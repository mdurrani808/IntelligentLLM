An additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm for the interaction of members of the Kazal family of protein inhibitors with six selected serine proteinases is described. Ten consensus variable contact positions in the inhibitor were identified, and the 19 possible variants at each of these positions were expressed.
The free energies of interaction of these variants and the wild type were measured. For an additive system, this data set allows for the calculation of all possible sequences, subject to some restrictions.
The strongest, the most specific possible, and the least specific inhibitors were designed, and an evolutionary problem was solved. 
The pioneers of protein chemistry (1, 2) demonstrated that for many proteins the sequence suffices to specify reactivity.

This demonstration was equivalent to showing that for such proteins sequence to reactivity algorithms (SRAs) must exist. 
However, the search for such SRAs was not highly productive and was largely stalled by looking for these SRAs in two steps:
sequence to folding and folding to reactivity.
In protein chemistry amino acid residue additivity was studied by various workers as soon as site-specific mutagenesis became tractable. Additivity was applied to various protein reactions, among them protein unfolding, proteinprotein and protein
ligand association, enzyme kinetics, and hydrolysis of internal peptide bonds in proteins (414).
The use of the additivity principle in biochemistry recently was reviewed (15). 
Here we report on a successful, 20-year-long (16) effort to determine an additivity-based SRA (Fig. 1) for predicting the equilibrium constants of some serine proteinases with members of the Kazal family (17, 18) of standard mechanism (17), canonical (19) protein inhibitors.
This family is named after L Kazal, discoverer of the first of the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitors, PSTI, that are present in all vertebrates. Among them are ovomucoids, abundant proteins in avian egg whites, which consist of three tandem Kazal domains (20).
Ovomucoids from closely related species of birds were shown to differ strikingly in their inhibitory specificity (21). 
Ovomucoid third domains from 153 species of birds were isolated and sequenced (2224), and their interactions with serine proteinases were studied.
The strongest association equilibrium constant, Ka, for a member of this set is 1.4 3 1012 M21;
the weakest measured is 7.1 3 102 M21. These results underscore the need for an algorithm because identifying a protein as an ovomucoid third domain does not predict that it will or will not be an effective inhibitor of a particular serine proteinase.

Aside from the large range of Ka values among closely related natural variants, additional strong reasons for choosing a standard mechanism, canonical inhibitor family, were the anticipated additivity of individual contact residue contributions (see below)
and the availability in our laboratory of techniques for measuring Ka values for enzyme-inhibitor pairs over the 103 M21 to 1013 M21 dynamic range with an accuracy of 620%. Bovine chymotrypsin Aa (CHYM) and subtilisin Carlsberg (CARL) were purchased from Worthington and Sigma, respectively, and human leukocyte elastase (HLE) was from Elastin Products, St. Louis.
Porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), freed from all chymotrypsin and trypsin activity, was a gift from the late M. Laskowski, Sr. (Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY). Streptomyces griseus proteinases A and B (SGPA and SGPB) were purified in this laboratory from pronase.
These were compared with standards given by D. A. Estell (Genencor International, Palo Alto, CA), L. Smillie (University of Alberta), and J. Travis (University of Georgia, Athens). Natural ovomucoid third domains were prepared and characterized as described (2224).
Natural ovomucoid first domains were obtained by CNBr cleavage of entire ovomucoid for OMHPA1 (from gray partridge, Perdix perdix)
and OMHMP1 (from Himalayan monal pheasant, Lophophorus imperianus), and by thermolysin hydrolysis for OMBWS1 (from black-winged stilt, Himantopus himantopus). The R44S variant of human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (HPSTI) and goose pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor are described in Table 3.

These were expressed in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with protein A domains. Their isolation, purification, and extensive characterization was described (25)
for the P1 variants.
The extensive modification of the procedure of Green and Work (26) is described (25). The conditions were 21 6 2C, pH 8.30, ionic strength 0.10 M. The measurement range was 103 M21 to 1013 M21, the accuracy 620%.
Among the natural third domains we sequenced most are effective inhibitors of some chymotrypsins, elastases, and subtilisins. They all have hydrophobic S1 pockets that range from small (PPE) to very large (CHYM).
All of them are strongly inhibited by OMTKY3 (28) as are many other enzymes. In addition, OMTKY3 very nearly represents the most probable sequence among the 153 species we examined (24).
X-ray crystallography of complexes of OMTKY3, of many of its variants, and of some PSTI variants with SGPB, CHYM and HLE showed that a consensus set of 12 contact positions in the inhibitors is in contact with the enzymes
(2934) (Fig. 2). When sequences of ovomucoid third domains from 153 species are compared, the seven most variable positions in the 51 residue domains all lie in the consensus contact residue set (24).
Analysis of Kas of most of these variants indicates that changes among the residues in the consensus contact set frequently cause very large changes in Ka. In sharp contrast, changes in noncontact residues often do not affect Ka values beyond experimental error.
Therefore, it appears that the 12 residue consensus set suffices to determine changes in Ka relative to OMTKY3. Most of the hypervariable contact residues are also highly exposed but two of the contact residues, P3 Cys-16 and P159 Asn-33, serve clear structural roles and show no (P3) or very little variation (P159)
from sequence to sequence.
This strong conservation at P3 and P159 persists in all of the 471 known sequences (see data at http:yywww.chem.purdue.eduyLASKOWSKI) of Kazal inhibitors. Therefore, we designated the remaining 10-residue set
(Figs. 1 and 2) as the variable consensus contact set.
The arrow points to the reactive site peptide bond between P1 and P19 residues (47). The 12 colored residues comprise the consensus contact residue set
(24, 2931).
Of these 12, the two in green are structural and accept very few mutations in evolution. 
Changing one of the white (noncontact) residues for another has little effect on DG, whereas changing one of the colored ones often has a very large effect.

Expression of Variants, Measurement of DG. Because additivity will be assumed, to have a general SRA we need to have the wild type
(OMTKY3) and 19 possible coded variants at each of the 10 variable contact positions.
The 191 3 6 5 1,146 equilibrium constants for the interaction of each variant with our six selected enzymes were measured. The remainder will be published separately and may be requested now from the corresponding author.
Again happily, all of the equilibrium constants fell into the 103 M21 to 1013 M21 dynamic range of measurements. In a set of seven eglin C variants at P1, the Leu-45 variant (wild type) interacts with SGPA and SGPB too strongly for direct measurement whereas the Asp-45 and Glu-45 variants interact with PPE too weakly
(35).
For each of the six selected enzymes, for variants at each of the 10 variable consensus contact positions, i, there are 19 association equilibrium constants Ka(X). These in turn were converted at each of the 10 variable consensus contact positions to DDG
(XTKY i X) 5 DG (X) 2 DG OMTKY3 values.
If a variant differs from OMTKY3 only by changes among the 51 2 12 5 39 noncontact positions, we state that its predicted DG is simply the value for OMTKY3. If a substitution is among the 10 variable consensus residues, we add to DGTKY the single DDG (XTKY i X) term.
For more changes in contact, we sum the DDG (XTKY i X) terms DG8predicted 5 DG8TKY 1 O i 5 1 i 5 10 DDG8~X TKY i X!. [1]
The simple additivity of the DDG (XTKY i X) is the major approximation involved in this work. There are some restrictions on the application of Eq. 1 to predict DG for the association of any Kazal domain with any of the six enzymes we selected.
Many Kazal family members are present in multidomain proteins, such as ovomucoid (20). Here we predict only for single Kazal domains, such as PSTI or for isolated domains of multidomain proteins such as turkey ovomucoid.
The decision not to vary the green residues in Fig. 2 (P3 Cys-16 and P159 Asn-33) requires that these must be present in all of the inhibitors we predict. A group of Kazal inhibitors, called nonclassical (36), have at P5 a disulfide-bridged Cys.
The SRA is based on an assumption that the variable consensus contact set of residues is additive. This additivity is equivalent to assuming that the interactions, if any, among the contact residues present in the free inhibitors do not change appreciably on formation of complexes with enzymes.

This assumption is not valid for the P2 Thr-17P19 Glu-19 residue pair (Fig. 2). The side chains of these two residues are hydrogenbonded to each other in the free inhibitor (37).
The hydrogen bond shortens on complex formation with SGPB (29) and CHYM (30) but not with HLE (31). The same shortening is seen when the structure of variant 3 of PSTI (38) (this variant has P2 Thr-17 and P19 Glu-19) is compared in free inhibitor and in complex with chymotrypsinogen (34).
We therefore restrict our predictions to the 39 P2P19 pairs we measured rather than to all possible 400 pairs. A simple wording of the restriction is that either P2 Thr or P19 Glu (or both) must be present.
The elimination of this restriction would widen the scope of SRA to more Kazal inhibitors, and in other protein systems there will be patches of nonadditivity in generally additive situations. For avian ovomucoid third domains where the P2 ThrP19 Glu is very common, the P2P19 restriction allows one to deal with substantial majority of the domains.
For Kazal inhibitors at large where this is not common, the current SRA encompasses a significant minority (about 30%) of sequenced domains. To use Eq. 1 to obtain DGpredicted, we need only the sequence of the Kazal domain of interest.
However, to test the SRA, we need to have the protein to obtain its DGmeasured for interaction with the enzymes. 
DG8I 5 DG8predicted 2 DG8measured. [2]
The subscript I on DGI was designed (7) to indicate interactions and therefore to be a measure of nonadditivity.
In our system, the nonadditivity component of this term is a measure of the change in interactions on complex formation. One arises from the changes in noncontact residues (white circles in Fig. 2), which are neglected in Eq. 1.
The other arises from errors in measurement of DG
values as DGmeasured (directly) and more importantly DGpredicted
(indirectly) involve such measurements. In our case, the choice was easy. We already had a set of DG values for the interaction of the six enzymes we study with 92 different, natural ovomucoid third domains.
These domains were gathered to serve as a primary data source for the construction of the SRA (4, 39). As we became facile with the production of recombinant OMTKY3 variants in the 1990s (25), the acquisition of natural variants ceased.
The SRA described above is based solely on the data on 190 single variants of OMTKY3 in the contact region
(Fig. 2) and on the OMTKY3 itself. The raw test set contains somewhat less (443) than 92 3 6 5 552 DG values as limitations in the amounts of available material did not allow for the determination of some binding constants for weak interactions.
The 443 DG values were sieved for sequences that meet the current SRA restrictions and 398 remained. Predictions were made for all of them (Eq. 1) and the DGI values (Eq. 2) were calculated.
Surprisingly, this value is significantly smaller than the 900 calymol for the set of 17 P1 variants of OMTKY3 interacting with SGPB (40) based on the Table 1.

From the fits obtained and the reproducibility of the about 3,000 DG values determined in our laboratory, we conclude that the average standard deviation, s, is DG 6 100 calymol.
At both the upper Ka 5 1013 M21 and lower Ka 5 103 M21, s is much greater. s is significantly smaller for OMTKY3, which was measured very frequently and served as a control in various experiments. However, in view of the difficulties in estimating individual s values, we consider only a constant one.
For DGmeasured, it is s. For DGpredicted, the error depends on k, the number of variable consensus contact residues in OMTKY3 that are replaced by others in the predicted variant. 
Eq. 2 can be rewritten as:
DG8I 5 O i 5 1 i 5 k DG8~Xi! 2 ~k 2 1!DG8TKY 2 DG8measured [3]
because each DDG (XTKY i X) term is the difference between DG (Xi) and DGTKY.

(Xi) terms and the DGmeasured terms are independent variables. For the entire system DG8I experimental 5 6 2sk2 2 k 1 2 5 6 200calymolk2 2 k 1 2
[4]
We divided the entire 398-member DG measured set on the basis of the number of contact region substitutions.
Cases where DGI is within the limits of Eq. 4 are called additive, outside the limits but within twice the limits partially additive, and outside that nonadditive (Table 1). Obviously larger absolute errors were allowed at k 5 6 than for k 5 0 (changes not in contact).

However, after that correction is made, small deviations from additivity will not show at all at k 5 0 and 1 as there is no additivity there. Such corrections are expected to be much smaller for k 5 2 where there is only one potential pairwise nonadditivity than at k 5 6 where there are many pairwise, triple, quadruple, pentuple, and one hexuple potential nonadditivities.

The 398 DGmeasured set also was divided according to the enzyme (Table 2). Clearly, CARL is the worst. It is the only member of the subtilin family of enzymes in our set. Also there is no three-dimensional structure of OMTKY3 or any Kazal inhibitor in complex with CARL, even though there are many structures of CARL in complex with other standard mechanism
(17), canonical (19) protein inhibitors.
We are unable to account for its difference from SGPB but we use SGPA for calculation of the distribution of DG values for all possible contact region sequences. 
The test above was made on avian ovomucoid third domains that are similar to OMTKY3.

It will be more interesting to make a comparably large test with other members of the Kazal family. Table 3 summarizes what we obtained after sieving this set for our restrictions, which in this case were more bothersome than for avian ovomucoid third domain.
The two top sequences are for PSTIs, the bottom three for avian ovomucoid first domains. It should be noted that domains in many multidomain Kazal inhibitors could be readily divided into a type and b type domains (41).
Ovomucoid first and second domains are a type whereas the third domains are b type. Therefore, ovomucoid first and third domains while homologous are very different proteins.

For HPSTI and OMHMP1 k 5 8; for the three other comparisons k 5 9, the largest number allowed by our sieve. Of the 17 cases where comparisons could be made, 15 are additive, one is partially additive and one is nonadditive, a somewhat similar distribution as in ovomucoid third domains.

number of tests, we conclude that SRA holds for all Kazal inhibitors provided that the restrictions are met.

Why do Kazal inhibitors work so well in the SRA? (i) The association is nearly lock and key rather than induced fit. (ii) The putative P1 residue always inserts into the S1 cavity of the enzyme, however deleterious this is to local binding.
(iii) Compared with other protein reactions the DDG terms observed here are very large. (iv) In contrast to antigenantibody interactions the main chainmain chain contributes importantly to the interaction energy (42). (v) In contrast to nucleasenuclease protein inhibitor system, the side-chain interactions are largely hydrophobic and not electrostatic (10). (vi) The inhibitor is globally convex and local interactions are mainly of the inhibitors side chains inserting into the enzymes pockets.
(vii) A method of measuring Kas accurately and over a wide dynamic range is available. Many of us think that it is the last of these that is most important for success.

It seems highly likely that the SRAs can be developed for several other families of standard mechanism canonical protein inhibitors of serine proteinases. However, what is most intriguing is whether additivity-based SRAs can be developed for some other protein
ligand and proteinprotein interactions.
Aside from the SRA data that are already available, it requires only the sequence of the variable consensus contact set. Therefore, the value of DG can be predicted for proteins whose sequences are known only from DNA sequencing and that were never isolated or expressed.
Predictions also can be made for postulated nodal sequences in phylogenetic trees or for sequences constructed to meet some design objectives (see example below). Because the additivity-based SRA is so very fast many potential designs can be screened before settling on the ones we want to express.
But most surprisingly we can calculate DG values for all possible sequences of Kazal inhibitors interacting with a stated enzyme. 
Subject to our restrictions (see above) there are 39 3 208 > 1012 possible sequences that affect the value of DG.
There was not enough memory to store them all but their distribution could be compiled and is given in Fig. 3. There is a largest (weakest possible inhibitor) DG value on the left side (not shown) and smallest (strongest possible inhibitor)
shown on the right side.
This value could have been obtained from the calculation but additivity provides an even simpler way (39). A sequence composed of best residues at each of the 10 positions is the best possible sequence.
Additivity allows for simple calculation of the weakest possible Ka (largest DG) but this is not likely to be useful. Additivity also allows for the calculation of the average DG (25.13 kcalymol for SGPA).

The designs in Table 4 are not only very strong but generally rather specific for only one of the six enzymes. The strongest inhibitor for SGPB is less than 10-fold stronger for SGPB than SGPA.
Defense against parasites is a postulated function of many proteinase inhibitors. 
As there are very many possible parasites, least specific inhibitors may well be natures goal.

It is of interest to compare the distribution of all possible variants to that of a large set of natural variants. The predicted values (predicted because the lowest values on the left are too weak to measure) for all species of birds, whose ovomucoid third domains were sequenced and comply with our restrictions
(140y153) are shown in red (Fig. 3).
It is seen that the variance of this distribution is narrower than that of all possible values and that they are much stronger than the average of all possible Kazal inhibitors. Nature appears to evolve very strong but not strongest possible inhibitors.

1414 u www.pnas.org Lu et al The comparison of the distributions allows us to answer an interesting question in evolution.
The variable consensus residue sets of Kazal inhibitors are hypervariable, and yet the residues in this set exert very large effects on DG values. According to the widely accepted neutral mutation theory (43), the structural and functional residues in proteins are conserved.
It is the surface residues that are not functionally important that rapidly fix mutations. If inhibition of serine proteinases were not the function of ovomucoids, there would be no paradox (44).
But the superposition of the two distributions clearly implies that the residues in the consensus contact set are selected for strong inhibition and one of the functions of ovomucoids is the inhibition of serine proteinases. 
Having the complete distribution of reactivity parameters for all possible variants of a protein was highly useful.
We anticipate that the readers will come up with many better uses of such data and that such uses will drive others to attempt to develop additivity-based SRAs for the systems they study.
