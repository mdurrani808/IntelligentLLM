4420 Biochemistry 1983, 22, 4420-4433 Structure of the Complex of Streptomyces griseus Protease B and the Third Domain of the Turkey Ovomucoid Inhibitor at  1.8-A Resolution+ Randy J. Read, Masao Fujinaga, Anita R. Sielecki, and Michael N .  G. James* ABSTRACT: The structure of the complex between the serine protease Streptomyces griseus protease B (SGPB) and the third domain of the Kazal-type ovomucoid inhibitor from turkey has been solved at 1.8-A resolution and refined to a conventional R factor of 0.125.
As others have reported previously for analogous complexes of proteases and protein inhibitors, the inhibitor binds in a fashion similar to that of a substrate; it is not cleaved, but there is a close approach (2.7 A) of the active site nucleophile Ser-195 0' to the carbonyl R o t e i n  inhibitors of serine proteases are well studied and much is known about the interactions between an inhibitor and its cognate enzyme (Laskowski & Kato, 1980). Most of these inhibitors act by a common mechanism; they bind very tightly to the enzyme (low K,) but are hydrolyzed very slowly, if at all (low kcat).
The inhibitors have at least one peptide bond called the reactive site. This is the bond that interacts with the enzyme's catalytic site and is the one that is cleaved if and when hydrolysis occurs. There are several families of homologous serine protease inhibitors; ovomucoid inhibitors belong to the pancreatic se- cretory trypsin inhibitor (Kazal) family (Laskowski & Kato, 1980).
The structure of the third domain of the ovomucoid inhibitor of Japanese quail (OMJPQ3) has been reported at 2.8-A resolution (Weber et al., 1981) and has subsequently been refined at 1.8-A resolution (Papamokos et al., 1982). The homologous third domain of the ovomucoid inhibitor of turkey (OMTKY3), used in our study, differs from OMJPQ3 only at five residues (Figure 1).
Our numbering origin for OMTKY3 corresponds to residue 131 of the complete ovo- mucoid inhibitor. An I follows the sequence numbers of the residues of the inhibitor in order to distinguish them from those of the enzyme.

Streptomyces griseus protease B (SGPB) is a serine protease obtained from the extracellular culture filtrate, Pronase. Its structure has been described at 2.8-A resolution (Delbaere et al., 1975) and is now refined at 1.7-A resolution (L. Sawyer, A. R. Sielecki, and M. N. G. James, unpublished results).
The three-dimensional structure has been compared with those of other serine proteases and shows a high degree of topological equivalence (James et al., 1978). Kinetic studies have also been carried out to determine the specificity of its binding sites (Bauer, 1978; James et al., 1980a).
The numbering of the SGPB molecule is given in Table I and follows an alignment with chymotrypsinogen (James et al., 1978).

Contrary to the structural reports regarding the other enzyme-inhibitor complexes, we conclude that there is no evidence for a sig- nificant distortion of this peptide bond from planarity. The mechanism of inhibition can be understood in terms of the equilibrium thermodynamic parameters K,, the enzyme-in- hibitor association constant, and Khydr the equilibrium constant for inhibitor hydrolysis.
These thermodynamic parameters can be rationalized in terms of the observed structure. Most of the work has been done with the pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (PTI).
The complexes of this inhibitor with trypsin (Huber et al., 1974), anhydrotrypsin (Huber et al., 1975), and trypsinogen, as well as the ternary complex with trypsinogen and Ile-Val (Bode et al., 1978), have been refined at high resolution. Recently, the structure of the complex between trypsinogen and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) has also been refined at high resolution (Bolognesi et al., 1982).
In addition, the structure of Strep- tomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) with subtilisin BPN' (Hirono et al., 1979) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) with porcine trypsin (Sweet et al., 1974) have been reported, but these structures are not refined yet and are not suitable for detailed analysis. 
Both the 2.6-A resolution structure of STI-trypsin (Sweet et al., 1974) and the initial 2.8-A resolution structure of PTI-trypsin (Ruhlmann et al., 1973) had indicated that a covalent tetrahedral adduct is formed between the enzyme and the inhibitor.
It was concluded that this tetrahedral adduct is isolated because the enzyme functions by stabilizing the transition state (Sweet et al., 1974; Pauling, 1946). However, upon refinement, PTI and trypsin were seen to form a non- covalent complex with a pyramidally distorted carbonyl carbon at the reactive site.
The refined structure of OMTKY3-SGPB also indicates that there is a short noncovalent interaction between the two molecules, but the reactive site peptide bond is not significantly distorted from planarity. 
A brief report on the refinement of the OMTKY3-SGPB complex has been given elsewhere (Fujinaga et al., 1982).
We present here a detailed description and discussion of our results. 
Experimental Procedures Intensity Data Collection.
The experimental details are summarized in Tables I1 and 111. The 1.8-A resolution data set consisted of a total of 20 227 reflections, of which 18 082 were unique.
Of these reflections, 13 937 satisfied the condition Z 2 2u,. The program ORESTES (Thiessen & Levy, 1973) was used to obtain the absolute scale of 7.1 and the mean isotropic temperature factor (B)  of 13.1 A*. This program was also used to calculate the normalized structure factor amplitudes (IEI) used in the structure determination.

The phase problem for the structure of OMTKY 3-SGPB was solved by using the tech- nique of molecular replacement.

The arrow indicates the reactive site, native SGPB structure (Delbaere et ai., 1975). which, at the time of this work, had been refined to an R factor! of 0.177 at 1.7-A resolution. 
The rotational parameters were determined from the fast rotation function (Crowther, 1973) by using normalized structure factors (IEI) calculated for the model of SGPB in an orthogonal cell of symmetry P1, with a unit-cell edge of 60 A. For a maximum radius of integration of 21 A, this cell axis length should be sufficient to minimize the contribution of intermolecular vectors for the model molecule SGPB, which has a maximum diameter of about 40 A. The rotation function was calculated on a So grid for an asymmetric unit of rotation function space (Rao et al., 1980).

The radius of integration was from 3 to 21 A, and data from ' R = XIIFJ - IFJ/XIF& where 1F.I and 1F.I are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respcctively.

A finer scan with intervals of 1' in the Euler angle p was calculated in the region of the highest peak. The section containing the correct peak (1 1.4 standard deviations above the mean) is shown in Figure 2.
The appropriately rotated SGPB coordinates became the search model for the determination of the translational parameters. 
An R factor search was used to solve the translation prob- lem.
Since P21 has a polar y axis, the search was carried out in the xz plane only. Intensity data in the 5-4-A resolution range were used to calculate R factors as the search model was translated in 1-A increments over an area from (0,O) to (a/2,c/2).
A contour map of this array of R factors is shown in Figure 3. The minimum R factor obtained was 0.35, 8 standard deviations lower than the average of 0.44.
An additional search on a 0.25-A grid located the minimum more accurately. 
The R factor for the rotated and translated SGPB molecule was 0.39 for the data to 2.8-A resolution.
This model was used to obtain calculated structure factor amplitudes and phases for the computation of PI: and F, maps. These are electron density maps with coefficients lFol - lFcl and IFol, respectively, and calculated phases, Q ~ .
 The MMS-X interactive graphics system (Barry et al., 1976) with the macromolecular modeling system, M3, de- veloped by C. Broughton (Sielecki et al., 1982), was used for map interpretation and model fitting. The model fitting consisted of taking short segments of about five residues of the known OMTKY3 sequence and fitting them to the electron density.

The N-terminal region of the inhibitor showed very little electron density, and the first six residues from Leu-11 to Val-61 were never located even after refinement at 1.8-A resolution. The possibility of proteolytic removal of these residues is eliminated since the amino acid analysis of the complex shows the composition expected for an intact molecule (M. Laskowski, Jr., personal communication).
The refinement of the structure was started with 50 out of the 56 residues of the inhibitor and the rotated and translated structure of the refined native SGPB molecule. 
The initial R factor for this model was 0.31 for the data in the 8.0-2.8-A resolution shell.
We used the restrained least-squares refinement program (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980), which was modified by Furey (Furey et al., 1982) and one of us (M.F.) for the FPS 190L array processor. 
At various stages during the refinement, electron density maps with coefficients 2(F01 - lFcl and lFol - IFcl, with calcu- lated phases, were produced.
The maps were superimposed on the model and displayed on the graphics system, and corrections to the model were made where necessary. At later stages of refinement, difference maps were also used to locate possible solvent atom positions.

In the initial cycles, weight = 1/uF2, where uF= (1/2)(hF), was used. At later stages, this was replaced by uF = C1 + C2[(sin O)/X - 1/61, to give higher weights to higher resolution data.

For the last cycle, the values of C1 and C2 were 10.0 and -55.0, respectively. Table IV lists the parameters and results of the last cycle.

After 58 cycles of refinement, the R factor has dropped to 0.125 for the data from 6.0- to 1.8-A resolution. The R factor becomes 0.145 for the 16 245 structure factors in the range 10.0-1.8-A resolution with I 1  u1/2.
The model has a total of 1855 atoms, all with individual temperature factors. The occupancies of the 165 solvent molecules included were also refined.
All solvent sites were interpreted as water molecules and refined as neutral oxygen atoms. The refined parameters of the OMTKY3-SGPB complex have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977).
At present, there is no accurate way of determining the errors in the atomic coordinates of a molecule refined by a restrained least-squares procedure. We looked at various ways of estimating coordinate errors.

The method of Luzzati (1952) gives an estimate of 0.13 A for the overall mean error, (IArl), from the variation of the R factor with resolution. This value corresponds to a root mean square (rms) error of 0.14 A for a normal distribution of Ar [(lArl)rms = ( 3 ~ / 8 ) ~ / ~ ( l A r l ) ] .
 It should be noted, however, that this method is not strictly applicable in our case since, among other reasons, we have weighted the structure factors as a function of sin 0 in the refinement of the structure. 
In any event, an overall value is not very useful since there will be regions in the molecule with errors greatly exceeding this value.

The errors in the individual atomic positions may be esti- mated from the formula given by Cruickshank (1949, 1954, 1967). For a monoclinic space group, uxj  = uyi = uzj, and cy j  is given by S T R U C T U R E  O F  P R O T E A S E - O V O M U C O I D  INHIBITOR C O M P L E X  V O L .

The plot begins at 71 because the first six residues were not located. 
where b is the axial length, foi is the atomic scattering factor, and m = 2 or 1, depending on whether the reflection is centric or noncentric, respectively.
Formula 1 gives the standard deviation as a function of atom type and individual temperature factor. In its derivation, well-resolved spherically symmetric atoms were assumed.

The Cruickshank formula leads to an rms error of 0.14 A for all atoms in the OMTKY3-SGPB structure. 
Alternatively, the errors in the individual atomic positions may be estimated by comparing the refined structure with that refined without structural restraints (Chambers 8i Stroud, 1979).
The refined structure was used as the starting model in seven cycles of unrestrained refinement. This refinement converged with an R factor of 0.103.
The rms difference between the coordinates of the restrained and unrestrained structure is 0.14 A for all atoms; Figure 4 shows these rms differences for different atom types plotted against the tem- perature factor B, as well as the errors predicted by the Cruickshank formula. These plots show fairly good agreement between the two methods.
Despite the fact that the assump- tions used in deriving the Cruickshank formula are not com- pletely satisfied, our results indicate that reasonable estimates of errors can be obtained by the method. 
Contrary to our results, Chambers & Stroud (1979) con- cluded that the Cruickshank formula underestimated the error in their structure.
They interpreted the formula as estimating the rms shift during a single cycle of difference Fourier re- finement. Thus, for a structure that is still far from conver- gence, the formula underestimates the errors.
The agreement that we obtain could indicate that our structure is closer to convergence. The similarity of the results from the three different methods of error estimation gives us some confidence in them.
The Cruickshank formula (see Figure 4) is the most useful for estimating the errors of different parts of the molecule as a function of B. The variation of the mean iso- tropic temperature factor along the polypeptide chain is shown in Figure 5 .  Overall Description. Figure 6 shows the a-carbon repre- sentation of the OMTKY3-SGPB complex (see paragraph at end of paper regarding supplementary material).
The structure of SGPB in the complex closely resembles that of the native molecule. The similarities in the three-dimensional structure of the native SGPB molecule with the bacterial serine proteases S. griseus protease A (SGPA) and a-lytic protease, as well as with the pancreatic enzymes chymotrypsin and elastase, have been shown before (Delbaere et al., 1975; James et al., 1978).

The structure of OMTKY3 in the complex is shown in Figure 7, and a listing of the hydrogen-bonding distances in the inhibitor is given in Table V. The folding of OMTKY3 (Fujinaga et al., 1982) is like that of the homologous protein of the Japanese quail, OMJPQ3 (Weber et al., 1981). The similarity of the two proteins is expected since their sequences differ in only five positions.

The regions of the active site of SGPB and the reactive site of OMTKY3 are shown, superimposed on the 21F01 - lFcl map, R E A D  ET A L .  FIGURE 6:  An ocarbon representation of the molecular complex ktwmn SGPB (open bonds) and OMTKY3 (filled bonds).

FIGURE 7: Structure of OMTKY3 molecule in the complex. The main chain is indicated in thick lines, and the hydrogen bonds are shown in dashed lines.
The following criteria were used to determine hydrogen bonds. If the position of the hydrogen atom could be deduced from sterwchemistry, then it was required that the distance from the donor atom to the acceptor atom be less than 3.4 A, the distance from the acceptor to the hydrogen atom be less than 2.4 A, and the angle at the hydrogen be greater than 1 3 5 O .
 If the hydrogen atom position was ambiguous. then it was placed in the closest possible position to the acceptor atom, and the same criteria were applied. The three terminal atoms of the Arg-211 side chain have B factors of about 50 A, and no associated density can be seen at the contour level used in the figure.
As mentioned before, the N-terminal region of the inhibitor is disordered, and Figure 8C shows that there is very little electron density in this area. The extent of disorder can also be appreciated from the very high B factors of these residues (Figure 5) .
The small contact area between the inhibitor and the enzyme can be seen in Figure 6. A close-up view of the active site region is shown in Figure 9, and a summary of the 108 intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts less than 4.0 A is given in Table VI.

Studies of small peptide substrates with SGPB (Bauer, 1978) and of many proteastinhibitor pairs (Laskowski & Kato, 1980) have shown that the amino acid occupying the primary specificity pocket is the most important to binding. 
The optimal PI residues for substrates of SGPB are phenyl- alanine, tyrosine, and, to a lesser extent, leucine (Bauer, 1978).

The relative importance of Leu-181 in the P, position of OMTKY3 is indicated by the 29 contacts that it makes to the active site of the enzyme (Table VI). 
In addition, Thr-I71 and Tyr-201 at positions Pz and Pz, respectively, make substantial contributions to the binding.

The relatively small number of contacts made by Glu-191 at position P, is due, in part, to its unusual side-chain confor- mation ( X I  = 61.  in contrast with the most highly The nomenclature introduced by khechtcr & Bcrger (1967) is used to facilitate discussion about the interactions between a protease and bound peptides.

The side-chain carboxyl group of Glu- 191 forms a hydrogen bond to the main-chain N H  (Figure 9). Since the SI' site on the enzyme binds hydrophobic residues (Bauer, 1978), the glutamate side chain is not likely to interact with it.

The binding interactions in OMTKY3-SGPB are similar to those in FTI-trypsin (Huber et al., 1974), as well as to those in tetrapeptide complexes with the homologous bacterial serine protease SGPA (James et al., 1980b). The hydrogen bonds involved in binding OMTKY3 to SGPB are listed in Table VII, and their lengths are compared with the corresponding distances in the structures of the other complexes.
Peptides I and I1 are hydrolysis products, Ac-Pro-Ala-Pro-Phe-OH and Ac-Pro-Ala-Pro-Tyr-OH, respectively, bound noncovalently to SGPA. Peptide IV is an aldehyde, Ac-Pro-Ala-Pro-Phe-H, bound covalently to SGPA through a hemiacetal linkage to Ser-195.
This latter structure is taken as an analogue of the tetrahedral intermediate. Figure 10 shows the superposition of the active site regions of the various complexes.

The P3 residue, Cys-161, makes two hydrogen bonds in an antiparallel fashion to Gly-216, as in the complexes of SGPA. 
In PTI, the P3 residue is proline; therefore, only one hydrogen bond can be made (Table VII).
Antiparallel hydrogen bonds are observed also between the P i  Tyr-201 and Arg-41 in SGPB. In trypsin, the conformation of the polypeptide chain at the homologous Phe-41 precludes the formation of a hy- drogen bond to the amide nitrogen of the P i  residue in PTI.

The carbonyl oxygen of the PI residue, Leu- 181, is located in the oxyanion hole (Robertus et al., 1972) and accepts one strong hydrogen bond from Gly-193 N and a weaker one from Ser-195 N.

FIGURE 8: Elatron density map  of different regions in the complex.
The maps were calculated with mefficients 21F.I - IFJ and calculated phases. The side chain of Arg-211 is highly mobile and is associated with low density at its terminus.
This region of the molecule is highly disordered and has little associated density aldehyde structure. The two long hydrogen bonds in this complex can be attributed to the protonation of the aldehyde carbonyl oxygen and the formation of a covalent bond to SGPA (James et al., 1980b).

The interaction between the amide NH of the PI residue and Ser-214 0 is too long and too poorly oriented to be wn- sidered a hydrogen bond in OMTKY3-SGPB and TI-trypsin (Table VII). It has been suggested that the tetrahedral in- termediate is stabilized in part by the formation of a good hydrogen bond in this position (Robertus et al., 1972).
Hy- drogen bonds are formed to Ser-214 0 in the tetrapeptide complexes with SGPA. This interaction is strongest in the aldehyde structure, as shown by the short distance of 2.8 A. Previous model-building experiments ( Jams  et al., 1980b) had indicated that this hydrogen bond to Ser-214 0 had to be relaxed in order to accommodate a PI residue.
The distance between Ser-195 0 and Leu-181 C, the carbonyl carbon at the reactive site, is 2.7 A, too long to be a covalent bonding distance and too short for a favorable van der Waals interaction.

A pyramidal distortion of the carbonyl group of the reactive site has been reported in the structures of complexes of the various forms of trypsin with PTI (Huber & Bode, 1978). 
Such a distortion is not observed in the OMTKY3-SGPB complex.
The discrepancy between our result and those for the various complexes of PTI may be due to the differences in the refinement procedures. In the refinement of the PTI structures, an extra parameter, O4 at the reactive site, was added.
This parameter is the out-of-plane bend angle that the carbonyl oxygen atom makes with the plane defined by the Cu, C, and N atoms. The extra flexibility given to this group may be the cause of the distortion.
In our refinement, we have not treated any group in a special way; however, the stereo- chemical restraints may force the structure to adopt an ideal conformation. 
Two experiments were done to determine whether the geometrical restraints applied during refinement were pre- venting any real deviations from ideality from being observed.

First, planar restraints on the atoms of the inhibitor were relaxed during several cycles of refinement. The resulting mean e4 of the main-chain peptide groups in the inhibitor was -lo, with a standard deviation of 8'.
The maximum deviation from 0' was at Ser-441 with a O4 of 23'. The value for Leu-181 at the reactive site was -loo, as compared with -5' obtained in the restrained refinement.

The second approach was to determine whether real devi- ations from ideality could be observed under the conditions of restrained refinement. To do this, we modified our refined structure so that e4 at Leu-181 was -40, similar to the value of -35' reported for this angle in PTI (Huber & Bode, 1978).

These modified coordinates were used to calculate structure factors that were then used as "observedn structure factors for refinement. The starting model was the unmodified structure with O4 at Leu-181 of -5'.
After six cycles of refinement, the mean @was 0' with a standard deviation of 2'; the value at Leu-181 was -14'. When this experiment was repeated with relaxed planar restraints, the mean O4 remained 0' with a standard deviation of 5', and the value at Leu-181 became -28'. Thus, even though the refinement procedure damps actual deviations from ideality, the presence of the deviation is still apparent.
It should be noted that in this experiment we have an ideal case with error-free data and a nearly perfect model. In a normal refinement, one has the added complication of errors in the data.

In addition to the above arguments, it is possible to calculate the uncertainty in O4 due to coordinate errors. With a con- servative value of 0.1 8, and the assumption of independent atoms, the estimated standard deviation in O4 is 8', at O4 = 0'.
Thus, within the accuracy of our coordinates, the carbonyl carbon of Leu-181 has a planar configuration. This planarity is not imposed by the stereochemical restraints used in re- finement, and it should be possible to observe a large distortion.
The crystal of native SGPB and the present crystal of its complex with OMTKY3 differ in crystallization conditions, in packing interactions, and in the presence or absence of the inhibitor molecule, all of which are expected to affect the conformation to some degree. 
A comparison of the two structures can indicate the nature and extent of these effects.

The level at which two structures can be compared depends on their accuracy. Both structures of SGPB are well-refined, high-resolution structures with estimated rms coordinate errors of 0.1-0.2 A, so that comparisons can be quite detailed.
The native SGPB structure has been refined at 1.7-A resolution to an R factor of 0.149 (L. Sawyer, A. R. Sielecki, and M. N. G. James, unpublished results). 
When the two SGPB structures are compared by at least- squares superposition of all 1310 atoms (program of W. Bennett), the rms deviation in atomic positions is 0.58 8, (for the 741 main-chain atoms, the rms deviation is 0.52 A; for the 569 side-chain atoms, it is 0.66 A).
The relative orientation derived from this superposition has been used in a detailed structural comparison. In order to study the effect of crystal-packing contacts on structure, we have applied the symmetry operations for each crystal to the appropriately oriented SGPB molecule from the other crystal.
In this way, contacts that are present can be compared with those that would exist if the conformation were that of SGPB in the other crystal. 
When such comparisons are made, one can see that dif- ferences in crystal-packing environment are often accompanied by changes in van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interac- tions.
It is generally evident that changes are necessary to avoid unfavorable contacts, but it is sometimes difficult to ascribe cause and effect. 
Some of the largest conformational differences observed involve the C-terminal residues of SGPB.
In the crystal of the native enzyme there is an intermolecular contact between the segment Gly-172-Gly-173 and the C-terminal residues Val-241 and Tyr-242 (Figure 11). In the crystal of the complex, both segments are essentially exposed to solvent, although Tyr-171 is in contact with the bound inhibitor (Table VI). If SGPB with the conformation observed in the complex were placed in the crystal of the native enzyme, unfavorable van der Waals contacts would exist (Figure 11).
The con- formation in the native structure avoids these unfavorable interactions and, in addition, allows Val-241 0 to form hy- V O L . 1 9 ,  1 9 8 3  4429 S T R U C T U R E  O F  P R O T E A S E - O V O M U C O I D  INHIBITOR C O M P L E X  FIGURE I I: Intennolmlar contact interface in the packing of crystals of native SGPB.

Had the C-terminal residues Val-241 and Tyr-242 retained their orientation observed in the crystals of the complex, unacceptably short nonbonded contacts with Gly-172' and Gly-173' would occur (Table Vlll).

drogen bonds both to Gly-173 N and to a water molecule involved in the solvent structure of the interface (Table VIII). 
The small shift of Gly-172 and Gly-173 toward the contacting protein molecule might be attributed to the inhibitor binding interaction at Tyr-171 (see below).
It is not clear why the C terminus, instead of the diglycyl @-bend, adjusts to avoid the potential bad contacts. 
The shift of the C-terminal residues propagates by intra- molecular contacts to the segment from Lys-115 to Ala-127 (Figure 12).
Without concerted shifts of Lys-115 and, es- pecially, Gly-117, prohibitively close contacts would result (Table IX). These shifts lead to a reorganization of the whole segment, even those residues relatively far from the C terminus.

In fact, the largest main-chain difference between the two SGPB structures (2.8 A for Gly-120 C) occurs in the @-bend from Val-119 to Gln-122. As can be seen in Figure 12, as well as from the data in Table X, the pattern of hydrogen bonding involving the residues Lys-115 to Ala-I27 is also somewhat altered.
One of these hydrogen bonds, that from the carboxyl group of Tyr-242 to Gly-I17 0 in native SGPB, is perhaps a contributing factor in the reorganization. The existence of this hydrogen bond implies that the carboxy terminus is prcr tonated, which is possible for the native SGPB structure, Table IX: Contacts Leading to Propagation of Shifts from the C Terminus to the Segment Lys-115 to Ala-127 in the Native Structure obsd potential distance distance shift of atom 1 atom 2 (A) (A)a atom 2 Tyr-242 C Gly-117 ca 3.7 2.9 1.0 Ty~242 C Gly-117 c 3.9 3.1 0.8 Tyr-242 C Gly-117 0 3.3 2.9 0.5 Tyr-242 0 Gly-117coL 3.2 2.6 1.0 Tyr-242 0 Gly-117C 3.3 2.7 0.8 Tyr-242 0 Gly-117 0 2.6 2.1 0.5 Tyr-242 C'r Asp-116 C 4.5 3.5 0.8 Tyr-242 Cf* Gly-117ca 3.7 3.1 1.0 Tyr-242 Gly-117 COL 3.6 2.8 1.0 Tyr-242 & LYS-115 0 3.5 2.9 0.7 Tyr-242 Cez LYS.115 0 3.3 2.8 0.7 Tyr-242 C'r Gly-117 N 3.8 3.0 0.9 Tyr-242 0'1 Lys-115 c 3.7 3.1 0.6 superimposed structure of SGPB in the complex.

For SGPB, there does not seem to be much and Ser-195, are important in the hydrolytic mechanism. As propagation of the conformational changes from the surface discussed above, Ser-195 Ov is only 2.7 A away from Leu-I81 residues to the more internal residues of the structural core.

 It has been proposed that the formation of this hydrogen bond is important in activating 0 7  as a nucleophile and in allowing the transfer of the proton from Ser-195 via His-57 to the leavinggroup amide during hy- drolysis (Huber & Bode, 1978). 
In the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB, the conformational changes are mostly small, though significant.
This observation favors the lock and key model of enzyme-substrate interaction (Fischer, 1894). On the other hand, the small conformational changes in the catalytic residues could have quite profound effects on the mechanism of hydrolysis.
Protein inhibitors of serine proteases have a common inhibitory mechanism (Laskowski & Kato, 1980). The inhibitor binds to the active site of the cognate enzyme in the manner of a good substrate, but very tightly, so that very little of the enzyme remains free.
The observed structure of the complex of SGPB and OMTKY3 supports this general proposal for a mechanism. Figure 10a shows that the binding of the inhibitor to SGPB is very similar to that of a tetrapeptide product (virtual substrate) to the homologous enzyme SGPA.

Only free enzyme can catalyze peptide hydrolysis, and the inhibitor reduces the concentration of free enzyme by forming a stable complex with it. In outline, the reaction between enzyme and inhibitor can be represented as E + I + E.1 + E + I* where I is the virgin inhibitor, and I* is the cleaved, or modified, inhibitor.
E.1 is the form of the enzyme-inhibitor complex that has the lowest free energy. In this scheme, the various catalytic intermediates along the path of peptide hy- drolysis (Kraut, 1977), as well as the loose, noncovalent complexes that are predicted from kinetic data (Luthy et al., 1973), have been omitted.
Individual rate constants derived according to such a scheme would thus be suspect, but equilibria are still valid. The amount of complex E.1 that is present at equilibrium is governed by (Finkenstadt et al., 1974).
For SGPB and OMTKY3, Ka,, is 6 X 1OIo M-' (W. Ardelt and M. Laskowski, Jr., personal communication). The overall equilibrium for the hydrolysis of inhibitor is given by Khyd = [I*l/[Il (3) Finally, the equilibrium constant for the association of virgin inhibitor with enzyme can be denoted as Table XI: Intermolecular Contacts between SGPB and OMTKY3 .

From eq 2-4, we can derive (4) (5) The function of the inhibitor is to maximize K,,,, thus min- imizing [E], the concentration of free enzyme.
With the insight provided by eq 5, this problem can be broken down into two parts: (1) maximizing K, and (2) minimizing Khyd. The first part involves the specific interactions between the enzyme and its inhibitor, while the second is a function only of the inhibitor structure.

The question of maximizing K, can be examined by con- sidering how the differences between the inhibitor and a small peptide substrate lead to tighter binding of the inhibitor. The most obvious proposal would be that the inhibitor makes a larger number of favorable contacts with the enzyme.
How- ever, almost all (100 out of 108) of the intermolecular contacts less than 4 A (Table VI) are made by residues P6 through P3, i.e., relatively close to the scissile bond. Therefore, most of the interactions with SGPB that are made by OMTKY3 would also be available to a small peptide substrate.
For example, there are 78 nonbonded contacts less than 4 A between SGPA and the tetrapeptide product Ac-Pro-Ala-Pro-Tyr-OH (James et al., 1980b). Thus, the intrinsic binding energy (Jencks, 1975) of the inhibitor, the sum of the favorable free-energy terms, is expected to be similar to that of a good substrate.

Normally, however, a significant portion of the intrinsic binding energy would be used to reduce the entropy of the substrate, locking it into its reactive conformation (Jencks, 1975). But, the inhibitor is conformationally much less mobile, so that much more of the intrinsic binding energy is realized as observed binding energy.
This concept has generally been expressed in terms of a rigid enzyme meeting a rigid, and complementary, substrate (Blow, 1974). It is important to note that this is not an absolute inflexibility but a relative one, when compared to good substrates such as small peptides or floppy external loops of globular proteins.
Indeed, in the native structure of the closely related OMJPQ3, the reactive site region shows considerable flexibility, as indicated by the thermal motion parameters (Weber et al., 1981; Papamokos et al., 1982). 
Khyd for inhibitors is generally close to unity near neutral pH (Finkenstadt et al., 1974; Laskowski & Kato, 1980).
It can be seen from eq 5 that the value of K,,, would not, in fact, be increased much by decreasing Khyd below this value. 
The region of the reactive site in inhibitors must have con- siderably less freedom to relax after hydrolysis than regions containing hydrolyzable bonds in globular proteins, which undergo virtually complete hydrolysis (Finkenstadt et al., 1974).
It is not difficult to rationalize this relative inflexibility in terms of the structure of OMTKY3. To begin with, the two sides of the reactive bond are fixed to the body of the inhibitor by disulfide bridges at Cys-161 (P3) and Cys-241 (P;).
The residues between these disulfides form six hydrogen bonds to the rest of the inhibitor (see Table V). Moreover, one can see in Figure 7 that the residues from Pro-221 to Cys-241 are sandwiched between the segments Lys-291 to Lys-341 and Leu-501 to Cys-561.
Leu-231 and Cys-241 are part of an antiparallel &structure. These covalent and non- covalent interactions in the region of the scissile bond would reduce the conformational freedom of the cleaved inhibitor, thus making hydrolysis less favorable.

It is possible to explain the general properties of protein inhibitors of serine proteases on the basis of the thermodynamic parameters for their hydrolysis. In addition, it is possible to rationalize these equilibrium constants in terms of the mo- lecular structure.
A more complete understanding of the interactions between SGPB and OMTKY3 would require a knowledge of the structures of all of the intermediates and the individual rate constants for each of the steps. Unfortunately, detailed kinetic data for this specific enzyme-inhibitor pair are not yet available, and we know only the present structure of OMTKY3-SGPB.
The next step on the pathway to hy- drolysis from the observed complex would be the completion of the nucleophilic attack of Ser-195 0 on the carbonyl carbon of Leu-181 to form the tetrahedral intermediate. We have described previously the relative movements of enzyme and inhibitor that would be required to form the tetrahedral in- termediate and some interactions that would hinder these movements (Fujinaga et al., 1982).
Part of these interactions involve hydrogen bonds from the side-chain amide of Asn-331 to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Thr-171 and Glu-191 that would oppose the movement of the carbonyl carbon of Leu- 181 toward Ser-195 0. The position of this amide group is sta- bilized, in turn, by a hydrogen bond from Asn-361 N H  to Asn-331 061.
Thus, the central cy-helix serves as an anchor for the reactive bond. 
The specific hindrance that we predict for the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate will not affect the equilibrium properties that make OMTKY3 an inhibitor.
However, if the interactions we have described increase the activation energy barrier to a level comparable to or greater than the highest energy level on the reaction coordinate, the approach to the equilibrium between E.1 and E + I* would be slowed. In fact, it has been observed that the formation of the complex from modified inhibitor is generally slower than from intact inhibitor (Empie & Laskowski, 1982).
Prevention of the formation of I* can be advantageous if I* is more susceptible to additional peptide cleavage, as is the case for PSTI and other temporary inhibitors. 
The proposal that protein inhibitors of serine proteases bind to their cognate enzymes in the manner of a good substrate (Laskowski & Kato, 1980) is strongly supported by the present analysis.
There is no covalent interaction between the two in the minimum free energy complex that we have isolated. The very high value of the association constant seems to be due primarily to the exceptional complementarity of the enzyme and inhibitor surfaces.
