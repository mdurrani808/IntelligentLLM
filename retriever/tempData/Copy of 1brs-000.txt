J. MoL BioL (1995) 248, 478-486 JMB Energetics of Protein-Protein Interactions: Analysis of the Barnase-Barstar Interface by Single Mutations and Double Mutant Cycles Gideon Schreiber and Alan R. Fersht Cambridge Centre for Protein Engineering, Medical Research Coucil Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH U.K. The interaction of barnase, an extracellular RNase of Bacillus amylolique- faciens, with its intracellular inhibitor barstar is a suitable paradigm for protein-protein interactions, since the structures of both the free and the complexed proteins are available at high resolution. The contributions of residues from both proteins to the energetics of kinetics and thermodynamics of binding were measured by double mutant cycle analysis.
Such cycles reveal whether the contributions from a pair of residues are additive, or the effects of mutations are coupled. Double mutant cycles were constructed between a subset of five barnase and seven barstar residues, which were shown by structural and mutagenesis studies to be important in stabilising the complex.
Generall~ residues separated by less than 7 & interact co-operatively At greater separations, the effects of mutation are additive, and the energetics of the interactions are independent of each other. Three of the six most important interactions detected by double mutant cycle analysis (with coupling energies of more than 3.0 kcal mol -~) had not been noted previously from examination of the crystal structure.
The effects of mutation on the kinetics of association are all additive, apart from charged residues located at distances of up to 10 .& apart, which are co-operative. This can be explained by the fact that the transition state for association occurs before most interactions are formed.

Keywords: protein-protein interaction; protein engineering; molecular recognition Introduction Understanding the interaction between two proteins depends on characterising the individual interactions at their interface. Such a study is most feasible when the structures of the individual com- ponents have been solved, both separately and in their complex, so that all components are known.
The interaction of barstar (b*), the intracellular polypep- tide inhibitor of barnase (bn), with barnase, an extra- cellular RNase of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, is a suitable paradigm for protein-protein interactions (Hartle~ 1989). The structure of barstar in solution has been solved by NMR (Lubienski et al., 1994), and the struc- ture of the barnase-barstar complex determined to Abbreviations used: bn, barnase; b*, barstar.
The structure of barnase has been determined in the crystalline form and in solution (Mauguen et al., 1982; Bycroft et al., 1991). Mutagenesis studies have shown that the resi- dues that contribute most to the tight interaction of the complex are, in barnase: Lys27bn, Arg59bn, Arg87bn, and Hisl02bn (the changes of free energy of association on mutation, AAGmu,_w~, are some 5 to 6 kcal mo1-1 on mutation of each residue), and in bar- star: Asp35b*, Asp39b*, and Glu76b* (with Asp39b* alone contributing 7.7 kcal mo1-1 to AAGmut_wt) (Hartle34 1993; Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a; Schreiber et al., 1994).
(The suffix b* indicates that the residue is in barstar, and bn indicates that it is in barnase.) The now conventional procedure for experimen- tally analysing interactions is by site-directed mutagenesis, usually using single mutations. If a mutated residue is directly or indirectly involved in 0022-2836/95/170748--09 $08.00/0  1995 Academic Press Limited Mutagenesis Studies of Barnase-Barstar Interactions 479 binding, the mutation can lead to a change in the binding energy of the protein-protein complex.

A change in free energy on the mutation of a residue X to A, AAGx_ A, is not, in general, the intrinsic binding energy of the side-chain of X that is mutated, but simply a quantitative measure of the relative binding energy of X rather than A being present; that is the specificity of the interaction (Fersht et al., 1985, 1987, 1992; Fersht, 1987, 1993). A more advanced procedure for mutagenesis is to mutate, both singly and doub134 pairs of residues (X and Y); that is the double mutant cycle method (Carter et al., 1984; Horovitz, 1987; Fersht et al., 1992).
This gives a coupling energ)4 AAG~,, defined by: ~AGint = AAGx-A.y~B- AAGx_A - AAG-n (1) where  A A G y  ~ B is the change in binding energy on mutation of Y to B, and AAGx ~ A. - ~ the change on the simultaneous mutation of X to A and Y to B. AAGn. If the effects of the mutations are independent (non-co-operative), the change in free energy for the double mutant is the sum of those for the two single mutations, but if the mutated residues are coupled, then the change in free energy for the double mutant differs from the sum of the two single mutants.
In some circumstances, AAG~,, can be reduced to the interaction energy between two residues (Horovitz et al., 1990; Serrano et al., 1990; Loewenthal et al., 1992). 
In this paper, we analyse experimentally the energetics of binding and specificity in the association of barnase and barstar, using the double mutant cycle method.
We examine how pairs of residues contribute to the binding, and how co-operative the interactions are over the binding surface. 
Results Residues located at the interface between barnase and barstar were subjected to screening by single mutations to determine their contribution to association and binding (Figure 1) (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a; Schreiber et al., 1994; and current research).

Residues contributing to the stability of the complex Barstar inhibits the RNase activity of barnase by binding to its active site. The site of phosphodiester cleavage (the P~ phosphate site) is occupied by Asp39b* in this barnase-barstar complex (Buckle & Fersht, 1994; Buckle et al., 1994).
A single mutation of any one of these residues in barnase or barstar results in a decrease in the binding energy of the complex by 5.4 to 7.7 kcal mol -~ (Table 1). Single residues on the surface of barnase and barstar were mutated (mostly to Ala, and to Phe for Trp).

The residues were coloured in respect of the measured change in the association or dissociation rate constant upon mutagenesis. For association rate constant: Yellow, 2 to 3-fold decrease; red, 4 to 6-fold decrease; brown, 7 to 10-fold decrease, and blue 2 to 4-fold increase.

For dissociation rate constant: Yellow, 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, decrease; red, 3 orders of magnitude, decrease; brown, 4 to 5 orders of magnitude, decrease. 
mutation Thr42b* --+ Ala reduces the binding energy by 1.8 kcal mol-L Hisl02bn acts as a general acid/ base group during RNA cleavage by barnase.
In the barnase-barstar complex, the side-chain of Hisl02bn interacts with three barstar residues: the NE2 atom of Hisl02bn forms a hydrogen bond with Asp39*, ND1 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Gly31b*, and the His side-chain interacts face-to-edge with the aromatic ring of Tyr29b* (Figure 2). The single mutations Hisl02bn --+ Ala and Tyr29b* ~ Ala result in a loss of 6.1 kcal tool -1 and 3.4 kcal mo1-1 binding energ34 respectivel~ Interest- ingl~ the mutation Tyr29b* --, Phe does not desta- bilise the complex, despite the two hydrogen bonds of the OH group of Tyr29b* with the carbonyl groups of Asn83bn andAsn84bn: a possible explanation could be that the hydrogen bond angles are not favourable (Buckle et al., 1994).
Cross-section through the barnase-barstar interface, showing some important protein-protein interactions and the residues mutated in this study Major interactions are shown by broken lines with colours according to the apparent strength of the interaction: Brown, 4.5 to 6.0 kcal mol-~; purple, 3.0 to 4.5 kcal mol-I; orange; 1.3 to 3.0 kcal mol-'; black indicates a potentially important hydrogen bond which could not be measured. 
of the interface, Arg59bn forms hydrogen bonds with Asp35b* and Glu76b*, and packs closely against the aromatic ring of Trp38b*. Mutating these residues to Ala decreases the binding energy by 5.2, 4.5, 1.6 and 1.4 kcal mol -~, respectively.

pH dependence of the dissociation rate constant The pK, value of Hisl02bn is lowered from pH 6.3 in the free enzyme (Sali et al., 1988) to pH ~ 5 in the barnase-barstar complex, as measured by the pH dependence of the dissociation rate constants of the complexes of wild-type and Hisl02bn ~ Ala with barstar (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a). The residue Hisl02bn has a very low pKo in the complex because its ND1 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Gly31b*, and a second proton cannot be accepted at this position without propagating a structural change (Buckle et al., 1994).
Therefore, the pH dependence of the dissociation rate constant can serve as a probe for structural changes in the vicinity of Hisl02bn caused by mutations. Within the range pH 8 to 5, the dissociation rate constant of the wild-type complex increases about 20-fold with no levelling off at pH 5 (Figure 3).
Mutating Tyr29b* ~ Ala and Arg87bn --, Ala does not cause a large change in the pH profile (Figure 3), indicating that these two mutations do not significantly alter the structure in the vicinity of Hisl02bn. The increase in the pK, of Hisl02bn in the complex from the value of ~< 5 measured for wild-type is expected for this mutation, since Hisl02bn is no longer constrained by Asp39b*. Double mutant cycle analysis of the barnase-barstar interface Double mutant cycles were constructed for all of the residues described above (five from barnase and seven from barstar) in order to measure the degree of co-operativity between their interactions within the complex.

Interactions between side-chains in barnase and barstar can be grouped according to their coupling energies (Figure 4). The highest coupling energies are found for Asp39b* interacting with Lys27bn, Arg83bn, Arg87bn and Hisl02bn (5 to 7 kcal mo1-1, Table 1).
The pairs Asp35b**--~Arg59bn and Tyr29b* ~-, Hisl02bn have coupling energies of 3 to 4 kcal mol-L Coupling energies of 1 to 2 kcal mol -~ were found for Thr42b* interacting with Lys27bn and Arg83bn, and for Glu76b* interacting with Arg59bn. Coupling energies below 1 kcal mol-', but above the experimental error of about +0.35 kcal mol -~ (calculated for two standard deviations from the mean), were found for many of the other interactions examined.

Single mutations result in a change of the association rate constant for mutations of charged residues only A mutation of any one of these residues in barstar decreases the association rate constant twofold, irrespective of the residue mutated (Schreiber et al., 1994). Single mutations of positively charged to neutral residues located in the barstar-binding surface of barnase result in a two- to tenfold decrease in the association rate constant, dependent on the mutation (Figure 1; and Schreiber & Fersht (1993a)).

Pairs of ionic residues located in close proximity in the complex showed co-operativity during the association process, with coupling energies of around 0.4 kcal mol-1. 
Discussion The complex formed by barnase and barstar is one of the tightest protein complexes reported in the literature.
Most of the barstar residues that contribute to binding are located on one continuous polypeptide chain between residues 29 and 42, which consists of a loop and its adjacent helix. Only a single interaction (Arg59bn with Glu76b*) is made with helix4 of barstar (residues 68 to 81).
The localisation of most important residues for binding on one continuous polypeptide chain has been observed for protease inhibitors; however, in antibody-antigen complexes, the interaction surfaces of both components are formed by several regions of peptides (Janin & Chothia, 1990). 
In this work, we measured coupling energies between residues in both proteins by double mutant cycle analysis on a subset of barnase and barstar residues that were identified by mutagenesis as contributing to binding.
Mutations that were likely to lead to significant structural changes in the proteins were not further analysed. Five barnase residues and seven barstar residues were considered to be suitable targets for double mutant cycles analyses.
Double mutant cycles were constructed between most residues in the subset to enable us to quantify the energetics of the interaction without being biased by structural information about the interface. We then investigated the extent to which coupling energies could be derived from an examination of the structure of the complex.
At the centre of the binding surface, Asp39b* binds to Arg83bn, Arg87bn and Hisl02bn, with Asp39b* mimicking the P1 phosphate Mutagenesis Studies of Bamase-Barstar Interactions 483 E v = 0.5 - 0 . 5  I  O O O - O 0 O  O O   O  o ~b O o O  O I I I I I I I 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Distance A 18 Figure 5.

Activation energies for the rate constant of association for different mutants and the co-operativity between them (AAGt,~) were calculated as explained in the text. A AAGta= of zero indicates that the pair of residues analysed do not interact during the association reaction.
A positive AAGt~ value means that the 2 residues interact favourably during the association process, and a negative value that the 2 residues oppose each other. Filled circles indicate the AAGt,= between 2 charged mutants, and open circles in- dicate all other mutant pairs analysed.
The coupling energies between Asp39b* with Arg83bn and Arg87bn are over 6 kcal mol -], making them among the strongest interactions yet reported. At the other side of the interaction surface, the salt-bridge between Glu76b* and Arg59bn shows a coupling energy of only 1.6 kcal mol -], the distance between the residues in the pairs in both cases being about 3/~. Three of the six most important interactions detected by double mutant cycle analysis (with coupling energies of more than 3.0 kcal mo1-1) were not noted previously as being potentially important from the analysis of the crystal structure (Guillet et al., 1993; Buckle et al., 1994).
The coupling energies for Lys27bn with Asp39b* and for Arg59bn with Asp35b* are 4.8 and 3.4kcal moP', respectivel} despite the distances of 4.5/~ and 4.4/~ between the two residues from each pair. 
Hisl02bn and Tyrl03bn are the only barnase residues that move significantly upon forming the complex (Buckle & Fersht, 1994; Buckle et al., 1994).

Hisl02bn makes face-to-edge interactions with both Tyr29b* and Tyrl03bn, with both Tyr residues being perpendicular to the face of Hisl02bn, locking it into position. The strong interaction between Hisl02bn and Tyr29b* (coupling energy of 3.3kcalmol-') cannot be simply explained as a base-to-aromatic interaction, because for such an interaction we would expect the edge of the histidine to be perpendicular to the face of a tyrosine, and hence the histidine would serve as a hydrogen donor, which it is not the case here (Burley & Petsko, 1986; Loewenthal et al., 1992; Perutz, 1993).

Figure 6 shows the coupling energies between barnase and barstar residues as a function of the distance between them. Overall, the coupling energy between pairs of residues decreases with distance, with significant values of free energy for all pairs of residues separated by up to 7 A. Ionic interactions are known to extend to long distances (Russell et al., 1987; Jackson & Fersht, 1993), but Figure 6 shows that coupling energies of between 0.35 and 1.2 kcal tool -~ are also found for interactions of uncharged residues separated by more then 4/~. The pairs of residues in this group are of a varied nature: ionic interactions (Lys27bn *--, Glu80b* and Arg59bn ~ Glu80b*), interactions between ionic and aromatic groups (Lys27bn ~ Trp38b*, Arg83bn ~ Tyr29b* and Arg87bn ~ Tyr29b*) and interactions between ionic and polar side-chains as for Arg83bn ~ Thr42b* and Arg87bn ~ Thr42b*. None of these interactions are simple water-mediated hydrogen bonds.

484 Mutagenesis Studies of Bamase-Barstar Interactions difficult, at this stage, to analyse the nature of those weak long-range interactions. Hydrogen bonds are partly of an electrostatic nature, so they might show longer-range contributions for binding.
Some of the measured coupling energies may also result from secondary interactions, through a third side-chain. It could well be that the coupling energies result indirectly from local rearrangements of the solvation shells on mutating, rather than from direct inter- actions.
No significant coupling energies are measured between pairs of residues separated by >8 A, apart from the coupling energy of Arg59bn with Tyr29b* of 0.64kcalmol-L The important conclusions from this are: (1) that the range of amino acid interaction distances in a protein is more than 4 A, even for interactions in which one or more of the components is not a charged residue; and (2) that the energetics of an interaction cannot be simply assessed by the distance between the two partners, even for the simple case of an electrostatic interaction, which is independent of the orientation of the interacting residues. The comparison between potentially important bonds derived from structural information with the measured coupling energies of those bonds emphasises that the nature of polar interactions is very dependent on their local environ- ment.
This was suggested also by the analysis of mutational data from the complex of human growth hormone binding with its receptor (Cunningham & Wells, 1993). The change in free energy of binding did not correlate with the change in buried surface area, number  of van der Waals' contacts or side-chain accessibility changes upon mutagenesis.
This is in contrast with the good fit found between the number of methyl side-chain groups found within 6 A of the deleted methyl group in the core of barnase and their contribution to the free energy of unfolding (Serrano et al., 1992). 
Two central questions in analysing coupling energy data are: to what extent do they reflect the real interaction energies, and to what extent do they reflect the structural rearrangement of the protein and solvent?
Additivity of mutational effects in proteins was observed for distant mutations at rigid molecular interfaces, such as in some enzyme-substrate inter- actions and some protein-protein interactions (Carter et al., 1984; Horovitz & Rigbi, 1985; Wells, 1990). The changes in the free energies of binding of all the pairwise mutations for residues separated by more than 8 A are equal to the sums of the two single mutants, and no significant co-operativity was detected between those pairs of residues (Figure 6).

These results suggest that no major rearrangement of the interface occurs as a result of mutagenesis. The question becomes more complicated for residues located in close proximity to each other, since they show co-operativity in double mutant cycles.
The pH dependence of the dissociation rate constant of the complex results from the steric inability of Hisl02bn to accept a second proton. This pH dependency may be used as a probe for structural rearrangements in the vicinity of His102 upon introducing mutation.

Mutations of Arg87bn ~ Ala and Tyr29b* ~ Ala do not alter the pH dependence of dissociation of the complex, which suggests that the structure of Hisl02bn in the complex in the presence of those mutations is not altered. 
The rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the difference in free energy between the transition state of the reaction and its ground state.

However, the calculation of the change in energy on mutation is simpler, since the absolute value of the free energy is not important, but only the change in it according to equation (2). The reference states for this calculation are the free proteins in solution, which have a coupling energy AAG,, of zero.
Double mutant cycles can be applied to Ad~G~ as for any other thermodynamic measurement (Fersht et al., 1992; Horovitz & Fersht, 1992). Where two residues interact during the transition for complex formation, their contribution to the free energy of the transition state should be non-additive.

The association rate constant for the formation of the wild-type complex is 3.7 x 108 M -1 s -~, which is too fast to be explained solely by diffusion with- out electrostatic effects. This, and the presence of multiple charges (mostly positive on barnase and negative on barstar), suggest that steering effects are important during the association.
Co-operativity is found only for pairs of charged residues located close to each other in the complex. The lack of co- operativity during association for all unchanged residues in the interface means simply that the transition state for association occurs before the co- operative effects come into pla}~ The existence of an intermediate on the association pathway was sug- gested from the analysis of the pH dependence of the association and dissociation rate constants (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a).
The lack of dependence of the association rate constant on pH suggests that the interaction of barstar with Hisl02bn is formed after the transition state. The current results suggest that all of the non-electrostatic interactions are formed after the transition state of binding barnase to barstar.

This can be explained in physical terms by the kinetics of protein-protein association using a computer simulation of Brownian dynamics (Northrup & Erickson, 1992). During this step it is expected that the contribution of a charged residue to the association rate constant will be proportional to its electrostatic field potential.
It was suggested that pairs of proteins surrounded by water undergo multiple collisions, with rotational reorientation during each encounter (Northrup & Erickson, 1992). At this stage, oppositely charged residues that are located in close Mutagenesis Studies of Barnase-Barstar Interactions 485 proximi ty  in the complex can assist in the guiding and docking of the two proteins.
 A mutat ion of one of those charged residues will result  in the neutralisation of the second charged residue of the pair  in the final docking steps, and so mutat ions  of closely interacting residues are not addit ive dur ing the association of the two mol- ecules. In other words,  those residues show co-operat ive behaviour  dur ing the association of the complex.

The a im of this work  was to construct a map  of the interaction energies at the surface of contact be tween  two proteins,  barnase  and barstar.  The compar ison  b e t w e e n  the energetic and structural  binding surfaces emphasises  that structural  details by  themselves are not sufficient to evaluate  the energetics of binding.
 The mos t  impor tan t  interactions are b e t w e e n  Asp39b* and the four barnase  side-chains that su r round  it. On the other hand,  the sal t-bridge be twe en  Glu76b* and Arg59bn is relatively weak,  showing the impor tance  of the local envi ronment  to binding.
The general  architec- ture of the interaction seems to be  rigid, even for mutat ions  that destabilise the interaction signifi- cantly This can be explained by  the fit b e t ween  the proteins being lock-and-ke~ rather  than an induced fit, wi th  very similar  s t ructures  of the free and the complexed proteins. The interactions be tween  residues that we  tried to quantify in this s tudy  add  up  to one of the tightest interactions b e t w e e n  proteins found so far.

Materials and Methods Protein expression and purification Site-directed mutagenesis of barstar was performed by the method of Sayers et al. (1988). The oligonucleotides that were used for mutagenesis of barstar residues were: Tyr29 ~ Ala, TTC ACC GTA GGC TTC CGG AAG; Tyr29 ~ Phe, TTC ACC GTA GAA TTC CGG AAG; Trp38 ~ Phe, TCA GAC AAT CGA ATA AAG CGT; Thr42 ~ Ala, CCA TCC GGC CAG ACA ATC; and for Trp44 ~ Phe, GGT ACT CCA CAA ATC CGG TCA GA: For mutagenesis of barnase Phe82 ~ Ala, CTG AAT TTC TGG CGC CTG ATG T. Mutant plasmids were identified by direct sequencing.
All the other mutations used in this work have been described (Mossakowska et al., 1989; Meiering et al., 1992; Schreiber et al., 1994). The expression and purification of barstar and barnase have been described (Serrano et al., 1990; Schreiber & Fersht, 1993b).
Barstar was unfolded in urea in the presence of 10 mM DTT for 30 minutes, refolded and extensively dialysed before use to eliminate the presence of oxidised or dimeric proteins. 
Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 27,400M -~ cm q for barnase wild-type and mutants, 23,000 M -~ cm-' for barstar wild-type, 20,600 M -j cm -~ for Tyr29b* --* Ala, 16,000 M-' cm-' for Trp38b* ~ Phe, and 16,170M-'cm -1 for Trp44b*~ Phe, estimated by the method of Gill & von Hippel (1989).

Kinetic and equilibrium measurements The association and dissociation rate constants for the barnase-barstar complexes (wild-type and mutants) were measured in 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8) buffer at 25C, as described previously (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a; Schreiber et al., 1994). The association of barnase and barstar was measured under second-order conditions, the concen- trations of the proteins being equal (Fersht, 1985; Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a; Schreiber et al., 1994).
The formation of the complex was followed by investigation of the change in fluorescence upon association, using a stopped-flow fluorimeter with a 315 nm cut-off filter for measuring emission. The association of reduced wild-type barstar with barnase (as well as some of the mutants) could be measured only upon excitation of 230 nm, not 280 nm.
The biophysical basis of this phenomenon will be discussed elsewhere (G. Schreiber, R. Golbik & A. R. Fersht, unpublished results). Similar rate constants of association were measured for mutants that show changes in fluorescence intensity on excitation at both 230 nm and 280 nm.
Dissociation rate constants ("off rates") were measured under first-order conditions by first allowing the barnase-barstar complex to form, then "chasing" off the mutant barstar with five to ten times the concentration of wild-type barstar. A [3Hlbarnase-barstar or barnase-[3Hl - barstar complex was used for complexes with dissociation rate constants of 5 x 10 -5 s -~ or more.
Dissociation rate constants faster than 5 x 10 -3 s -~ were measured with a stopped-flow fluorimeter. This method takes advantage of the differences in fluorescence behaviour between wild-type and mutant complexes, relative to the free form, as described previously (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a).

Dissociation rate constants were calculated by fitting the obtained data set to an exponential equation. 
Very small dissociation constants (Kd), such as that for the complex of wild-type barstar and barnase, cannot be measured directl)~ but may be derived from kinetic measurements of the dissociation rate constant (k_~) and association rate constant (k~), so that the dissociation constant is calculated as K~ = k_~/kj.
The free energy of an interaction is calculated as AG = - R T  In Ka, and the interaction energy between two residues is calculated by the double mutant cycle method, as in equation (1). 
The standard error of the mean (o) was calculated from two to five repetitions of each experiments for all of the data for mutant proteins, and for more measurements on wild-type proteins.
Accordingl~ 2o, the 95% confidence level for AG is +0.2kcalmol -~, and for AAGm,t.w, the 2o is +0.2kcal mol -~ (since the error for the wild-type data is substantially smaller).
