The contribution of specic residues and interactions within the barnase-barstar interface to the enthalpy of binding has been examined using isothermal titration calorimetry and protein engineering.
The enthalpy of association of the wild-type proteins is 18.9 (0.1) kcal/mol at pH 8 and at 25C The enthalpy of binding remains favourable for 31 different combinations of mutations in the interface. The effects on the binding enthalpy upon replacing a side-chain involved in the interaction of barnase and barstar are, however, always unfavourable and in most cases larger than the effects on the free energy of binding.
Interaction enthalpies calculated by double mutant cycle analysis are in some cases much larger than the interaction free energies. The interaction enthalpies for complexes between different barnase mutants with amino acid substitutions of the general base residue glutamic acid 73 and a barstar variant (D39A) vary by as much as 8.3 kcal/mol while the coupling free energies differ only by 1 kcal/mol.
The use of enthalpies for the analysis of structure-activity relationships appears to be complicated by enthalpy-entropy compensation of weak intermolecular interactions. These tend to cancel out in measurements of free energy, which is thus the preferred quantity for simple analysis of interactions.

Barstar inhibits barnase by binding to its active site, forming a 1:1 complex (Figure 1: Hartley & Smeaton, 1973;

double mutant has been solved by Guillet et al (1993) at 2.6 A resolution and by Buckle et al (1994) at 2.0 A resolution.
The three-dimensional structures of the free proteins are also known: for barnase both from X-ray crystallography (Mauguen et al., 1982) and from NMR studies in solution (Bycroft et al., 1991); and for barstar from NMR studies in solution (Lubienski et al., 1994). 
Detailed protein engineering studies on the interaction of barnase and barstar have revealed the apparent contributions of specic residues to the free energy and kinetics of binding (Hartley, 1993;
Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a, 1995; Schreiber et al.,
1994).
In this study, we complete the thermodynamic characterisation of this interaction using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the enthalpy of formation of barnase-barstar complexes with single amino acid substitutions in the# 1997 Academic Press Limited Figure 1. Coupling enthalpies{were determined by the double mutant cycle method (Carter et al., 1984; Horovitz, 1987; Fersht et al., 1992) and compared with the corresponding coupling free energies.
Changes in protonation on the interaction of barnase with barstar were measured as were the heat capacity for the interaction and its change on mutation. 
These direct calorimetric measurements reveal the contributions of enthalpy and entropy to the free energy of binding.
Changes in the free energy and enthalpy on mutation are generally not correlated (Sturtevant, 1994), however, and any interpretation of the effects on enthalpy and entropy in structure-activity relationships is complicated by the involvement of solvent (Hammett, 1940; Jencks,
1969). Mark & van Gunsteren (1994) have stated that the theoretical basis for the assignment of enthalpic contributions to the free energy to specic atom-atom or residue-residue interactions is rm while the free energy of these interactions can not be determined but this has been challenged by Boresch & Karplus (1995) and Brady & Sharp (1995).

The binding enthalpy of the association of barnase and barstar can be determined as accurately as the binding free energy using isothermal titration calorimetry. The barnase-barstar complex constitutes, therefore, an ideal system to compare experimentally determined values of coupling enthalpies and coupling free energies for residue-residue interactions.{Coupling energies and enthalpies are dened by equation (1).Results Enthalpy and stoichiometry of interaction of barnase and barstar The enthalpy of association of barnase and barstar at 25C and at pH 8 is 18.9 (0.1) kcal/mol.

The stoichiometry and enthalpy of interaction of barnase and barstar are independent of protein concentration (data not shown) or whether barnase is titrated with barstar or vice versa (Table 1). These observations indicate that all the proteins are fully folded and capable of binding the other component.
The average value for the stoichiometry of binding (n) from all ITC measurements performed in this study is 0.95 (standard deviation   0.03; total number of experiments was 220). 
The ITC measurements shown in Table 2 were performed at an ionic strength of 0.018 M while all other ITC measurements and all measurements of association and dissociation rate constants were at an ionic strength of 0.029 M. The difference in binding enthalpy between the two ionic strengths for the barnase-barstar and barnase-barstar(D39A)
complexes was in both cases 0.4 kcal/mol with the lower (more negative) binding enthalpy being at low ionic strength (see Tables 2 and 3).
The H of the interaction of barnase and barstar increases further at ionic strengths of 0.2 and 0.5 M, respectively (Table 3). This is in good agreement with the ionic strength dependence of the free energy of binding (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a).

698 Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and BarstarProtonation changes during the interaction of barnase and barstar The contribution of the heat of protonation to the heat of binding of barnase and barstar can be determined from the binding enthalpies obtained from ITC measurements of interaction of barnase and barstar in buffers with different heats of ionization. Association of barnase and barstar was measured at 25C in three different buffers at pH 8
(Table 3).
The enthalpies of ionization (for the process HA! H  A) at 25C for these buffers are:
7.7 kcal/mol for Tes, 4.9 kcal/mol for Hepes and 0.8 kcal/mol for phosphate buffer (Cooper &
Johnson, 1994a). The binding enthalpies measured in Hepes and phosphate buffer were virtually identical, whereas in Tes buffer H was decreased by 0.6 kcal/mol, which is slightly larger than the experimental error.
A similar difference of 0.7 kcal/
mol and 0.4 kcal/mol in Tes buffer was found for the complexes between barstar and barnase(E73Q)
and barstar and barnase(E73W), respectively
(Table 3). This decrease, however, is not very high and since the binding enthalpies of the interaction of barnase and barstar in Hepes and sodium phosphate buffer were the same, no correction for the contribution of buffer titration to the observed H was made.
The net ux of protons for the interaction of barnase and barstar at pH 8 must bearound zero, which means that the inuence of the heat of buffer ionization is negligible. 
Association constants for the interaction of barnase and barstar Binding was too strong for most of the complexes to allow the association constant to be determined by ITC measurements (Figure 2).
For complexes where Ka could be determined (barnasebarstar (D39A) and barnase(K27A)-barstar(D39A))
there is good agreement with values determined from kinetic measurements of the association and dissociation rate constants (Table 2). This may reect the difculty in determining Ka from ITC measurements when the H of the interaction is small.

Effects of mutation on the thermodynamics of interaction The thermodynamic parameters of complexes between barnase and barstar mutants of which the free energy of interaction had been determined previously (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995) are summarized in Table 2.

Accordingly, 2s, the 95% condence level, for G is 0.2 kcal mol1, for
Gwt-mut the 2s is 0.2 kcal mol1 (since the error for the wild-type data is substantially smaller). 
For the H and G values obtained by ITC, the standard error of the mean was calculated from at least three repetitions of each experiment and the 2s is between 0.1 and 0.4 kcal mol1 as is for 2s for Hwt-mut.
For complexes where both possible calorimetric titrations have been performed (see Table 1), all data were averaged. 
Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 699binding enthalpy (i.e. less favourable) upon mutation of one residue of the barnase-barstar binding site, which is in most cases larger than the corresponding increase of binding free energy.
The exceptions are the complexes between barnase(R87A) and barstar,
and between barnase(R87A) and barstar(D39A),
where the increase of free energy of binding is larger than the increase of binding enthalpy. 
The interaction enthalpy (Hint) between several pairs of residues was determined using the double mutant cycle method (Carter et al., 1984;
Horovitz, 1987; Fersht et al., 1992).
In this procedure, two residues, X and Y, are mutated singly and pairwise and the interaction energy (Gint)
is calculated as:
Gint  GXY GX!A GY!A GX!A;Y!A 1
where GXY is the free energy of the wild-type,
GX ! A and GY ! A are the free energies of the two single mutants and GX ! A, Y ! A the free energy of the double mutant. If the effects of the twomutations are independent, Gint should be zero. 
If the effects are coupled, the change in energy for the double mutant should be different from the sum of the changes in G of the two single mutants.
Interaction free energies between residues on barnase and barstar have been observed only between residues that are located at a distance of less than 8 A from each other,
suggesting that possible changes in structure or solvation resulting from mutagenesis are limited to a short distance from the site of mutation (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995). The double mutant cycle method can also be used to calculate an interaction enthalpy or interaction entropy (Sint).
In an ideal situation, the interaction energies of X and Y with the rest of the protein and with solvent and possible reorganisation energy terms will cancel out to leave just the interaction energies between X and Y (Fersht et al., 1992). The coupling enthalpies between residues His102(bn) and Tyr29(b*) and between Lys27(bn) and Asp39(b*) are 7.6 and 9.4 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 3A).

The buffer routinely used for the ITC measurements was 39 mM Hepes (pH 8), 1 mM DDT. Ka (and G) was calculated from the association and dissociation rate constants (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995; unpublished results).
The interaction between Arg87(bn) and Asp39(b*) has an interaction enthalpy of 8.0 kcal/mol while the Gint is 6.1 kcal/mol. These enthalpy values are far too high for the interaction of His102(bn) with the phenyl ring of Tyr29(b*) or for the long-range electrostatic interaction (charged atoms are 4.5 A apart)
between Lys27(bn) and Asp39(b*) or the hydrogen bond between Arg87(bn) and Asp39(b*).
There are,
therefore, probably additional effects (solvent or other reorganisation effects) that lead to a decrease in binding enthalpy in the complexes between the barnase and barstar single mutants (``double mutant complexes'') compared with at least one of the corresponding complexes between barnase or barstar wild-type and a single barstar or barnase mutant (``single mutant complexes'') that does not cancel out in the double mutant cycle. 
Values of Hint of the barnase(H102A)-barstar(Y29F) and barnase(R59A)-barstar(D39A) complexes should be zero, since the side-chains of Arg59(bn) and Asp39(b*) are too far apart to interact and the hydroxyl group of Tyr29(b*) does not interact with His102(bn) (Buckle et al., 1994;
Schreiber & Fersht, 1995).
In both cases, however,
signicant interaction enthalpies of 1.6 kcal/mol for barnase(H102A)-barstar(Y29F) and 1.7 kcal/
mol for barnase(R59A)-barstar(D39A) were found. 
The free energy of association of the latter complexwas determined only by ITC, which could not be done very accurately, since the enthalpy of association is only 1.7 kcal/mol.

Changes in H and G of binding for different barnase(E73) mutant-barstar complexes To investigate possible contributions of solvent and reorganisation to the measured binding enthalpy that do not seem to cancel out in the double mutant cycles, the binding energetics of a series of barnase mutants at one position in the binding interface were determined. Glutamic acid 73 of barnase was chosen for this study since its side-chain reaches into a large water-lled cavity at the centre of the barnase-barstar interface (Buckle et al., 1994).

The side-chain of Glu73 makes three interactions with water molecules that are buried in the interface but it is not involved in a direct interaction with barstar (Figure 1; Buckle et al., 1994). Computer modelling suggests that Glu73 could even be substituted by tryptophan without causing clashes with neighbouring residues.
The binding thermodynamics of the complexes between these barnase mutants and barstar and barstar mutants are summarized in Figure 2.

Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 701Table 3. While the destabilizing effect on G for the interaction of the different barnase(E73) mutants with barstar varied only between 1.4 and 3 kcal/mol, the change in H was between 8.2 and 11.6 kcal/mol.
Considering the large change in H in all the barnase(E73) mutant-barstar complexes (compared with the barnase-barstar complex), the differences between them are relatively small. 
The values of Gint of the complexes between different barnase(E73) mutants and barstar(D35A)
or barstar(E76A) are all around zero within experimental error (Figure 3B).
The values of Hint for these complexes are on average slightly higher but they are in all cases lower than 1 kcal/mol. This is the expected result because these residues are notinvolved in direct interactions (and Asp35(b*) does not interact with Lys27(bn), which might be affected by the mutation of Glu73(bn)).
The value of
Gint of the complexes between different barnase(E73) mutants and barstar(D39A) is on average 2.5 kcal/mol and varies only between 1.9 and 2.9 kcal/mol for the four different barnaseE73 mutants analysed (Figure 3B). This interaction free energy could result from either a perturbation of the water network within the binding site or a loss
(or a weakening) of the interaction of residues Arg83(bn), Arg87(bn) and Lys27(bn) with barstar
(especially with Asp39(b*)) caused by reorganisation.

702 Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstarand Glu76(b*) suggests a reorganisation conned to the region around residue 73 of barnase, which should be similar in all cases. 
In contrast, the value of Hint of the complexes between different barnase(E73) mutants and barstar(D39A) is very large and varies between 8.2 and 16.5 kcal/mol (Figure 3B).
This results from a decrease in binding enthalpy of the double mutant complexes compared with at least one of the single mutant complexes of the cycle, as has been observed for the other double mutant cycles with a very high interaction enthalpy (Tables 2 and 3).Table 4.

The structure of the barnase-barburied accessible surface area of this complex should not be very since the two cysteine residues in barstar are relatively buried barstar(C40A/C82A) are identical (Wong et al., 1996). For the bare residue using the software package Insight II (Biosym Technoloas calculated as for the complex between the wild-type proteins.

Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 703and barstar and for six different barnase(E73) mutant-barstar complexes were performed at ve different temperatures (8, 16.5, 25, 31 and 37C). The binding enthalpies were plotted against temperature (Figure 4)
and the data were t both to a linear function and to a second-order polynomial to obtain values for
Cp.
All the data t better to a second-order polynomial, indicating a small temperature dependence of the Cp of binding. The slight curvature in the plots becomes especially apparent on examining the residuals of the linear and the polynomial ts
(Figure 4); the residuals of the polynomial ts are randomly distributed while the residuals of the linear ts show a systematic curvature.
The differences, however, between the Cp values from the linear t and the Cp values at 25C from the second-order polynomial t are very small
(Table 4). 
The Cp values of the complexes analysed are relatively large and negative and they are all very similar (the Cp values are almost all smaller than the experimental error: Table 4).
Glu73 contributes only 11 A 2 to a total of 1600 A 2 of accessible surface area buried upon complex formation between barnase and barstar. Hence, the expected changes in the burial of polar and non-polar accessible surface area on mutation of Glu73 are small
(Table 4).
The very similar Cp values suggest that there is no large structural perturbation within the interface of the barnase-barstar complex on mutation of Glu73(bn). 
Discussion The binding enthalpy of the interaction of barnase and barstar can be measured accurately by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).
The values do not depend on protein concentration and the same values are obtained for both the calorimetric titration of barnase with barstar and vice versa. 
There is only a negligible protonation change upon association at pH 8, which is, according to the theory of linked functions (Wyman, 1964), consistent with the nding that the dissociation constant of the barnase-barstar complex between pH 7 and 9 is practically invariant (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a).

For two complexes (barnase-barstar(D39A), barnase(K27A)-barstar(D39A)) the Ka values could be determined accurately by ITC. These are in good agreement with the Ka values determined independently from the association and dissociation rate constants (Table 2; Schreiber & Fersht, 1995).
The ITC measurements have, therefore, conrmed the proposed scheme of complex formation, in which one association/dissociation equilibrium for barnase-barstar complex formation is involved (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a). Hence, Ka values of the interaction of barnase and barstar from direct measurements should be generally the same asthe Ka values determined from the association and dissociation rate constants.

The Cp value represents the difference in heat capacity at constant pressure that is related to solvation changes between two states of a system. It was shown that most of the heat capacity change associated with the unfolding of the native state of a protein can be expressed as a linear combination of the differences in polar and non-polar solventaccessible surface areas between those states (Murphy & Freire, 1992; Spolar et al., 1992), and it was suggested that this approach applies also to protein-protein interactions, since the atomic interactions involved are similar in both cases (Murphy et al., 1993; Gomez & Freire, 1995).
The following equation, derived from model compound studies,
relates Cp to the polar (Ap) and non-polar
(Anp) surface area buried upon folding or interaction (Murphy & Freire, 1992; Murphy et al.,
1993):
Cp  0:45Anp  0:26Ap cal mol1 K1 3
For the barnase-barstar complex the polar and non-polar surface area buried between the interface is about 894 A 2 and 706 A 2, respectively (Table 4). 
Hence, the calculated Cp is 85 cal mol1 K1 The Cp of binding of the barnase-barstar complex, however, was estimated to be 363 cal mol1 K1 assuming that it is independent of temperature and 384 cal mol1 K1 (at 25C) assuming it is temperature dependent.
A lack of correlation between the measured and the calculated Cp values (using the same equation) was also found for other protein-protein interactions
(Raman et al., 1995; Schwarz et al., 1995; Pearce et al., 1996). This suggests that while the heat capacity change for protein folding often correlates well with the burial of non-polar and polar surface area, a similar correlation may not apply to protein-protein interactions.

For most of the mutant complexes between barnase and barstar the increase of the enthalpy of binding is larger than the increase of the free energy of binding. This indicates enthalpy-entropy compensation, which seems to be a characteristic of weak intermolecular interactions (Dunitz, 1995).

Coupling enthalpies of non-interacting residues are on average larger than the corresponding coupling free energies, which are all smaller than 1 kcal/
mol, but none is larger than 1.7 kcal/mol. Coupling enthalpies of directly or indirectly (through stabilization of neighbouring residues) interacting residues are, however, in most cases much larger than the corresponding coupling free energies and,
in contrast to the interaction free energies, they vary considerably for the different barnase(E73)
mutant-barstar(D39A) complexes.

Mark & van Gunsteren (1994) claim that,
whereas the enthalpy of interaction of individual residues may in principle be determined by calculation or experiment, the associated free energies cannot, because of difculties in the calculation of 704 Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstarentropy: there are changes in the entropy of the protein and solvent on mutation that are non-additive. 
Boresch & Karplus (1995) and Brady & Sharp
(1995) have set out the counter arguments that G can be usefully calculated and measured.
There is also an experimental justication of why measurements of G are more meaningful than those of
H because of entropy-enthalpy compensation. 
For over 50 years, G has been preferred by physical-organic chemists for analysing reactions in solution and is even considered a more accurate measure of changes in enthalpy than is the measured value of H (Hammett, 1940).
This stems from the large number of observations, summarized by Jencks (1969) and Lumry & Rajender
(1970), that changes in values of H (and S) on changes in structure for processes in solution contain contributions from changes in the enthalpy and entropy of water that are compensating. It has also been shown theoretically that on forming a cavity in water to accommodate a solvent molecule, the change in the enthalpy of water (the solvation or cavity term) is exactly balanced by the entropy of the cavity (Ben-Naim, 1975; Yu &
Karplus, 1988). Thus, measured values of H and
S contain contributions from H(solv) and S(solv),
which may obscure them but cancel out in G because G(solv) (H(solv)  TS(solv)) is zero.
Dunitz
(1995) has analysed entropy-enthalpy compensation semi-quantitatively and has shown that it extends to all weak interactions so that there is nearly complete enthalpy-entropy compensation at 300 K for interactions of about 5 kcal mol1. The results in this study show that the changes in G are reasonable and rational, but that those in enthalpy can be large and erratic, as are those for changes in protein stability (Sturtevant, 1994).
Thus, measurements of G are preferable to those of H for analysing structure-activity relationships. 
Materials and Methods Protein expression and purification Barnase and barstar were expressed and puried as described (Mossakowska et al., 1989; Serrano et al., 1990;
Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a; Lubienski et al., 1994).
All barnase and barstar mutants used in this study have been described (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995; G.S., C.F. & A.R.F.,
unpublished results). 
Isothermal titration calorimetry Barnase and barstar samples were dialysed exhaustively at 4C against the same batch of buffer, previously
ltered using 0.2 mm lters (Sartolab V-500, Sartorius,
Go ttingen, Germany).
After dialysis, the proteins were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for ten minutes and then diluted with dialysis buffer to the required concentration. Protein samples were degassed under vacuum for ve minutes with gentle stirring immediately before use.
Experiments were performed inHepes buffer (pH 8), 1 mM DTT because barstar tends to aggregate in the cell of the calorimeter in Tris buffer at pH 8 (data not shown). Tris buffer was used for measurements of the interaction of barnase and barstar in previous studies (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a, 1995,
1996; Schreiber et al., 1994).
The DTT was added to the buffer to prevent oxidation and dimerization of barstar
(Frisch et al., 1995). 
Measurements were also performed in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8), 1 mM DTT and Tes buffer (pH 8),
1 mM DTT, to examine the contribution of the heat of buffer ionization to barnase-barstar binding.
Measurements were not routinely performed in phosphate buffer because the active site of barnase binds phosphate with a Kd of 1.3 mM (Meiering et al., 1992), which could complicate the determination of the binding enthalpy of barstar and barnase. 
ITC measurements were performed as described
(Wiseman et al., 1989; Cooper & Johnson, 1994a) using an OMEGA isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal,
Northampton, MA, USA).
The protein concentration in the cell of the calorimeter ranged from 0.01 to 0.06 mM,
while the titrant solutions were about nine times higher. 
Figure 2 shows data from a typical calorimetric titration experiment of the association between barnase and barstar.
The binding data were analysed using OriginTM software (Microcal, Northampton, MA, USA) and were
tted either with a xed value of Ka, which was calculated from independently measured values of the association and dissociation rate constants to obtain values for the stoichiometry of binding (n) and H, or with no parameters xed to obtain n, H and Ka. 
The calculation of the enthalpy of association from ITC measurements is based on the concentration of the titrant (sample in the injection syringe).
Errors in its concentration or the presence of aggregated and/or inactive material can lead to large deviations from the true enthalpy of association. Hence, for a number of combinations of mutants, barnase was titrated with barstar and vice versa (see Table 1).

The protein concentration was determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm, corrected for light scattering (Drake, 1994). Extinction coefcients (e280 M1 cm1),
determined by the method of Gill & von Hippel
(1989), are: barstar, 22171 M1 cm1; barstar(Y29A),
20643 M1 cm1; barstar(Y29F), 20798 M1 cm1; barnase,
27404 M1 cm1; barnase(E73W), 33863 M1 cm1; and barnase(E73Y), 28769 M1 cm1.

Kinetic and equilibrium measurements Association and dissociation rate constants for the barnase-barstar complexes were measured in 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8) at 25C as described (Schreiber & Fersht,
1993a, 1995, 1996; Schreiber et al., 1994). The meaning of component analysis: decomposition of the free energy in terms of specic interactions.
