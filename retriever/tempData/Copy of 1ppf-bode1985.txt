Eur. J. Biochem. 147, 387-395 (1985) 0 FEBS 1985 The crystal and molecular structure of the third domain of silver pheasant ovomucoid (OMSVP3) Wolfram BODE, Otto EPP, Robert HUBER, Michael LASKOWSKI, Jr and Wojciech ARDELT Max-Planck-Insti tut fur Biochemie, Abteilung Strukturforschung 11, Martinsried; and Purdue University, Department of Chemistry, West Lafayette, Indiana (Received September 10/November 5,1984) - EJB 84 0987 OMSVP3 and Oh4TKY3 (third domains of silver pheasant and turkey ovomucoid inhibitor) are Kazal-type serine proteinase inhbitors. They have been isomorphously crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2 with cell dimensions of a = 4.429 nm, b = 2.115 nm, c = 4.405 nm, /3 = 107".
The asymmetric unit contains one molecule corresponding to an extremely low volume per unit molecular mass of 0.0017 nm3/Da. Data collection was only possible for the OMSVP3 crystals.
Orientation and position of the OMSVP3 molecules in the monoclinic unit cells were determined using Patterson search methods and the known structure of the third domain of Japanese quail ovomucoid (OMJPQ3) [Papamokos, E., Weber, E., Bode, W., Huber, R., Empie, M. W., Kato, I. and Laskowski, M., Jr (1982) J.  Mol. The OMSVP3 structure has been refined by restrained crystallographic refinement yielding a final R value of 0.199 for data to 0.15 nm resolution.
Conformation and hydrogen-bonding pattern of OMSVP3 and OMJPQ3 are very similar. Large deviations occur at the NH2 terminus owing to different crystal packing, and at the C terminus of the central helix, representing an intrinsic property and resulting from amino acid substitutions far away from this site.
The deviation of OMSVP3 from OMTKY3 complexed with the Streptomyces griseus protease B is very small [Fujinaga, M., Read, R. J., Sielecki, A., Ardelt, W., Laskowski, M., Jr and James, M. N. G. (1982) Proc. Nut1 Acad. Sci. USA, 79,4868-48721. Ovomucoid inhibitors are major constitutents of avian egg white. Generally they consist of three tandem domains, each of which is a strong inhibitor of serine proteases and belongs to the family of Kazal inhibitors.
The specificity of the ovomucoid inhibitors is mainly determined by the P1 residue. 
The nomenclature of Schechter and Berger [l] is used for the numbering of the substrate amino acid residues 'towards the NH2-terminal and the COOH-terminal directions from the scissile bond.
The detailed specificity is also affected by single residue changes in positions other than P1. In an attempt to unravel the detailed algorithm for predicting in- hibitory specificity from the amino acid sequence the Purdue group has sequenced a large number of avian ovomucoid domains and compared their inhibitory properties.
It was found that only changes of residues in contact with the enzyme are important. Such exchanges may affect the packing of the inhibitory enzyme interface but they may also alter the main- chain conformation of the binding segment itself.
Structural studies of related inhibitors are required to clarify this prob- lem. 
The high-resolution crystal structures of three different representatives of the Kazal family have been determined and crystallographically refined : four independent molecules per asymmetric unit of the third domain of Japanese quail ovomucoid inhibitor (OMJPQ3) [2, 31, the third domain of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor (OMTKY3) complexed with the Abbreviations.
OMSVP3, third domain of silver pheasant ovo- mucoid inhibitor; Oh4TKY3, third domain of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor; OMJPQ3, third domain of Japanese quail ovomucoid in- hibitor; PSTI, porcine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; SGPB, Streptomyces griseus protease B; r.m.s., root-mean-square; IFo\, IF& observed and computed structure amplitudes. 
Streptomyces griseus protease B [4,5], and the porcine pancre- atic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) complexed with bo- vine trypsinogen [6].
The sequence of OMSVP3 differs at six positions from OMJPQ3. Three of these changes occur at P2(17), Pl(18) and Pl'(19) around the reactive site.
The P3 to P2' residues run as follows: Cys-16, Thr-17, Met-18, Glu- 19, Tyr-20. Thus, in contrast to OMJPQ3, which is a trypsin inhibitor because of a lysine residue at its PI position, the methionine of OMSVP3 determines its preferred inhibitory specificity towards chymotrypsin, elastase and subtilisin [7].

OMTKY3 differs from OMSVP3 only by a leucine residue in the PI position resulting in almost identical binding constants. 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Preparation and crystallization Isolation and purification of OMSVP3 and OMTKY3 were similar to those described by Bogard et al. [8].
Large plate-like crystals of diameter up to 1 mm (Fig. 1 A) could be grown from OMSVP3 in 1 .O M ammonium sulphate, pH 6 - 7, or 0.8 M citrate, pH 7 - 10 at 20C. These crystals are of the monoclinic space group C2 and show reflections up to 0.12 nm resolution.
Very frequently the crystals are dis- ordered, characterized by a very large mosaic spread. Also the cell constants varied slightly from crystal to crystal.
The cell constants of the first crystal, from which most of the data have been collected, are a = 4.429 nm, b = 2.1 15 nm, c = 4.405 nm, /3 = 107". There is one molecule in the asym- metric unit corresponding to a very dense packing, characterized by the volume per unit molecular mass of 0.0017 nm3/Da. Crystals from one batch showed a different kind of disorder namely a superstructure, which corresponds 388 number of reflections expected in the resolution range to 0.15 nm, was 0.035.

The Patterson search functions The orientation of the molecule in the monoclinic cell was solved using Patterson search methods and programs previously described [lo]. The positioning of the correctly oriented molecule was achieved in reciprocal space using a Translation Function program written by E. Lattman and based on the algorithm of Crowther and Blow 1111.

Fig. 1. Monoclinic crystals of ( A )  OMSVP3 and ( B )  OMTKY3 to an exact triplication of the unit cell along the a axis. This property may also explain the slight variability in the cell constants of different crystals.
This variability lowered the quality of the data and restricted the resolution limit of the collected data to some extent. 
Monoclinic crystals isomorphous with the OMSVP3 crystals, but of smaller size, have also been obtained from the third domain of the turkey ovomucoid (OMTKY3) (Fig. 1 B) in 0.9 M citrate, pH 7 - 9, or in 1.2 M ammonium sulphate, pH 6, at 20C.
Unfortunately these crystals are more fre- quently disordered than the isomorphous OMSVP3 crystals thus impairing a structure analysis. In addition, from 1 M citrate, pH 10, different plate-like crystals of orthorhombic space group P2,212 could be grown from OMTKY3 with cell constants a = 8.2 nm, b = 7.9 nm, c = 3.3 nm.
Because these crystals presumably contain four molecules per asymmetric unit, corresponding to a packing density of 0.00224 nm3 Da, they seemed not suitable for a comparison of the OMSVP3 and OMTKY3 molecules and were not considered for structure analysis. 
Data collection X-ray intensity data have been collected on a modified Siemens AED diffractometer using 0 - 2 0  scan with focus-to- crystal and crystal-to-detector distances of 30 cm each.
The data were corrected for absorption by an empirical method [9]. One large crystal enabled the collection of a complete data set to 0.18 nm resolution, which after scaling and merging had an R factor of 0.026 ( R  = CIIhj - ( z ) h l / Z z h j ,  where z h j  is the intensity of thejth individual measurement and (I),, the average value of reflexion h ;  the summation is over all reflexions h).

Additional data in the range between 0.18 nm and 0.15 nm were collected with three smaller crystals, which differed slightly in the cell parameters. The final Rmerge for 4837 inde- pendent reflections, corresponding to 75% of the total Crystallographic refinernen t In order to define the position of the molecule more accu- rately, refinement started as rigid-body refinement.
By means of the program CORELS [I21 positional and rotational parameters were allowed to vary. Afterwards restrained crys- tallographic refinement (EREF, reciprocal-space refinement in conjunction with energy minimization) was used [I 31.
The resolution was stepwise increased when the model improved to finally 0.15 nm. In order to correct the model between successive refinement stages Fourier maps with coefficients (2[Fo[ -IF,[) were inspected in a Vector General graphics dis- play system using the program system FRODO [14].

Accessible surface areas were calculated according to Lee and Richards [15] using a program written by Levitt and setting the radius of the molecular probe to 0.14nm. This program was also used to search for possible hydrogen bonds. Comparisons between different molecules were performed using a least-squares program, which minimizes the deviation of common atoms.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION PATTERSON SEARCH The molecue used for the calculation of the rotation func- tion has been the refined structure of molecule 3 of OMJPQ3. 
It has been changed as follows: the N-terminal residues (1 - 7) were excluded, because this segment is incorporated in a p channel formed by the four molecules in the asymmetric unit [22].
The side chains of OMJPQ3 which are not in common with OMSVP3 residues [17-19, 23, 32, 511 were truncated to alanines. For the calculation of the model Patterson map, structure factors were calculated with the changed OMJPQ3 molecule placed in a large cubic unit cell (a = 5 nm) with P1  symmetry in order to eliminate intermolecular vectors.
A model Patterson map was calculated with data from 0.7 nm to 0.3 nm resolution and grid spacings of 0.1 nm. An overall temperature factor of 0.18 nm2 was applied in the structure factor calculations.
The 1500 highest peaks were selected within a radial shell between 0.3 nm and 1 nm. The crystal Patterson synthesis was also calculated with data from 0.7 nm to 0.3 nm resolution (1370 triclinic structure factors) and the same grid spacings.
The product correlation function of the experimental and the model Pattreson map was calculated as a function of the orientation angles for the range Y = (0, 360), 0 = (0, 180) and @ = (0, 180), first in steps of 5" and subsequently at 1". 
In this angular system Y is the rotation about the z axis, @ is the rotation about the new x axis and 0 is the rotation about the resultant y axis.
The three highest peaks in the correlation function were 5.7 CT above the mean at (1 lo", 5", 35"), 4.7 CJ at (195", 145", 165"), and 4.0 CJ at (270", 35", 45"). A subsequent 389 - u  I Fig. 2. Harker section through the translationfunction of OMSVP3 at v = o  fine scan around the highest peak resulted in the solution (Il l",  6", 31.5").

The positioning of the correctly oriented molecule was then achieved in reciprocal space using the Translation Func- tion programs written by E. Lattman. These programs are based on the algorithm of Crowther and Blow [ll], i.e. the intramolecular vectors are subtracted from the crystal Patterson function in order to improve the contrast. Data from 1.0 nm to 0.3 nm were used, an overall temperature factor of 0.18 nm2 was applied in the structure factor calculations.
In space group C2 the origin can be chosen freely along the y axis. The vector set generated from molecules at equivalent positions (x, y, z) and (-x, y, -z) was searched in the Harker section at v = 0.
Only one very prominent peak at u = 0.32 nm, w = 1.178 nm (Fig. 2) was obtained, which represented the correct solution. The next highest peak was substantially lower with 4.3 0.
Structure factors were calculated for the appropriately rotated and translated coordinate set. The corresponding conventional R value, defined as CllFoI - ~ F c ~ ~ / A ~ F o ~  was 0.477 in the resolution range 0.7-0.31 nm for this solution.

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC REFINEMENT The three rotational and two positional parameters were further refined, applying the rigid-body reciprocal-space refinement program CORELS [12] using data between 0.6 nm and 0.35-nm resolution. This led to angular shifts at 0.4", 0.7", and 3.9" and translations of about 0.02 nm in the x direction and 0.01 nm in the z direction.
The R value for data between 0.7 nm and 0.31 nm dropped to 0.393. 
The resulting atomic model was subjected to several cycles of EREF refinement.
At different stages the molecular conformation had to be corrected manually using FRODO. 
Initially the N-terminal heptapeptide and the side-chain atoms of residues exchanged between OMJPQ3 and OMSVP3 did not contribute to the calculated structure factors.
The resolu- tion was increased stepwise to 0.25 nm. 
From stage 2 to stage 4 the substituted amino acids as well as the N terminus were activated and fitted to the appropriate electron density distribution.
15 water molecules, identified in difference Fourier maps, were introduced at stereochemically reasonable positions. The temperature factors averaged for each amino acid, saparately for main-chain and side-chain atoms, were fixed to the same values found in the OMJPQ3 molecule and not refined.

From stage 5 to stage 8 the resolution was increased to 0.15 nm. Individual isotropic temperature factors were refined and averaged separately over main-chain and side-chain atoms.
At the end of the refinement 31 water molecules had been introduced as identified in difference Fourier maps. They all occupy stereochemically reasonable positions and make hydrogen bonds to polar groups of the inhibitor molecule (Table 1).
The final overall temperature factor is 0.21 nm2 reflecting in part the relatively high crystai lattice defects. The final R values (calculated with a rejection ratio (21Fo-Fc[/ IFo+ FcI) 2 1.2) are: 0,177 for the resolution range 0.7- 0.203 nm; 0.186 for 0.7-0.183 nm; 0.199 for 0.7-0.15 nm.

The final difference Fourier map has no interpretable features. 
QUALITY AND ACCURACY O F  THE MODEL Bond lengths and bond angles of the refined model are close to ideal values; the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations are 0.0016 nm and 2.3", respectively.
deviation of the torsional angle o from the minimum energy value is 7.3". 
For the torsion angles, which define the planarity of aromatic rings, the r.m.s. deviation is 3.4". Table 3 gives a list of all torsional angles in order to allow an independent assessment of the refinement results.

MOLECULAR CONFORMATION AND COMPARISON O F  OMSVP3 WITH OMJPQ3, PSTI AND OMTKY3 OMSVP3 and OMJPQ3 As pointed out above, the packing of the OMSVP3 molecules is extremely tight (0.0017 nm3/Da). The cor- responding value for the tetragonal OMJPQ3 crystals is 0.0028 nm3/Da [2].
As a consequence, the OMSVP3 molecule is engaged in many intermolecular contacts (1 57 interactions, including 14 hydrogen bonds, of distances below 0.4 nm) dis- tributed over the whole surface. In addition, 16 of the 31 localized water molecules mediate intermolecular contacts.

These interactions clearly affect the conformation and the degree of flexibility of segments on the surface of the molecule, as outlined below. The comparison with the four independent OMJPQ3 molecules indicates, however, that these effects are not larger than normal.
The high overall temperature factor of this OMSVP3 structure is only apparently in disagreement with the tight packing and the high resolution of the ob- servable reflections. A major contribution to it originates from the large lattice disorder of the crystals, manifested by the variations of the crystal cell.

The primary structures of the OMSVP3 and OMJPQ3 inhibitors are homologous. Only at six positions do amino acid substitutions occur (OMSVP3/0MJPQ3) : 17, Thr/Pro; 18, Met/Lys; 19, Glu/Asp; 23, Leu/Val; 32, Gly/Ser and 51, Ser/Asn.
As has been shown be solvent accessibility calculations and can also be deduced from Fig. 3, the side chains of the first three of these residues, which are part of the extended binding loop, are mainly exposed to the solvent, as is the case for residue 51. In contrast, the side chains of residue 23 and residue 32, which are part of the B-pleated sheet Table 1.

Ser 5 N  0.33 ASP ASP or positioned at the N terminus of the a helix respectively, are mainly buried. It is therefore not surprising that the spatial structures of OMSVP3 and OMJPQ3 are quite similar.

This is also documented by Fig. 4, where their peptide chains, represented by their a-carbon atoms, are overlaid. 
Only the N-terminal segments up to Asp-7 are in completely different conformations, and larger deviations are present at Glu-10, residue 17, and in the loop from Val-42 to Thr-47, i.e. C-terminal of the a helix.
A comparison of all backbone atoms (N, C@, C", C, 0), if one omits these 15 residues, yields a r.m.s. deviation of 0.037 nm. This value differs only slightly from the values derived for the four non-equivalent molecules of OMJPQ3 [3].
Therefore, the qualitative description of the OMJPQ3 structure, as given by these authors, remains valid also for the OMSVP3 molecule. 
An obvious reason for the structural difference of the N- terminal segments up to Glu-10 is the involvement of Leu- 1 to Asp-7 of OMJPQ3 in an intermolecular four-stranded /?channel formed with the N-terminal segments of neighbouring molecules [2].
The corresponding segment of OMSVP3, which has an identical sequence, is fully defined by electron density and runs close to the molecular surface of 391 Table 2. Course of refinement of the OMSVP3 inhibitor molecule Energy refinement, combined with diagonal matrix least-squares refinement.

It might be further stabilized by a few intermolecular contacts. Mediated by solvent molecules 1 14 and 128 the backbone atoms of Ala-3 and Val-4 are linked through hydrogen bonds to Leu-50.
Only from Val-4 on there are direct intramolecular van der Waals contacts with the main molecular body. The main and side-chain atoms of seg- ment 7 - 17 exhibit quite high temperature factors in OMSVP3 (Fig. 5).
Relatively high flexibility in this segment is also observed in three of the four independent OMJPQ3 molecules. In addition, at Glu-10 all four independent OMJPQ3 molecules deviate considerably from one another.

Clearly, flexibility and displacements observed in this segment in OMSVP3 and OMJPQ3 are both due to its weak in- tramolecular contacts with the main body of the molecule. 
On both sides of this loop are highly conserved cystine bridges (8 - 38 and 16 - 39,  which certainly assist in arresting this segment, but which are themselves affected by quite high temperature factors.

The considerable deviations at residue 17, observed be- tween OMSVP3 and OMJPQ3, can be explained by the sub- stitution of a proline by a less constraining threonine. In spite of this replacement the main-chain conformational angles around the active site are rather similar in both molecules (Table 4) certainly because of common steric requirements for protease binding.

a-Carbon drawing o fOMSVP3 (solid line) overlaid with PSTZ (open line). For OMSVP3 the disulphide bridges are also drawn OMSVP3 the side chain of Met-I8 is fully defined by electron density, presumably due to intermolecular contacts made by its distal C& and S6 atoms with side-chain atoms of Glu-10 of a symmetry-related molecule.
These van der Waals contacts would necessarily have to be different upon a replacement of the methionine by a leucine residue as present in O W K Y 3  and should be responsible for the slightly different crystalliza- tion behaviour of the latter. 
The substitution of the internal Val-23 (OMJPQ3) by a leucine residue causes surprisingly small effects.
Its side chain is close to, but not in direct van der Waals contact with residues Gly-32 and Ser-51 (OMJPQ3: Ser-32, Asn-51). The position of the hydroxyl group of Ser-32 in OMJPQ3 is in OMSVP3 occupied by an internal solvent molecule, Sol-131, which is placed in a cage surrounded by polar groups of the inhibitor (Table 1).

According to main-chain geometry and hydrogen-bond distances, the a helix stretches from Asn-33 to Val-42 in OMJPQ3 (at least in molecules 2 -4; in the first molecule also Glu-43 could be partially involved in helix conformation) but to Ser-44 in OMSVP3. Only in OMSVP3, Val-42 to Asn-45 form a type-I reverse turn [16].
The turn formed by Ser-44 to Thr-47 is a type-I' reverse turn in both molecules. In spite of this identical geometry the residues including Glu-43 to Thr-47 deviate considerably in both molecular species, up to 0.26 nm at Gly-46 C".
This loop segment displays rather high B values in all four OMJPQ3 molecules, which might be a consequence of the disturbed hydrogen-bond system and vice versa. The conformational differences to OMSVP3 are difficult to explain as their sequences are identical in this region.
Owing to the relatively close spatial agreement within the four OMJPQ3 molecules on the one hand and between OMSVP3 and the complexed OMTKY3 (see below) on the other, the considerable deviations of segments 43 -47 in both ovomucoid species should be intrinsic properties and must result from the few amino acid substitutions (mainly residues 23 and 32) far away from this site. 
All possible intramolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrogen bonds to water molecules are listed in Table 1.
As discussed above, in OMSVP3 compared with OMJPQ3 there are two additional main-chain hydrogen bonds (Ala-40 0 -+ Ser- 44 N, and Val-42 0 + Asn-45 N); nearly all hydrogen bonds which involve side-chain atoms are common to both molecules, with only a few more occurring in OMSVP3.

deviation of 0.089 nm (if one excludes residues 1 - 13 and 40 -47). The stereo view of the overlaid C" atoms of both structures is shown in Fig. 6 using the transformation matrix obtained from a comparison of the Ca-atoms of residues 15- 33 (r.m.s. deviation 0.042 nm).
The N-terminal segments of both molecules up to residue 13 have quite different conformations. 
As fully discussed by Bolognesi et al. [6] these deviations are easily explainable by different intermolecular contacts (segment 1 - 7) and by an insertion and a cis-proline residue 394 L R 9 !T I8  6 4 .d '3 TI8 i; 4 Fig. 7. &-Carbon drawing of OMSVP3 (solid line) overlaid with OMTKY3 (open line).

Both structures diverge considerably from residue 37 to 48 and are similarly organized at the C-termini. 
The comparison of both molecules provides a good ex- ample for the general observation that in a given protein family the secondary structure elements themselves are highly conserved, whereas their relative orientation is more variable within certain limits.
Since the three-dimensional structures of OMSVP3 and OMJPQ3 are nearly identical, a detailed comparison of OMSVP3 and PSTI is not given. 
OMSVP3 and OMTKY3 OMSVP3 and OMTKY3 differ only in the PI residue 18, which is a methionine in OMSVP3, but a leucine in OMTKY3.

The thermodynamic and kinetic constants for interaction with proteases of both inhibitors have been determined and compared 1171. They are very similar, with a slight preference of chymotrypsin and elastase for leucine and of subtilisin for methionine at P1. 
A comparison of the three-dimensional structures of free OMSVP3 and OMTKY3 complexed with SGPB [4] yields a r.m.s.
deviation of 0.035 nm if all main-chain atoms (N, Cp, C", C, 0) except those of residues 1 - 9 are included. As shown in Fig. 7 both main-chain conformations are extremely similar.
The N-terminal segment up to Asp-7 is disordered in the OMTKY3-SGPA complex. As shown above this N terminus is ordered in OMSVP3 and stabilized by apparently weak intramolecular and intermolecular interactions.

Somewhat larger deviations slightly above the r.m.s. value are observed at the binding segment around residue 18. This is more accurately visible in Fig. 8, where the binding segments 13-21 and 31 -36 of OMTKY3 (which are in contact with SGPB) and of OMSVP3 are overlaid.
Most obvious are the displacements of residue Thr-17 ( A  Cy, 0.12 nm; A OY, 0.08 nm), of main ( A  C", 0.06 nm) and side-chain atoms of residue 18 ( A  Cp,  0.14 nm; A Cy, 0.21 nm), of the side chain of Glu-19 ( A  Cp, 0.07 nm; d Cy, 0.1 nm; A C6, 0.09 nm; A OE, 0.09 nm and 0.12 nm) and of the side chains of Tyr-20 and Arg-21. Also the main chain deviates significantly, especially at residue 18 and (3111-19, as can be seen in Fig. 8 and quantitatively derived from Table 4.
It is interesting to note that the B values of the main-chain atoms of residues P2 to P1' in the OMTKY3-SGPB complex are considerably below the overall B value [4], but equal or above it in the free OMSVP3 structure (Fig. 5) .  A similar observation has been made with the trypsinogen-PSTI complex [6].
This supports the idea that the reactive sites of (ovomucoid) inhibitors are not the most rigid parts of these molecules but rather possess just the flexibility necessary to adapt to the substrate-binding sites of slightly different serine proteinases. 
Also the carbonyl groups of residues 18, i.e. of the scissile peptide bonds, differ considerably in their orientation, again as a consequence of the specific binding of the oxygen in the oxyanion binding-hole of the enzyme.
It is interesting to observe that the carbonyl groups of Glu-19 are almost 395 congruent in both molecules and those of Thr-17 similarly oriented. As had been first proposed for the OMJPQ3 structure [3] and also suggested by its strong conservation in the Kazal inhibitor family [18].
Asn-33 acts as a spacer be- tween the primary binding segment and the central parts of the molecule. Its side-chain amide nitrogen donates to the carbonyl groups of Thr-17 and Glu-19 hydrogen bonds, which help to fix the conformation at P1.
Rigidity may oppose efficient cleavage of the scissile peptide bond IS]. 
As mentioned above and shown in Fig. 8, also the side chains of Glu-19, Tyr-20, Arg-21, Lys-34 and Asn-36 are displaced in OMSVP3 compared with OMTKY3.
This may be a consequence of protease binding of OMTKY3. Owing to common shift components of both side chains upon complex formation, one of both carboxylate oxygens of Glu-19 is hydrogen bonded to the OY atom of Thr-17 in the free in- hibitor as well as in the complex.
Presumably stabilized by this hydrogen bond, the same Glu-19 carboxylate oxygen of the complexed Oh4TKY3 is further involved in a hydrogen bond formed with the amide nitrogen of the same residue [5]. 
A similar intra-residue, but stereochemically likewise un- favourable hydrogen bond is also observed in OMJPQ3 for the homologous aspartate residue 19 and may impair the rehybridization at this P1' amide nitrogen assumed to be stereochemically required for the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate [19].
In fact residue 19 is restricted, in the overwhelming majority of avian ovomucoid third domains sequenced to date, to glutamic and aspartic acid. It is, how- ever, replaced by non-carboxylic amino acids in other Kazal inhibitors, which could not make such an intra-residue hydrogen bond (see e.g. [3]).
In our free OMSVP3 molecule, the distance between Glu-19 0" and N is too long for a hydrogen bond. Its formation in the course of complexation might be due to exclusion of bulk water in free OMSVP3 (the localized Sol-123 binds to the remaining Glu-19 carboxylate oxygen) and the approach of other inhibitor and enzyme groups [5 ] .
 The other conformational changes occurring in the bind- ing region (Tyr-20, Arg-21, Asn-36) are likewise explained by the interaction of these inhibitor groups with the enzyme. 
As also emphasized by the isomorphous crystallization of OMSVP3 and OMTKY3, the conformational differences be- tween these closely related molecules are extremely small and certainly much smaller than the changes occurring upon enzyme binding.
Thus, the results of these crystallographic studies provide quantitative structural information that the construction of a sequence to reactivity algorithm for protein proteinase inhibitors is possible [17].
