Biochemistry 1993, 32, 5145-51 50 5145 Interaction of Barnase with Its Polypeptide Inhibitor Barstar Studied by Protein Engineering7 Gideon Schreiber and Alan R. Fersht' MRC Unit for Protein Function and Design, Cambridge Centre for Protein Engineering, Medical Research Council Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 2QH, U.K. Received October 26, 1992; Revised Manuscript Received February 15, 1993 ABSTRACT: Barnase, an extracellular ribonuclease of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, forms a very tight complex with its intracellular polypeptide inhibitor barstar. At pH 8, the values for the rate constants kl (association) and k-1 (dissociation) are 6.0 X lo8 s-l M-l and 8.0 X lo4 s-l, respectively.
The value of Ki, the dissociation constant of barstar and barnase, calculated from the ratio k-l/kl is 1.3 X 10-14 M, which corresponds to a AG of -18.9 kcal/mol a t  25 OC. The dissociation constant increases with decreasing pH according to the ionization of an acid in free barnase of pK, 6.4, with very weak, if any, binding to the protonated form.

This pH dependence for dissociation of the complex can be attributed almost entirely to residue His102 in barnase, as determined by a HislOZ-.Ala mutation. Analysis of the pH dependence of the kinetic constants indicates that binding is, a t  least, a two-step process.
The value of Ki increases to 2.4 X lo-" M in the presence of 500 mM NaC1, and to 1.6 X 10-l1 M at  pH 5 (100 mM NaC1). The binding site of barstar on bafnase was mapped by measuring the values of Ki for a broad range of site-specific mutants of barnase.
Mutagenesis of residues Lys27, Arg59, Arg87, and His102 to Ala increases the values of Ki by a factor of lo4. The structures of some 15 protease-polypeptide inhibitor complexes, for example, that depend on such interactions have been solved by X-ray crystallography [reviewed by Janin and Chothia (1990)l.
In this paper, we initiate an investigation of the interactions between an RNase (barnase) and its polypeptide inhibitor (barstar) by protein engineering. 
Barnase, an extracellular ribonuclease of Bacillus amylo- liquefaciens, consists of 110 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 12 382.
The gene has been cloned and the protein overexpressed (Paddon & Hartley, 1987;Serranoet al., 1990). 
The crystal and 2D 'H NMR solution structures of barnase have been solved (Mauguen et al., 1982; Bycroft et al., 1991).
The secondary structure of the protein comprises three a-helices at the N-terminal portion and five antiparallel @-stands at the C-terminal portion of the protein. The active site of barnase contains two residues that serve as general acid-base catalysts, Glu73 and His 102.
Arg87 binds to thesubstrate phosphategroup (Baudet & Janin, 1991; Meiering et al., 1991), and Lys27 stabilizes the substrate phosphate group in the transition state (Mossakowska et al., 1989). The loop between residues 56 and 62 serves as a recognition loop for substrates (Baudet & Janin, 1991; Day et al., 1992).
It has been used previously in this laboratory for extensive protein engineering studies of protein stability and protein folding pathways. The solution structure of this protein is currently being solved in this laboratory (M. Lubienski, D. N. M. Jones, and M. Bycroft, unpublished results).
The equilibrium constant of the complex G.E.S. is an EMBO postdoctoral fellow, 1992. 0006-2960/93/0432-5 145%04.00/0 was estimated to be M (Mariani et al., 1992). The aim of the present study is to map by protein engineering methods the residues of barnase that are responsible for binding and to determine their relative energetic contributions.
This has entailed measuring by rapid reaction and other techniques the association and dissociation rate constants for thecomplex between wild-type barstar and mutants of barnase. 
Solutions were prepared using double-distilled water made by an Elgastat UPH. Protein Expression and Purification.
All barnase mutations used in this work have been described (Mossakowska et al., 1989; Loewenthal et al., 1991; Meiering et al., 1992). Barstar was purified from BL21- (pLysE)(pMLZbs) cells, as described by D. N. M. Jones, M. Bycroft, M. J. Lubienski, A. R. Fersht (unpublished results).

[3H] Barstar was prepared by [3H]leucine labeling of BL21- (pLysE)(pMLZbs) cells grown in (-Leu) MOPS medium supplemented with all amino acids except leucine. Excitation was at 280 nm (slit width 2 nm), and emission was monitored at3 15-650 nm (slit width 8 nm).
The fluorescence spectra of barnase, barstar, and the barnasebarstar complex upon excitation at 280 nm are shown in Figure 1. Barnase, which contains three tryptophans, has a fluorescence spectrum with a maximum of fluorescence at 337 nm.

Integration of the fluorescence between 3 15 and 650 nm, which is the emission spectrum measured by the stopped-flow machine used in these experiments, shows that the fluorescence of the complex is about 20% lower than the fluorescence of its components.
Stopped-flow kinetic mea- surements were made at 25 C on an Applied Photophysics Bio Sequential DX-17MV. In each experiment, 400 data points were recorded over the course of the reaction, and 10 runs were averaged.

We monitored the fluorescence decrese accompanying the binding of barstar to barnase under second-order conditions, in which the initial concentrations of both proteins were equal (0.25 pM). The association is effectively irreversible at these concentrations: Le., [E] + [I] - [E-I], where [E] is the barnase concentration, [I] the barstar concentration, and [EsI] the complex concentration.
The analytical solution for second- order conditions, where [Elo = [ I ~ o ,  is (1) (Fersht, 1985). The rate constant kl is calculated by fitting the data to the equation: 1/([EIo - W I )  - 1/IEIo = klt F = Fo + AFIE]:klt/(l + [E],k,t) (2) where F is the fluorescence at time t, FO is the fluorescence at t = 0, AF is the total change in fluorescence divided by protein concentration, and t is the time.
The dissociation rate constant for the barnase-barstar complex was obtained by forming a complex of [3H]barstar-barnase (5 pM each) in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8, and chasing off the labeled barstar with 50 pM unlabeled barstar. Dissociation rates were monitored by the disappearance of [3H]bar~tar from the complex with time after the addition of unlabeled barstar to the reaction mix.

[3H]Bar~tar was separated from [3H]bar~tar in the complex with barnase by loading 15 pL of the reaction (which initially corresponds to about 500 cpm) on a small anion-exchange column (DE52) where [3H] barstar-barnase elutes at 100 mM NaCl (at pH 8), while [3H]bar~tar remains bound to the column. The amount of [3H] barstar in complex with barnase is proportional to the cpm of the elute, which was counted in a scintillation counter for 10 min.
The dissociation rate constant was determined by plotting the residual quantity of [3H]bar~tar in the complex against the time at which the A 31 5-650nm integration (R87A)Barnase Barstar + (W35F)Barnase 16680 (W35F)Barnase Barstar + (R87A)Barnase 19105 50  0 1 , 1 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 nm FIGURE 2: Fluorescence spectra between 3 15 and 650 nm of different barnase mutants in complex with barstar.

The dissociation rate constant (k-1) was calculated from first-order kinetics: A = AA exp(-k-,t) + C (3) where A is the quantity of [3H]barstar which is in complex with barnase at time t, AA is the amplitude of the change in A, and Cis the offset. In using this equation, we assume that [3H] barstar becomes completely substituted by the unlabeled barstar in the complex that was added in large excess at time zero.
This equation can be used because k-l<< kl [barnase], so that we can assume the reaction is [3H]barstar-barnase + barstar - barstar-barnase + [3H]bar~tar where the disso- ciation rate constant (k-1) is rate-limiting. Measuring dissociation by separating [3H] barstar-barnase from unbound [ 3H] barstar (as described before) is possible only when off rate constants are lower than 5 X lo-* s-l.
When dissociation rate constants are greater than this, we had to employ a different system for dissociation measurements that uses stopped-flow kinetics. 
We found (Figure 2A,B) that the fluorescence of Arg87-Ala (or His102-Ala) barnase in complex with barstar plus the fluorescence of unbound Trp35-Phe barnase (between 3 15 and 650 nm which is the emission measured by the stopped- flow machine) is lower than the fluorescence of Trp35-Phe barnase in complex with barstar plus unbound Arg87-Ala (or His102-Ala) barnase.
These were then mixed in the stopped-flow chamber with 5 pM Trp35-Phe barnase [which is used to chase off Arg87-Ala (or H 102A) from barstar].

Solutions of the two proteins (0.5 pM each) in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8, were mixed in a stopped-flow fluorometer, and the change with time of the emission fluorescence (315-650 nm) was recorded. 
RESULTS Barnase and barstar form a very tight complex, with an equilibrium constant Ki of approximately 10-14 M (Mariani et al., 1992).
Measurements of equilibrium constants of this magnitude are difficult to measure directly; it is simpler to calculate them from the "on" and "off" rates of the complex (Ki = kl/k-l). The measurement of the "on" rate of the complex was done by monitoring the change in fluorescence with time after mixing barstar with barnase.
We monitored the fluorescence decrease accom- panying the binding of barstar to barnase, under second-order conditions, in which the initial concentrations of both proteins are equal (0.25 NM). The kl value, which was calculated from eq 2 (see Experimental Procedures), was found to be 6.0 X lo8 s-l M-l.
Wild-type complex formation was monitored also in pseudo-first-order conditions, which gave a similar association rate constant (data not shown). Second-order kinetics were preferred for this work because of better signal to noise ratio, compared to pseudo-first-order kinetics.

[3H]Bar~tar was chased off its complex with barnase by a 10-fold excess of unlabeled barstar, and the quantity of [3H]- barstar in the complex with barnase was measured. Figure 4 shows the decrease of [3H] barstar-barnase concentration plotted against time, from which the dissociation constant was calculated by fitting the data to a simple exponential equation.
The equilibrium constant ofthe complex is, therefore, Ki = k ~ / k - ~  = 1.3 X 10-14 M (AG = -18.9 f 0.15 kcal/mol). At 500 mM NaC1, the association rate constant is 40 times lower (1.6 X lo7 s-1 M-l) and the dissociation constant 5 times higher (4 X M-l) than in the absence of salt (Figure 5 ) .
Even a low salt concentration of 100 mM NaCl reduces the binding energy by 1.4 kcal/mol (kl = 1.1 X lo8 s-1 M-l, kl = 1.5 X le5 s-l). The pH dependence of association and dissociation rate constants of the barnase-barstar complex was measured between pH 4.5 and 9 in 10 mM buffer (sodium acetate for pH 4.5 and 5 ,  Biochemistry, Vol. 32, No. 19, 1993 5147 6.0 I I 0.0 ' I I I 0.0 5.0 1 o5 1.0 106 1.5 lo6 Time (s) FIGURE 4: Dissociation rate constant (kl) of the barnase-barstar complex.

Addition of 100 mM NaCl to the buffer was necessary to eliminate the tendency of barstar to precipitate at pH values below pH 6. The association rate constant varies only slightly in the pH range 5-9 and so appears independent of buffer used.
The dissociation rate constant increases by almost 100-fold from pH 7 to 5 ,  to a value of 1.2 X s-l. The plot of log Ki against pH has a slope of -1 down to pH 5 ,  with no evidence of leveling off. At pH 5 (100 mM NaCl), AG = -14.7 kcal/ mol (compara with -17.4 kcal/mol in 100 mM NaC1, pH pH-Dependent Effects on Dissociation Rates of the BarnaseeBarstar Complex May Be Attributed Mainly to His102 in Barnase.
Table I shows the dissociation rateconstantsof thewild-typecomplexand of the HislO2-Ala barnase-barstar complex, in a pH range from 4.5 to 9. Whereas the dissociation rate constants increase by almost 100-fold when the pH of the solution is lowered from 7 to 5 for the complex of barstar with wild-type barnase, the dissociation rate constant of the (HislO2-Ala) barnase-barstar complex increases by less than a factor of 2. The PKa for His102 in barnase in complex with barstar can be calculated by normalizing the pH dependence of wild-type barnase to that of the Hisl02-Ala mutant.
The Ki(assn) for the wild-type enzymenormalized to that for HislO2-Ala fits to a theoretical ionization curve of an acid of PKa 6.4 f 0.3 in the free enzyme, which corresponds to the conjugate acid of the active-site Hisl02.

Amino acid residues in barnase that take part in binding barstar were identified by measuring association and dissociation rate constants of barstar from different barnase mutants, in the same way as for wild- type barnase (except dissociation rates of His102-Ala and Arg87-Ala; see Experimental Procedures). 
The following mutations were introduced into barnase for measuring barstar binding: a-helix2 (residues 26-34), Tyr26+His, Lys27-Ala, Gln3 l-Ala; loop2 (residues 35- 40), Trp35-Ala; @-strand, (residues 50-55), Asp54-Ala; loop3 (residues 56-59), Phe56-Ala, Asn58-Ala, Arg- 59-Ala, G l u 6 e A l a ;  @-strand2 (residues 70-76), Glu- 73-Ala; loop4 (residues 77-84), Tyr79-Va1, Asn84-Ala; @-strand3 (residues 85-9 l), Arg87-Ala; and loops (residues 100-105), His102-Ala, Tyrl03+Phe, Glnl04-Ala (seealso Figure 7).
The association and dissociation rate constants for the barnase mutants and barstar (Table 11) were used to calculate the binding energies (AG) and AAG, which is the difference between AG of the wild-type complex and the mutant complex. Three of them are located in the active site of barnase (Lys27, Arg87, and Hisl02), and the fourth (Arg59) is located in the recognition loop of the enzyme.
Substitution of each of these four amino acids by alanine results in a decrease of AAG of 5-6 kcal/mol. 
Most of the effect on binding is seen in the dissociation rate constant, which increases by a factor of up to 2.8 X lo4 for the His102+Ala mutation (to k-1 = 0.22 s-l).

Despite the magnitude of the changes in the dissociation rate constant being much larger than the changes in the association rate constant, we find a consistent change in the association rate constant of the complex.
These mutations results in an even faster association rate constant of (1.8-4.5) X lo9 s-l M-I, compared with 6 X lo8 s-l M-I for wild-type complex formation. The association rate constant of these mutants approaches the theoretical calculated diffusion rate, which is 7 x 109 s-I M-I at 25 OC (Fersht, 1985).
A second group of mutations consists of two basic residues, which were changed to neutral ones (Lys27-Ala and Arg59-Ala). 
The Ki of the complex is 1.3 X l O - I 4  M, which gives a standard free energy of binding of 18.9 kcal/mol at 25 O C .
 The association rate constant of the wild-type complex is 6.0 X lo8 s-l M-I, which is close to the diffusion limit. The binding reaction, which is monitored by the change in fluorescence, follows simple second-order kinetics over the concentration ranges examined.
The dissociation rate constant of the wild- type complex is 8 X 1 V  s-I. The association rate constant of barstar with barnase is approximately constant over the pH range of 4.5-9, but the dissociation rate constant increases by a factor of almost 100 when the pH of the solution is lowered from 7 to 5 .  The association constant fits to an ionization curve of pKa 6.4 i 0.3 in the free enzyme, with tight binding to the basic form of the ionizing group, and undetectable weak binding to theacid form.
The dissociation rate constant of the complex between the mutant His102+Ala and barstar changes only slightly with changes of pH, thus confirming that it is the ionization of His1 02 that is responsible for the pH dependence of binding. The pH dependence of the binding constant of barstar with barnase at an ionic strength of 100 mM fits to a pKa of 6.4 for His102 in the free enzyme.
The value of Ki increases linearly with decreasing pH at low pH with a slope close to 1, with no indication of leveling off at pH 5 (Table I). 
The pKa of His102 in the barnase-barstar complex is thus ((5. The following thermodynamic cycle (Scheme I) holds for the simplest scheme (where B is for barnase and B* is for barstar).
The upper part of the cycle represents the unprotonated form of His102 in barnase, which hzs h dissociation constant of Ki = 0.13 pM (at pH 8 in the presence of 100 mM NaCI). The lower part represents the protonated form, which has a dissociation constant of Ki > 16 pM. k l  and k: are the association rate constants of the Yencountern complexes B-B* and BH+-B* for the unprotonated and protonated form.
These are pH-independent with a rate constant of 108 s-I M-I. k- ,  and kf, are the dissociation rate constants for the encounter complexes, where k-l = 0.4kT, (in order to maintain the equilibrium of the left box). The rate-determining step (rds) is for encounter complex formation, which is the observed second- order rate constant.

Scheme I Kf-0.13 pM B + B '  . - B - B '  BH* + B' - - BH+ - B' Kl >>is pM This cycle implies pH dependencies of the rate constants for association (kl) and dissociation (k-I) that conflict with the observed data. The value of k-1 should be constant between pH 5 and 7 since the complex does not change its ionization state.
Yet the opposite is found; kl varies little with pH, and k-1 varies according to the ionization of an acid in a barnase-barstar complex of pKa 6.8. We can assume this because the contribution of His102 in barnase to the disso- ciation constant k-l of the complex represents a single ionization in a complex which fits the equation k-l(wt)/ k-l(H102A) = [H]o+ pKa/([H]+ + pKa) [seep 161 of Fersht (1985)l.
In this, the observed second-order rateconstant for formation of the complex is that for the formation of an "encounter" complex that has a PKa of 6.8 for HislO2. In (4) the reverse reaction, the rate-determining step is the release of B* from either the B.B* or the BH+-B* complex, the observed rate constant for that from BH+.B* being by far the greater.

Is it valid to calculate Ki from the ratio of kon and k,n? It is certainly valid for a simple one-step reaction from the principle of microscopic reversibility. In theory, the existence of more than one step in binding should give multiple relaxation times in the kinetics.
In practice, 5 150 Biochemistry, Vol. 32, No. 19, I993 only one major phase is frequently observed in the stopped- flow and slower time scales because one phase either is too fast or does not generate a signal because the amplitude is too small. Consider the extreme case, which is close to that observed here, where the initial association appears to berate- determining as it is close to the diffusion rate.
The second- order rate constant for association is kl, and the observed rate constant for dissociation is k-lk-2/k2, so that the ratio of koff/ kon = k-lk-z/klkz = Ki. This will hold for a scheme with a large number of sequential intermediates where kl is clearly the rate-determining step in one direction, and k-1 in the other.

Consider Figure 8 where kl is only partly rate-determining, so that the second-order rate constant kon = klkz/(k-~+ k2). 
The kinetics of the off reaction will have two phases: a fast one for the interconversion of the complexes and a slow term that is one measured by the chase experiment.
The chase willhavearateconstant kOffgivenbyk-lk-2/(k-l + k2).Again, the ratio of kofffkon = k-lk-2/kl/k2. The presence of 500 mM NaCl decreases the association rate constant by a factor of 40, and increases the dissociation rate constant by Sfold, so that at 500 mM NaCl Ki = 2.4 X 10-l2 M. Electrostatic interactions between the two proteins are thus probably important in the formation of the encounter complex.
In the substrate recognition loop of barnase, we made changes of Asp54+Ala, Phe56+Ala, Ser57+Ala, AsnSfl-Ala, Arg59+Ala, and Glu6O-Ala. The largest change in binding is found for the mutation Arg59-Ala, where AAG increases by 5.2 kcal/ mol. Arg59 was found to interact with the guanine base of the substrate in the crystal structure of barnase, but not with a d(GpC) substrate on barnase, which is bound nonproduc- tively (Baudet & Janin 1991).
It forms hydrogen bonds with Leu63 and Lys62 which stabilize the guanine-binding loop (Sevcik et al., 1990). 
It is possible that the change in binding energy due to the A s n S b A l a  mutation is a result of the disruption of the loop and not to the interaction of Am58 with barstar.

The deletion mutations Lys27+Ala, Arg87+Ala, and HislOZ+Ala were found to decrease the binding energy substantially. Lys27, the side chain of which points into the active site, was found to stabilize the substrate phosphate group in the transition state of the enzyme (Meiering et al., 1992).
The mutations Lys27-+Ala and HislOZ-Ala were found to be nondisruptive (Meiering et al., 1991), with the structures of the mutants being very similar to that of wild-type barnase. In the deletion mutation Lys27-.Ala, the decrease in binding energy may be attributed to the removal of the positively-charged side chain, which might play a role in electrostatic interactions with barstar.
The mutation Arg87-Ala is a disruptive deletion, which generates structural changes in the polypeptide back- bone of residues 84-86, and in the structure of the active site (Meiering et al., 1991). It is not possible, therefore, to isolate the direct energetic contribution of this side chain to barstar binding from secondary effects that results from other structural changes induced by this mutation.

Schreiber and Fersht Despite the association rate constant for wild-type complex formation being very high, we found three barnase mutants that have even higher association rate constants with barstar, Asp54-.Ala, Glu60-.Ala, and Glu73-Ala. Conversely, we found a significant decrease in association rates for two mutations, Lys27-+Ala and Arg594Ala. 
The results of site-specific mutagenesis, as shown in this paper, show that barstar binds to the active site of barnase.

The binding of an inhibitor to the active site of a protein has been shown before for many of the proteinase inhibitors, as well as for the placental ribonuclease inhibitor (PRI; Lee & Vallee, 1989; Janin & Chothia, 1990). Interestingly, thesame mutations that we find to decrease binding are those found previously to decrease substantially the activity of barnase (Mossakowska et al., 1989), as well as to raise the dissociation rate constant of GpC from barnase (Meiering et al., 1991).

It may be hypothesized that some segment of barstar can enter the binding pocket of barnase, in the same manner as substrate, and block it sterically. This conclusion is strength- ened by barstar-barnasebinding studies employing hydrogen- deuterium exchange and chemical shift experiments (D. N. M. Jones, M. Bycroft, M. J. Lubienski, and A. R. Fersht, unpublished results).
The conclusions of that study are that the only residues found to form intramolecular bonds between barstar and the amide protons of barnase are located at the guanosine-binding loop or in the active-site loop of barnase. 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Dr. R. W. Hartley for supplying the original clone of barstar and for his continual encouragement and generosity in sending unpublished data.
