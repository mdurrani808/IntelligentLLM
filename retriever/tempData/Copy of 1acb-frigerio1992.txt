Eglin c is bound to the cognate enzyme through interactions involving 11 residues of the inhibitor (sites Ps-P4 in the reactive site loop, P,,, and P2s,) and 17 residues from chymotrypsin.
Binding of eglin c to the enzyme causes a contained hinge-bending movement around residues P4 and P4, of the inhibitor. The tertiary structure of chymotrypsin is little affectled, with the exception of the lo-13 region, where an ordered structure for the polypeptide chain is observed.
The overall binding mode is consistent with those found in other serine proteinase-protein-inhibitor complexes, including those from different inhibition families. Contained, but significant differences are observed in the establishment of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and polar interactions stabilizing the structure of the intact inhibitor, if the structure of eglin c in its complex with chymotrypsin is compared with that of other eglin c-serine proteinase complexes.

The interaction is parti- cularly tight and specific at the P,-S, sites, directly adjacent to the potentially scissile peptide bond of the inhibitor, on its carbonyl side (Schechter & Berger, 1967).
Residues from different positions in the (re)active site may contribute with diverse levels of specificity to the global interaction process. As a broad rule, however, the (pro)enzyme-inhibitor contact area is limited to residues of the (re)active site, with very limited contributions from the amino acid residues in the remaining part of the inhibitor polypeptide chain, which serves as a molecular scaf- folding for the active-site loop (Huber & Bode, 1978; Laskowski & Kato, 1980; Bolognesi et al., 1988; Creighton & Darby, 1989).

From a functional viewpoint, the serine- (pro)proteinase-inhibitor reaction is characterized by affinity constants which span about 11 orders of magnitude, according to the particular system con- sidered, and by very low kcat values, indicating that the reactive-site peptide bond is seldom cleaved (Empie & Laskowski, 1982; Laskowski et al., 1989). 
&Ioreover , measurements of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energy of binding show a low value for Al!l (0 to +5 kcal/mol: 1 cal = 4.184 J) for several systems investigated, whereas the value of AS is always positive and high (+30 to +60 entropy units: Amiconi et al., 1987, 1988; Ascenzi et aZ., 1988a,b,c).
The kinetics of enzyme-inhibitor association and dissociation processes have been investigated mostly in enzymes of the chymotrypsin family; these studies indicate that control of complex formation is exerted mainly by modulation of the dissociation rate constant (Ascenzi et al., 1988a,c). Thus, as a whole, serine proteinase-protein-inhibitor complex formation can be considered as a complex series of molecular events characterized and ruled by space and time component events.
Substantially different proper- ties, and possibly a different inhibition mechanism, have been reported recently for the protein protein- ase inhibitor hirudin, a potent inhibitor of thrombin, whose binding mode to the target proteinase occurs via two major regions, not involving direct contact with the proteinase active site (Griitter et al., 1990; Rydel et al., 1990). 
Eglin c (EGG?) is a thermostable serine proteinase t Abbreviations used: EGc, eglin c; CHT, a-chymotrypsin; Leu-proteinase, leucine-specific serine proteinase from spinach (X+~~cia oleracea L.) leaves; OMTKY3, third domain of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor; r.m.s.; root-mean-square.

Amino acid residues of CHT have been numbered by taking as a reference the bovine chymotrypsinogen A polypeptide chain (Hartley & Shotton, 1971). EGc numbering follows the convention adopted by Bolognesi et al. (1990); the suffix I has been added to the inhibitor residue numbers.
The inhibitor reactive-site and the enzyme active-site recognition subsites are referred to as I, . P,. and S s,-s,-s,A& . s,,, respectively, according to Schecter & Berger (1967).

protein inhibitor, isolated from the leech Hirudo medicinalis, and belongs to the potato-inhibitor-l family (Seemiiller et al., 1977, 1981, 1986). Other components of this family include the barley ehymotrypsin inhibitor-2, the chymotrypsin potato inhibitor-l and two proteinase inhibitors isolated from yeast (Svendsen et al., 1982).
The protein isolated from leeches contains two isoinhibitors that differ by one amino acid residue at position 35 (His or Tyr in eglin b and c, respectively: Seemiiller et al., 1980; Chang et al., 1985). The polypeptide chain is composed of 70 amino acid residues, and is devoid of cysteine residues.
Eglin b and c are strong a,nd specific inhibitors of human ol-chymotrypsin (CHT), human leukocyte elastase, subtilisins, human cath- epsin G and the leucine-specific proteinase from spinach leaves (&p&a&a olereacea L: Leu- proteinase) with Ki values in the lo9 to lO1 M-I range (Ascenzi et al.: 1988a,b, 1991). As such, they have been considered as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory and pulmonary diseases.
EGc binds to bovine b-trypsin, porcine pancreatic elastase and bovine a-chymo- trypsinogen A with Ki values ranging from 10 to IO6 M-I (Ascenzi et al., unpublished results). EGc has been cloned in Escherichia co& and expressed in large quantities (Rink et al., 1984).
The recombina,nt, inhibitor shows reactivities that are identical, with respect to its target enzymes, with those of t-he protein isolated from leech. The free-energy changes found for the reaction of recombinant EGc with CHT, subtilisin Carlsberg, Leu-proteinase, human eathepsin G or human leukocyte elastase are very similar, and about - 13 kcal/mol.
The inhibition reactions, despite the different geometries of the recognition sites involved, are entropy driven, the AS values being approximately 1-52 entropy units in the five cases (Ascenzi et al., 19886, 1991). 
Moreover, the same reactions are indistinguishabie from the kinetic viewpoint (Ascenzi et al., 198%).

Free EGG has failed to produce single crystals suit- able for X-ray diffraction, possibly due to flexibility of the N-terminal chain (Bode et al., 1987). The three-dimensional structure of the inhibitor, however, has been unraveled by high-resolution crystallographic investigations in its complexes with subtilisin Carlsberg, and with the homologous enzyme thermitase (McPhalen et al., 1985a; Bode et al., 1986a, 1987; Gros et al., 1989a,b).

CHT st,ructural and functional properties have been investigated extensively since the very early days of enzymology and protein crystallography. 
Three-dimensional structures have been reported for the y  and 01 forms of the enzyme (Cohen et al., 1981; Blevins & Tulinsky, 1985; Tsukada & Blow, 1985), for the proenzyme (Wang et al., 1985), as well as for complexes with low molecular-weight inhibi- tors (Dixon & Matthews, 1989; Hare1 et al.: 1991).

Moreover, the molecular structure of the complex between CHT and the third domain of t,urkep ovomucoid inhibitor (OMTKY3) has been reported ate 1.8 W (1 A = 0.1 nm) resolution (Fujinaga et al., 1987). AS such, CHT is an excellent molecular model Structure of the Chymotrypsin-Eglin c Complex 109 to be used in molecular-replacement crystallo- graphic investigations.

When aligned, CHT and human leukocyte elas- tase amino acid sequences show 35% identity; their crystal structures display a substantial degree of three-dimensional structure overlap (Greer, 1990). 
Thus, keeping in mind the potential therapeutic value of strong inhibitors of human leukocyte elas- tase, a high-resolution CHT-EGc molecular model could be used as a reliable basis for investigations on inhibitor-recognition processes in the two related enzymes.
Moreover, we wished to compare the active site of the prototype serine proteinase enzyme in the presence of two non-homologous inhibitors (EGc and OMTKY3: Fujinaga et al., 1987), investigating the role of enzyme residues that modulate inhibitor recognition. Finally, considering the three-dimensional structures of EGc in its complexes with non-homologous target enzymes (CHT, subtilisin Carlsberg and thermitase), we wanted to shed more light on the question of rigid- ity versus adaptability in the reactive sites of inhibi- tors, such as EGc, endowed with broad inhibitory specificity.

Here, we report the molecular structure analysis of the complex formed by CHT and recombinant EGc at 2.0 L% resolution, refined to a crystallo- graphic R-factor of 0.167. 
2. Experimental CHT, treated with N-a-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, in order to abolish tryptic activity, was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO, U.S.A.).

Recombinant EGc was a generous gift of Ciba-Geigy AG (Basel, Switzerland). All chemicals (from Merck AG, Darmstadt, Germany) were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
Crystallization of the CHT-EGc complex was achieved from polyethylene glycol solutions, at pH @5, as previously described (Pugliese et al., 1989). The crystals belong to monoclinic space group P2 1, with unit cell dimensions a = 553 a, b = 59.4 A, c = 42.5 A, /3 = 99.1; 1 full complex moiety (M, 32,000) is contained in the asymmetric unit.
An initial X-ray diffraction data set was collected, up to 2.6 a resolution, by means of a conventional sealed-tube 4-circle Enraf-Nonius CAD4 diffractometer, as described previously (Bolognesi et aZ., 1990). Structure solution was achieved by means of molecular-replacement techniques employing the atomic co-ordinates of the A subunit of the refined CHT dimer reported by Tsukada & Blow (1985) i deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al.; 1977).
The molecular-replacement programs package used was MERLOT (Fitzgerald, 1988), the search model being the CHT A-subunit alone. AS described elsewhere (Bolognesi et al., 1990), this was suffi- cient to locate correctly the enzyme portion of the complex in the asymmetric unit, and to obtain enough electron density to position the inhibitor chain.
The R-factor for the starting complex model was 0.483 for the data in the l@O to 3.0 a resolution range; after indepen- dent, rigid-body refinement of the 2 molecular com- ponents, the R-factor dropped to @390. Conventional restrained crystallographic-refinement and model- building cycles were subsequently run, employing the TNT restrained crystallographic refinement suite (Tronrud et al.: 1987) and FRODO graphics package (Jones, 1978).
As described by Bolognesi et al. (1990), after 5 cycles the molecular model was refined co a crys- tallographic R-factor of 0.180 for the data in the 6.5 to 2.6 a resolution range. 
New crystals were grown at this stage, as described above, and a new data set was collected on an Enraf-Nonius FAST television area detector system, coupled to an Elliot GX-21 rotating anode generator run at 40 kV and 100 mA, at the Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College (London, U.K.).
Data collection to a limiting sphere of 2.0 A was run at room temperature, using 0.1 frame widths, 12 s/frame, on 1 crystal (the detector temperature was kept at 10C by a strea.m of refrigerated air, to reduce dark-current fluctuations). The crystal-to-detector distance was 110 mm, with a swing angle for the detector arm of 28.
Missetting angles and camera constants were updated continuously during data collection; every 5 a cycle of refinement was performed, with prediction of a new batch of reflections based on the updated parameters. A total of 31,318 intensities (16,841 unique) were measured, and evaluated on-line using the MADNES program package (Messerschmidt & Pflugrath, 1987).
The reflection intensities were determined by means of a profile-fitting procedure that operates on the spot profiles measured in 16 different areas off the detector. A least-squares plane was fitted to the back- ground pixels and then subtracted from all pixels, moni- toring the position of adjacent spots, and eliminating from the background tails of neighboring strong reflec- tions.
After background correction, the strong reflections (greater than 50) were integrated by summation, whereas profile fitting was applied to the remaining weak reflec- tions. For data reduction, the data were subdivided into batches of 6 rotation angle.
Lorentz and polarization corrections were applied to individual reflections during the integration step; reflections were then reduced to the asymmetric unit, and corrected for obliquity. The scale and temperature factors between batches were refined according to the procedure of Fox & Holmes (1966).
In the 11.0 to 2.0 ,& resolution range, the overa,ll Rmerge factor was 40%: R merge = chciI1h, i- (r>hl/zhcilJi, i, the sum is extended over all the h observed intensities that had multiple measurements, and (I) is the average intensity value for each measurement. 
This data set was adopted for further, high-resolution, crystallographic refinement, which continued along the lines described previously (Bolognesi et al., 1990), alter- nating model-building/correction sections on an Evans & Sutherland PS330 graphics system, with restrained- crystallographic-refinement cycles (Jones, 1978; Tronrud et al., 1987).
The starting atomic co-ordinates, adopted from the refinement on the previous data set at 2.6 f% resolution, yielded an R-factor of @29 in the 11.0 to 2.5 A resolution range. The resolution of the data included in the crystallographic refinement was gradually increased during the following 2 refinement stages, which included refinement of temperature factors with group-correlation restraints, and location of solvent peaks in 2F, -E, and F,-F, difference Fourier maps (F, and F, are, respec- tively, the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes).
A total of 6 refinement/graphics-model- correction cycles were conducted before convergence of the process was reached. The final crystallographic R-factor, calculated for the 16,833 reflections in the 11.0 to 2.0 a resolution range (901 y0 of the total reflections in this shell) is 0.167; the molecular model includes 2433 110 F.

The root-mean-square (rms.) deviations from ideal values, as described by the TNT program (Tronrud et al., 198i), are 0018 a for bond lengths; 2.97 for bond angles, 0.018 A for t,rigonal centers, 0019 A for planar groups and 0.086 A for non-bonded contacts. Individual occupancies were refined for the solvent molecules in the 6th refinement stage, when the co-ordinate and tempera- ture-factor refinement was judged at convergence, keeping the other parameters constant.
The quality of the refined model was assessed from calculation of t,he rrA plot for the data in the 11.0 to 2.0 a resolution range (Read; 1986; see Fig. 2). and of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 3) for the 2 polypeptide chains in the complex (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965). 
In a following and independent series of restrained crystallographic refinement cycles.
run on the final atomic co-ordinates obtained as described above (R = 6167), the geomet.rical restraints defining the planarity of the peptide bond were released for 24 amino acid residues in the complex structure, 18 in the CHT component and 6 in EGc. None of these included proline residues or cysteine residues that contributed to disulfide bridges: the reac- tive-site peptide bond 451-461 was among t,hose selected in the EGc component After convergence in these refine- ment cycles, the deviations from planarity of the selected peptide bonds were checked, measuring the out-of-plane displacement of each carbonyl carbon atom, with respect to the neighboring covalently linked atoms C!. 0 and N of the following residue.

For the purpose of comparison, the following atomic co- ordinates files were recovered from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank distribution tape (Bernstein et al., 1977): CHT-OMTKY3 (Fujinaga et al.; 1987; file label lCHO), thermitsse-EGc complex (Gros et al., 1989a,b; file label ITEC), chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 from barley seeds (McPhalen & James, 1987; file label %X2), Streptomyces griseus proteinase B-chymotrypsin inhibitor-l complex (from Russet Burbank potato tubers; Greenblatt et al.. 1989; file label 4SGB), subtilisin Nova-chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 complex from barley seeds (McPhalen et al.; 198%; NcPhalen 8: James, 1988; file label SSNI). The atomic co-ordinates for the subtilisin Carlsberg-EGc complex, refined at 1.2 A resolution (Bode et al.. 1986a,b, 1987), were kindly provided by Dr Wolfram Bode, Max Planck Institut. fiir Biochemie (Martinsried bei Miinchen, ^, -. Germany).
lhese molecules were compared and overlaid by means of a !east-squares procedure that minimizes the overall deviations between pairs of equivalenced atoms in the 2 molecules considered (program by W.

Results and Discussion (a) Quality of the derived structwe The overall mean error associated with the atomic co-ordinates of the CHT-ECc complex was esti- mat.ed according t.o t.he method described by Luzzati (1952) from the k/d dependence of the crys- tallographic R-factor, and according to the crA plot method (Read; 1986; see Fig. 2).

The Ramachandran plot for the whole complex {Fig. 3) shows the regularity of the protein confor- mation; only two non-glycme residues, Ile99 and Alal85, fall in the J/: &posit,ive quadrant,. as observed in other CRT structures (Tsukada &. Blow, 1985; Fujinaga et al., 1987). 
The temperat,ure-factors profile displayed in Figure 4 indicates that both protein components of the complex display comparable temperature factors.
R. for the overall structure, including solvent atoms: is 30.6 A2; for CHT alone the average R-values are 26.7 it2 and 35.3 AZ, for main-chain (including Co) and side-chain atoms, respect,ively. Similarly, in EGc; the main-chain component shows an average temperature factor of 27.6 A2, and the side-chain atom tempera.ture factors average at 3&5 A2.
The variation of the temperature factor along the poly- peptide chain of CKT is comparable with those reported for the free enzyme (Cohen et al., 1981; Blevins & Tulinsky, 1985; Tsukada & Blow, 1985).

(b) The molecular components Specific binding of polypeptide serine-proteinase inhibitors to the active sites of their target (pro)en- zymes result in typically mushroom-shaped complexes, which have been described previously in several papers (for reviews, see Read & James, 1986; Bolognesi et al., 1988).
The only exception to this structural pattern, so far, has been observed in the complexes of hirudin with human a-thrombin (Griitter et al., 1990; Rydel et al., 1990), which, however, do not follow the standard inhibition mechanism proposed by Laskowski & Kato (1980). 
The overall shape of the molecular CHT-EGc complex is shown in Figure 5 as a (Y-atom plot.
The interaction of the thin rim of the wedge-shaped inhibitor (the reactive site) with the active-site cleft is evident. A total of 126 intermolecular contacts (shorter than 4.0 8) occur between the inhibitor and the enzyme, burying 714 x 2 A2 of the interacting molecular surfaces upon complex formation, in the absence of ordered interface water molecules.
Table 1 provides a summary of the intermolecular contacts observed in the complex (for details., see below). 
(i) Eglin c The EGc structure conforms to the descriptions given before for this molecule, and for the homo- logous inhibitors from the potato inhibitor-l family (Bode et aZ., 1987; McPhalen & James, 1987), and consists of a short a-helix (residues Vall81 to Tyr291), a central mixed parallel/antiparallel four- stranded p-sheet (residues Lys81 to PhelOI, Asn331 to Leu371, Arg511 to Tyr561, His651 to GlylOI), supporting the reactive-site loop (residues Pro381 to Asn501: see Fig. 6).
In the CHT-EGc complex, the inhibitor polypeptide chain starts with residue Lys81, owing to a proteolytic digestion of the EGc N-terminal chain during crystallization (Pugliese et al., 1989). The N-terminal heptapeptide ThrlI to Leu71 (Thr-Glu-Phe-Gly-Ser-Glu-Leu-) is solvent exposed, predicted flexible in the free inhibitor (Karplus & Schulz, 1986), and is a suitable candi- date for proteolytic cleavage by CHT, in the crystal- lization buffer.
A similar situation has been reported by Bode et al. (1987) for the crystallization of the subtilisin Carlsberg-EGc complex. Moreover, multiple hydrolytic cleavages of the N-terminal chain have been observed during purification and crystallization of the homologous chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 from barley seeds (McPhalen & James, 1987).
The side-chain of residue Lys81 is disordered, showing no electron density in the final refined model.

The comparisons between EGc in its complexes with subtilisin Carlsberg and thermi- tase show that the reactive sites can adopt very similar structures (r.m.s. deviation for P3-Ps, is O-17 a) when bound to highly homologous protein- ases. On the other hand, CHT compiex format,ion results in a more pronounced a,lteration of the reae- tive-sitSe geomet,ry (see Table 2) which, as shown in Figure 6, includes a hinge-bending motion centered around sites P4 and P4,.
The P3-P3, reactive-site loop of EGc bound t,o CHT was also compared with the homologous regions of the free chymotrypsin barley inhibitor-2, of EGc complexed with subtilisin Nova (McPhalen & James, 1987; McPhalen & James, 1988), and of chymotrypsin potato inhibitor-I Structure of the Chymotrypsin-Eglin c Complex 113 - (b) Figure 6.

The Asn571 C-Thr601 C distance (residues i and i + 3) is 4.90 A, and the 5710 . ,601 N hydrogen bond is 2.94 A. Additionally, the side- chain of Asn571 contributes to the stabilization of t,he turn with a hydrogen bond (2.97 8) between the ODl atom and the peptide N atom of Gly591.
As shown in Figure 6: the EGc structures determined in the complexes with CHT and subtilisin Carlsberg (McPhalen et al., 19850,; Bode et al., 1986a, 1987) deviate substantially in this region (2.3 a at residue Gly591), even when the best fit between the two is calculated over the ent,ire C backbone. 
More-contained r.m.s. c deviations (of the order of 67 A) are observed for the same turn region in the comparison with the inhibitor structure in the ther- mitase complex (see Fig. 6: Gros et al., 1989a).

Pro581 is not in contact with the CHT molecular OXT is the EGc (!-terminal carboxylate oxygen atom. 
surface and a contained structural perturbation at this site may have only marginal effects on the overall structure of the inhibitor and on the geometry of the enzyme-contacting surface.
On the other hand, the structural requirements for a proline residue a,t this site do not appear to be stringent since the same position is occupied by non- prolyl residues in the homologous molecules from the potato inhibitor-l family (Svendsen, 1982; &Phalen & Ja,mes, 1988). 
EGc is characterized by strong intramolecular ionic interactions, which support and possibly confer rigidity t,o the reactive-site structure.
This is achieved by ion pa,irs and hydrogen bonds involving residues Thr441 (PZ), 4~~461 (PI,), Arg.ilT: Arg53T, the C-terminal carboxylate group and, partly. Tf this structural arrangement is compared with that observed in the subtilisin Carlsberg complexes (McPhalen et aC., 1985a; Bode et al.: 1986a, 1987), it can be noticed Figure 7.

that small, concerted structural changes character- ize the CHT-EGc complex.
The hydrogen-bonding pattern is slightly altered (compare with Fig. 13 of McPhalen & James, 1988), and a structural water molecule, bridging between Thr441 (P2), Asp461 (P,,) and Arg511, believed to contribute to the stability of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, is not present. Moreover; the conformation of the side-cha,in of Arg481 is altered, such that an intermolecular hydrogen bond occurs between Arg48INEH2 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of residue Cys58.
Table 3 lists the intramolecular hydrogen bonds in this area of the EGc molecule. 
Conformational disorder is present at the side- chain of residue His281, whose electron density is absent from the Fourier maps.
In the modeled con- formation, the His281 side-chain is 60% solvent exposed, and free of intra/intermolecular contacts. 
Weak density is also observed for part of the side- chain of Tyr491 (49% solvent exposed) and for the ODl and ND2 atoms of Asn501 (45% solvent exposed).

Va1661 from a symmetry-related EGc molecule. Residues Serll, Gly12 and Leul3 of CHT are ordered, and their electron density is well defined in the CHT-EGc complex. They adopt a conformation mimicking 3/4 of a distorted a-helical turn, which is packed between an apolar CHT patch (residues Va1137 and Trp207, facing the side-chain of Leul3), and a symmetry-related complex moiety (residues Tyr146 and His681: see Fig. 9).
Four strong electron-density peaks, accounting for ordered water molecules, are present after the Leu13 carboxylate group. The 11-13 peptide frag- ment has been found to be disordered in both flree CHT and in the CHT-OMTKYS complex structures (Tsukada & Blow, 1985; Fujinaga et al., 1987).
On the other hand, its structure shows an approximate helical turn (at residues 12 to 15) in chymotryp- sinogen (Wang et al., 1985), where it is covalently linked to the following polypeptide chain.

Both figures are in good agreement with previous comparisons of various chymotrypsin structures reported by Fujinaga et al. (1987).
As compared to the free CHT (Tsukada & Blow; 1985) the largest C deviation in the CHT-EGc complex is located at residue Serll (6.27 a), possibly due to a crystal contact (and hydrogen bond) occurring between the 11 OG atom and the peptide nitrogen atom of The second largest C deviations (between 1.3 A and 2.6 A with respect to the free enzym.e, and between 0.7 A and 1.1 A with respect to the CHT- OMTKY3 complex) occur at the calcium loop, in the polypeptide segment Glu75-Gln78; this, however, corresponds to a part of the CHT-EGc electron-density map which is fairly noisy, such that a unique structural interpretation is difficult. The EGc complexed CHT and the free enzyme C atoms deviate by l-2 a at residue Lys36.
A comparable deviation has been reported in the CHT-OMTKY3 complex at residue Thr37 (Fujinaga et d., 1987), whereas more contained displacements are found in this area when the two inhibitor complexed enzymes are compared (0.4 to 0.5 a). Additionally, similar C deviations (0,6 to 0.9 a) are observed, if the CHT-EGc adduct is compared respectively to the CHT-OMTKYS complex and to the free enzyme, in the 144 to 146 region of the autolysis loop, involved in the intermolecular Tyrl46 OH . . .

A number of amino acid side-chains of CHT are disordered, and did not contribute to structure- factor/phase calculations.
These include (different portions of) the side-chains of lysyl residues 36, 79, 87, 93, 169, 170 and 203; moreover, no electron densit,y has been observed for parts of the side- chains of residues Ser77, Glu78, Arg145, Ala149, Asnl50, Arg154 or Gln239. Only one out of the 143 solvent molecules located in the refined complex participates in a direct intermolecular (enzyme- inhibitor) hydrogen-bonding bridge; water molecule OH715 bridges between Ser128 N and Xer411 0 atoms with two hydrogen bonds (2.76 A and 2.95 A, respectively).
On the other hand, 33 water molecules are involved in intramolecular bidentate hydrogen bonds connecting the two surface residues of EGc and CHT (see Table 5). A total of 47 water molecules in the whole complex show less than 10% accessibility in their surface area, either because they are buried in the protein, or because they are shielded by an outer solvent layer.

(c) Interactions at the (re)active-site region The enzyme-inhibitor recognition is based on the contribution of 11 residues from EGc and 17 from CHT (see Tables 1 and 4). This figure, together with t,he total buried surface area and with t,he number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds supporting the recognition reaction, falls within the statistics for protein-protein recognition processes (not only in enzyme-inhibitor complexes) reported by Janin R: Chothia (1990).
In CHT, the contacting residues are located in six major groups, located on the enzyme polypeptide loops 35-43, 56-65, 140-153, 168-178, 188-196 and 212-221 (see Table 1). This is a, subset of the eight 100p that control proteinase-inhibitor recognition in the chymotrypsin family (Creighton & Darby, 1989).
Moreover, these contacts appear to be more extended on one face of the EGc molecule, in the proximity of t,he loops 35-43, 1406153, 188-196 and 212-221. In the reactive-site region, specific and direct interactions between the enzyme and the inhibitor occur between sites P5 and PS3, and involve the primary recognition event, at the S,-P, sites, between the primary specificity pocket of CHT and the side-chain of residue Leu45I (Pr) (Pig. 10).

As shown in Table 4, the hydrogen-bonding pattern observed in the CHT-EGc (re)active-site cornact region is in good agreement with that observed for other serine proteinase-inhibitor complexes from the chymotrypsin family (Bolognesi et al., 1988): Table 4 Comparison of hydrogen-bond interactions between enzyme (E) and inhibitor (I) at the contact surfaces of the CHT-EGc and CHT-OMTKY3 complexes Site I atom E atom CHTpEGc CHT-OMTKYS a P5 Ser411 0 Ser218 OG 2.91 5 p3 VA431 N Gly216 0 2.89 24 Va143I 0 Gly216 N 2.85 3.0 p, Leu451 N Ser214 0 3.15 3.3 Leu451 0 Serl95 N 2.99 33 Leu451 0 Gly193 N 2.68 2.4 p2 Leu471 N Phe41 0 308 2.9 p3, Arg481 NEHZ Cys58 0 2.42 c P 23 His681 NE2 Tyr146 OEH 3.17 d a Data from Fujinaga et al.

and is identical, between sites P3 and PZ,, with that reported by Fujinaga et al. (1987) for the CHT- OMTKY 3 complex. 
Extensive thermodynamic solution studies on the third domain of ovomucoid indicate that the nature of the Ps, residue may have an appreciable influence on the enzyme-inhibitor affinity (Laskowski et al., 1989).
In particular, when the target enzyme is CHT, replacement of the Ps, residue with Arg can increase the inhibition constant of ovomucoid inhibitors (Ki, M-l) by a factor of approximately 50 (Laskowski, M. Jr, personal communication). Such a stabilization effect, which can be estimated in the 2 kcal/mol range, has its structural basis in the productive interactions of the Ps, arginine guanidino group, through buried water molecules, with the enzyme residues described above, in particular with the charged residue Asp64 of CHT.
Indeed, from comparison of the EGc structures in the subtilisin Carlsberg-, thermitase- and CHT-EGc complexes (McPhalen et al., 1985a; Bode et al., 1986a,b, 1987; Gros et al.; 1989a,b), the conformation of the side- chain of Arg481 (Ps,) appears to be affected by binding to CHT. 
Only at the two ends of the reactive-site specific- An additional proteinase-inhibitor interaction is recognition loop (sites P5 and Ps,) are hydrogen observed further away from the scissile peptide bonds involving amino acid side-chains present (see bond, at site P2s,, where the NE2 atom from the Table 1).
Among these, residue Arg481 (Ps,) contri- side-chain of residue His681 (P2s,) is at hydrogen- butes to the binding process with a side-chain hydrogen bond between the 481 NEH2 atom and the Cys58 0 atom of CHT (2.50 A). Additionally, the Arg481 NEH2 atom is 3.62 A from the His57 0 atom, and forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with Asp461 (PI,) ODl (3.04 A; Fig. 11).
Inspection of the CHT-EGc refined model indicates that the positive charge of the Arg481 (Ps,) side-chain can be partly counterbalanced by Asp64 of CHT, whose carboxylate group is 6.4 A from the guanidino end of residue Arg481. This potential electrostatic inter- action can be mediated by water molecules, since both residues are solvent accessible.
The electron- density map shows a peak for one molecule (OH539), and lower electron density, possilbly accounting for one additional (mobile or partly occupied) solvent molecule, located in the polar cavity between the Gly59 0 atom and the Asp64 carboxylate group.

bonding distance (2.71 a) from the OEH atom of Tyr146 in the CHT autolysis loop (Fig. 12).

The electron density for both His681 and Tyr146 is defined, despite the excision of residues 147 and 148 at the neighboring autolysis site; the average B-factors of t)he two side-chains are however high, 62% and 47.2 A2, respectively, for His681 and Tyr146. In the crystalline CHT-EGc complex, both Tyr146 and His681 participate in a crystal contact with Serll of a symmetry-related CHT molecule, which may restrain their conformational flexibility, but also induce a certain disorder.
Indeed, on the basis of the available electron-density map, it is not possible to distinguish between two alternative hydrogen-bond interactions: (1) between the His681 NE2 atom and the Tyr146 OEH atom of the same complex unit (3.17 A); or (2) between the His681 NE2 a.tom and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Serll of a symmetry-related CHT molecule (3.22 8). In the CHT-OMTKYS complex (Eujinaga et al., 1987) the OEH atom from residue Tyr146 is involved in a weak hydrogen bond (3.2 8) with the Asn36I (P1s,) ODl atom.
This coincidence, together with the structural resemblance, and the similar dimensions of the His and Asn side-chains, suggests either a common recognition role for the P,,, residues in two non-homologous inhibitors (strengthening the idea that functional interactions can take place at sites different from the rea,ctive-site loop), or the fortui- tous coincidence of crystal contacts in two crystal- line forms that, indeed, share some common geometrical features (see below). 
The CHT residue Metl92, close to the specificity 8, site, has been shown to exert some control on substrate or inhibitor recognition, according to the oxidation stake of its side-chain.
In particular, in the case of the CHT-EGc complex, selective oxidation of this residue to Met 192-sulfoxide has been shown to decrease t,he enzyme-inhibit,or afinity by about, one order of magnitude, whereas more contnined effects have been reported for other inhibitors, such as the bovine basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Amiconi et al., unpublished results). DespitOe the absence of direct contacts between the side-chain of Met192 and EGc residues, inspection of the refined model shows that modification of the Met192 thioether bond into a sulfoxide can bring to inefi- cient packing at the enzyme-inhibitor molecular Figure 12.
Stereo view of the hydrogen-bonding interaction observed at site P2,,, jHis681) of EGc and residue Tyr146 from the autolysis loop of CHT. Unfavorable contacts may develop with residues Va1431, Leu451, Leu471, Arg511, Arg531, the inhibitor C terminus and the ordered water molecule OH718, according to the conformation adopted by the Met192 sulfoxide side-chain.

(d) Crystal contacts The largest crystal-contact area between the complex moieties in the unit cell occurs along the 2, symmetry axis, and includes the C-terminal helix of CHT (mostly residues 237 to 244), which runs almost parallel to the 35-38 strand of b-structure in a symmetry-related EGc molecule. Such an extended interaction could be considered as playing a certain role in enhancing the hinge-bending move- ment observed in EGc reactive site and, moreover, explain the tilted orientation of the inhibitor with respect t,o the active-site crevice median, in the direction of the CHT regions 40-42, 146-149, 190-195 and 215-220 discussed above.
Additional crystal contacts in this area are provided by CHT loops 37-39,93-97, 122-125, 173-175, and by the N terminus. 
Concerning the EGc molecule, besides the crystal contacts with the C-terminus of CHT just mentioned, two other regions participate in the crystal-lattice contacts, and they involve two addi- tional different CHT molecules.
One series of contacts occurs along the 631-661 p-strand, with residues 11 to 19 of CHT, on the EGc side, opposed to the one contacting the C-terminal helix of CHT. 
The core of the EGc molecule, thus, looks as if it is clamped by two CHT molecules displaced by a full unit-cell translation along the a axis.
The second series of (less-extended) crystal contacts on the EGc molecule occurs at the 301-311 bend, with residues 86, 109 and 110 of a symmetry-related CHT molecule. 
The CHT-OMTKY3 complex (Fujinaga et al., 1987) crystallizes in monoclinic space group P2,, with unit cell constants comparable to those of the CHT-EGc complex, if a and c-axes are inter- changed.
Packing of the complex moieties in the two cryst#alline forms shows some common elements. 
Both enzyme-inhibitor complexes are oriented parallel to the unique monoclinic b axis, and in both cases the C-terminal helix of CHT makes contacts with one side of a symmetry-related inhibitor molecule.
Besides this, however, most of the other crystalline contact regions cannot be compared in the two complexes. Moreover, the CHT-OMTKY3 crystals show a large solvent cavity on one side of the inhibitor molecule; this is absent from the EGc complex, which, as mentioned, is clamped between two CHT molecules.
Despite the different crystalline environment, both complexes show an identically tilted orientation of the inhibitor molecule with respect to the active-site crevice (Fig. 5; see also Fig. 2 of Fujinaga et al., 1987), ruling out a possible influence of the crystal contacts on the overall orien- tation of the inhibitor molecule with respect to the cognate enzyme. 
(e) Structural considerations on the EGc inhibition mechanism The binding mode of the EGc scissile peptide bond to the active site of CHT follows the stereo- chemical rules observed for other serine proteinases, small inhibitors obeying the standard inhibi- tion mechanism (Laskowski & Kato, 1980).
In parti- cular, two hydrogen bonds connect the Leu451 (.P1) carbonyl oxygen atom to the peptide nitrogen atoms of Gly193 and Ser195 (see Table 4), the Ser195 OG to Leu 451 C contact distance being 2.75 A, i.e. shorter than an O-C van der Waals contact. The side-chain torsional angle x1 of the Ser195 side-chain is -85, allowing the formation of a hydrogen bond between the side-chain OG atom and His57 NE2 atoms (2.96 A); the hydrogen bond, however, deviates 38 from linearity.
The Ser195 OG atom, in addition, is at 3.03 A from the Leu451 0 atom, and at 2.92 A from the Leu451 N atom, although both potential hydrogen-bond eont,acts show very unfavorable donor-acceptor orientations. 
The trigonal carbonyl carbon atom of the reac- tive-site bond resulting from restrained crystallo- graphic refinement is virtually planar, deviating by 0.01 A from the plane defined by the 451 CA, 45T 0 and 461 N atoms.
After six refinement cycles, run with substantial release of the planarity restraints on this and 23 other different peptide bonds, the out-of-plane deviation of 451 C is 0064 A. This value is close to the mean out-of-plane displacement observed for the 24 peptide bonds analyzed in the absence of restraints (6061 A), which showed an upper value of 0.143 A for the 171-172 peptide of CHT. These figures do not allow us to draw signifi- cant conclusions on the out-of-plane distortion of the carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile peptide bond in terms of the incipient reaction of the Ser195 OG nucleophile on the reactive-site electrophile Leu451 C (Bolognesi et af., 1982; Marquart et al., 1983; Bode et al., 1987).
A substantial out-of-plane displacement has been reported for the Leu451 C atom in the subtilisin Carlsberg-EGc complex at 1.2 A resolution (Bode et al., 1987), whereas more contained deviations are observed in the thermitase complexes at 1.98 A resolution (Gros et at., 19896). 
Indeed, the pyramidalization of the electrophile carbonyl carbon atom cannot be generalized to all serine proteinase-inhibitor complexes (Read & James, 1986).
Ovomucoid inhibitors in their CHT and human leukocyte elastase complexes show carbonyl carbon trigonal centers that are close to planar (Bode et al., 1986; Fujinaga et al., 1987). In the CHT-EGc complex, the reactive-site average main-chain B-factor is 20.6 .k2, and the electron density is well defined.
Nevertheless, given the esti- mated mean positional error of 0.22 A for the atomic co-ordinates, any inference on subtle structural details, such as pyramidalization of the scissile peptide carbonyl carbon atom, can be drawn only on the basis of higher-resolution refinement. The short nucleophile-electrophile distance observed, however, is consistent with a proteolytic reaction, 120 F.

Comparisons of the P3-P3, reactive site regions indicate that, despite a good conservation of the EGc rea.ctive-site conformation, as suggested by the 4, $ angles (Table B), a certain conformational readjustment of these residues is allowed for optimal enzyme-inhi bitor recognition. Two processes, hinge bending around P4 and PQ sites and fine conformational changes in t,he neighborhood of the scissile bond, appear to be used in order to attain proper enzyme-inhibitor contacts.
The degree of conformational readjustment observed for the reactive site of EGc in the various complexes studied (see Table 2) is pronounced (Read & James, 1986), and can be related to the particular nature of the residues supporting the reactive-site loop in EGc. In fact, whereas in most inhibitor families the structure and conformational rigidity of the reac- tive-site loop is attained through covalent disulfide bridges to the inhibitors hydrophobic core, these interactions are mediated in EGc (and homologous inhibitors) by non-covalent: less directional, ionic interactions.
The hydrogen-bonding and ionie-inter- action network that supports the reactive site (formed by residues Thr441, Asp461, Arg481, Arg511, Arg53I and the C-terminal carboxylate group) in the CHT-EGc complex can accommodate contained structural perturbations that, in turn, allow readjustment of the reactive-sit,e polypeptide conformation. On the other hand, the hinge-bending movement of the whole reactive-site loop allows us to maximize the number of van der Waals contacts between the outer rim of the inhibitor and the enzyme active-site crevice, which, in turn, does not, alter significantly its structure.
In accordance with this view, McPhalen & James (1988) find C dis- placements of 2.1 a to 4.1 ,! % in the Ps-PZ loops, when comparing the c backbones of EGc, in the Both aspects may be related to the broad speci- ficity of EGc, which is used by the leech to inhibit the coagulation enzymes of widely different hosts, and which is known to display almost the same affinity (Ki = lo9 to lOlo M-l) for different serine proteinases such as CHT, human leukocyte elastase, subtilisins and human cathepsin G (Seemiiller et al., 1986; Ascenzi et al., 1988a,b, 1991).
In this respect, only Leu-proteinase shows a higher affinity (Ki = 2x 1012~p1) for EGc (Ascenzi et al., 1991). 
Predetermined structural complementarity between the interacting molecules favors binding by minim- ization of the degrees-of-freedom loss of t,he enzyme and the inhibitor upon complexation.
A contained adaptation of the reactive site, on the other hand, although entropically less favorable, can indeed bring into the free-energy balance for the binding reaction a,n enthalpic contribution significantly different from that of the unperturbed inhibitor (see Ascenzi et al., 198821, 1991). Thus, t.he eventual affinity reached is sufficiently high to inhibit the target proteinases at their physiological levels, but, Is, however, lower than that of t,he more rigid and highly specific bovine basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, which binds to bovine P-trypsin without, significant alteration of the contact surfaces (Hubes $ Bode, 1978), attaining Ki values in the 1013 to lOI M-I range (Antonini et al.: 1983).

From a different view of the inhibition mechan- ism, rigidity of the reactive site should prevent the scissile peptide bond from reaching a position that, is close enough to the nueleophile Serl95 OG atom to start the hydrolytic reaction. The polar interaction network supporting the reactive-site loop plays undoubtedly a role in this sense, as indicated by the results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments on EGc (Heinz, 1990).
Replacement of Arg53I with Structure qf the Chymotrypsin-Eglin c Complex 121 Lys, with alteration of the hydrogen-bonding network, or, conversely, replacement of Asp461 (PI,) with Ser, increases the conformational flexibility of the reactive-site loop, the engineered eglins becoming poorer inhibitors (Ki = 9 x lo9 M-l), and a substrate for subtilisin, respectively (Heinz, 1990). 
Consistent with an additional proposed contribu- tion to the inhibition mechanism (Huber & Bode, 1978; Read & James, 1986), the (re)active-site residues are buried in the complex core, and barely accessible to solvent.
This is particularly true for residues His57 and Ser195, and for those located between Va1431 and Leu471 (P3-P2,), which are inaccessible to a solvent probe of 1.4 A radius. 
Similar considerations can be drawn for residues involved in the polar interaction network that stabilizes the reactive-site conformation, therefore suggesting a particular strength for these inter- actions.
Complete solvent inaccessibility of the active site of an acylenzyme intermediate would prevent the access of nucleophilic solvent molecules for the deacylation process. 
Finally, consideration of the thermodynamic and kinetic constants of EGc and other small inhibitors with respect to different proteinases shows that the enzyme-inhibitor affinity is, to a first approxima- tion, regulated by differences in the values of the rate constants for the first-order dissociation reac- tion (see Ascenzi et al., 1988a,b).
In the case of high- affinity inhibitors (such as the bovine basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) the dissociation process is substantially slow, with rate constants in the 10e7 s-l range (compared to 2.0 x lop4 se1 for the CHT-EGc complex: Ascenzi et al., 1988a). On the other hand, the enzyme-inhibitor association process is fast: for the CHT-EGc complex forma- tion, the second-order rate constant is 1.0 x lo6 M-I s-l.
Both observations are in keeping with a strong predetermined complementarity between the two interacting molecular surfaces, which recognize each other readily and achieve a substantial degree of complex stabilization, stressing the role of intramolecular interactions that shape the inhibitor-recognition region. Additionally, a strong network of intramolecular interactions in the intact inhibitor (bound to the cognate enzyme) may also help in stabilizing the complex relative to the forward direction of the enzymatic reaction, namely with respect to a complex formed between the proteinase and the nicked inhibitor, where the rupture of the scissile bond may impair part of the recognition processes/interactions between the two molecular partners.
