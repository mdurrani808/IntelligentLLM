Inhibitor design Kazal inhibitor Serine protease Protease inhibitor Additivitya b s t r a c t We describe here successful designs of strong inhibitors for porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) and Streptomyces griseus protease B (SGPB). In one, the reactive site residue (position 18) was retained and the best residues were substituted at contact positions 13, 14, and 15.
In the other variant the best residues were substituted at all contact positions except the reactive site where a Gly was substituted. The four designed variants were: for PPE, T13E14Y15-OMTKY3 and T13E14Y15G18M21P32V36-OMTKY3, and for SGPB, S13D14Y15-OMTKY3 and S13D14Y15G18I19K21-OMTKY3.
The free energies of association (DG0) of expressed variants have been measured with the proteases for which they were designed as well as with five other serine proteases and the results are discussed. Introduction Standard mechanism serine protease inhibitors bind to serine proteases like substrates but instead of getting hydrolyzed theyform a stable non-covalent complex with the serine protease [1
4].
Based on sequence homologies and disulfide bond topologies, eighteen families of standard mechanism serine protease inhibitors have been recognized [3,5]. Despite differences in sequences, size, and disulfide bonding patterns, all of the eighteen families follow the same mechanism of inhibition commonly called the standard mechanism of inhibition [1].

We have been involved in the research work aimed at developing a sequence to reactivity algorithm (SRA) for the Kazal family of standard mechanism inhibitors. In the first part of our research project, ovomucoid third domains (a Kazal family inhibitor) were prepared and purified from egg whites of a large number of species of birds.
The ovomucoid third domains were sequenced [68] and free energy changes of their association (DG0) were measured with a panel of six serine proteases [912]. In the second part of the project all single amino acid variants at ten of the twelve consensus contact positions of turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3)
(see Fig. 1) were prepared and their DG0 values were measured against the same set of six serine proteases [1315].
The culmination of these two projects produced an SRA for the Kazal family of inhibitors, in addition to providing a large and unbiased set of inhibitors for testing the algorithm. The first five residues are not shown because they are not part of the expressed OMTKY3 (and its variants) and have been found to have no effect on the inhibitory activity of OMTKY3.
Residues towards the N-terminal of the P1 residue are sequentially labeled as P2, P3, . . ., Pn whereas residues C-terminal to P1 residue are labeled as P10 , P20 , . . ., Pn0 . The amino acids shown as filled circles are the consensus contact residues in inhibitorprotease complexes.
The two filled circles shown in grey color represent the residues which in addition to being the contact residues also play a structural role. 
3022 M.A. Qasim et al. / FEBS Letters 587 (2013) 30213026An important assumption in our proposal of SRA was the additivity of DG0 values when substitutions at the contact positions of OMTKY3 are made.
In principle, a substitution at an inhibitor contact position is additive if that position is independent of other positions in the inhibitor and it also does not produce alterations through protease contact residues [16,17]. Thus, the additivity depends both on the contact position of the inhibitor as well as on the serine protease being investigated.
These tests were based on natural ovomucoid third domains that differed from OMTKY3 at two or more contact positions [6,14]. The general consensus in all additivity tests is that most contact positions, with the exception of the contact positions P2 and P01, are additive with the six serine proteases that we have used [15,16,19,20].
The two important applications of additivity-based SRA are: (i) the prediction, with few restrictions, of the free energy of association of any Kazal inhibitor of known protein or gene sequence with any of the six serine proteases we have used, and (ii) the design of strong, specific, or non-specific inhibitors for the six serine proteases. 
Structure based design of strong and specific drugs and ligands for target proteins is an area of great academic and practical interest [2123].
In this communication, we describe the design and expression of the strongest possible OMTKY3-based inhibitors for PPE and SGPB. We also measure the free energy changes in the association of the designed inhibitors with the target serine protease as well as with the other five serine proteases in the panel and compare them with the predicted free energy changes.
The predicted free energy changes of association of the strongest possible inhibitors were outside our reliable measurement range
(4.017.5 kcal/mol). Therefore, to bring these numbers into the measureable range we introduced a Gly at the P1 position of the designed inhibitor instead of the best residue dictated by theSRA.
The substitution of Gly at P1 is based on overwhelming data
[14,2427] that show strong additivity of substitutions involving the P1 position of inhibitors as well as substrates. The success of these studies emphasizes the importance of including more serine proteases in further developing the sequence to reactivity algorithm.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals Four of the six serine proteases used in this research namely, TLCK treated bovine a-chymotrypsin (Worthington), human leukocyte elastase (HLE) (Elastin Products), porcine pancreatic elastase
(PPE) (Sigma), and subtilisin Carlsberg (CARL) (Sigma) were obtained from the commercial sources listed in parentheses. The other two serine proteases, Streptomyces griseus protease A and B, (SGPA and SGPB) were purified from a commercially obtained preparation of pronase (Sigma) as described [28].
The identity and the purity of the two proteases were established by amino acid analysis and by analytical ion exchange chromatography. 
The chromogenic and fluorogenic synthetic substrates of the type succinyl-ala-ala-pro-Xxx-pNA and succinyl-ala-ala-pro-XxxAMC were purchased from BACHEM.
Construction and expression of variants Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to introduce amino acid substitutions in the recombinant OMTKY3. For the variant S13D14Y15, the plasmid of variant Y15 was used as template, and the following primers were used to create the indicated changes:
S13D14Y15-forward primer: 50-GAC TGT AGT GAG TAC CCT AGC GAT TAC TGC ACG CTG-30; S13D14Y15-reverse primer: 50-CAG CGT GCA GTA ATC GCT AGG GTA CTC ACT ACA GTC-30.
The variant plasmid could be easily distinguished from the parental plasmid by the digestion with Pst I. For the mutant S13D14Y15G18I19K21, the plasmid of the variant S13D14Y15 was further used as template, and the following primers were used: S13D14Y15G18I19K21-forward primer: 50-C TGC ACG GGG ATC TAC AAA CCT CTC TGT GGA TC-30; S13D14Y15G18I19K21-reverse primer: 50-GA TCC ACA GAG AGG TTT GTA GAT CCC CGT GCA G-30. 
For the variant T13E14Y15, the plasmid of variant Y15 was used as template, and the following primers were used to create the indicated changes: T13E14Y15-forward primer: 50-GAC TGT AGT GAG TAC CCT ACG GAG TAT TGC ACG CTG-30; T13E14Y15-reverse primer:
50-CAG CGT GCA ATA CTC CGT AGG GTA CTC ACT ACA GTC-30.
The variant plasmid could also be easily distinguished from the parental plasmid by the digestion with Pst I. For the variant T13E14Y15G18M21, the plasmid of the variant T13E14Y15 was further used as template, and the following primers were used: T13E14 Y15G18M21-forward primer: 50-G TAT TGC ACG GGG GAA TAC ATG CCT CTC TG-30; T13E14Y15G18M21-reverse primer: 50-CA GAG AGG CAT GTA TTC CCC CGT GCA ATA C-30. For the variant T13E14 Y15G18M21P32V36, the plasmid of the variant T13E14Y15G18M21 was further used as template, and the following primers were used:
T13E14Y15G18M21 P32V36-forward primer: 50-CA TAT CCA AAC AAG TGC GTC TTC TGC AAT G-30; T13E14Y15G18M21 P32V36-reverse primer: 50-C ATT GCA GAA GAC GCA CTT GTT TGG ATA TG-30.
Each variant plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli strain RV308 for protein expression. An engineered Z domain of protein A was used as a fusion protein in the construction of variant plasmids [14].

After affinity separation the fusion protein was cleaved at an engineered methionine placed at the junction of the Z domain and the ovomucoid third domain variant. The inhibitor variants were then separated from cleaved fusion protein by size exclusion column chromatography on Bio-gel P-10 column and purified by ion exchange column chromatographies on SP-sepharose and Q-sepharose columns.
The variants were characterized by size exclusion HPLC, amino acid analysis, and by mass spectral analysis by MALDI TOF. 
2.3. Measurement of free energy changes in the association of inhibitors with proteases The free energy changes in the association of the inhibitors with the panel of six serine proteases were calculated from experimentally determined values of association equilibrium constants, Ka, by using the equation, DG0 = RT lnKa.
Association equilibrium constants for the binding of the inhibitor variants with the serine proteases were determined by a procedure perfected in this lab [9,14]. 
The Ka measurements, except in those cases where they were expected to be >1013 M1, were performed in 0.1 M TrisHCl buffer + 0.02 M CaCl2 + 0.005% Triton X-100, pH 8.3.
The technical difficulties such as long incubation times (several weeks) and non-availability of sensitive enough substrates to accurately determine picomolar concentrations of the protease used in these measurements, prevent us from measuring large Ka values (>1013 M1)
at pH 8.3. However, we have found that the Ka measurement range can be increased by about a factor of 10 for some enzymes (such as SGPA, SGPB and chymotrypsin) by performing the Ka measurements at pH 5.0 and then converting these values to pH 8.3 by using an appropriate conversion factor.
As part of our studies on pH-dependencies of Ka, we measured Ka values of a number of P1 variants of OMTKY3 with different serine proteases in the pH range 4.010.0. The pH dependence for variants having non-ionizable amino acid residues at P1 was found to be identical, within experimental error, for a given protease ([29] and Qasim and Laskowski
 unpublished).
This means that the ratio of Ka for P1L variant (or any other non-ionizable P1 variant) at pH 8.3 and at any given pH is constant. Such measurements are more easily done at pH 5.0 because the drop in Ka with pH is steeper than the drop in the enzyme activity.
The Ka measurements at pH 5.0 were performed in 0.1 M acetic acidacetate buffer + 0.02 M CaCl2 + 0.005% Triton X-100, pH 5.0.3. DG0 values of inhibitor variants The amino acid sequence of recombinant wild type OMTKY3 is shown in Fig. 1.
The consensus contact residues of OMTKY3 determined from the X-ray crystallographic structures of its complexes with different serine proteases are shown as filled circles. Our lab, in collaboration with Andersons lab at Rutgers, constructed and expressed all single amino acid variants at ten of the twelve contact positions shown in Fig. 1.
The two contact positions which were not subjected to substitution are Cys16 (P3) and Asn33 (P15 0). These residues, in addition to being contact residues, also serve as structural residues and their mutation generally produces dramatic changes in the conformation and stability of OMTKY3.
In all, 190 inhibitor variants
(corresponding to single amino acid changes at 10 contact positions) and the wild type OMTKY3 were expressed, purified, and the DG0 values for the interaction of these variants with six serine proteases were measured [15]. The DG0 values of some of the variants that are relevant to the research work described in this paper are listed in Table 1.3.2.
Design of the strongest possible inhibitors for PPE and SGPB The strongest OMTKY3-based inhibitor for PPE and SGPB will be the one that has a residue at each of the contact positions that produces the highest association equilibrium constant for these proteases. The sequences of the strongest possible inhibitors for all six serine proteases have been described [15].
Assuming full additivity at each contact position one can calculate the free energy change (DG0 predicted) in the association of these variants with any of the six serine proteases by using the following relation [15]:
DG0 predicted  DG0 TKY3  RDDG0XTKY3iX0 1 The term DDG0 (XTKY3 i X0) represents the change in the free energy of association when a contact residue in OMTKY3, X, at position i is changed to X0. The free energies of association of OMTKY3 and single variants used for the design of these inhibitors are shown for all six enzymes in Table 1.
If the above equation is used to calculate free energy of association for the two inhibitors that are designed for PPE and SGPB, their predicted free energies of association will come out to be 18.5 kcal/mol (Ka = 5.1  1013 M1) for inhibitor sequence T13E14Y15M21P32V36 (for PPE) and 20.6 kcal/mol
(Ka = 1.8  1015 M1) for S13D14Y15I19K21 (for SGPB). Our range of accurate DG0 determinations ranges from 4.0 kcal/mol to 17.5 kcal/mol (Ka: 103 M1 to 1013 M1).
These numbers, however, represent the lower and the upper limit of our measurements when all six serine proteases are considered. We were able to extend the upper limit of DG0 value for SGPB to 18.9 kcal/mol (a 10-fold increase in Ka) by determining DG0 at pH 5.0 and converting it to the DG0 at pH 8.3 by using our knowledge of pH dependence of DG0.
The predicted DG0 values for the strongest possible inhibitor of PPE and SGPB are clearly outside our measurement range. Therefore, although we could make the strongest inhibitors using the above sequences, we would not be able to measure them in order to see whether they are actually as strong as our predictions suggest.
In order to overcome this 3024 M.A. Qasim et al. / FEBS Letters 587 (2013) 30213026problem, we made the strongest inhibitors in which the best P1 residue was replaced by the simplest of the amino acids, i.e. Gly. 
The choice of P1 and the choice of the amino acid Gly for substitution in the designed inhibitor were made on the basis of clear merits.
The choice of Gly at P1 is based on the simplicity of this amino acid (no side chain) and its uniformly lower DG0 value for all serine proteases. Strongest inhibitors with a Gly at P1 The design strategy for these inhibitors was exactly the same as described above except that the best amino acid residue at P1 was replaced by a Gly.
The two designed inhibitors are designated as T13E14Y15G18M21P32V36-OMTKY3 and S13D14Y15G18I19K21-OMTKY3. 
For each of these designed inhibitors, we also produced an intermediate designed inhibitor (see Tables 2 and 3) that had the best residues at P6, P5, and P4 positions but having the rest of the contact residues left the same as in wtOMTKY3.
Having inhibitors with fewer substitutions is important particularly in situations where the measured DG0 values for the designed inhibitor do not match with the predicted DG0 values. The measured and predicted Kas and the free energies of association of designed inhibitors for PPE and SGPB are given in Tables 2 and 3.
The DG0 values shown in Tables 2 and 3 are at pH 8.3. With the exception of T13E14Y15 and S13D14Y15 values for SGPA and SGPB all other values were directly measured at pH 8.3. The DG0 values for T13E14Y15 and S13D14Y15 for SGPA and SGPB were measured at pH 5.0 and converted to DG0 values at pH 8.3 by using the extensive DG0 data that we have acquired at both of these pH values.
A cursory look at the measured and predicted DG0 values shows that most of these are close to each other. The question, how close the measured and the predicted DG0 values should be to each other, in order to be considered within experimental error, was addressed in detail in our SRA paper [15].

(DG0 predicted  DG0 measured) is represented as DG0 I (see Eq. (2)). 
The term DG0 I is in effect the sum of any non-additivity and any experimental error inherent in the acquisition of the data set that is used as the predictive tool.
Thus, in our overall calculation of error, we use a 2r level to decide whether the DG0 I is due to experimental error or whether it should be attributed to non-additivity. The calculation of DG0 I is performed by using the following equation:
DG0 I experimental  2r ffiffiffiffiffi k2 q
 k 2  200cal=mol ffiffiffiffiffi k2 q
 k 2 2 Here, k represents the number of amino acid changes from OMTKY3 sequence.
The DG0 I value for three changes comes out to be 0.57 kcal/mol and for six and seven changes 1.13 kcal/mol and 1.33 kcal/mol, respectively. According to this criterion, 17 of the 24 (71%) DG0 values are in good to excellent agreement with the predicted DG0 values (see Tables 2 and 3).
This is slightly better than the value of 63% found for the much larger set of 400 comparisons [15]. Of the seven measured values that do not agree with the predicted values, the one for S13D14Y15G18I19K21-OMTKY3 for SGPB is only marginally outside the allowed error range.
It is worthwhile to mention here that of the six enzymes we use, the two most non-additive enzymes are HLE and CARL [15,31]. The structural explanation for the greater non-additivity in CARL has been provided by the X-ray crystallographic structure determination of the OMTKY3CARL complex [32].
On the other hand, the greater degree of non-additivity in HLE is at least in part due to inherent difficulties in accurate determinations of DG0 for this protease.

First, despite six and seven changes in the contact position of designed inhibitors, the additivity works very well. Second, the measured DG0 values for the designed inhibitors against the proteases for which they were designed were reasonably good.
Third, quite astonishingly the designed strongest inhibitor for SGPB has significantly higher DG0 value for SGPB than that for SGPA. Enzymatically SGPA is more active [35] and also is inhibited about 2- to 20-fold more strongly by most of the naturally occurring inhibitors that we have tested in our lab.
The fact that the S13D14Y15G18I19K21 OMTKY3 inhibits SGPB 10 times more strongly than SGPA is important and suggests that our SRA can be used for the design of specific inhibitors for closely related serine proteases. 
The findings of the increasing roles of serine proteases in cancer
[36], in inflammations [37], and in many viral infections [38]
makes them an important target for the design of strong and specific inhibitors.
Such designed inhibitors can be used as molecular tools in the investigation of the structure and properties of target serine proteases as well as can also be used as therapeutics. SRAs similar to the one developed for the six serine proteases and used here can in principle also be developed for other serine proteases using our OMTKY3 variant set and can then be used for inhibitor design against them Author contribution Mohammad Qasim performed measurements of DG0 values, interpretations of data, and writing of the manuscript.
