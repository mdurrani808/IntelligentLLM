The equilibrium constants for 38 of 66 possible interactions are strong enough to measure, and for these, the predicted and measured free energies are compared, thus providing an additional test of the additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm.
The test appears to be unbiased as the 11 variants were designed a decade ago to study furin inhibition and the specificity of furin differs greatly from the specificities of our six target enzymes. Of the 11 variants, one does not satisfy the restriction that either P2 Thr or P1 Glu should be present and all three measurable results on it, as expected, are nonadditive.
For the remaining 35 measurements, 22 are additive, 12 are partially additive, and only one is (slightly) nonadditive. These results are comparable to those obtained for a set of 398 equilibrium constants for natural variants of ovomucoid third domains.
The expectation that clustering of charges would be nonadditive is modified to the expectation that major nonadditivity will be observed only if the combining sites in both associating proteins involve large charge clusters of the opposite sign. It is also shown here that an analysis of a small variant set can be accomplished with a smaller subset, in this case 13 variants, rather than the whole set of 191 members used for the complete algorithm.

The sequence to reactivity algorithm for proteins (1, 2)
predicts the reactivity of all (subject to restrictions) possible members of a protein family from known reactivities of several appropriate target members of the family. One is the identification of a subset of residues that can be varied without changing the structure yet determine the reactivity.
The second is the production of all 19 single variants at each of the above positions and measurement of the reactivity of the wild type and of the 19n variants. Assuming that the free energy contributions of each of the positions are independently additive, we can calculate the reactivity of any sequence.

In our sequence to reactivity algorithm (1), the standard free energy of association (equilibrium constant) between two different proteins has been studied. The other member of the pair is any possible member (subject to restrictions) of the Kazal family of protein inhibitors of serine proteinases (for a recent list of such families, see ref 3).
X-ray structures of its complexes with several of our six serine proteinases have been obtained (4-9), and a consensus set of 12 contact residues has been formed. 
The 191 needed variants, including the wild type, were expressed, and the 6  191 ()1146) needed equilibrium constants were measured.
Its standard free energy of association, G(Xi), will in general be quite different from that of the wild type, Gwt, for association with the same target protein. We call the difference between these two standard free energies the increment due to the replacement where i is the position where the replacement was made, Xwt is the wild-type residue, and X is the variant residue at the ith position.
The additivity assumption asserts that for members of a protein family the value of the free energy

Assuming additivity, the data allow for the prediction of association constants of multiple variants of the blue residues. 
However, three-dimensional structure determinations show that in free inhibitors the side chain of Thr17 (P2 residue) is hydrogen bonded to the side chain of Glu19 (P1 residue) (10).

Importantly, the strength (length) of this hydrogen bond appears to change greatly upon complex formation with some, but not all, enzymes (4-8). This is the hallmark of nonadditivity. An easy way to state the restriction is that either Thr at P2 or Glu at P1 must be present in the variant that can be predicted.

The algorithm was tested with a set of 398 equilibrium constants of the six target enzymes interacting with numerous natural variants of ovomucoid third domains (1). The results were highly satisfactory as were the results with five very distantly related Kazal inhibitors.
It turned out that most of our colleagues whom we asked for samples of inhibitors they had isolated, sequenced, and characterized no longer had any material left. Even in our own laboratory, some samples we needed were gone. Clearly, expression of test variants for more extensive tests is the ultimate solution, but these must be either rather complicated multiple variants or a very large number of simpler but still multiple ones.

Fortunately, we found in our laboratory a set of 11 constructs designed a decade ago to test the inhibition of furin (11). As the specificity of furin is strikingly different from those of the six serine proteinases we have studied, this test set was clearly not biased by its design Furin prefers Arg and Lys residues in many contact positions.
There was ample reason to think that highly positive or highly negative contact regions would be nonadditive as repulsive interactions between the residues would change upon binding to the enzyme (see also the Discussion). The variants used in this study were constructed and expressed as described in earlier publications from the Purdue group (11, 12).
The fusion proteins containing two identical engineered B domains (designated as Z domains) of protein A, and the inhibitor variant, were expressed in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli. The fusion proteins were obtained in soluble and folded form by osmotic shock (12, 13) and were purified by affinity chromatography on an IgG-Sepharose column.
The two Z domains are connected to the inhibitor by an oligopeptide linker which has engineered sites for cleavage by Glu-specific Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 and CNBr. In the study presented here, the fusion protein was treated with 6% (w/
v) CNBr in 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid for 12 h. The inhibitor variants were separated from Z domains by size exclusion column chromatography on P-10 and further purified by ion exchange chromatography on S- and QSepharose columns.
Association equilibrium constants for the association of inhibitors with serine proteinases were measured in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.005% Triton X-100 (0.025% for measurements with HLE) and 0.02 M CaCl2 at 21 ( 1 C. The procedure used for Ka measurements is in principle based on the procedure of Green and Work
(14), but it has been extensively modified in our laboratory over the past two decades (13, 15-17).
Ten separate mixtures of enzyme and inhibitor in various ratios are incubated for an appropriate period of time to reach equilibrium. An appropriate p-nitroanilide peptide substrate is added, and the free enzyme concentration is determined by spectrophotometrically monitoring the release of p-nitrophenol.
We routinely determined the inhibitor concentration by amino acid analysis and the enzyme concentration by titrating against an appropriate inhibitor variant whose Ka is g5  108. From the fits obtained and the reproducibility of 3000
G values determined in our laboratory, we conclude that the average standard deviation, , is (100 cal/mol.

Additivity-Based Sequence to Reactivity Algorithm Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 21, 2003 6461 RESULTS Predicted G Values.
Table 1 lists all available G
values for the association of 11 multiple variants with our set of serine proteinases. Of these, three are double variants, two are triple variants, five are quadruple variants, and one is a pentuple variant.
The additivity assumption allows us to predict their standard free energies of association from the standard free energies of association of all needed single variants and the wild type. Table 2A is a listing of the free energy of association of the wild type and of the 12 relevant single variants with six serine proteinases.
The remaining ones are excerpted from the database of 191 single variants recently described (1) but not as yet published. 
The Gpredicted values can now be computed by summing the observed Gwt value shown in Table 2A and the appropriate standard free energy increments (eq 1, Table 2B)
The readers are invited to check the predicted entries in Table 1 with a hand calculator to appreciate how simple the algorithm is.

The range of Ka measurements by direct techniques employed in our laboratory is from 103 to 1013 M-1, which is equivalent to G values ranging from -4.05 to -17.55 kcal/mol. Weak association of CARL is found for some of the variants with Arg at P4, which is highly deleterious for that enzyme (18).
When both the measured and predicted standard free energy of association were available, then the
GI, the free energy of interaction, or the difference between these two values is also given. Wells (19) defined the difference between the predicted and measured free energy of association as GI where the subscript I denotes interaction, the hallmark of nonadditivity.
It should be noted that both Gpredicted and
Gmeasured contain experimental errors as Gpredicted is based on combining (eq 2) several of the free energy increments
(Table 2B of the single variants). Thus, several experimental Table 1: Free Energies of Association in Kilocalories per Mole at pH 8.3 and 21 ( 1 C CHYM PPE CARL SGPA SGPB HLE P2K/P1R measured -7.86 -9.03 -7.33 -9.27 predicted -7.21 -1.31 -9.39 -7.00 -9.16 -2.75

The second column in Table 3 gives the estimated net charge in the combining region of the inhibitor (colored residues in Figure 1) at the pH (pH 8.3) of Ka measurements. The net charge in this region in wild-type OMTKY3 is +1 due to Lys at P6, Glu at P1, and Arg at P3. The changes in charge are easily inferred from the listed substitutions in the variants.
It is clear that all the variants have highly positive combining regions and an unusually large concentration of like charges. GI can deviate from zero for three reasons (1):
(1) nonadditivity, (2) effect of changing the white residues in Figure 1, and (3) experimental errors in measured G
and especially in predicted G as these values are based on experimental data in Table 2.

We arbitrarily call the cases where |GI| e 2 of the expected propagated experimental error additive. For the first 10 variants in Table 3, the results are strikingly good: of 35 cases, 22 (63%) are additive, 12 cases (34%) are partially additive, and only one
(3%) is nonadditive.
These results are comparable to those obtained with a much larger analysis of 398 free energies of association of natural ovomucoid third domains (1). The results are highly gratifying since we anticipated they would be nonadditive due to the large positive charge on the combining region.
In sharp contrast are the three nonadditive results out of three measured for the last variant in Table 3. 
DISCUSSION We were pleased by the significant additivity of ovomucoid third domain natural variants (1).
We are also pleased by comparable results that are seen here because we had strong reason to expect that these results would be worse One of the additive results listed in Tables 1 and 2 is shown in the double mutant cycle in Figure 2. Note that in this figure the two G(ThrP2Lys) values are within experimental error of each other as are the two G(LeuP1Arg) values.
An easy overall assessment of additivity is that the GI term (eq 3) is 0.11 kcal/mol, while the allowed interval for an additive double mutant cycle is 0.4 to -0.4 kcal/mol as given at the bottom of Table 3. This variant has Lys at P2, i.e., ThrP2Lys change from the wild type, and Ser at P1, i.e., GluP1Ser change from the wild type.
As stated in the introductory section, when, as seen frequently (20), Thr at P2 and Glu at P1 are present in the same molecule, their side chains are hydrogen bonded. To study this further, we designed a cycle where the P2Thr-P1Glu pair is gradually replaced by a hydrophobic Val-Val pair (Figure 3).
This is a highly nonadditive cycle, as the presence of Val at either P2 or P1
breaks the hydrogen bond and therefore weakens the binding of some enzymes. However, Table 4 lists the GI values for CHYM, SGPA, and SGPB and compares them to GI values for the P4R/P2K/P1R/P1S variant given in Tables 1 Table 3: Free Energies of Interaction, GI, in Kilocalories per Mole (Predicted - Measured Standard Free Energy Changes)

The match is excellent. It appears that the nonadditivity of the last variant arises from the same cause. This is because we might expect a change in the repulsive interaction between the several positive side chains upon complex formation.
Such a change might arise from a change in either the dielectric environment, the intercharge distances, or both. 
We also, somewhat hastily, expected nonadditivity from the excellent double variant studies on barnase-barstar association (21).
Barnase is a nuclease and, like most nucleases that hydrolyze highly negatively charged nucleic acids, carries a large positive charge in its combining sites. 
As many protein enzyme inhibitors mimic the enzyme substrates, the barnase inhibitor, barstar, has a highly negative combining site (for a recent review of such interactions of nucleases and their inhibitors, see ref 22).
Many of the double variant cycles on the interaction of barnase and barstar were highly nonadditive, confirming our nonadditivity expectation. In the previous studies with furin
(11) as well as in the current paper, all multiple mutations are made in the inhibitor.
In the barnase-barstar system (21), one change is made in the enzyme (barnase) and the other in the inhibitor (barstar). However, (1) the information that is obtained does not lend itself well to the construction of a predictive algorithm, and (2) the likelihood of nonadditivity is much greater than in our approach.
Therefore, the otherwise excellent paper on barnase-barstar interaction (21) does not serve us well as a predictive analogue. As stated previously, this set of variants was designed as inhibitors of furin and furin has a negative combining site as clearly demonstrated by the conversion of subtilisin BPN to an enzyme with furin-like specificity by introduction of three Asp residues into the combining region of subtilisin (23).

The interaction of these variants with furin was studied in our laboratory, and we found the P4R/P1R OMTKY3 variant to be strongly nonadditive. Also, the association equilibrium constants for wild-type OMTKY3, P4R OMTKY3, and P1R OMTKY3 were weaker than the lower bound of the measurement range.
Only the double variant P4R/P1R OMTKY3 was sufficiently strong as an inhibitor to be well FIGURE 2: Double mutant cycle (27) for an additive interaction. 
The numbers under each entry are the measured standard free energies of interaction of SGPB with the wild-type OMTKY3
(middle left), the two single variants (center at the top and bottom), and the double variant (middle right).
Note that here the G values are independent of the sequence context well within the allowed (0.40 kcal/mol;
see Table 3) experimental error. We can conclude that interactions between P2 and P1 residues that are studied here do not change on complex formation.
In this case, the standard free energy of association can be predicted from the first three values by using additivity. Note that the two values for the G(ThrP2Val) change (top left and bottom right, 2.95 kcal/mol) differ far more than the allowed experimental error of 0.4 kcal/mol (see Table 2).
The same large difference exists between the two G(GluP1Val) values (bottom left and top right, 2.95 kcal/mol). 
Making either the P2V or P1V substitution disrupts this hydrogen bond both in the free inhibitor and in the complex and produces a weakening of binding of 2.95 kcal/mol, the GI value.
Therefore, the values of G(ThrP2Val) and G(GluP1Val) are large and positive as each carries the additional 2.95 kcal/mol term as well as a smaller term associated with the substitution in a non-hydrogenbonded system. As the hydrogen bond is disrupted in both middle forms, going from the middle to the right gives only the G for the substitution in the non-hydrogen-bonded system.
G of the double mutant cannot be predicted by simple additivity because two 2.95 kcal/mol terms for rupture of the hydrogen bond would be added.

As the measurements of furin inhibition are rather difficult, we decided the results were not publishable after presenting them at a meeting. One possibility would be to change some residues in positions different from P4 and P1 to make OMTKY3 a better furin inhibitor.
The other approach is to do the experiment in a different inhibitor family, which is inherently a better furin inhibitor. The second approach was quite independently adopted by using a set of variants closely similar to our OMTKY3 set but using eglin c as the scaffold (24).
The nonadditivity observed in this case is in good quantitative agreement with our unpublished OMTKY3 results. 
Previous quantitative studies from our laboratory (25, 26)
show that (1) changes in the P1 position in OMTKY3 and in eglin c are strikingly interscaffolding additive and (2) eglin c is frequently a better inhibitor than OMTKY3 even though both share a Leu residue at P1.
The enzymes that are better inhibited by eglin c are R-lytic proteinase, Streptomyces griseus proteinases A and B, bovine chymotrypsins A and B, mosquito chymotrypsin, human cathepsin G, human leukocyte elastase, and cercarial elastase. 
Thus, the stronger inhibition of furin by analogous constructs in the eglin c frame is not unexpected, nor is the interscaffolding additivity of the results.

It appears that if only one of the interacting partners has a strongly charged regions, multiple variants made entirely in that partner will be largely additive. 
These two enzymes are very similar and generally exhibit similar G values for inhibition by natural avian ovomucoid third domains and by their variants, but in most cases, SGPA is 1 kcal/mol stronger.
The variants used in this study mostly inhibit SGPB more strongly, a reversal of the common observation. The reason for this reversal is in part due to the fact that all these variants have Arg at P1, and a single variant of this type [see Table 2, the R18 (P1R) line]
inhibits SGPB 0.5 kcal/mol more strongly than SGPA.
It seemed worthwhile to check whether the predictions are sufficiently accurate to pick up the subtle difference in SGPA and SGPB discrimination. They are correct in 10 cases out of 11. They are even correct for the last entry in Table 1 where there is a very large difference between the predicted and measured values AdditiVity and Predictability Studies Can Be Carried Out on RelatiVely Small Databases.
We received numerous wellintentioned criticisms of our additivity-based predictive algorithm (1). They can be divided into two classes. The results of both the previous (1) and the current paper show that while nonadditivity is found in some protein systems, it occurs only in a few residue pairs.
We believe that it is sufficiently rare to initially start with a fully additive model in which then we can identify and deal with relatively rare nonadditivities. It is also worth noting again that for the association of inhibitors with highly positively charged combining regions interacting with neutral combining region enzymes, nonadditivity was expected but not found. The complete algorithm
(1) required the expression of the wild type and of 190 specified variants (19 variants at each of the 10 contact positions).
Not only was the effort involved large, we were conspicuously lucky to express all 191 variants and to measure all the 1146 equilibrium constants. The current paper provides many examples of associations falling outside the current measurement range.
However, in this paper, we demonstrate that all 191 variants and 1146 measurements were not needed for the additivity analysis carried out here. Indeed, the 191 variants and 1146 measurements were not all needed for the much larger algorithm tests (1).
They were, however, all needed to provide the best possible inhibitor for each of the enzymes we study, or the most specific one or the distribution function of standard free energies of association for all possible inhibitors. 
Will Such an Approach Succeed with Other Systems? We believe it will, but we are not sure. To the best of our knowledge, a comparable amount of work was not invested in any other protein family.
It is clear that the two values of G(ProP4Arg) differ dramatically. So do the two values of G(LeuP1Arg). Further inspection shows that introducing only one Arg, either at P4 or at P1, increases the level of biding only slightly.
The nonadditivity observed here results from two Arg residues interacting with furin, which uses Asp residues to recognize its substrates (for a discussion, see the text). This effect was mistakenly expected by us for the two-Arg OMTKY3 variant interacting with CHYM, CARL, SGPA, SGPB, and HLE.
We believe that the difference between furin and these enzymes is that furins site is strongly negatively charged while the others are nearly neutral Additivity-Based Sequence to Reactivity Algorithm Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 21, 2003 6465 Difficulty in Obtaining Protein Test Samples. We already mentioned that it proved to be extremely difficult to obtain samples of Kazal inhibitors that were isolated, sequenced, and characterized by other laboratories. They are unavailable as they were exhausted in earlier experiments, lost, or discarded in laboratory cleanups. As this is in contrast to DNA (genes or plasmids), it may be worthwhile for granting agencies to take an interest in preserving the proteins, which were described in the literature with their support.
