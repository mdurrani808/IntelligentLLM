0022-2836/99/21017512 $30.00/0Different families of protein inhibitors of serine proteases share similar conformation of the enzyme-binding loop, while their scaffoldings are completely different. In the enzyme-inhibitor complex, the P1 position of the loop makes numerous contacts within the S1 pocket and signicantly inuences the energy of the interaction.
Here, we determine the association energies (Ga values) for the interaction of coded P1 variants of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) with bovine b-trypsin (BT), anionic salmon trypsin (AST), bovine a-chymotrypsin (BCHYM), and human neutrophil elastase (HNE). Next, through interscaffolding additivity cycles, we compare our set of Ga values determined for BCHYM and HNE with similar data sets available in the literature for three other inhibitor families.
In one particular case (comparison of associations of P1 variants of BPTI and OMTKY3 with BCHYM) there is a structural basis for strongly non-additive behaviour. We argue that the interscaffolding additvity depends on sequential and conformational similarities of sites where the mutation(s) are introduced and on the particular substitution.
The high correlation coefcient shows that both trypsins recognize with comparable strength the non-cognate side-chains.

(Laskowski & Kato, 1980; Janin & Chothia, 1990;
Jones & Thornton, 1996; Otlewski & Apostoluk, 1997).
Protein inhibitors do not form a singleing author:
salmon trypsin;
PTI, bovine ine b-trypsin; HNE, 3, turkey ovomucoid cyte protease msd, root-mean-group but can be divided into about 20 different families (Laskowski, 1986). Global structures of proteins representing different inhibitor families are completely different and comprise a-helical proteins, b-sheet proteins, a/b-proteins and different folds of small disulde-rich proteins (Bode &
Huber, 1992).
The inhibitor binds to the enzyme through the exposed and convex binding loop, which is complementary to the active site of the enzyme (Figure 1). Binding loops of different inhibitors adopt rather similar, so-called, canonical conformation, which is dened by the torsion angles of the P3-P3 0 segment (Pn, Pn 0 follow the notation introduced by Schechter & Berger, 1967).

The mode of recognition is always very similar and resembles that of an ideal substrate: the short antiparallel b-sheet formed between the P3 and P1# 1999 Academic Press Figure 1. Superimposition of the main-chain P3  P3 0

176 Interscaffolding Additivityresidues and the 214-216 (chymotrypsinogen numbering system) segment of an enzyme. Other important features include: short (about 2.7 A ) contact between the P1 carbonyl carbon atom and the catalytic Ser195 Og, two hydrogen bonds between the amide group of P1 and the carbonyl group of Ser214 and the side-chain of Ser195, and two hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen atom of P1 and Gly193/Ser195 amide groups.
The similar system of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, shape complementarity of interacting areas (Jones
& Thornton, 1996) and the lack of conformational adjustments during complex formation ensure very similar recognition of different proteases and inhibitors. 
In a stable enzyme-inhibitor complex, about 1012 amino acid residues on an inhibitor side and 2025 on an enzyme side are in direct contact, providing an intermolecular buried area of 600-900 A
(Janin & Chothia, 1990; Janin, 1995).
Free energies of interactions between residues forming the loop and the protease are often found to be additive
(Wells, 1990; Laskowski et al., 1989). A large part of the contacts (up to 50 %) involves the P1 residue, which is placed in the center of the loop and penetrates deeply into the S1 specicity pocket of the protease.
The principial inhibitory activity is often dictated by this position (e.g. trypsin inhibitors have Lys or Arg; chymotrypsin inhibitors have Tyr, Leu or Met). However, amino acid residues that precede or follow the P1 residue (e.g. P2 or P3 0)
and those from a sequentially remote region, called the secondary contact region, can also inuence the association energy (Laskowski et al., 1989).

Here, we determine the inuence of the P1 residue of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)
on its interaction with four serine proteases: bovine b (BT) and salmon anionic trypsins (AST), bovine a-chymotrypsin (BCHYM) and human neutrophil elastase (HNE). BPTI is a small protein (58 aminoacid residues) with three disulde bonds, welldened secondary structure and a hydrophobic core.
Crystal and solution structures of BPTI and proteins homologous to BPTI as well as their complexes with different proteases have been thoroughly characterized by X-ray crystallography
(Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975; Wlodawer et al., 1984, 1987; Hynes et al., 1990; Eigenbrot et al., 1990;
Housset et al., 1991; Arnoux et al., 1995) and NMR spectroscopy (Wagner et al., 1982; Berndt et al., 1992; Zweckstetter et al., 1996). The wild-type of BPTI forms tight complexes with a number of serine proteases (Fritz & Wunderer, 1983), particularly bovine trypsin (Ka  1.6  1013 M1 at pH 8.0) and bovine chymotrypsin (Ka  6  107 M1 at pH 8.0:
Lazdunski et al., 1974).
The BPTI mutant K15V is known to strongly inhibit pancreatic
(Ka  3.3  108 M1) and neutrophil (Ka  3.6  108 M1) elastases (Kraunsoe et al., 1996). The proteases studied here possess very different S1 binding pockets and are archetypes of trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and elastase-like enzymes.
For the latter two proteases, the precise data on binding of different P1 side-chains have recently been determined for three inhibitors: turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3; Lu et al., 1997), eglin c (Lu et al., 1997) and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor
(SLPI; Eisenberg et al., 1990). This enables the extensive quantitative analysis of analogous mutations introduced into the binding loops of different inhibitors on the binding with a serine enzyme, the interscaffolding additivity comparison (Qasim et al., 1997).
To the best of our knowledge, there is no information available on recognition energetics of different amino acid side-chain in the trypsin S1 pocket, hence, interscaffolding additivity analysis is impossible. The enzymes are about 65 % homologous and show overall displacement in their main-chain atoms of about 0.8 A (Smalas et al., 1994).
According to the kinetic data, the psychrophilic enzyme from cold-adapted sh species displays up to 20-fold lower Km toward the cognate P1 Arg substrate than mesophilic bovine protease (Smalas et al., 1994). This encouraged us to study the effect of non-cognate P1 amino acid substitutions to see whether the stronger binding is a universal property of the psychrophilic trypsin.
Thus, the comparison of association energies of the same inhibitor P1 mutants with two homologous serine proteases offers another type of interscaffolding analysis.

The (Ga) values for the association of 18 P1 mutants of BPTI with BCHYM, HNE, BT, and AST at pH 8.3 and 295 K. The estimated values for Arg and Lys side-chains based on measurements at pH 5.0 are marked with a broken line.
To facilitate further analysis, especially additivity comparisons, the Ka values were converted into the respective association free energies
(Ga   RT ln Ka at 295 K) and shown in Figure 2. The range of Ka values is particularly broad for both trypsins: about 109-fold for BT and, probably, about 1011-fold for AST.
The extremely high Ka values for P1 Arg and Lys variants with both trypsins could not be precisely determined at pH 8.3. Instead, they were determined at pH 5.0, where the interactions are weaker: the Ka value for the association of BT with the P1 Lys mutant is 3  1010 M1 and with the Arg mutant 8  1010 M1; respective values for AST are 1.3  1012 M1 and 5  1012 M1. Based on the pH-dependence of Ka for BPTI - BT interaction
(Finkenstadt et al., 1974), the estimated Ka values at pH 8.3 for Lys and Arg variants interacting with BT are 1.2  1013 M1 and 4.5  1013 M1 and for AST are 7.4  1014 M1 and 2.8  1015 M1.
The estimated value for P1 Lys BPTI - BT interaction is in agreement with Ka  1.7  1013 M1 determined at pH 8.0 (Vincent & Lazdunski 1973). 
In agreement with the narrow trypsin specicity, Lys and Arg mutants of BPTI bind to BT about 105-fold stronger than BPTI with P1 Tyr, which is the strongest binding non-cognate residue.
Aromatic (Tyr, Phe and Trp), large hydrophobic (Met and Leu) and polar (Gln, Asn, Ser and His) side-chains bind stronger than small (Gly and Ala), b-branched (Val, Ile and Thr) and acidic (Asp and Glu) residues. 
The determination of Ka values for two trypsins offers a possibility to compare binding of the same P1 side-chains to two enzymes of very similar specicity.
The correlation plot of Ga values forBT versus AST is a straight line with a slope s  0.98 and a correlation coefcient r  0.97
(Table 2). This shows that both trypsins recognize non-cognate side-chains with similar energetics and geometry of interaction.

178 Interscaffolding Additivityments at pH 5.0 show that the Ka values for cognate P1 Lys and Arg inhibitors are about 100-fold higher for AST than for BT and these data points would be clearly off the correlation plot.

It is also possible to form thermodynamic additivity cycles in which the effect of the same amino acid substitution (e.g. P1 Thr15! Phe) in BPTI is compared for two trypsins (cycle 1):where: Ga (Thr15! Phe)BT  Ga (Thr15)BT  Ga (Phe15)BT: the difference in the association free energy values between Thr15 and Phe15 mutants of BPTI interacting with BT;
Ga (Thr15! Phe)AST  Ga (Thr15)AST  Ga
(Phe15)AST: the difference in the association free energy values between Thr15 and Phe15 mutants of BPTI interacting with AST; Ga
(Thr15! Phe) Ga (Thr15! Phe)AST  Ga
(Thr15! Phe)BT: the non-additivity in association energy quantitatively describing the departure of the cycle from additivity.

For 15 mutants, we analyzed all possible 105
(15  14/2) interscaffolding additivity cycles
(Table 3). Instead, jGaj ranges from 20 to 1430 cal mol1, which suggests that non-additivity occurs essentially in all considered cases.
However, as discussed by Qasim et al. (1997), the cycle comprises four independent Ka, each with an estimated error of 20 %, equival-ent to 400 cal/mol as an acceptable additivity range of jGaj values at the 2s level. Our individual association constants were measured with an estimated error 30 % for strong associations
(Ka > 106 M1) and 50 % for weak interactions;
therefore, an average 40 % error was assumed, which is equivalent to 200 cal mol1 error in Ga and, consequently, 800 cal mol1 as an acceptable additivity range of Ga values.
In agreement with the high correlation coefcient (Table 2), 86 of 105 additivity cycles (82 %) reported in Table 3 full the additivity criteria. Some of the amino acid side-chains (Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, Tyr and His)
clearly produce additive effects.

Association constants for BCHYM and HNE Compared with trypsins, the dynamic ranges of Ka values are signicantly narrower for BCHYM, 6.3  105-fold, and HNE, 2  106-fold (Table 1 and Figure 2). The data presented are in agreement with the general conclusions on BCHYM
(Schellenberger et al., 1991; Lu et al., 1997) and HNE (Lu et al., 1997) specicities reported in the literature.
None of these enzymes shows as clear specicity toward any kind of amino acid side chain(s) as trypsins exhibit towards Arg and Lys. The P1 amino acid residues that bind strongly have medium-sized hydrophobic side-chains, including all b-branched ones, and Ala, Leu and Met.

Interscaffolding Additivity 179observed for acidic side-chains and for Gly, when the pocket remains empty after complex formation.

It is possible to compare our data with the association constants determined for OMTKY3 (Lu et al., 1997), eglin c (Qasim et al., 1997) and SLPI
(Eisenberg et al., 1990). The particularly large data set comprises 25 P1 mutants (20 coded and ve non-coded amino acids) of OMTKY3.
To facilitate comparison, our association constants were measured under identical conditions as for the association of OMTKY3 (Lu et al., 1997) and eglin c (Qasim et al., 1997) P1 variants with BCHYM and HNE. Experimental conditions for SLPI association constants measurements were somewhat different (pH 7.5, 37 C; Eisenberg et al., 1990).

Table 2 shows r and s values of the Pearson product-moment correlation for comparisons of BCHYM associations with P1 BPTI variants and other inhibitors mutants. When two (Arg and Lys) points, clearly well off the straight line, are removed, the r value changes from 0.92 to 0.99.

Similarly, the Arg and Lys data points are clearly off the plot in the BPTI versus SLPI correlation ana-Figure 3. The correlation plot for binding of BPTI and OMTKY3 P1 mutants to BCHYM expressed in the form of respective association free energies.lyzed for the association with BCHYM (data not shown), and improvement of the correlation was observed after the elimination of these two data points (Table 2).

Besides the correlations, we analyzed interscaffolding additivity in the form of a thermodynamic cycle where the effect of the same amino acid substitution (e.g. P1 Leu15! Ser) in BPTI and another inhibitor is compared for a single enzyme (Qasim et al., 1997). An example of the cycle is shown below for the association of mutants of BPTI and OMTKY3 containing either Leu or Ser at position P1 (residue 15 and 18 in BPTI and OMTKY3, respectively) with BCHYM (cycle 2).
The cycle descripition is analogous to that of cycle 1:Table 4 presents the interscaffolding additivity analysis for associations of P1 mutants of BPTI and OMTKY3 with BCHYM. For 18 P1 amino acids compared, there are (18  17/2)  153 cycles and, hence, 153 Ga non-additivity energy entries in Table 4.
In agreement with a visual inspection of the correlation plot, Lys and Arg side-chains are least additive (with a single exception for Arg Lys substitution) with Ga values approaching 4.15 kcal mol1 (Table 4). Also some other residues, particularly large aromatic ones
(Phe, Trp, Tyr and His) tend to exhibit a non-additive behaviour.
The additivity cycles were also constructed and analyzed based on data available for eglin c and SLPI. The statistics of all interscaffolding additivity cycles is given in Table 3; r and s values of different correlation plots are given in Table 2.

Both sets appear to be well correlated and no amino acid(s) seemed to be particularly off the correlation line (data not shown). Our data are also well correlated with log (kcat/Km) of Ala-Ala-Xaa substrates (Harper et al., 1984).

Discussion Binding properties of S1 pockets The proteases studied here possess very different S1 binding pockets and are the archetypes of trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and elastase-like enzymes. Since the S1 pockets of BCHYM (Lu et al., 1997; Schellenberger et al., 1991) and HNE (Lu et al., 1987; Harper et al., 1984) have been extensively characterized using large sets of coded amino acids, their properties will not be analyzed here.

Although a large number of trypsin mutants have been designed and analyzed (Perona et al., 1995), little is known about catalytic and binding energies of non-cognate amino acid side-chains to trypsin. 
For trypsin, only limited kinetic data for Suc-AlaAla-Pro-Xaa-AMC substrates (Xaa  Arg, Lys, Tyr, Phe, Leu and Trp) have been reported (Graf et al., 1988).
Our data show a large gap between Ga values for cognate and non-cognate side-chains, approaching 6.5 to 9 kcal mol1 (Figure 2). There are two sources of binding energy for the cognate side-chains: a major one, involving the ion pair formation between Asp189 at the bottom of the S1 pocket and the charge of the P1 side-chain, and an additional one resulting from the burial of the hydrophobic part of the P1 side-chain inside the pocket.
Except for the charged amino group, Lys and Met side-chains can be considered similar, since binding of -CH2- and -S- groups in the S1pockets of several serine proteases was found to be energetically equivalent (Lu et al., 1997). If we assume that enzyme-inhibitor interactions outside the specicity pocket are equivalent regardless of the identity of the P1 residue, we can eliminate all contributions that do not include the P1 side-chain by subtracting the Ga value for Gly from the association free energies for Lys and Met residues: Ga, Lys  Ga, Gly   12.03 kcal mol1 and
Ga, Met  Ga, Gly   4.60 kcal mol1. It appears that binding of the hydrophobic part of the Lys side-chain (equivalent to Met) provides 4.60 kcal mol1, while the remaining part resulting from the ion pair interaction is extremely strong: 12.03 kcal mol1  4.60 kcal mol1   7.43 kcal mol1.

As might be expected, due to the presence of Asp189 at the bottom of the trypsin pocket, placing a negatively charged P1 side-chain in the pocket is strongly disfavoured. Surprisingly, the effect is much more severe for Asp than for the longer Glu, if estimated from the comparison with the binding of respective isosteric amide groups.
We suppose that the longer and more exible side-chain of Glu can adopt a conformation that allows a more favourable interaction of its negative charge with water molecule(s) or main-chain nitrogen atoms forming the walls of the pocket. 
Binding of Gly in the pockets of both trypsins (and also of BCHYM) is similarly strongly disfavoured.
The association energy origins predominantly from the burying of the P1 side-chain hydrophobic area in the S1 pocket; hence, there is a gradual dependence of the association energy on the size of the hydrophobic side-chain, complicated further for residues with branching, polar or charged atoms (Lu et al., Figure 4. Interestingly, if the cognate trypsin Lys/Arg amino acids are eliminated, the correlation of BCHYM and AST binding energies is high and shows r  0.9 (for BT r  0.72; Figure 4 and Table 2).
This suggests that both enzymes recognize non-cognate substrates using similar binding interactions within their S1 pockets. 
Compared to BCHYM, the S1 pocket of HNE, although hydrophobic, is signicantly smaller and prefers hydrophobic amino acid side-chains of moderate size.
The dynamic character of the pocket allows favourable binding of b-branched sidechains, which are strongly disfavoured by BT, AST and BCHYM (Figure 2). Due to the small size of the pocket, binding of Gly residue is not as unfavourable as in the case of trypsin and chymotrypsin.
The size of the pocket is severely restricted by the side-chains of Val216 and Asp226, these positions are occupied by glycine both in BCHYM and in trypsins. There is virtually no correlation
(r   0.32) if the BPTI association data for noncognate side-chains of trypsins are compared with the HNE - BPTI data (for BT r   0.32 and for AST r   0.22) and if HNE/BCHYM correlation is performed for all side-chains, r  0.02 (Table 2).

This shows that, unlike the situation observed for BCHYM, the size and dynamic character of the HNE S1 pocket is a clear determinant of its specicity. 
Additivity In recent years the applicability of the thermodynamic additivity principle to protein chemistry has been tested several times, mainly through double mutant cycle analysis involving a single protein (Lu et al., 1997; Carter et al., 1984; Dill, 1997; Ackers & Smith, 1985; Wells, 1990; HorovitzFigure 5.
Structures of (a) protein inhibitors BPTI, (b) OMT tures of BPTI pdb code (Scheidig et al., 1997), OMTKY3 (PDB their complexes with BCHYM. The P3-P3 0 segment and the P et al., 1988) could not be included, as the coordinates are SYBYL software (Tripos). Qasim et al. (1997) analyzed interscaffolding additivity comparisons made between seven P1 mutants of OMTKY3 and eglin c, which do not share a common fold (Figure 5), but show extremely similar conformations of their binding loops (Figure 1).
In the rst one we checked whether introduction of the same amino acid substitutions into structurally and functionally equivalent regions in different inhibitors will produce the same effect on the association with a particular protease. We have chosen the P1 position of BPTI, which is the bestknown protease inhibitor, but had not been extensively mutated at its P1 site before.
Taking into account the amino acid sequence and main-chainKY3 and (c) eglin c. Ribbon diagram of the crystal struccode 1HJA), and eglin c (Frigerio et al., 1992) as seen in 1 side-chain are shown as darker. The Figure was drawn with 182 Interscaffolding Additivityrmsd values, the binding loop of BPTI is more dissimilar both from OMTKY3 and eglin c loops than OMTKY3 loop is from eglin c (Figure 1 and Table 5) and offers a possibility of structurally more remote comparison than OMTKY3/eglin c
(Qasim et al., 1997).
We determined the association energies for 17 P1 mutants of BPTI and the recombinant wild-type inhibitor (Met52! Leu) and compared them with the data available in the literature for OMTKY3, eglin c and SLPI inhibitors. 
The most extensive additivity comparison comprises binding of P1 mutants of BPTI and OMTKY3 to BCHYM.
They involve mainly small side-chains of Asn, Asp, Val, Gly, Met, Thr and Ala. On the contrary, long or bulky side-chains of Arg, Lys, Phe, Tyr and Trp belong to the least additive ones, suggesting different modes of interaction with the S1 pocket of BCHYM Fortunately, in the case of P1 Lys mutants highresolution crystal structures are available for BCHYM complexes with BPTI (Scheidig et al., 1997) and OMTKY3 (PDB code 1HJA). The comparison of both structures reveals the completely different conformations of the P1 side-chain.
In the OMTKY3 - BCHYM complex, the side-chain of Lys extends directly into the pocket, as in typical trypsin complexes (Figure 6). In the BPTI - BCHYM complex, the side-chain of Lys15 bends away from Ser189 and forms two hydrogen bonds with the main-chain atoms of enzyme Ser217 (2.8 A ) and Pro13(P3) of inhibitor (3.0 A ).
Moreover, the Arg side-chain in a BCHYM complex of Alzheimer's amyloid b-protein precursor (Scheidig et al., 1997), which is highly homologous to BPTI, shows exactly the same bending and difference in interactions as observed for BPTI complexed with BCHYM. The average value of the non-additivity factor is 2.32 kcal mol1 for all cycles involving Lys and 2.46 kcal mol1 for cycles involving Arg.

This value is a measure of the above-mentioned charged hydrogen bonds that are formed by P1 Lys in the BPTI - BCHYM complex, and is in agreement with the experimentally determined G value of charged hydrogen bonds (Fersht, 1987). 
The Arg and Lys data points also lead to a clear non-additivity in the case of BCHYM associationTable 5.

A similar analysis of other strongly non-additive effects is impossible, due to a lack of respective spatial structures. 
The OMTKY3/eglin c interscaffolding additivity comparison determined for their interaction with six different proteases gives 69 % additivity at IGaI < 800 cal mol1 (Qasim et al., 1997).
It seems plausible that the larger non-additivity observed here results from different loop sequences of BPTI: Pro(P3)-Cys(P2)-Lys(P1) and OMTKY3: Cys(P3)-Thr(P2)-Lys(P1) and larger difference in the conformations of their loops as indicated in Table 5. This is clearly seen from rmsd values operating in torsion angles: while for the P3-P3 0 segment of OMTKY3/eglin c the rmsd value is 20 , it is about 56  for BPTI/OMTKY3 and BPTI/eglin c superimpositions (Table 5). In conclusion, we argue that interscaffolding additivity may depend on the sequential and conformational similarity of the regions where the mutation(s) is introduced, and on a particular substitution, e.g the presence of Pro at P3, P2 or P1 sites may lead to the non-additive behaviour.

In the second approach, we analyzed the opposite situation: two different enzymes of very similar specicity were tested for their association energy with P1 variants of the same inhibitor. BT and AST show about 65 % amino acid sequence homology and are very similar in the architecture of their S1 specicity pockets.
The mean rmsd value for the main-chain atoms of nine residues forming the S1 pocket (189 bottom, 190-192 and 214-220 walls) is 0.13 A and 0.27 A if the side-chains are included
(Smalas et al., 1994). Among the nine residues forming the pocket, there is one amino acid difference between the two proteases (Ser217 in BT, Tyr217 in AST).
This change does not seem to affect the afnity toward substrates, as the sidechain of residue 217 points away from the active site and makes interactions mostly with the solvent
(Smalas et al., 1994). Nevertheless, AST was foundthe P3-P3 0 seqments of BPTI, OMTKY3, elgin c and SLPI lin c and SLPI P1 0 P2 0 P3 0

P1 Lys side-chains of two inhibitors BPTI (darker) (Scheidig et al., 1997) and OMTKY3 (lighter) (PDB code 1HJA) bound to the S1 pocket of BCHYM. 
Interscaffolding Additivity 183to hydrolyze amide bonds at cognate P1 Arg up to 40-fold more efciently than BT, primarily due to the 20-fold decrease in Michaelis constant (Outzen et al., 1996).
Our measurements at pH 5 also show respectively 40 and 60-fold stronger association of Lys and Arg side-chains to AST. The direct hydrogen bond between Nx of P1 Lys and Od2 of Asp189
(Helland et al., 1998), which is not observed in the BT - BPTI complex (Huber et al., 1974), is a likely reason for stronger binding of cognate side-chains.

Another, not observed in the BT - BPTI complex, hydrogen bond P1 N - 214 O should equally stabilize all other P1 BPTI - AST complexes, compared to BT complexes, but this does not occur. Instead, there is a very good correlation between AST and BT for binding of non-cognate P1 mutants (Table 2).

This is, perhaps, not surprising, since the correlations for BT/BCHYM and AST/BCHYM are also good, if cognate Lys and Arg substrates are eliminated (Figure 4 and Table 2). 
In summary, the binding properties of BT, AST and BCHYM pockets are similar for non-cognate substrates of trypsin.
The tune-up of trypsin specicity towards cognate substrates is possible through hydrogen bond(s) from the P1 side-chain to Asp189. The further increase of binding energy observed for the interaction of AST with Lys and Arg may result from the formation of direct hydrogen bonds, instead of water-mediated ones present in the S1 pocket of BT (Helland et al., 1998).
The structural differences between BT, AST and BCHYM pockets on one hand, and HNE on the other, are not restricted to one particular substitution within the pocket, but manifest in pocket size and dynamics, leading to completely changed specicity pattern also toward non-cognate amino acids.

Expression and purification of BPTI mutants All P1 mutants of BPTI were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS using the phage T7 system (Studier et al., 1990), as described
(Staley & Kim, 1994).
All mutants used in this study contained additional mutation Met! Leu at position 52 to enable cleavage of the fusion protein by CNBr. Purication of BPTI mutants was performed as described 184 Interscaffolding Additivity(Krokoszynska et al., 1998).
To ensure high purity, mutant proteins were puried both in the reduced and the oxidized state on a Vydac C18 semi-preparative HPLC column. Solvents A (0.1 % TFA) and B (90 %
acetonitrile, 0.1 % TFA) were mixed with a linear gradient of 10 % to 60 % solvent B (1.5 ml/minute ow).
Oxidation of BPTI variants (104 M protein concentration)
was performed in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.7), 6  104 M reduced glutathione and 3  104 M oxidized glutathione, 1 mM EDTA, 4 M urea for one hour at 45 C. A typical yield of oxidative refolding was 30-50 % (7 to 10 mg of pure protein per liter of culture medium). The P1 Pro and Cys variants could not be produced, as HPLC chromatograms showed accumulation of many single and double-disulde intermediates and no peak corresponding to natively folded protein.

Mass spectrometry Electrospray mass spectrometry of all genetic variants used in this study was performed with a Finnigan MAT TSQ-700 equipped with ESI source (USA). Molecular masses of all variants were within 1.0 atomic mass unit from those expected from amino acid sequences, as found by electrospray mass spectrometry.

Standardisation of enzyme, inhibitor and substrate stock solutions Bovine b-trypsin and a-chymotrypsin were dissolved in 1 mM HCl, 20 mM CaCl2 to obtain the stock of about 1  104 M. Salmon anionic trypsin (1  105 M) was dissolved in 25 mM diethanolamine, 0.14 M NaCl, pH 5.5; a 6  105 M solution of HNE was prepared in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.2 M NaCl. The exact concentrations of trypsins stock solutions were determined by NPGB titration (Chase & Shaw 1970).
Concentrations of chymotrypsin and HNE were, in turn, determined by titration with turkey ovomucoid. 
The P1 BPTI variants were prepared in 1 mM HCl at 102  104 M. Concentrations of variants that do not strongly inhibit any of the proteases (Ka < 108 M1) were determined spectrophotometrically, assuming a molar absorbance coefcient of 5720 M1cm1 at 275 nm for BPTI (Kosen et al., 1981).
In the case of strong inhibitors
(Ka > 108 M1), concentration was determined by titration with a standarized solution of trypsin, chymotrypsin or HNE. All substrates were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); 4-Nitrophenyl 4-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride (NPGB) was dissolved in 20 %
acetonitrile in DMSO.

Equilibrium association constants The equilibrium association constants were determined in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.3 at 22 C), 20 mM CaCl2, 0.01 % (v/v) Triton X-100 (HNE buffer additionally contained 0.5 M NaCl) using a described procedure (Empie
& Laskowski, 1982; Otlewski & Zbyryt, 1994). The association constants between wild-type BPTI and P1 Arg BPTI and both trypsins were also measured in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 20 mM CaCl2, 0.01 %
Triton X-100.
Increasing concentrations of inhibitor wereadded to the constant concentration of appropriate protease and after a suitable incubation time the residual enzyme activity was measured using turn-over substrate on a HP8452A diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard) or on a microplate reader Spectra Max 340
(Molecular Devices). In order to prevent substrateinduced dissociation of the complex, the substrates were used at concentrations ve to ten times lower than the respective Km values.
This problem was particularly serious during the determination of low association constants. In these cases, substrates with a poor kcat/Km index were chosen. The experimental data were tted to the equation (Empie & Laskowski, 1982):
E  0:5 fE0  F I0  K1 a


E0  F I0  K1 a  4 E0  F I0g q 1
where [E0] and [I0] are total enzyme and inhibitor concentrations, respectively; [E] is residual enzyme concentration; F is the enzyme-inhibitor equimolarity factor.

The low Ka values (below 106 M1) were determined from two parameter ts, Ka and [E0] were variable and F was xed at the default value (F  1).
