Mutations of four acidic residues of barstar, D35A, D39A, E76A and E80A, decreased the binding free energies by 17.2, 25.2, 3.8 and 2.1 kJmol1, respectively, in the presence of 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 and 25
C. The changes of the hydrated structures of the complexes caused by the mutations were localized around the mutational site,
suggesting that difference in the binding free energy is closely correlated with difference in the local hydrated structure.
Then, the averaged binding free energy was estimated at 4.4 kJmol1 per water-mediated indirect interaction on the basis of the difference in hydrogen bonding network. Recent studies have shown that water-mediated indirect interactions are as important as direct interactions in the stability and specificity of interaction.
The interaction between barnase (bn), an extracellular ribonuclease of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and its intracellular inhibitor barstar
(bs), is an excellent system for investigating the interaction mediated by hydrated water, because the complex bites many water molecules in the interface [1]. One of the great advantages in this system is structural robustness of barnase and barstar; the unbound and bound structures of barnase and barstar determined by X-ray crystallography [14] and NMR spectroscopy
[5,6] shows that formation of their complex requires little conformational changes such that the rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) of all Ca atoms between the unbound and bound conformations is less than 0.5 A for both proteins.
In addition, the structures of both proteins are also robust for mutations; more* Corresponding author. 
doi:10.1016/j.chemphys.2004.05.010than 130 and 30 mutations did not change the whole structures of barnase and barstar, respectively [711].

The kinetics of binding and thermodynamic properties of the complex has been investigated using stoppedflow fluorescence measurements [1218], showing that complex formation is extremely fast and the complex form is very stable. Mutational studies indicated that a few residues at the interface of the complex played an important role for the complex conformation; mutating any one of bnLys27, bnHis102, bsAsp35 and bs
Asp39 increased the dissociation rate by 26 orders of magnitude [15,16], suggesting that electrostatic interaction between charged groups of the proteins mainly contributed to the stability of the complex.
The X-ray crystallographic analysis for the complex revealed that these residues formed many intermolecular hydrogen bonds mediated by water molecules as well as many hydrogen bonds directly bridging both proteins. 
Here, we focused on four negatively charged residues of barstar, Asp35, Asp39, Glu76 and Glu80, and substituted each one of them by Ala. At first, the kinetic constants for binding of pseudo-wild-type (pwt) or each four mutant barstar to wild-type (wt) barnase were measured by surface plasmon resonance measurement,
and then the binding free energies were derived from the 112 T. Ikura et al. / Chemical Physics 307 (2004) 111119kinetic constants.
Then, the hydrated structures of the four complexes, bn (wt)bs (pwt), bn (Q2A)bs (D35A),
bn (wt)bs (E76A) and bn (wt)bs (E80A), were determined by cryogenic X-ray crystallography. Comparing the hydrated structures of the three mutant complexes with that of wild-type one, the structural difference was localized around the mutational sites.
The rearrangements of hydrogen bond networks by the mutations were also limited around the mutational sites, though they were sometimes accompanied with movement,
penetration and escape of a few water molecules. A water molecule penetrated the cavity created by the mutation D35A, while a water molecule left from a rim of the interface exposed by the mutation E76A or E80A.

These aspects suggest that difference in the binding free energy between wild-type complex and each mutant complex results from difference in the local hydrated structure between them. Supposing that difference in the hydrogen bond network mainly contributes to difference in the binding free energy, the averaged free energies to form a direct intermolecular hydrogen bond and a water-mediated intermolecular hydrogen bond are calculated at 10.5 and 4.4 kJmol1, respectively, by three simultaneous equations.
In addition, penetration of a water molecule is estimated to destabilize the complex formation by about 2.3 kJmol1.2. Protein expression and purification Expression plasmids of wild-type barnase and barstar C40/82A were gifts from Sir A.R. Fersht.
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed for the barnase and the double mutant barstar by Quik Change (Stratagene,
USA). All the mutant barstar genes presented in this paper were newly constructed, though they were described somewhere [15].
In this paper, we described barstar C40/82A as pwt barstar because this double mutant barstar used to be regarded as the reduced form of wt barstar in a number of studies
[1517,21]. A mutation from this double mutant barstar was not described as a triple mutation, e.g., D35A/
C40A/C82A, but as a single mutation, e.g., D35A, in order to avoid verbiage.
Surface plasmon resonance measurement Surface plasmon resonance measurements for the barnasebarstar interaction were performed by BIAcore X (Biacore AB, Sweden). Wild-type barnase was immobilized at a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore AB, Sweden)
by the standard amine coupling technique.
Various concentrations of pwt barstar and its mutants wereprepared in 10 mM N -2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N 0-2ethanesulfonic acid (Hepes) buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 3 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 0.005% polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) (running buffer). The association was measured by injecting 40 ll of barstar over immobilized barnase at a flow rate of 20 ll min1 for 2 min in the running buffer, while the dissociation was measured by injecting the running buffer alone.
The surface of the chip was regenerated with 10 mM glycine buffer (pH 2.0) at the end of each measurement. All measurements were performed at 25 C Experimental data were analyzed with the BIAevaluation program 3.1 (Biacore AB, Sweden).2.3. Crystallization and structure determination Crystals used for X-ray diffraction studies were grown at 20 C by vapor diffusion in a hanging drop
configuration.
Protein concentrations were 1.05.8 mM for the complexes which were formed by 1:1 mixture of barnase and barstar, and 1 or 2 ll of the protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of an equilibrating buffer in a well in a sealed chamber containing 500 ll of equilibrating buffer. The equilibrating buffer was optimized for each complex; the complex bn (wt)bs (pwt)
was crystallized in 0.1 M 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3propanediol hydrochloride (TrisHCl) (pH 8.8) containing 24% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate and 8% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; the complex bn (Q2A)bs (D35A) was crystallized in 0.1 M disodium hydrogenphosphate (pH 9.1) containing 20%
PEG 3350; the complex bn (wt)bs (E76A) was crystallized in 0.1 M TrisHCl (pH 8.5) containing 22%
PEG 8000, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate and 6% 2-propanol; the complex bn (wt)bs (E80A) was crystallized in 0.1 M TrisHCl (pH 8.5) containing 22% PEG 8000, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate.
Diffraction data for bn (wt)bs (pwt) and bn (wt)bs
(E76A) collected at beamline BL40B2 in SPring-8 were integrated and scaled with HKL2000 (HKL Research Inc., VA), while diffraction data for bn (Q2A)bs
(D35A) and bn (wt)bs (E80A) collected with a suite system of FR-E and RAXIS-VII (Rigaku, Japan) were integrated and scaled with CrystalClear (Rigaku, Japan). The space group is C2 with unit cell dimensions a  200:3, 197.8, 200.1 and 200.8 A, b  43:8, 44.3, 43.9 and 44.0 A, c  83:3, 83.5, 83.2 and 83.8 A, and b  110:6, 110.9, 110.3 and 110.4, respectively, for bn (wt)bs (pwt), bn (Q2A)bs (D35A), bn (wt)bs
(E76A) and bn (wt)bs (E80A) with three complexes per asymmetrical unit.
The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of bn (wt)
bs (pwt) reported by Buckle et al. (1994) (the PDB code T. Ikura et al. / Chemical Physics 307 (2004) 111119 1131brs) as the search model in CNS [22]. Kinetics of the interaction between barnase and barstar Barnase and barstar form a very tight complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) on the order of 10141013 M [24].
Since it is difficult to directly measure the dissociation constant with such magnitude, kinetic measurements using stopped-flow technique have usually been performed to calculate it
[1416,25]. However, it is impossible to measure both of the association and the dissociation for the identical sample; the tritiumhydrogen exchanging reaction with [3H]-labeled barstar is performed to measure the dissociation rate (koff ), while the fluorescence intensity changed by the interaction is monitored to determine the association rate (kon).
Here, kinetic measurement of barnasebarstar interaction performed by surface plasmon resonance has an advantage such that both the association and the dissociation are performed for the identical sample, and then all the kinetic and equilibrium constants of the interaction is simultaneously determined by the global fitting of a theoretical equation to the experimental data. So we measured kinetics of the interaction between barnase and barstar at pH 7.4 and 25 C by surface plasmon resonance.
At first,
the interaction between wt barnase and pwt barstar was measured because the absolute values of the rate constants were affected by the immobilization of barnase. Then, the dissociation constant and the binding free energy were calculated at 1.32 1010 M and 56.7 kJmol1, respectively (Table 1).
The kon was smaller by three-orders of magnitude than that measured by stopped-flowTable 1 Association (kon) and dissociation (koff ) rate constants of wt barnase with pw Barstar kon ( 105 s1 M1) koff (s1) K pwt 8.74 1.15 104 1 D35A 2.14 2.73 102 1 D39A 1.55 4.57 101 2 E76A 8.97 4.75 104 5 E80A 8.62 2.28 104 2 aAll rate constants were measured in 10 mMHepes (pH 7.4) containing 150 surface plasmon resonance.

d The difference in the binding free energy between pwt and mutant proteimethod, while the koff was larger by one-order of magnitude than that measured by tritiumhydrogen exchange method [15]. These kinetic and equilibrium values observed in the present study, however, implies that the interaction between barnase and barstar is still strong even if barnase is immobilized.

One of four acidic residues of barstar Asp35, Asp39,
Glu76 and Glu80 was substituted by Ala to perturb the intermolecular interactions between barnase and barstar. The interactions between wt barnase and each of these mutant barstars were then measured under the same condition as that applied to the measurement of the bn (wt)bs (pwt) interaction.
These mutant proteins had the association rate constants of approximately 105106 M1 s1, which were not significantly different from that of pwt barstar as was seen in other experiments [15]. In contrast, the dissociation rate constants for these mutant proteins increased by from 2-folds to three-orders of magnitude.
Such varieties of the dissociation rate constants suggest that these mutations affect the site-specific interactions formed in the complex,
namely intermolecular hydrogen bonds and salt bridges related to the mutated residues of barstar. Difference in the binding free energy (DDGb) between pwt barstar and each mutant is then calculated at 17.2 kJmol1 for barstar D35A, 25.2 kJmol1 for barstar D39A, 3.8 kJmol1 for barstar E76A and 2.1 kJmol1 for barstar E80A (Table 1).
Instead of large discrepancies in the absolute value of the rate constant, the differences in the binding free energy measured by surface plasmon resonance are surprisingly similar to those measured by stopped-flow method
(Table 1), implying that the differences in the binding free energy resulted from the differences in the local environments around the mutated residues of barstar because the difference in the reaction field, e.g., in solution versus on a chip, did not affect these free energy differences.t and mutant barstara d

T. Ikura et al. / Chemical Physics 307 (2004) 111119 115methionine residue could not be observed in other chains and other crystals. Because, the residue in any one of three chains D, E and F of barstar is located at the crystal contact, a little difference in crystallizing condition affected the packing and flexibility of the Nterminal residue, and then allowed only the N-terminal methionine residues of the three chains to occupy a definite position.
This methionine residue is assigned a residue number zero to keep the original numbering scheme [21]. 
For pwt barstar, two crystal structures of the complex, 1BGS [2] and 1BRS [1], are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
Although they belong to the space group C2 with three complexes per asymmetrical unit in common, the crystals are different in orientations of three molecules in the asymmetrical unit from each other. Moreover, the complex structures in 1BRS lack the loop regions of barstar, while the numbers of water molecules in 1BGS are too small to analyze the watermediated interactions.
The crystal parameters and the orientations of the molecules in an asymmetrical unit are quite similar to those of 1BRS. Although the resolution of the crystal was a bit lower (2.3 A) than that of 1BRS (2.0 A), the loop regions of barstar and 498 water molecules were observed because dynamics of the molecules were diminished at 100 K (Table 2).

For the mutant barstar D35A, the crystal structure of a complex bn (Q2A)bs (D35A) was applied to further investigation instead of the crystal structure of bn (wt)
bs (D35A). Since the crystal of bn (wt)bs (D35A) had large mosaic and low resolution (data now shown),
several residues of barnase were mutated at the crystal contact in order to improve the quality of the crystal.
A mutation of barnase Q2A was then found to form of the crystal of the complex bn (Q2A)bs (D35A) with higher quality. Although the crystallizing condition was different from that for bn (wt)bs (D35A), the space group and the orientation of the molecules were identical to that of the crystal bn (wt)bs (D35A).

For the mutant barstars E76A and E80A, the complexes were crystallized under the identical condition,but 6% 2-propanol was added only into the crystallizing solution of the complex bn (wt)bs (E76A) to improve the quality of the crystal. 
3.3. Intermolecular interaction at the interface The interface of barnasebarstar interaction consists of 20 residues of barnase and 18 residues of barstar
(Fig. 2).
Two types of intermolecular interactions should work at the interface; hydrophobic and hydrophilic interaction. The hydrophobic interaction corresponds to a broad interaction between hydrophobic side-chains rather than a specific interaction.
In addition, it is well-known that the contribution of hydrophobic interaction to binding free energy correlate closely to the buried surface area by complex formation [26,27]. The buried surface area for the complex formation is calculated at about 14601570
A2 which depends on the mutants; the area averaged over three complexes in the asymmetrical unit is 1558 A2 for bn (wt)bs (pwt), 1459 A2 for bn (Q2A)bs (D35A),
1568 A2 for bn (wt)bs (E76A) and 1552 A2 for bn (wt)
bs (E80A).
Then, the difference in the buried surface area is 99 A2 for bn (Q2A)bs (D35A), )10 A2 for bn
(wt)bs (E76A) and 6 A2 for bn (wt)bs (E80A). Thus,
the correlation between the buried surface area and the 116 T. Ikura et al. / Chemical Physics 307 (2004) 111119binding free energy determined by the experiments cannot always be confirmed in the present study.
As an example, the mutation of barstar E76A increased the buried surface area by 10 A2 but decreased the binding free energy by 3.8 kJmol1. Such poor correlation might correspond to the fact that the electrostatic interaction between polar residues is dominant in the barnase
barstar interaction [28,29].

On the other hand, the hydrophilic interaction corresponds to a hydrogen bond and a salt bridge between polar groups of main-chain and side-chain. In the present study, 14 direct hydrogen bonds between barnase and barstar were observed at the interface of the complex bn (wt)bs (pwt) (Table 4).
The mutant complexes lacked the hydrogen bonds related to the mutational sites, but still kept the rest of the hydrogen bonds;
a hydrogen bond between Ng2 nitrogen atom of bn
Arg59 and Od1 oxygen atom of bsAsp35 was lacked only in the complexes bn (Q2A)bs (D35A), while a hydrogen bond between Ng1 nitrogen atom of bn
Arg59 and Oe1 oxygen atom of bsGlu76 was lacked only in the complex bn (wt)bs (E76A). Since no hydrogen bonds were related to bsGlu80, the mutant complex bn (wt)bs (E80A) kept all the hydrogen bonds detected in the wild-type complex bn (wt)bs (pwt),
because of no direct hydrogen bonds between any one residue of barnase and Glu80 of barstar.
Conservation of all the direct hydrogen bonds, except for only the hydrogen bond related to the mutational sites, implies that effect of the mutation on the barnasebarstar interaction was localized to its mutational site. Moreover,
even though the direct hydrogen bonds are major contributors to the binding free energy, the binding free energy does not be determined only by the direct hydrogen bonds.
As an example, the mutation of barstar E80A decreased the binding free energy by 2.1 kJmol1,
though it did not change the number of the direct hydrogen bonds (Tables 1 and 4).Table 4 Direct interactions between barnase and barstar (hydrogen bonding pairs)

For the wild-type complex bn (wt)bs
(pwt), 31 water molecules found within 3.4 A of both proteins were classified into three groups (Fig. 2).
Six molecules of the first group were buried into the surface cavity and bound to either barnase or barstar. The hydrogen bonds of these water molecules have relatively long life time as shown by molecular dynamics simulation (data not shown).

Eleven molecules of the second group mediated the interaction between both proteins through hydrogen bonds of barnaseH2Obarstar (Table 5). These molecules have relatively low B-factor values because of stabilization by hydrogen bonding with both proteins.

Some of theses water molecules have more than one hydrogen bond with barnase, though they have only one hydrogen bond with barstar. 
These molecules are bound to either barnase or barstar,
and they have relatively large B-factor values and accessible surface area.
Molecular dynamics simulations of the complex also showed that the water molecules occupying the hydration sites of the third group had relatively short life time (data not shown). Although the molecules of the third group as well as those of the first group do not directly mediate the barnaseH2Obarstar interactions, they must contribute to the stability of the complex.

Most of the water molecules observed at the interface of the wild-type complex were also conserved at the interfaces of the mutant complexes, though the water molecules observed at the surface exposed to the bulk water were not always conserved.

T. Ikura et al. / Chemical Physics 307 (2004) 111119 117groups were well-conserved except for the neighborhood of the mutational sites. The water-mediated indirect interactions such as barnaseH2Obarstar are summarized in Table 5 for the three mutant complexes as well as the wild-type complex.

The mutation of barstar D35A broke three hydrogen bonds between barstar and water of the second group,
except for one direct hydrogen bond between barnase and barstar (Fig. 3(a)). A water molecule then penetrated into the cavity created by the mutation, and occupied the position almost identical to that occupied by Od2 oxygen atom of bsAsp35.
The water molecule then newly formed two hydrogen bonds with main-chain amide atom of bnArg59 and Od2 oxygen atom of bn
Glu60. Another water molecule, which mediated the interaction between Ne nitrogen atom of bnArg59 and Od1 oxygen atom of bsAsp35 before the mutation, left from the nitrogen atom of bnArg59 and approached the main-chain amide atom of bnArg59.

The mutation of barstar E76A broke a hydrogen bond between Oe1 oxygen atom of bsGlu76 and water of the third group, except for one direct hydrogen bond between barnase and barstar (Fig. 3(b)). Before the mutation, the water molecule formed a hydrogen bond with a water molecule of the third group bound to Ng1 nitrogen atom of bnArg59.
After the mutation, the water molecule left from the site because of lack of the hydrogen bond with the side-chain of barstar. Two water molecules were also observed around the sidechain of bnArg59 before the mutation, though they were a bit far from their optimal positions for hydrogen bonding formation with the side-chain of bnArg59.

Since the room created by the mutation allowed them to move to their optimal positions, each of the two water molecules formed a hydrogen bond with the side-chain of bnArg59. 
118 T. Ikura et al. / Chemical Physics 307 (2004) 111119The mutation of barstar E80A only broke a hydrogen bond between Oe2 oxygen atom of bsGlu80 and water of the third group (Fig. 3(c)).

In summary, the mutations of barstar D35A, E76A and E80A variously changed the barnasebarstar interactions, but the changes of the interactions resulted from changes of the hydrated structures localized at the mutational sites.4. Discussion 4.1. Reliability of numbers and positions of hydrated water molecules at the interface When the water-mediated proteinprotein interaction is evaluated, all the water molecules existing at the interface should be taken in consideration.
However, we cannot determine the position of a molecule or detect the existence of the molecule if the position of the molecule is highly disordered or random in the unit cell,
because the ordered structure is required to determine the atomic position by X-ray crystallography. Therefore, even if no molecules are detected anywhere by this technique, the experimental data does not always deny the existence of a molecule.
Here, we examined numbers and positions of water molecules which were located at the interface and were undetectable by X-ray crystallography. A program dowser was performed for this purpose, because this program surveyed the structure of a protein to locate internal cavities and assess the hydrophilicity of these cavities and then determined positions and orientations of the water molecules in the internal sites [30].
Calculating for the structure of the wild-type complex without the crystal water molecules,
this program finally put nine water molecules at the interface (Fig. 2). Those positions were identical to the positions of the crystal water molecules, suggesting that the disordered water molecules did not exist at the internal space of the interface.

4.2. Evaluation of the free energy for direct and indirect interactions In general, the binding free energy of the protein
protein interaction should be evaluated in consideration of changes of entropy and enthalpy by the binding. 
However, the compensation between entropy and enthalpy is too complicated to estimate the contribution of a single specific interaction such as a hydrogen bond to the total binding free energy.
Here, the barnasebarstar interaction is an ideal model system because this system can exclude a couple of side effects, e.g., large confor-mational changes in binding and mutation. The mutational studies on the barnasebarstar interaction indicated that change of the binding free energy by a mutation was closely correlated with change of the hydrated structure by the mutation.
Then, the change of the hydrated structure can be resolved into the change of the hydrogen bonding network. Since a hydrogen bond can be dealt as a discrete interaction, we can calculate the free energy contribution per hydrogen bond if we suppose several assumptions as follows: (1) difference in numbers of hydrogen bonds is directly correlated to difference in the binding free energy; (2) the free energy contribution of a hydrogen bond is independent of the environment surrounding the hydrogen bond; (3) the free energy contribution of a direct hydrogen bond between proteins is different from that of a water-mediated indirect hydrogen bond; and (4) the free energy contribution of breaking a water-mediated indirect hydrogen bond is equivalent to that of dehydration of the functional group.
In addition, penetration of a water molecule into the interface must contribute to the binding free energy. Now we have three simultaneous equations for the three mutations
DGdirect  DGwater  DGpenetrate  17:2 for the mutation of barstar D35A;
DGdirect  DGwater  DGpenetrate  3:8 for the mutation of barstar E76A;
 DGwater  DGpenetrate  2:1 for the mutation of barstar E80A;
where DGdirect;DGwater and DGpenetrate represent the free energy contribution per direct hydrogen bond, the free energy contribution per water-mediated indirect hydrogen bond, and the free energy contribution per penetrating water, respectively.
Finally, we obtained 10.5 kJmol1 of DGdirect 4.4 kJmol1 of DGwater and )2.3 kJmol1 of DGpenetrate by simple algebraic calculation. 
The value of DGdirect is consistent with the free energy value of the typical hydrogen bonding formation, 830 kJmol1.
The value of DGwater is almost half of that of DGdirect suggesting that water-mediated indirect interaction has large contribution to the complex formation,
though insertion of a water molecule weakens the interaction. The negative value of DGpenetrate indicates that penetration of a water molecule destabilizes the complex formation.
Although these values of DGdirect;DGwater and DGpenetrate depend on the experimental conditions, e.g.,
temperature, pH, ionic strength, the relativity between DGdirect and DGwater must be conserved under the different conditions. Since the evaluation performed here is quite primitive, the values of the binding free energy for these interactions should be refined by the doublemutant cycles [31,32].
