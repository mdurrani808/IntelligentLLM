Both natural evolution and protein engineering often change the P1 residue to greatly alter the specicity and the binding strength.
To systematize such results we have obtained all 20 coded P1 variants of one such inhibitor, turkey ovomucoid third domain, by recombinant DNA technology. The association equilibrium constants were measured at pH 8.30, 21 (2)C, for interaction of these variants with six well characterized serine proteinases with hydrophobic S1 cavities.
The enzyme names are followed by the best, worst and most specic coded residue for each. Bovine chymotrypsin Aa (Tyr, Pro, Trp), porcine pancreatic elastase (Leu/Ala, Arg, Ala), subtilisin Carlsberg (Cys, Pro, Glu), Streptomyces griseus proteinase A
(Cys, Pro, Leu) and B (Cys, Pro, Lys) and human leukocyte elastase (Ile, Asp, Ile).
The data set was merged with Ka values for ve non-coded variants at P1 of turkey ovomucoid third domain obtained in our laboratory by enzymatic semisynthesis. The ratios of the highest to the lowest Ka for each of the six enzymes range from 106 to 108.
The dominant force for binding to these pockets is the hydrophobic interaction. Excess steric bulk (too large for the pocket), awkward shape (Pro, Val and Ile), polarity (Ser) oppose interaction.

We suggest that these may serve as a quantitative description of the specicity of the enzymes at P1. The sets of Streptomyces griseus proteinases A and B and of the two elastases are strongly positively correlated.

Strikingly, chymotrypsin and pancreatic elastase are negatively correlated
(0.10). Such correlations can be usefully extended to many other enzymes and to many other binding pockets to provide a general measure of pocket binding specicity.

The numbering system, now widely employed for all avian ovomucoid third domains, starts from the hydrolysis site by Staphyloccocus aureus proteinase V8
(Weber et al., 1981). The arrow indicates the reactive site peptide bond, which serves as the origin of Schecter &
Berger (1967) Pn, P0n notation.
The consensus set of residues that contact the enzyme in various complexes
(Apostol et al., 1993) is darkened. Most variants studied were third domains proper or the ``short forms'' 6-56.
The natural

& Berger, 1967 numbering) to the S1 cavity of the enzyme. Millions of students learn that trypsin is specic for Arg and Lys P1 side-chains because of the presence of Asp189 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) at the bottom of its S1 pocket.
Similarly, chymotrypsin prefers Tyr, Trp, Phe, Leu and Met P1 residues because of its commodious S1 pocket with neutral Ser189 at the bottom of it. 
Ovomucoid is a major glycoprotein in avian eggwhites whose single polypeptide chain consists of three tandem Kazal family{ domains, each with a single, actual or putative, reactive site for inhibition of serine proteinases (Kato et al., 1976, 1978, 1987) Rhodes et al. (1960) showed that ovomucoids from various, closely related species of birds exhibit striking variation in inhibitory activity and specicity.
We have found that such variation persists when third domains (Figure 1) are examined alone
(Empie & Laskowski, 1982; S. J. Park et al., unpublished results) and that it is due to much more rapid xation of mutations in the enzyme-inhibitor contact region compared to the rest of the inhibitor molecule (Laskowski et al., 1987; 1990; Apostol et al., 1993). We have attributed this hypervariability to positive Darwinian selection (Laskowski et al., 1988).

The reasons for the choice of turkey ovomucoid third domain as the wild type are the approximately equal inhibition of all six enzymes we study and the ready availability. Ovomucoid third domains are among the best studied of all small proteins and of protein inhibitors of serine proteinases.
The three-dimensional structures of two free ovomucoid third domains, Japanese quail (Weber et al., 1981; Papamokos et al., 1982) and silver{ For denitions of protein inhibitor families, see Laskowski & Kato (1980) and Laskowski (1986)pheasant (Bode et al., 1985) were determined both in virgin (reactive site intact) and in modied (reactive site hydrolyzed) forms (Musil et al., 1991). The three-dimensional structures of complexes of turkey ovomucoid third domain with Streptomyces griseus proteinase B (Fujinaga et al., 1982; Read et al., 1983), human leukocyte elastase (Bode et al., 1986) and bovine achymotrypsin (Fujinaga et al., 1987) were also determined.
There are severalcirlces; the recombinant long form has Ala1 His Phe Ala Met5 in these positions. Wieczorek et al. (1987) and this paper show that the presence or absence of either 1-5 peptide is without effect on Ka.

Some of these structures e.g. Gly18, Ala18 and Leu18 (short form) are already completed
(Huang et al., 1995), many others await publication
(Huang, 1995; Bateman et al., 1996), others are in renement.
These studies as well as the interpretation of the huge volume of thermodynamic data available at Purdue lead to the following conclusions (1) residue 18 always serves as the P1 residue even when its binding to the S1 cavity is locally deleterious, (2) the changes in the inhibitor and enzyme conformation on complex formation are very small, nearly lock and key, (3) with the exception of Pro18, the nature of X18 has little effect on the interaction between the enzyme and the re-Table 1.

Thus, for our purposes, the inhibitor-enzyme system serves as a molecular vise. It positions X18 into the S1 cavity and by subtraction of Gly18 data (see below) it allows us to measure just the X18 . . .

We have already reported Ka values for 14 variants of ovomucoid third domain at X18 (P1 residue) interacting with six serine proteinases (Bigler et al., 1993). Of these 14 variants, nine involved coded residues, while ve were non-coded.
Of the nine coded variants, six were obtained directly, while three were calculated from other data by making
(reasonable) additivity assumptions. Most of the variants employed were generated by semisynthesis (Wieczorek & Laskowski, 1983).

Here, we describe a set of techniques announced by us earlier (Lu et al., 1992) for the production of coded ovomucoid third domain variants. We apply these techniques to the production of all 20 codeds; pH 8.30, t  21(2)C, T/2  0.10 M (M1)

We directly measure the Ka values for all these, interacting with the same six serine proteinases as employed by Bigler et al. (1993). We combine our complete set of 20 with the set of ve non-coded residues
(Abu, Ape, Ahx, Ahp and Hse) provided by Bigler et al. (1993).
It allows for a great number of comparisons both internally and to literature values. 
Results and Discussion The Ka values Table 1 lists the Ka values for all 20 coded variants of X18OMTKY3.
We were fortunate that in spite of the huge range of these data (see below) all the values t into our dynamic range of measurements
(roughly 103 M1 to 1013 M1, the upper bound is lower for some enzymes e.g. HLE). As was already pointed out by Bigler et al. (1993) the set of all coded amino acids allows for only a few structurally simple pairwise comparisons.
The homologous series e.g. Gly, Ala; Asp, Glu; Asn, Gln; Val, Ile are only two residues long. Inclusion of only a few well selected non-coded residues allows for many more good pairwise comparisons and for much longer series.
Table 1 is augmented bythe values for ve non-coded variants obtained by semisynthesis. Their Ka values with the same six enzymes (Bigler et al., 1993) were measured by the same technique and under the same conditions as used for the coded set.

The ranges We call the ratio of the highest to the lowest Ka for each enzyme, the range for that enzyme. When converted to free energy differences, they range from 8.1 to 10.8 kcal/mol.

These values are similar to the total stability of the native forms of many globular proteins. 
The ranges given in the rst columns of Figure 2 include all the 25 side-chains we have studied.
As Pro is not an amino acid in a chemical sense, we provide a range for the 24 side-chains other than Pro (second column of each set). This affects the results for the four enzymes for which Pro is the smallest Ka entry.
In sharp contrast, the set of all coded amino acid side-chains is complete. 
Therefore, we also provide the values of ranges for the set of all coded amino acid side-chains with
(third columns) and without Pro (fourth columns).

Obviously, decreasing the size of the set decreases the ranges in some cases but the important conclusion is that they remain very large Isofunctional residue clusters In view of the huge ranges, plotting of the data in Table 1 requires some compression and the logarithmic compression seemed best. It was implemented by converting the Ka values to  Go(X18)a  RTlnKa, where T  294 K. The results are plotted in Figure 3.
Only coded residues are listed in order to reduce the crowding of the Figure. Instead, for each enzyme there are clusters of isofunctional residues with nearly the same  Go(X18)a. One might expect that the side-chains in isofunctional clusters should be closely related.
As pointed out by Bigler et al. (1993), the value  Go(X18)a is determined by opposing inuences of hydrophobicity on one hand and of steric bulk, branching, polarity and charge on the other. The nding of isofunctional clusters is important for at least two reasons One of these reasons is the study of positive Darwinian selection (Laskowski et al., 1988) of the contact residues in standard mechanism canonical inhibitors of serine proteinases.
In most such inhibitors, the residues which are in contact with the enzyme in the enzymeinhibitor complex are hypervariable. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in the Kazal inhibitor family and particularly so among the avian ovomucoid third domains (Laskowski & Kato, 1980; Laskowski et al., Figure 3.
The relative values for the non-ionizable residues are expected to be unaffected by pH. For ionizable residues they change dramatically. 
Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 445 JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]1987, 1988; Creighton & Darby, 1989).
At P1 position, 11 different residues, more than at any other position in the third domain, were found. The composition is Leu65.5, Met60, Ala6.5, Gln5, Val4.5, Thr3, Pro3, Lys2, Ser1.5, Gly1 and Ile1 (Apostol et al., 1993){ Inspection of Figure 3 shows that some of the best (Leu, Met for PPE, CARL, SGPA and SGPB) and worst (Pro) residues are represented.{ Thus, either the target enzyme for the ovomucoid third domains changes among the species examined or the equilibrium constant for inhibition of a constant target enzyme undergoes a very large change.

It is worth noting that for almost all of the enzymes, Leu and Met form an almost isofunctional pair. Leu and Met are the two most highly populated (43% and 39%, respectively) members of the P1 residue set.
It is probable that the evolutionary changes between Leu and Met at P1 are not selective but neutral. A more familiar example is{ The subscripts denote the number of species in which the P1 residue was found.
The fractions arise because for species in which the P1 residue was found to be dimorphic each of the two dimorphic residues was given an arbitrary weight of 0.5. 
{ In these considerations we disregard Cys as it is not present in its reduced form in any of the contact positions in standard mechanism canonical inhibitors.

The disulde bridged homodimer of Cys18 OMTKY3 is inactive.the frequent variation between P1 Lys and P1 Arg in inhibitors whose target enzyme is clearly trypsin, for example, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitors (Kazal). However, while isofunctional clusters explain a part of the observed hypervariability, they do not explain it all.
Ka values of ovomucoid third domains from closely related species show striking variations (Empie &
Laskowski, 1982; Park, 1985; Wynn 1990; Lu, 1994). The implications of the existance of isofunctional clusters upon scanning techniques of protein engineering such as the alanine scan (Cunningham
& Wells, 1989; Clackson & Wells, 1995) have already been discussed by Bigler et al. (1993).

Gly18 as a standard The set of  Go a (X18) in Figure 3 reects the variation of binding free energy with the nature of the P1 residue. It seems natural to choose Gly18 as a reference and to assert that side-chains, whose  Go a (X18) is greater than  Go a (Gly18), make a positive contribution to binding while the others are deleterious.
The rst is that inhibitors with P1 Gly may not bind to the S1 subsite of some enzymes but instead place a more favorable residue in that subsite. Huang et al (1995) determined the three-dimensional structure of Gly18 OMTKY3-SGPB complex.

There is no available three-dimensional structure of a free, canonical protein inhibitor with Gly at P1 position.
One might speculate that the main-chain of such free inhibitors might be more exible at the P1 Gly position than the main-chains of inhibitors with other residues at P1. Upon complex formation, the main-chain would rigidify (it is known to be normal in Gly18 OMTKY3-SGPB complex, Huang et al. 1995).
This would entail a free energy cost and therefore the use of Gly18 as a standard would not be fair. Huang et al. (1995) showed that the observed   Go a (Gly18X) values are linearly dependent upon the buried hydrophobic surface area and therefore, excluded this objection to Gly18 as a standard.

The large values of Ka for Gly18 variants (Table 1)
and of  Go a (Gly18) (Figure 3) are an indication that binding of the P1 side-chain to S1 cavity is not the only important energetic contribution to complex formation. The interaction of the remaining 11 consensus contact side-chains (Apostol et al., 1993)
and of the main-chain make a very signicant contribution.
It is this contribution that is clearly responsible for directing the P1 side-chains to the S1 subsite even when their individual interaction is neutral (Gly18) or deleterious. The nding that theKa and the  Go a (Gly18) values are similar for the six enzymes may be a coincidence arising from the choice of turkey ovomucoid third domain as the wild-type.
Yet, turkey ovomucoid third domain contains Arg21 (P3 0)
which is exceptionally favorable for chymotrypsin
(Lu, 1994). Were Arg21 changed to another residue, Ka values for the Gly18 variants would no longer be approximately equal. 
It is interesting to note that one natural ovomucoid third domain (tawny frogmouth, Australian bird belonging to the goatsucker family) has Gly at P1 position (Apostol et al., 1993).
It is likely that its true target enzyme has a very small or nonexistent S1 pocket. 
Binding of Pro18 Pro18 is very poor and deleterious compared to Gly18 for all the enzymes we study.

Modeling suggests that Pro18 side-chain is difcult to wedge into the S1 pocket. Furthermore, the N Figure 4.The values of   Go (Gly18X) for 20 coded and ve non-coded amino acid residues obtained at 21oC, pH 8.3.
The homologous series of residues Gly, Ala, Abu, Ape, Ahx and Ahp is extended by hydrophobic Phe, Tyr and Trp and plotted against the number of non-hydrogen atoms in the side-chains. 
Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 447 JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]atom of Pro18 cannot approach the enzyme as closely as the atoms of other P1 residues.
A complex of Pro18 OMTKY3 with SGPB has been crystallized and a high resolution structure was obtained (K Huang, W. L., M. L., S. A. & M. N. G. James, unpublished results). In the other complexes, the positions of all contact residues, other than P1, are superimposable.
In the Pro18 complex some of these residues make small motions to aid in the wedging of P1 Pro into the S1 pocket. Since Pro is the only member of our set that is not an amino acid in the chemical sense,{ The structures of complexes with Gly18 and Ala18 were experimentally determined.
Those with the noncoded amino acids were only modeled as the Purdue group was unable to supply sufcient quantity of these variants (Bigler et al. 1993) for X-ray crystallography of complexes.neither a strictly isosteric nor a strictly isomeric comparison is possible. Comparisons of Ka values for all six enzymes for Ape18 and Pro18 is given in the rst row of Table 2.

Since Pro18 is so deleterious, it is surprising that it was found three times among the 153 species of birds whose ovomucoid third domains were sequenced (Apostol et al., 1993). The Pro18 containing species are black night heron and the two species of cassowaries we examined.
Furthermore, in alligator ovomucoid, which consists of four Kazal domains (March, 1980), the third domain has Pro at P1 position. Over the last 15 years we have tested alligator ovomucoid and the P1 Pro containing avian third domains for inhibition of likely targets such as prolyl endopeptidases.

Effect of residue size on binding Consider a homologous (in a chemical sense)
series of amino acid side-chains Gly, Ala, Abu, Ape, Ahx and Ahp. The last four entries are from Bigler et al. (1993), who also had Ala but not Gly, an important residue.
Technical problems also prevented Bigler et al. (1993) from going beyond Ahp but they chose to add Phe to the series. We further add Tyr and Trp and plot the   Go(Gly18X) values versus the number of non-hydrogen atoms in the side-chain.

For all six enzymes   Go increases (Figure 4)
with the number of atoms in the side-chain, rises to a maximum and then declines. Increasing the size increases the hydrophobicity of the residues in this series.
As the pocket size is exceeded, energy consuming changes must be made to accommodate the oversized side-chain. 
This qualitative explanation is sufcient to emphasize the point made by Bigler et al. (1993) that the   Go(Gly18X) values are frequently a result of two large and opposing terms, exemplied by hydrophobicity and inelasticity of the too small pocket.
As a result, a small and a large residue may turn out to have the same   Go(Gly18X)
values. As will be seen below, branching, polarity and charge also can oppose hydrophobic bonding, thus leading to some truly unexpected isofunctional sets (Figure 3).

A good start was made in quantitative treatment of the ascending sides of Figure 4. Huang et al (1995) measured the buried hydrophobic surface area for the Gly18-, Ala18-, Abu18-, Ape18-, Ahx18-, and Ahp18 OMTKY3 complexes{ with SGPB.
Our   Go(Gly18X) values were then plotted versus 
(the buried hydrophobic surface area) yielding an impressive straight line (Figure 8 of Huang et al., 1995) with a slope of 34.1 cal/mol per A 2. As discussed by Huang et al. (1995), this value for hydrophobic strength is intermediate among the Figure 5.
The coded residues are given their one letter symbols, the non-coded ones three letters. The number after each side-chain indicates the number of non-hydrogen atoms.

448 Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]currently proposed values in the literature.

Huang et al. (1995) modeled the same series of complexes for SGPA and CHYM. Excellent straight   Go(Gly18X) versus  (buried hydrophobic surface area) lines with slopes ranging from 34 to 40 cal/mol per A 2 were obtained.
The Huang et al (1995) straight lines arise from the  (hydrophobic buried surface area) results increasing less than linearly with the number of non-hydrogen atoms of the side-chains. This non-linearity matches the non-linearity of the ascending sides in the plots of Figure 4 to produce the straight lines.
Therefore, the hydrophobic contribution to binding cannot be simply calculated from a formula with a linear dependence on the number of methylene groups in the side-chain. Upon insertion in the S1 cavity of the enzyme they become highly restricted.
This was recently demonstrated in the SSIsubtilisin system by deuterium NMR studies
(Tamura et al., 1996). This restriction is associated with an entropy loss (Doig & Sternberg, 1995).

Clearly, such an entropy loss must arise in our homologous series of side-chains. Presumably, it is one of the many effects that are incorporated into the   Go(Gly18X) versus  (buried surface area)
correlation.
In the case of SGPB, Phe18-, Tyr18 and Trp18- bind less well than Leu18- in spite of greater buried hydrophobic sur-face area. Bateman et al. (1996) obtained the structures of these complexes and showed that the aromatic side-chains t without distorting the S1 pocket.
In order to t in without distorting the pocket, they adopt an unfavorable w2 angle. Bateman et al. (1996) calculate that this uncommon angle costs about 3kcal/
mol, somewhat more than is needed to explain the decline in binding of the aromatic residues compared to Leu18.
The P1 preference of both enzymes is very similar, as judged by Pearson product moment correlation (see below). Their maximal   Go(Gly18X) residues are essentially the same; however, the descending sides differ strongly.
The conclusion that the S1 pocket of HLE is more exible than those of the ve other enzymes is reached here on three different bases. The other two are the preference for Val and Ile, of which the other enzymes are intolerant and the non-additivity seen only in HLE.
Furthermore, Bode et al. (1989) have already concluded on the basis of X-ray crystallographic studies that HLE's S1 pocket is more exible than PPE's. It is clear that more structures involving both PPE and HLE will be needed to resolve these problems. The sharp decline, especially for PPE, does not continue for the largest residues.
Instead, there is a levelling out toward a relatively constant low value. It's cause is unknown. 
Other amino acid side-chains Figure 5 provides an elementary classication of amino acid side-chains.
In analyzing the various groups above we resort whenever possible to binary comparisons between isomers and isosteres. 
As pointed out by Bigler et al. (1993), most points in Figure 4 fall below rather than above the solid line consisting of hydrophobic, straight chain sidechains.
This observation, however, is now somewhat less striking than it was in Bigler et al. (1993), since Cys is often better than Abu, and Ile is better than Ahx for HLE. The second interesting aspect is that the large range for CHYM is achieved mainly above the Gly zero line, i.e. it is the strong improvement in binding from Gly to Tyr that accounts for most of the range.
The very large range for PPE is mostly achieved below the line as some substituents are very deleterious. 
Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 449 JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]Branching Of the 20 coded amino acid side-chains, 13 are branched (Figure 5).
For aliphatic, hydrophobic residues, the presence or absence of branching such as Ape/Val, Ahx/Leu and Ahx/Ile comparisons or the position of branching (Leu/Ile) have only small effects on the transfer free energy from water to organic solvent (e.g. Radzicka &
Wolfenden, 1988 and references therein). The surface areas of unbranched and variously branched isomers are closely similar and the cavities in the solvents readily adjust to different shapes of the sidechains.
The branching problem was also addressed for residues buried in the protein interior Sturtevant, Richards and their co-workers are engaged in a major study of binding of X13 S-peptide variants to ribonuclease S-protein to yield X13 ribonuclease S complexes. They determine three-dimensional structures and  Go,  Ho and
 Cpo of binding of the variants.
In a recent paper, they write: ``substitution of wild-type methionine at position 13, with either leucine or isoleucine, unsurprisingly produces little or no change in the free energy of association'' (Thomson et al., 1994). While we are unable to nd equally strongly worded quotes in the other papers, we believe that this quote fairly summarizes the work of Kellis et al. (1988, 1989), Matsumura et al. (1988), Shortle et al. (1990), Sandberg & Terwilliger (1991), Eriksson et al (1992), Serrano et al. (1992) and Matthews (1993).
Interchanges of Ahx
(when available), Met, Leu and Ile have no effect upon the free energy of stabilization of the interiors of globular proteins. These results, in turn, are consistent with the considerable liquid-like adaptability of the protein interiors.

In spite of considerable similarities between the effects of side-chains on the stabilization of proteins and of binding to the S1 cavity of serine proteinases, the effects of branching are sharply different. Grn et al. (1992) summarize their wide reading of the proteolytic enzyme literature by
`` . . .
This inefciency in cleaving substrates with a b-branched P1 residue is common to many proteolytic enzymes . . . ''. The other is the interaction between carboxypeptidase A and potato chymotrypsin inhibitor, where bbranched P1 residues are preferred to their isomers (Molina et al., 1994).

The contrast between Leu and Ile being isofunctional (protein thermodynamicists) and Ile being greatly inferior (enzymologists of proteinases)
gives a strong feeling of two cultures. We assumethat the explanation lies in the far greater rigidity of preformed cavities than of protein interiors.
The greatest deviations from unity (but still less than an order of magnitude) are for the two elastase PPE and HLE, where packing of these side-chains into a small cavity is the overriding concern. The relative Ahx/Leu equivalence aids those who wish to discuss the S1 cavity phenomenon using only coded variants.
They can talk about the Leu/Ile ratio almost as if it were Ahx/Ile Now let us turn to the Ape/Val ratio, where Val is highly deleterious for the rst ve enzymes. It is slightly favorable for HLE. The comparison between Ahx/Ile is a repeat; except, now the unfavorable effect is an order of magnitude higher as is the favorable effect for HLE.
The Leu/Ile comparison restates the results; except, now in three cases the ratio reaches 2000, a large effect indeed. The reason seems simple. It is much easier to pack in the Ahx and the g-branched Leu residue than the b-branched Val and Ile.

It is easy to conclude from these data that all b branching is highly deleterious, except for HLE. 
However, this conclusion becomes tempered by the next entry, the Hse/Thr comparison.
While Thr is deleterious for four enzymes and advantageous for the two elastases: PPE and HLE, the effects are quite modest. The relevant X-ray structures are not yet analyzed but an attractive explanation is that the environment into which the additional b-branched group is forced is somewhat polar, such as a peptide bond, thus explaining the relative preference of -OH versus -CH3 at this position.
The direct comparison of isosteric Val/Thr below conrms this speculation, but clearly only the structures can decide. The contrast between the strong aversion to Ile by ve of the enzymes and a weak preference for Ile by HLE is the second of our three arguments for
exibility of HLE S1 pocket.

Neutral, heteroatom containing side-chains Whereas, some heteroatom containing side-chains are neutral (Ser, Thr, Hse, Met, Asn, Gln) over the whole accessible pH range, others are ionizable. 
Such side-chains are involved in a pH-dependent equilibrium between their protonated and deprotonated forms.
Equilibrium constants Ka for such forms describe the binding of the inhibitor, in which the P1 residue is in Xo form yielding a complex in which the P1 residue remains in the Xo form. 
A preliminary analysis suggests that Ka values at pH 8.30 for His, Cys, and Tyr are for the Hiso, Cyso and Tryo forms as dened above.
Tyr was already treated as Tyro in the discussion of size 450 Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]effects. In this section Cys is treated as Cyso. Unfortunately, we have no appropriate isostere for His comparison.
It is also striking that Ser is particularly deleterious for the two elastases, PPE and HLE. The very deleterious effect of the
-CH3 * -OH replacement does not persist for the Val/Thr substitution.

Only in the case of HLE is Thr signicantly deleterious when compared to Val. In the discussion of branching, we noted that Val was quite deleterious compared to Ape for all of our enzymes except HLE (see Table 2).
As Thr is smaller than Val, its steric hindrance problems might be smaller. It may also be that b branching forces one of the g-methyl groups in Val into a slightly polar environment. The Val/Thr comparison is another contrast between our rigid pocket results and the stabilization of exible interiors of globular proteins where Val is much better than Thr
(Matthews, 1993).

Another case where the very large -CH3 * -OH effect is not observed is the Ape/Hse comparison. 
In this case, Ape is appreciably better than Hse, but about an order of magnitude less good than the Abu/Ser ratio.
As might have been anticipated, Leu is much better for the six hydrophobic pockets than Asn. Note that there one oxygen and one nitrogen atom substitute for the two carbon atoms.
It is startling to us that Leu is very closely similar to Aspo in the binding to SGPB. The three-dimensional structures of both members of this pair
(Huang et al., 1995; Huang, 1995) are available.
Before offering an interpretation, we would like to have Leu/Aspo ratios for the remaining ve enzymes. 
In strong contrast to the -CH3! -OH replacement in Abu, the -CH3 * -SH replacement in this sidechain generally favors Cys over Abu, by relatively large factors for SGPA and SGPB.
The strong preference for Cys over Abu makes Cys the best P1 residue for CARL and SGPB and the best coded residue for SGPA (non-coded Ahp is better). It is possible that hydrolysis of P1 Cys bonds in their substrates is an important role of some bacterial enzymes provided that they act in reducing environments.
Therefore, only the results are given in Tables 1 and 2 and in Figures 3 and 4.The remaining isosteric comparisons deal with the replacement by a nitrogen atom. Both Aspo and Gluo bind signicantly more strongly to the SGPB pocket than do their amides.
In this case, the structural comparisons based on X-ray structures
(Huang, 1995) are already available. We await the Aspo/Asn ratios for several more S1 pockets as the pH dependence analysis was only completed for SGPB (Qasim et al. 1995).
The Ahx/Lyso ratio reecting the -CH3 * -NH2 substitution seems very small to us. This may well be true as (see below)
SGPB has a very large preference for Lys, compared to the other ve enzymes.
The Ka values for OMTKY3 associating with any of the six enzymes we study are pH-dependent. An important question is whether the relative Ka values for the various P1 variants are pH-independent and therefore, general.
For the non-ionizable P1 residues the answer seems to be that they are pH-independent for the six enzymes we study. What about ionizable residues? For some of these, the relative Ka values are clearly highly pH-dependent. Let us consider the simplest possible situation. Because the P1 residue in the free inhibitor is known to be highly exposed, it ionizes independently of the other residues of the inhibitor. 
Its ionization is characterized by a simple ionization constant, Kf, where f stands for free inhibitor.
Similarly, in complex with one of the six enzymes we study here, the P1 residue is imbedded in a hydrophobic cavity and it does not interact with other ionizable groups of the enzyme or of the inhibitor. Therefore, its ionization is characterized by a simple constant, Kc, where c stands for complex.

R  Kio nizablea Kno nio nizablea
 R0 1 Kc
H
1 Kf

where R is the ratio of Ka with an ionizable P1 residue to the Ka with a non-ionizable P1 residue. Ro is the ratio between association constant Ka for the ionizable P1 in its fully protonated form both in the free inhibitor and in complex and Ka for the nonionizable P1 residue.
For the uncharged amino acids Asp, Glu, Cys and Tyr this is the Aspo, Gluo, Cyso and Tyro form we have already discussed. However, for the cationic amino acid side-chains, His, Lys and Arg, this is the His, Lys and Arg form.

At very high pH, where [H] is very small, the limit of R in equation (1) is Ro  (Kc/Kf). At the high pH limit, we are measuring the ratio of the equilibrium constant for binding of the deprotonated P1 side-chain, both in the complex and in Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 451 JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]the free inhibitor, to that of the non-ionizable reference side-chain.
Specically, we deal here with the Asp, Glu, Cys and Tyr constants for uncharged side-chains and with Hiso, Lyso and Argo for the cationic side-chains. 
The effect of charge For each of the seven ionizable amino acid residues
(Figure 5), we can make an isosteric comparison such as Aspo/Asp and Lyso/Lys. However, values are now available only for the four cases (all in SGPB) for which the full pH dependence of Ka was determined (Qasim et al., 1995 and unpublished; Table 2).
It is seen there that the uncharged form of each of these four side-chains binds to the S1 cavity of SGPB much more strongly than the charged form. This is true for both uncharged
(Asp, Glu) and cationic (His, Lys) members of the set.
We strongly expect that it would also be true if the data were available for Cys, Tyr and Arg. Similarly, we expect that it also would be true for all seven ionizable side-chain binding not just to SGPB but to all S1 cavities that are studied here.
Indeed, we have a signicant number of preliminary data conrming these conclusions. 
The P1 side-chains in all standard mechanism canonical protein inhibitors of serine proteinases are highly exposed to solvent (Read & James, 1986;
Bode & Huber, 1992).
Therefore, when the P1 sidechain is charged, the charge resides in a high dielectric medium. Upon transfer to the hydrophobic S1 cavity of one of the six enzymes we study, it is forced to reside in a much lower dielectric environment.
Transfers of a charge from high to low dielectric are strongly disfavored (Born, 1920). This provides a satisfying qualitative explanation for the preference for neutral over both positive and negative charges.

However, the neutral forms of both types of ionizable residues will not be favored by all S1 cavities in all serine proteinases. We expect trypsin (with a negative S1 pocket due to the presence of Asp189)
to strongly favor Lys over Lyso and to disfavor Asp compared to Aspo. Similarly, we expect positive S1 cavities of enzymes such as (Glu Sgp) the glutamic acid specic Streptomyces griseus proteinase (Yoshida et al., 1988; Komiyama et al., 1991;
Nienaber et al., 1993) to strongly favor Glu over Gluo and to disfavor Lys over Lyso Returning to Table 2, we note that the Aspo/Asp and Gluo/Glu ratios are truly huge, exceeding four and approaching ve orders of magnitude.

On the other hand, the Hiso/His and especially Lyso/Lys ratios, while still quite large, are much more modest. SGPB appears to favor the cationic residues His, Lys and Arg far more than the other
ve enzymes (see below).
However, it still appears that the Aspo/Asp and Gluo/Glu ratios for CHYM are much larger than the Lyso/Lys ratio. 
We tentatively conclude that while the primary effect we are observing is the change in the dielectric constant, there is a secondary effect in all sixenzymes we study, relatively favoring positive charges and disfavoring negative charges on the buried P1 side-chains.

Preliminary measurements suggest that for all six enzymes we study, the Ka values at pH 8.3 are for Hiso, Cyso, Tyro and Arg. On the other hand, we are still awaiting pKc measurements for Asp, Glu and Lys for enzymes other than SGPB. We were clearly hasty to suggest (Bigler et al., 1993) that these residues were in their charged form at pH 8.3.

Specificity of serine proteinases We have thus far focused on the comparisons within columns of Table 1, addressing such questions as the best and worst residues, isofunctional clusters, Leu/Ile ratio, uncharged/charged ratio, all for a particular enzyme. In this section, we address questions involving within row comparison and a related column to other columns comparison.
We have (Laskowski et al., 1989) dened the concept of the most specic residue for each enzyme. This most specic residue is not just a function of the target enzyme but also of all the other members of the enzyme set under consideration.
In view of that, our set of six enzymes is so highly arbitrary that it can almost be regarded as capricious. 
Sets of all human serine proteinases or of all serine proteinases from organisms likely to infect eggs are probably much more reasonable sets to investigate.
Proceeding in the manner recommended by Laskowski et al. (1989), we have selected for each of the six enzymes a P1 residue that is the most specic within our set. Therefore, while changing Tyr18 to Trp18 is only slightly poorer for CHYM, it is appreciably poorer for the nearest competitor, SGPA.
While Trp18 is actually better than Tyr18 for PPE, this is without signicance because both Tyr18 and Trp18 are much too large for PPE and HLE. For PPE, with a very small pocket, our choice was Ala18
(Abu18 is a close competitor).
The reasoning is essentially the same as for CHYM, except in reverse;
small residue for a small pocket. We found the choice of Glu (at pH 8.3, please remember that relative binding constants of ionizable residues depend upon pH) for CARL somewhat startling.
While SGPA and SGPB are sister enzymes with closely similar specicities, for most P1 residues SGPA has higher Ka values by about a factor of 10 or more. 
Therefore, the problem of nding the most specic residue for SGPA is largely reduced to nding a moderately large residue that was better for SGPA than for CHYM.

Because SGPA is typically more strongly inhibited than SGPB, difculty in nding a most specic P1 Table 3. The P1 specicity of six serine proteinases Pearson product-moment correlations (r)
Coded residues only CHYM PPE CARL SGPA SGPB HLE CHYM 1.00 PPE 0.10 1.00 CARL 0.66 0.39 1.00 SGPA 0.87 0.30 0.89 1.00 SGPB 0.83 0.23 0.87 0.96 1.00 HLE 0.03 0.94 0.42 0.41 0.35 1.00 452 Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]residue for SGPB was expected.
However, we note in Table 1 that at pH 8.30, the three ionizable, cationic variants Lys18, His18, and Arg18 inhibit SGPB better than SGPA. The nding that all cationic sidechains prefer SGPB to SGPA raises a question.
Is the effect due to positive charges{, to nitrogenous substituents or to both. It seems clear that in binding to SGPB at pH 8.30 we deal with Arg and Hiso.
Comparisons will become much easier when more pKc values for the other S1 pockets are determined. Much of this paper was already concerned with the abhorrence of b-branched aliphatic residues by the rst ve enzymes in Table 1.
In contrast, HLE nds such residues better than their straight chain and g-branched counterparts. 
Aside from picking out the most specic residue for each enzyme, we can instead think of each column in Table 1 as a vector in 25-dimensional amino acid space.
If we restrict the set to coded amino acids only, the space reduces to the more familiar 20-dimensional amino acid space. However, if we were to leave the entries as equilibrium constants, the small ones (see Figures 2 and 3){ The stronger binding of Lys18 to SGPB than to SGPA was recognized in our group sometime ago
(Park, 1985; Lin 1986) based on results with Japanese quail ovomucoid third domain, which has . . .

An explanation for the difference was advanced on the basis of a presumed difference in the amino acid sequence between SGPA and SGPB. The reported amino acid sequences showed that, in SGPA residue, 191 was Gln (Johnson & Smillie, 1974) while in SGPB (Jurasek et al., 1974), it was Glu (Chymotrypsinogen numbering and Fujinaga et al. (1985) alignments are employed.).

However, subsequent to our explanations, Henderson et al. (1987) published nucleotide sequences of SGPA and SGPB. In order to conrm it, we have isolated the relevant peptide from both enzymes and obtained its amino acid sequence.
After this was communicated to Professor Smillie, he kindly rechecked the original assignment of Gln191 in SGPA and found that, along with many amide assignments of that period in protein sequencing, it was largely a guess. On the other hand, this leaves us without molecular explanation for the SGPB preference over SGPA for cationic side-chains.would have no measurable effect on the direction of the vector, which would be determined by the highest value or a few highest values.
This is avoided when logarithms of Ka(X 18) or association free energies,  Go (X18), are considered. Therefore, Figure 3 is the appropriate reduction of data of Table 1, as it both restricts to the coded set and provides free energies of association.
The restriction to the coded set is easy to justify as proteinases act on substrates in which the residues are overwhelmingly members of the coded set with but a few post-translationally modied outliers. 
With the data of Figure 3 in hand, there are numerous procedures for calculating the relationship between the vectors given by the columns.
The Pearson product-moment correlation (Campbell, 1989), is very familiar and we employ it here:
r 
Xn i1
xi  xyi  y
Xn i1
xi  x2 Xn i1
yi  y2 s 2
where r  1 perfect positive correlation, r  0 no correlation, r  1 perfect negative correlation. 
In the specic application in this section the index, i, refers to the kind of coded residue present at position 18 in X18OMTKY3, n is 20, the number of kinds of coded amino acids.
x values are  Go a(X18) values for the interaction with one of the enzymes and the y values are for the interaction with the other. 
Table 3 is a list of all the possible pairwise comparisons for six enzymes.
As expected, the closely related SGPA and SGPB have the most positive r value (0.96). The next closest relationship is between PPE and HLE (0.94), in spite of differences that appear to arise from considerable rigidity of PPE and relative exibility of HLE.
This high correlation is a testimonial to the insight of the late Aaron Janoff, who named HLE elastase (Janoff &
Basch, 1971). All six enzymes we have studied are strongly inhibited by wild-type OMTKY3, whose P1 residue is Leu18.
Each entry differs from its horizontal neighbor by a single substitution at P1. WTD stands for West Indian tree duck, EMG for emperor goose, SWN for black-necked swan, GOO for greylag goose, MNQ for Montezuma quail, GUI for guinea fowl, KAP for Kalij pheasant, SVP for silver pheasant.
The Hse18 OMSVP3 and Hse18 OMGU13 were prepared by opening the Met18  Glu reactive site peptide bond by cyanogen bromide cleavage followed by enzymatic resynthesis. SWNGOO is a chimera or residues 6 to 18 of OMSWN3 and 19 to 56 of OMGOO3 (see Wieczorek
& Laskowski, 1983 and Bigler et al., 1993 for more detailed descriptions).
As shown in this graph, 44 were found with 1 < Fc < 2 or within experimental error, 24 with 2 < Fc < 4, ve with 4 < Fc < 6 and only two with Fc > 6. 
The Fc values, which were smaller than unity, were replaced by their inverses for ease of comparison.

Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 453 JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]Trp18 are the best P1 residues for CHYM. They are nearly the worst for PPE. As it lacks enzymes with a preference for positve and negative P1 residues, our set appears incomplete.
We have already remedied some of these deciencies and a more extended publication on the use of inhibitor binding constants to dene the specicity of serine proteinases is in preparation. 
Generality of the data Table 1, whose data were exhaustively discussed above, applies only to X18 OMTKY3 and to that only at 21 (2)C and at pH 8.30.
However, it is reasonable to expect that the relative data in each column of Table 1 may apply to a closely related set of avian ovomucoid third domains or even to all members of the Kazal family of serine proteinase inhibitors. If the data for these sets agree well, we talk about intrascaffolding additivity as all the members of these sets share the common Kazal family scaffolding.
We could be more venturesome yet. As the canonical standard mechanism inhibitors have a common conformation of the contiguous combining region, interscaffolding additivity might be expected. If this is true, relative values in the six columns of Table 1 can be used to predict or conrm the relative Ka values of P1 variants of BPTI, SLPI, SSI and eglin c. When this is found to hold (approximately), we can turn even more venturesome. As ``inhibitors are substrates''
(Laskowski & Kato, 1980) we can also seek a correlation between log(kcat/Km) values for a series of substrates that differ from one another only at P1 and log Ka values of X18 OMTKY3.Strict additivity criterion for avian ovomucoid third domains Over decades of work on avian ovomucoid third domains, the Purdue group acquired 92 unique (Apostol et al., 1993) and 32 semisynthetic

(personal communication) G, A, S, V, T, L, M, K, Q, E, H, F, R, Y. t, Bauer (1978) G, A, V, L, F, Y, W 454 Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]published results) variants. For most of these variants Ka values for interaction with the six enzymes studied in this paper were determined (Empie &
Laskowski, 1982; Laskowski et al., 1983, 1989; Park, 1985; Wynn, 1990; Lu, 1994; Park et al. unpublished results).
More strikingly, these data have been acquired by the same measuring technique as that employed for determination of data in Table 1 and possibly even more importantly they were acquired at pH 8.30 and at 21 (2)C. As pointed out above, pH affects the relative Ka values for Asp,{ This is of course, trivially true of all the variants listed in Table 1. Some eggs contain only OMMNQ3L, others OMMNQ3S, yet others a 50:50 mixture (see Bogard et al., 1980 for similar phenomenon in OMJPQ3).
Third domain mixtures can be readily separated by reverse phase HPLC (Lin, 1986).Glu and Lys residues. We suspect that temperature also affects the relative values for many residues.

However, only a subset of those data, shown in Figure 6, can be usefully compared. This subset consist of those inhibitor variants which differ from another member of the subset by a single substitution at P1{. We wish to apply the additivity criterion (Laskowski et al., 1983; Wells, 1990;
Wynn, 1990; Horovitz et al., 1991) to these data.

On the upper right of the left hand square, we have OMTKY3, our wild-type. Below it lies Montezuma quail ovomucoid third domain leucine form{, OMMNQ3L.

Now note that moving to the left changes L18 (the reactive site P1 residue) to S18 in both variants. In spite of the fact that Ka values for OMTKY3 and OMMNQ3L are different,   Go (L18S) values are the same within experimental error for all six enzymes.
The dependence of log(kcat/Km) values of all chymotrypsin substrates in the world literature
(Schellenberger et al., 1991) upon log Ka values from Table 1. r is the Pearson product moment correlation coefcient, s is the power dependence (see the text).
The thin diagonal is a slope 1.00 line drawn through the common Phe reference without any tting. 
Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 455 JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97](L18S) is its non-logarithmic version: the ratio of Ka values for the S18 and L18 variants.
Therefore, identity of Ka S(18)/KL(18)
a ratios is another measure of additivity. For the case discussed here the six ratios of ratios range from 1.1 to 1.8.
The determination of Fc requires an experimental determination of four equilibrium constants. An analysis of our data sets suggests that for 1.00 < Fc < 2.00, the deviation from unity is likely to be caused by experimental errors.
It follows that j  Goj dev due to experimental errors is about 400 cal/mol. Figure 7 shows the Fc and j  Goj dev values for the 65 cycles for which we have data.

With few exceptions, the agreement is excellent We decided to examine the two most aberrant cases, where the Fc values are greater than 6. Both are for HLE, and both involve comparisons between P1 Val and non-b-branched amino acid.
HLE is the only one of the six enzymes we have studied that does not disfavor Val and Ile compared to Ape, Ahx and Leu. We think that the usual non-additivity we observe for HLE is due to the same phenomenon.
Most S1 pocketsare rigid and less inuenced by the nature of other contact residues, but HLE deforms easily. 
Comparison with literature data Unlike the data from our laboratory, the data of others were not obtained at the same pH and temperature as our own.
Therefore, the differences, even in relative values, are likely to be and are large, and less strict comparisons than additivity must be employed. 
The Pearson product-moment correlation
(Campbell, 1989) which we already employed for the examination of enzyme specicity (equation
(2)) is such a measure.
Therefore, for each of the literature data sets we calculate such a correlation. 
For example they are  Go a for P1 scaffold versus  Go a of X18 OMTKY3 variants or:
lo g kcat Km for a series of related substrates with only P1 residue varied versus log Ka for X18 OMTKY3.
The best straight line through such plots is characterized by a slope, s (see Figure 8). In all of our plots, X18 OMTKY3 data are the x-axis or the abscissa, while the data of others are the ordinate or the yaxis.
The r  1.00, s  1.00 indicate direct proportionality and therefore, additivity. 
Consider rst the comparisons between free energies of transfer of amino acid side-chains from water to organic solvents to the binding to S1 pockets.
In fact, we restricted the comparisons to CHYM as only CHYM has a commodious enough pocket so that global steric effects do not matter First, we look at the transfer of simple homologous, aliphatic side-chains to octanol and to chymotrypsin. This is a reection of the well known phenomenon that ``enzymes are more hydrophobic than organic solvents'' (Fersht, 1977, 1985). (We feel that now it is better dealt with by the examination of the correlation   Go
(Gly18X) to the buried hydrophobic surface area computed from X-ray crystallographic determinations and from modeling (Huang et al., 1995). As we extend the size of the set to most of the residues, the correlation gets somewhat worse (it would have been worse yet if His, Ile and Pro were included) but the s value remains near one Figure 9.
The expression vector, pEZZ318.tky, was assembled starting from a chicken ovomucoid cDNA clone, pOM100, as described in Materials and Methods. The insert in pOM100 contains sequences representing the 30-untranslated region and the coding region for amino acids 18 to 186 in the chicken ovomucoid mRNA (Stein et al., 1978; Lai et al., 1979); this insert thus contains the complete coding information for the OM2D and OM3D domains, but the sequence for the OM1D domain is incomplete.
Black rectangles represent coding sequences for polypeptide linker regions connecting discrete protein domains. The Glu and Met residues in the short sequence (shown) connecting the ZZ and OM3D domains, which are the sites of cleavage in the fusion proteins by V8 porteinase or cyanogen bromide for producing the long and short forms of OM3D
(see the text), respectively are underlined.
Other symbols are as follows: PSPA, staphylococcal protein A promoter; SS, signal sequence for secretion; Z, protein A IgG-binding domain; lacZ', E. coli b-galactosidase a fragment;  ori, 
phage origin of DNA replication; AmpR, ampicillin resistance marker; TerR, tetracycline resistance marker. Obviously, similar correlations could have been done for many different solvents and for more enzymes, not just CHYM.
We did not persist as these two lines are in Table 4 only to illustrate our analysis technique. 
The next part of Table 4 deals with interscaffolding comparisons between inhibitors which are not at all homologous (they are members of different families) but they share being standard mechanism canonical inhibitors.
The r values in Table 4 are very near to unity, but s values deviate greatly. It is not clear whether this is due to differences in experimental conditions and techniques or the reection of the true situation.
In order to answer this, we recently acquired a set of seven eglin c variants at P1 and measured them in our laboratory under the conditions of Table 1. The third section of Table 4 deals with log(kcat/Km)
plots versus log Ka plots (Figure 8).
Here Schellenberger et al. (1991) combined all of the known kcat/
Km values from the world's literature and calculated their dependence on P1 (and other residue positions). An even better agreement is found for a restricted set of acetyl methyl esters of simple hydrophobic amino acids reported in a classic paper by Dorovska et al. (1972).
For other enzymes the r and s agreements are rather good but not as good as for CHYM. The excellent agreement overall between log(kcat/Km) and our log Ka presumably implies that the P1 side-chains are imbedded in the enzyme's S1 pockets in a very similar manner in the kinetic transition states and in the enzyme-inhibitor complexes.
As three-dimensional structures of the latter are already available or are being obAmino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 457 JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]tained, this is good news for kineticists, who can look at part of the transition states Materials and Methods Construction of the OM3D expression vector The steps in the construction of the expression vector for the turkey ovomucoid third domain as a downstream fusion to secreted IgG-binding domains of staphylococcal protein A are shown schematically in Figure 9. 
Briey, a 0.18 kbp HincII/BamH I fragment from a plasmid containing a molecular clone of the chicken ovomucoid cDNA, pOM100 (Stein et al., 1978; Lai et al., 1979), was purifed by gel electrophoresis and inserted into SmaI/BamHI-digested pEZZ318 (Nilsson & Abrahmsen, 1990).
This HincII/BamHI fragment contained the coding region for the third domain of chicken ovomucoid
(Figure 9). Single-stranded template was obtained from the above plasmid using the M13K07 helper phage
(Vieira & Messing, 1987).
The OM3D coding region was then fused in-frame to the coding sequences for the IgGbinding (``Z'') domains of staphylococcal protein A via deletion mutagenesis (Taylor et al., 1985; Nakamaye &
Eckstein, 1986) with the oligonucleotide, 50 GCA GTC AAC CAT AGC GAA GTG AGC TTC TTT ACG 30 (protein A-OM3D fusion primer). To remove the rest of the polylinker sequences the plasmid was cleaved with HindIII and BamHI, lled-in with Klenow DNA polymerase and dNTPs and religated.
The chicken OM3D sequence was mutated to the turkey OM3D sequence and a unique BamHI site introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded template DNA using the oligonucleotide primer, 50 GTT GTC GGA TCC ACA GAG AGG TCT GTA TTC CAG CGT GCA TGC AGG CTT AGG 30
(CHI! TKY primer). Nucleotides that were altered in the mutagenesis from the chicken to the turkey sequence are underlined; the silent mutation in the codon for Gly25 that introduced the BamHI site (italics) is also underlined.
The amino acid and codon changes were as follows: D15A(GAC! GCA), A18L(GCA! CTG), and D20Y(GAC! TAC). 
Introduction of mutations at the P1 position Standard oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, using the phosphorothioate incorporation method (Taylor et al., 1985; Nakamaye & Eckstein, 1986), was employed to introduce amino acid substitutions at the P1 position in the recombinant turkey OM3D gene in pEZZ318.tky.
Mutagenic oligonucleotides were also designed to revert the silent BamHI site mutation in codon 25 (see above); since this BamHI site was unique in pEZZ318.tky, mutant plasmids could be easily distinguished from the parental plasmid based upon their resistance to BamHI digestion. Mutagenized plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagen) for selection, screening, and characterization.
The entire OM3D coding region for each candidate mutant was resequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) to verify the presence of the intended mutation and the absence of adventitious second-site mutations. Each mutant plasmid was then retransformed into E. coli strain RV308 (Maurer et al., 1980) for protein expression.
Protein expression and purification The fusion protein was designed to be secreted into the periplasmic space of E. coli to insure facile and correct formation of disulde bridges (see Figure 1). Having the two IgG-binding Z domains also allowed us to use afnity chromatography on IgG column as a method of purication.
In brief, after inoculation on an LB plate, a single colony of RV308 cells was grown overnight at 30C in 75 ml of 2  TY broth (16 g/l Tryptone, 10 g/l Yeast Extract, 5 g/l NaCl, 100 mg/l amplicillin and 0.1%
(w/v) glucose). The medium then was transferred into a 2.8 liter culture ask containing 1.5 liters of 2  TY broth and was continously shaken for 24 hours at 30C. An osmotic shock procedure (Randall & Hardy, 1986) was used to obtain periplasmic proteins.
After osmotic shock and centrifugation, the supernatant containing the periplasmic fraction was loaded onto an IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (Pharmacia) afnity chromatography column. 
The afnity purication was performed according to the standard procedures provided by the manufacturer
(Pharmacia).

The fusion protein was subjected to CNBr cleavage at the Met5Val6 bond in 5% TFA. The more common 70%
formic acid was avoided as traces of formylation were seen in many puried products obtained in that medium.
The reaction mixture was then subjected rst to size exclusion chromatography on Bio-gel P-10 to separate third domain from the two Z domains of SPA followed by its purication by ion exchange chromatography on S-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose columns at pH 3.6 and 9.1, respectively. 
In the cases of the Cys18 and Met18 variants, Staphylococcus aureus protease V8, instead of CNBr, was used to split off the connecting peptide at the Glu1Ala1 bond, which yielded third domains ve residues longer at their N terminus.
For the Cys18 variant, since there existed a signicant amount of dimerized fusion protein covalently linked by Cys18Cys18 in the expression product, an alternative cleavage by CNBr was also performed to generate a third domain dimer. The cystine dimer was reduced by DTT into Cys18OMTKY3 monomer without the N-terminal extra ve residues.
The yields of isolated highly puried X18OMTKY3 variants were remarkably consistent (3.5 to 4.0 mg/l; nine liters were shaken at a time). 
Characterization Probably the most decisive characterization of the variants was that complexes of X18OMTKY3 with SGPB were crystallized and their three-dimensional structures were determined (Huang et al., 1995; Huang, Bateman &
James, personal communication).
The conformation of the inhibitor in these complexes is strikingly similar to that found for the natural turkey ovomucoid third domain (Fujinaga et al., 1982; Read et al., 1983). These
ndings rule out a great number of possible folding concerns, such as improper closure of disulde bridges. A possible objection is that only a part of the preparation, the part that crystallized, is being tested.

All of the samples were characterized by amino acid analysis, electrospray mass spectrometry, analytical anion exchange chromatography (Ardelt & Laskowski, 1982, 1991), thermal denaturation studies except for Cys18 and Met18, and in many cases, N-terminal sequencing beyond the P1 position. In each, the amino acid composition, the molecular weight, the chromatographic 458 Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]behavior, the melting transition and tm value as well as the N-terminal sequence (beyond the P1 position) all agreed well with what was expected (Lu, 1994). It should be pointed out that, the Cys18 and Met18 variants generated by Staphylococcus aureusV8 hydrolysis contained trace amounts of non-covalently bound peptide fragments from the SPA domains, as indicated by N-terminal sequencing and poor amino acid analysis results.
Therefore, the identication of these two variants largely relied on mass spectral analysis and protein sequencing, which agreed well with expectations. 
The Ka values of OMTKY3 and OMSVP3 natural materials were respectively compared with the Leu18OMTKY3 and Met18OMTKY3 recombinant variants; in both cases, the Ka values are well within the 20% experimental error (Lu, 1994).
Note that in these comparisons for OMTKY3, the natural long form (Figure 1) is compared with the recombinant short form. For the OMSVP3, the natural long form is compared to the recombinant long form with a different N-terminal pentapeptide.
The identity of the Ka values extends the earlier conclusions of Wieczorek et al. (1987), who showed that absence of the natural pentapeptide has no effect on Ka. We now show that the recombinant pentapeptide (Figure 1) also has no effect on Ka.

Ka determination Determinations of equilibrium constants were carried out by an extensively modied procedure of Green &
Work (1953), as described by Empie & Laskowski (1982)
with later modications by Park (1985) and Wynn
(1990). For most enzymes we studied, the procedure allows for the determination of Ka values over 10 orders of magnitude (Ka from about 103 to 1013 M1)
with an accuracy of 20%.
The data were collected on a Hewlett-Packard HP8450A diode array spectrophotometer at 21 (2)C at pH 8.30 in 0.1 M Tris-HCI containing 0.005% Triton X-100 and 0.02 M CaCl2. Most Ka values were obtained using appropriate tetrapeptide pnitroanilide chromogenic substrates for the determination of the residual enzyme concentration in the incubation mixture.
However, for the Phe18, Tyr18 and Trp18 with CHYM, a more sensitive 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin-based uorogenic substrate was used and the signal change was monitored on a Perkin Elmer LS-50 uorometer. In addition, Ka values for Cys18 were measured in the presence of 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol to prevent possible dimerization.
