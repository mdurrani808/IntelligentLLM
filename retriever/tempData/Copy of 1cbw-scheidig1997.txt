KOSSIAKOFF Protein Engineering Department, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California 94080 (RECEIVED October 28, 1996; ACCEPTED May 7, 1997) Abstract The crystal structures of the inhibitor domain of Alzheimers amyloid @-protein precursor (APPI) complexed to bovine chymotrypsin (C-APPI) and trypsin (T-APPI) and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) bound to chy- motrypsin (C-BPTI) have been solved and analyzed at 2.1 A, 1.8 A, and 2.6 A resolution, respectively. APPI and BPTI belong to the Kunitz family of inhibitors, which is characterized by a distinctive tertiary fold with three conserved disulfide bonds.
At the specificity-determining site of these inhibitors (PI), residue 15(I) is an arginine in APPI and a lysine in BPTI, residue types that are counter to the chymotryptic hydrophobic specificity. In the chymotrypsin complexes, the Arg  and  Lys P1 side chains of the inhibitors adopt conformations that bend away from the bottom of the binding pocket to interact productively with elements of the binding pocket other than those observed for specificity-matched PI side chains.
The stereochemistry of the nucleophilic hydroxyl of Ser 195 in chymotrypsin relative to the scissile P1 bond of the inhibitors is identical to that observed for these groups in the trypsin-APPI complex, where Arg 15(I) is an optimal side chain for tryptic specificity. To further evaluate the diversity of sequences that can be accommodated by one of these inhibitors, APPI, we used phage display to randomly mutate residues 11, 13, 15. 17, and 19, which are major binding determinants.
As expected, trypsin specificity was principally directed by having a basic side chain at P1 (position  15); however, the P1 residues that were selected for chymotrypsin binding were His and Asn, rather than the expected large hydrophobic types. This can be rationalized by modeling these hydrophilic side chains to have similar H-bonding interactions to those observed in the structures of the described complexes.
The specificity, or lack thereof, for the other individual subsites is discussed in the context of the allowed residues determined from a phage display mutagenesis selection experiment.

California 94080; e-mail: koss@gene.com. 1806 Structures of APPI complexed to chymotrypsin and trypsin and BPTI to chymotrypsin 1807 A particularly fertile system for studying structure-function rela- tionships of molecular recognition involves protease-inhibitor asso- ciation.
In this regard, serine protease enzymes of the trypsin-like family have received considerable attention, because they display a broad range of binding and specificity requirements and play critical roles in a myriad of important biological processes (Stroud, 1974; Neurath, 1984; Barrett & Rawlings, 1995). In many cases, the proteolytic activities are arrested by a specific inhibitor (Las- kowski & Kato, 1980).
The Kunitz class of inhibitors is one of a number of protease inhibitor families involved in protease regula- tion. These inhibitors contain about 58 amino acids and share a high degree of sequence homology (Creighton & Charles, 1987), including the distribution of three disulfide groups, and are very similar in their tertiary structures.
They form 1 : 1 complexes with their enzyme targets by providing an extended loop that fills the enzyme active site in a conformation mimicking a bound substrate through a series of independent subsite interactions (Huber  et al., 1974). With additional contacts from a second binding loop, a total of up to 15 inhibitor residues are involved in the interface, making the interaction substantially more extensive than that of a peptide substrate.
Taken together, these interactions normally generate very tight complexes with binding constants in the picomolar (pM) range. 
The basic principles of how molecular surfaces fit together in a complementary fashion are generally recognized.
Factors that af- fect binding through steric, electrostatic, entropic, and solvation effects are areas of intense study; however, at this point, the details of their interplay are not understood clearly. A message emerging from the composite of considerable structural and mutagenesis work is that nature, through evolution, has established many dif- ferent ways to solve its molecular recognition requirements.
It is assumed that the productive complex requires a high degree of shape complementarity and that local regions within the interface must also be matched chemically in terms of polar characteristics. 
The interface is not a continuum, but a set of distinct subsites with different topographies and polar environments.

It is noteworthy that the Kunitz inhibitors, APPI and BPTI, bind to chymotrypsin with nanomolar affinities (Wagner et al., 1992; A.J. Scheidig, unpubl. results). This is surprising because both inhibitors have a basic side chain at residue 15, the so-called P1 position.
The P1 position is the side chain defining the primary specificity of the inhibitor (or substrate) and inserts directly into the enzymes binding pocket. Chymotrypsin has a distinct prefer- ence  for substrates with large hydrophobic residues at the P1 po- sition (Baumann et al., 1970; Berezin & Martinek, 1970).
The observation that there can be a mismatch at the principal binding site demonstrates that, in the presence of a number of other ener- getically productive interactions, one or a few such mismatches can be tolerated. 
The energetic contribution of individual residues contained within the binding epitope of APPI complexed to trypsin has been as- sessed by alanine scanning mutagenesis (Castro & Anderson, 1996).

There has also been a comprehensive analysis of the effects on affinity toward several different proteases of a variety of P1 sub- stitutions in the context of the Ovomucoid inhibitor third domain (Lu et al., 1997). Although the interaction of the P1 residue has been shown to be the major contributor, it is expected that the relative importance of interactions at the binding subsites will vary somewhat between different protease-inhibitor pairs, and that groups of interactions might act in a synergistic manner.
In fact, it has been determined that to alter trypsin specificity to that of chymo- trypsin requires not only reconfiguring its binding pocket, but exchanging several distant surface loops as well (Hedstrom  et al., 1992). 
To evaluate thoroughly the issue of the relationship between primary and secondary specificity by standard mutagenesis tech- niques would require making an unrealistically large number of mutants.
This problem has been overcome by employing the method of phage display mutagenesis, which allows the efficient selection of proteins that have undergone exhaustive and simultaneous mu- tation at a few specific sites (Wells & Lowman, 1992). Similar types of studies selecting Kunitz inhibitor mutants displaying novel binding properties have also been reported (Roberts et al., 1992; Dennis & Lazarus, 1994a, 1994b; Dennis et al., 1995; Markland et al., 1996).

The aim of the work reported here is to develop a structural perspective about the properties that define the specificity of the binding interface between these inhibitors and trypsin-like serine proteases. This study is based on the analysis and comparison of two different inhibitors, APPI and BPTI, complexed to two prote- ases, trypsin and chymotrypsin.
It is significant that these inhibi- tors are targeted toward proteases with trypsin specificity; that is, they have a basic side chain in the P1 position.  The structures presented here show that Lys and Arg side chains can have alternate modes of binding using differ- ent parts of the binding pocket, which explains why earlier at- tempts to model the chymotrypsin-BPTI complex produced an incorrect orientation of the Lys 15(I) side chain in the S 1  pocket (Blow  et al., 1972).
The phage display mutagenesis results show the binding subsites on the enzymes can reasonably accommodate a variety of side-chain types at the five sites on APPI that were mutated. Of particular interest was the finding that His and Asn were highly selected PI residues for chymotrypsin.
This contrasts its inherent hydrophobic specificity, but can be explained based on the stereochemistry of the Arg and Lys residues at P1 seen in the inhibitor-enzyme complexes. 
Results Overall structure of the complexes The refinement statistics and geometry of the final models are summarized in Table 1.
The respective orientations of APPI and BPTI bound to trypsin and chymotrypsin are similar to those of BPTI bound to bovine trypsin and of APPI bound to rat trypsin (Perona  et al., 1993a). Note however, that there are small, but real, overall orientational differences between the complexes of trypsin and chymotrypsin.
These differences, which are about 3 degrees, were determined by a vectorial relationship between central atoms in the enzyme and inhibitor in each system, and are about the same magnitude as those found between the two molecules in the asym- metric unit for the chymotrypsin complexes (Table 2). No distin- guishing features can be identified as the source of these small differences, and there is  no obvious reason to consider them bio- logically important.

APPI and BPTI superimpose well with each other when com- pared in their complexed states; the one significant change in the main-chain conformation occurs in residues 39-41 and was de- 1808 A.J.

Some differences are observed in side-chain conformations, but these are most probably a consequence of either complex forma- tion or different crystal packing environments. The nine residues in the primary binding loop of the inhibitors (residues 11-19) super- impose well, with an RMSD in main-chain atoms of 0.25 A, 0.23 A, and 0.26 A in trypsin-APPI (T-APPI), chymotrypsin- BPTI (C-BPTI), and chymotrypsin-APPI (C-APPI), respectively, using trypsin-BPTI (T-BPTI) as the reference.

Subsites of the protease-inhibitor interjiace The main chain of the principal binding loop of the Kunitz-type inhibitors (residues 11-19) forms a section of intermolecular anti- parallel P-sheet structure with the enzyme binding pocket.
In this configuration, alternate residues of the inhibitor present their side chains to make productive contact with the enzyme surface. 
For the side-chain interactions of the Kunitz inhibitors, these are the P5, P3, P1, P2, P4 sites, which represent inhibitor residues 11(I), 13(I), 15(I), 17(I),  19(I), respectively.
 A representation of this epitope and the corresponding charge and local topography on trypsin is shown in Figure 1. The S1 subsite of the enzyme and the PI residue of the inhibitor are the principal components defining the specificity of the enzyme.
A secondary inhibitor binding loop (residues 34-39) also contacts the proteases in both the trypsin and chymotrypsin complexes. Of the 14 inhibitor residues that are in contact or are proximal to the enzyme surfaces, six positions [ 1 1, 15, 17, 19, 34, and 39(I)] have been proposed as being responsible for differences in specificity (Perona & Craik, 1995).
Residues in five of the six positions differ between APPI:BPTI, three on the In Schechter-Berger nomenclature (Schechter & Berger, 1967), these subsites on the enzyme have the letter designation, S(n) (for the sequential binding subsites preceding the peptide scissile bond) through S(n) (for subsites following the cleaved bond).

Buried sulface  area On binding to chymotrypsin, APPI buries about 720 A2 of its surface, whereas BPTI buries slightly more, 770 A'. In both sets of complexes, there is a slightly larger percentage of hydro- phobic surface buried (-55%) than hydrophilic area.
As seen in Figure 2, the pattern of interactions of specific residues is quite similar, especially for the principal binding loop. However, there are some distinctive differences matching the variation in topog- raphies and side-chain orientations at the binding interfaces of these complexes.
In all cases, the major sites of interaction are through residues 15(I) and 17(I) of the inhibitors, which are highly buried and account for nearly one-half the buried surface area. Arg 39 of BPTI loses about 100 A* of its accessible surface; however, this site is not important in APPI, where the residue Gly 39 loses essentially nothing upon complexation.
Binding subsites on the trypsin surface that were characterized by phage display mutagenesis of the inhibitor are marked using Schechter and Berger nomenclature (1967).

S I - P I :  The primary binding subsite The SI-PI binding site is the principal specificity-defining deter- minant for serine protease enzymes.
As  such, there are significant differences in size, shape, and hydrophilicity of the trypsin and chymotrypsin binding pockets. Because of the large variation in the residues participating at the S 1 -P1 interface, the details of this site are discussed separately for each enzyme.

Trypsin The  S1 binding site of trypsin is a well-defined pocket formed by residues 189-195 and 214-220. The main chain and several of the side  chains of these segments are configured to make an ex- tensive network of H-bonding interactions with the Lys and Arg P1 residues.
In the T-APPI complex, the side chain of Arg 15(I) extends directly into the binding pocket, forming a direct salt bridge interaction between its guanidinium group and  the carbox- ylate of Asp 189, which is located at the bottom of the pocket (Fig. 3A). The Arg 15(I) side chain replaces two well-ordered water molecules that fill the binding pocket of uncomplexed tryp- sin [Wat 414 and Wat 805 of Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2PTN, Marquart et al., 19831.
In addition to the salt bridge, an H-bond is made between Arg 15(I)Nq2 and the hydroxyl of Ser 190 (2.8 A). The NE of the side chain H-bonds to a water (2.9 A), which in turn forms two long H-bonds to the carbonyl oxygens of Pro 13(I) (3.2 A) and Gly 216  (3.3 A).
In the T-BPTI complex, the side chain of the  inhibitor Lys 15(1) superimposes  well  on Arg 15(1) of its APPI counterpart. Although in T-BPTI the Lys A.J. Scheidig et al. points directly toward Asp  189,  no direct interaction with the car- boxylate of Asp 189 is made because of its shorter length (Huber et al., 1974).
Consequently, the interaction between Lys and the carboxylate is indirect, mediated by a water molecule, which shifts by 0.8 A toward Lys 15(I)-N( on inhibitor binding. This conserved water position in the trypsin S1 site is an- chored by H-bonds to the main-chain oxygen atoms of protease residue Val 227 and Trp 215 and to Ser 190 Oy; in chymotrypsin, Ser 190 Oy points away from this water.

Chymotrypsin Although there are differences in sequence in several of the binding pocket residues and an insertion of residue 218 in chymo- trypsin when compared to trypsin, the overall binding pattern of the inhibitors is essentially identical in the two enzymes. The com- posite differences in the binding pockets affect the stereochemical properties of the S 1 sites to a significant degree.
A clear difference in the binding pocket is the disposition of the side chain of residue 192 in the proteases. In T-APPI, Gln 192 is twisted into the pocket and H-bonds to Wat 5; in C-APPI, the Met 192 side chain is rotated away from the pocket and two waters (Wat 6, Wat 7) are located in the region where the Gln was found in T-APPI (Fig. 3A).

Considering the differences in topography and hydrophilicity of the binding pockets, it is not surprising that the conformations of Lys 15 (BPTI) and  Arg 15 (APPI)  are different between the chy- motrypsin and trypsin complexes. Instead of extending directly into the pocket, as is the case for the trypsin APPI and BPTI complexes, both the Arg and  Lys side chains adopt a conformation best described as a bending away from Ser 189 and toward the main chains of the inhibitor and the enzyme (Fig. 3B).
This ori- entation is referred to as the up position, differentiating it from the down position, where the side chains extend toward the bottom of the pocket, as is seen in T-APPI and T-BPTI. In the up orientation, a set of H-bonds is made involving the main-chain oxygens of Gly 217 (2.8 A) and Pro 13(I) (3.0 A).
The N( of Lys 15(I) in BPTI superimposes on Nq2 of  Arg 15(I) in APPI and forms the same set of interactions (Table 3; Fig. 3B). 
A comparison of the conformation of the Arg 15(I) side chain and its interactions with the binding pocket in the chymotrypsin and trypsin APPI complexes is shown in Figure 3A.
A water (Wat 2) in C-APPI super- imposes directly on the guanidinium N772 in T-APPI and Wat 3 is within 0.5 8, of the carboxylate 0 6 2  of Asp 189. 
In the C-APPI and C-BPTI structures, four water molecules as- sume essentially identical positions (Fig. 3B).
There are, however, two additional waters in the C-APPI structure; one H-bonds to Cys 14(I) 0 (2.6 A) and the other to a water that interacts with Ser 189 and Gly 221. 
Based simply on stereochemical criteria, there is no apparent reason why, in the chymotrypsin complexes, the P1 side chains adopt the up over the down conformation preferentially.
In this position, it would displace one water molecule, Wat 2, and H-bond to two ordered water molecules, Wat 1 and Wat 3, whereas Wat 5 would be in a position to H-bond to the NE, as it does in T-APPI. However, it is clear that the Structures of APPI complexed to chymotrypsin and trypsin and BPTI to chymotrypsin 181 1 A B Fig. 3.
A: Superposition of T-APPI (green) and  C-APPI  (magenta)  PI  binding  pockets  comparing  the  conformations of Arg 15(I) and the local water structure. In trypsin, the Arg 15(I) side chain is in the down position, forming a salt bridge to Asp 189; in the chymotrypsin  complex,  this  side  chain  is  in  the up position.
Arg and Lys side chains of inhibitor residue 15(I) are in up position,  H-bonding  to  the  carbonyl  carbons of 13(I) of the  inhibitor  and 217 of the enzyme.  Whatever  the  nature  of  the  balance  of energy  that  selects  the  up  position  versus  the  extended  down position  (the  T-APPI  conformation), it appears  not  to  involve  the shape or solvation  of the  chymotrypsin  S1  pocket.

The S2-P2 subsite: An important  secondary site of interaction Composition of the  S2  binding cleft The S2 pocket  binds  the side chain  of residue 17(I) (P2) and is  formed  by structural  components  from  both  the  protease  and  the inhibitor  itself.  The  protease  interface  for  this site is comprised  of the  main-chain  atoms  from  loops  30-41  and  192-193,  and  by  the side  chains of residues 39, 40, and  151 (Fig. 4).

As  pictured  in  Figure  4,  the  top  of  the  pocket is more  open in chymotrypsin  than  in  trypsin. This is partly  due  to  the  larger  side chain  of residue  151,  which is Qr in  trypsin  and Thr in  chymo- trypsin.
 Additionally,  there  is  a  proteolytic  clip  that  removes  the dipeptide, Thr 147-Asn  148,  in a-chymotrypsin,  the  enzyme  form used in this study. This clip  causes  some  disorder  in  the  region preceding  residue  151, as well as somewhat  altered  conformations around  15 1, as seen  in  the  two  independent  molecules  in  the  crys- tallographic asymmetric units in both the C-APPI and C-BFTI structures.
 (Comparison of  the  two  independent  molecules  in  the chymotrypsin  complexes  allows  for an assessment  of  real  fea- tures,  those  observed  for  each  structure,  versus  features  found  in only  one,  which are ascribed to factors  such as crystal  packing.) On the other hand, the 5 r  151 side chain in trypsin structure tightly  encloses  the 17(I) side  chain.  Residue 40 is His in  both  enzymes, 39 is 5 r  in trypsin and Phe in chymotrypsin, which are oriented differently  in  the  two  enzymes.
 In  trypsin,  the Qr side  chain is rotated  away  from 17(I) by  about 60 compared to its Phe  coun- terpart  in  chymotrypsin  (Fig.  4). In this  orientation, it makes  two H-bonds: to the  main-chain  amide  of 19(I) (3.0 A) and to the NL of  Lys 60 (2.9 A) of the enzyme.

Orientations of the 17(1) side  chains The Met 17(I) side  chain  has  a  somewhat  different  conformation in  the  APPI  complexes. In C-APPI,  the smaller Thr 151  side  chain allows  the  conformation  of  the  Met  side  chain to be more  extended compared to that  in T-MPI (Fig. 4).
In C-APPI, the pocket contains one bound water molecule that H-bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of residue Trp 141 and the side chain Oyl of Thr 151. 
Another notable difference is a translation of the Phe ring of 34(I), which keeps the ring in  van der Waals contact with the Met side chain.
In C-BPTI, a water molecule (Wat 1, Fig. 4) H-bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of 141  (2.8 A) and the Oyl of Thr 151 (3.3 A). Wat 2 makes an H-bond to 141 0 (2.7 A) analogous to Wat 1 in the chymotrypsin complex, but it is dis- placed by about 2.5 because of the altered orientation of the Met side chain.
Wat 4 H-bonds to the main-chain amide of His 40 (2.9 A) and to Wat 3, which, in turn, forms a long H-bond to the carbonyl oxygen of His 40  (3.3 A). 
In the BPTI complexes, Arg 17(I) packs its methylene side- chain carbons  into the hydrophobic cleft described above with its hydrophilic guanidinium group extended out to make H-bonding contacts with surface polar groups and solvent.

The S3-P3 subsite The sequence of residues 12-14 is Gly-Pro-Cys in both APPI and BPTI, and these residues adopt the same conformation in all the complexes.  There is a strong requirement for a Gly  at position 12, because there  is no space  for a side chain due to the proximity of the main chain of Cys 38(I), which in turn is fixed in its orientation by the disulfide bridge with Cys 14(I).
Although a proline at res- idue 13 is reasonably well conserved in the Kunitz family of in- hibitors (Creighton & Charles, 1987; Creighton & Darby, 1989). 
from a structural standpoint it appears that it could be replaced by a variety of amino acid types because its p carbon is oriented toward a solvent-exposed region that includes a few well-ordered water binding sites.

Subsites SN" and S4'-P4': The edge of the binding pocket The S5 and S4' sites define the extremities of the principal protease- inhibitor binding surface. A notable difference between the two sites is that, whereas the S4' sites of trypsin and chymotrypsin have generally similar topographies, their S5 sites are quite dif- ferent, as pictured in Figure 5 .
 The S5 pocket is formed by residues 146,  192, and 217-219 of the enzyme and 34(1)-35(1) of the inhibitor. The posttranslational excision of the dipeptide Thr 147- Asn 148 in a-chymotrypsin, combined with sequence variations, results in a different packing of side  chains 143-146 and 149-151 compared to the 143-151 loop in trypsin.
In trypsin, this loop assumes a conformation where no residues are close to the Thr 11 (I) side chain. Additionally, the disposition of enzyme res- idues 216-219 is quite different, partly due to the insertion of Thr 218 in the chymotrypsin sequence.
This segment of chain in chymotrypsin is translated about 3 8, toward 1 ](I), where it forms an extensive interface burying about 70% of the surface area of the Thr(1) side chain. The surface of this side of the pocket is extended in the chymotrypsin complexes by the side chain of 5 r  146, which packs against Thr 218.
The main chain of 146 in trypsin is 3 A farther away; in addition, the side chain points away from the pocket, resulting in an open pocket in the trypsin complexes. 
Another extensive face of the S5 pocket is formed by the main chain of inhibitor residues 34(1)-35(I) and the protease side chain of 192.
Although the type and conformation of the 192 side chain differs between the two enzymes, the surface buried upon com- plexation is similar (= 85 A*). The chymotrypsin complexes have two ordered waters that superimpose the terminal 062 and Ne1 atoms of the Gln 192 side chain, as it is oriented in the trypsin complexes.
A characteristic of this pocket in both the trypsin and chymotrypsin complexes  is a highly organized water structure. In all the complexes, there is room to accommodate a large P5 side  chain, although this would eliminate the H-bond in the complexes between the Thr 1 ](I) Oyl and the carbonyl of Phe 34(I)  (2.9 A).

The S4' site  fits the 19(I) side chain and is formed principally by side  chains of the inhibitor: 21 (I) (Trp:Qr, APPI versus BPTI), 32(I) (Pro:Thr), and 34(I)(Phe:Val) and  the protease side chain 39 (Qr:Phe,  for trypsin versus chymotrypsin). In the T-APPI com- plex, this binding cleft  is more highly structured due  to the bulkier Phe 34(I) side chain and the conformation of the Q r  ring of residue 39 (Fig. 6).
In this complex, Ser 19(I) H-bonds to a water molecule (Wat 1, 2.8 A), which sits between the side chains of Structures of APPI complexed to chymotrypsin and  trypsin and BPTI to chymotrypsin 1813 1 O(I1 U Fig. 5. This pocket is considerably  smaller in the chymotrypsin  structures  than in  the trypsin  counterpart.
 Note  the  pattern of the  ordered  waters  in  T-APPI (green), which  lay  in close proximity  to  the  main  chain of 216-218 in  C-APPI. Although an H-bond between the hydroxyls of Ser 19(I) and 39 can be modeled  by  rotating  the 19(I) side chain,  the  geometry  of  the resulting H-bond is not  optimal  and  it is apparent why the energetics  favor  the  observed confguration.

Note, however, that small adjustments can make the Ser 19(I) Oy-Tyr 3907 interaction  favorable as observed  in  the  APPI-rat trypsin  structure  (Perona  et  al.,  1993a). 
In the BPTI complexes, the Ile 19(I) side chain buries about 40%  of its  accessible  surface  area.
 It  is  surrounded by a  lattice of water  molecules  just  outside  its  van  der Waals contact  surface.  One of  the  waters  in C-BPTI overlays  the  hydroxyl  of 5 r  39  directly in  the  trypsin  complexes  and  makes  the  same  H-bond  to  the  amide peptide  nitrogen  of 19(I) (3.0 A).

Selection of APPI inhibitors with altered specificity by phage display mutagenesis Library selection To further elaborate on the variety of inhibitors  that  can  bind tightly  to  trypsin  and  chymotrypsin,  we  randomly  mutated  APPI  at positions  11,  13,  15,  17,  and  19  using  phage  display  and  selected those mutants that bound tightly to each protease (Fig. 7). The number  of  DNA  sequences  possible  when five  codons  are  mutated randomly  by  substitution  with NNS is 3.4 X lo7 (325).
The size of the  library  screened  (9 X lo6 independent  transformants)  was  less than  that  needed  to cover  all  possible DNA  sequences,  but  should have provided a reasonable sampling of the 3.2 X lo6 possible amino acid combinations. To estimate the sequence bias in the starting  library,  27  independent  clones  were  picked  at  random  and sequenced.
From the 135 NNS codons sequenced (5 X 27), the nucleotide  frequencies  were  19% A, 28% T, 23% C, and  30% G for the first two  positions,  and  48% C, 51% G, and  1% T in the  third position. The starting library contained an even distribution of amino  acids in each  position,  dependent  primarily  on  the  theoret- ical  number of  codons for  each amino acid.

Libraries were  selected  for  binding  to  each of the two proteases [T+ or C'], either in  the  presence [T- or C-] or  absence [To or Co] of  the other  protease  in  solution.  This  produced  four  different selection protocols abbreviated: [T' Co], [T+ C-1, [ T o  C+], or [T- Cf] .
 Following 6 or 12 rounds of binding enrichment, the sequence  diversity  in  the  starting  library  was  reduced  to  distinct distributions of  amino  acids  (Table 4; Fig.  8).  Positions l l  and 17, which were diverse in the optimal trypsin  library  [T' Co], were  focused  more  narrowly  in  the  opti- mal  chymotrypsin  library [ T o  c'].
Position 13 was  focused  in  the optimal trypsin library [T+ Co] and diverse in the optimal chy- motrypsin  library [To  C'].

Outline of the phage display vector and the strategy for positive and negative selection of APPI variants. The  staning library of phagc- mid particles is subjected to rounds of selection to isolate an enriched pool of sequences.
Broadly specific sequences are selected through successive rounds of positive selection to each protease target. Aftcr binding selection, indi- vidual phage are isolated and the ssDNA sequenced to dctcrmine the amino acid suhstitutions present.
Finally. the ssDNA is transformed into a non- suppressor E. coli strain, in  which the amher codon terminates translation and free inhihitor is produced. 
Optimal  binding  sequences In the optimal trypsin library [T' C"] ,  Arg and Lys were the only amino acids selected in position 15, the PI position.
The strong selection for Arg and Lys residues matches the substrate specificity as well as the general presence of basic residues in the PI position of protein inhibitors of trypsin. Both APPI and BPTI bind extremely tightly to trypsin using Arg and Lys residues in position 15, respectively.
The preference for Arg over Lys corre- lates with the higher turn-over of Arg-containing small peptide substrates relative to Lys substrates (Perona  et al.. 199%). In ad- dition, there were strong preferences for His and  Asn at position 13 and Lys and Gln at position 19.

The striking result from the optimal chymotrypsin binding library [TI' C " ]  is the strong selection for Asn and His residues in position 15. The cleavage specificity of chymotrypsin is bi- ased toward large- and medium-sized hydrophobic side chains (Bauer et al., 1976).
This clone, as well as clones with an Asn or His in position 15, were expressed and assayed for chymotrypsin binding activity (Table 5). This argues that, in the context of the APPI inhibitor, scaffold Asn and His side chains in the PI site are equally potent for chy- motrypsin inhibition as a large hydrophobic side chain.
In posi- tion 11, Arg and His were selected with a significantly narrowed distribution after 12 rounds, compared with 6 rounds, of binding selection. 
Protease  inhibition by selected  sequences The population of sequences from each selected library was expressed as a pool and assayed for inhibition of trypsin and chy- motrypsin (Table 6).
Individual clones from the selected libraries were expressed and assayed to determine if the apparent K, values of the pools were representative of individ- ual sequences (Table 5) .  The clones chosen for assays were se- quences that most closely matched the consensus sequence of  the selected libraries.

Two libraries were selected for binding to trypsin with increas- ing use of negative selection against chymotrypsin (Table 6). The addition of negative selection to chymotryp- sin [T+ C - ]  decreased the cross reaction with chymotrypsin by 60-fold.
However, the increased specificity of the negatively se- lected library, [T+ C-1. was linked to a fourfold loss of affinity for trypsin. Thus, the use of negative selection increased signif- icantly the specificity of the selected inhibitor sequences for their target proteases accompanied by some loss of absolute bind- ing affinity.

Similar trends in binding specificity were seen for the libraries selected for chymotrypsin inhibition (Table 6) .  The K; for chymo- trypsin with simple positive selection [To C']  was in the 10 nM range and increased in the negatively selected library, [T- C'] .
the Ki values for trypsin were greater than 200 nM. This represents the extent of nonspecific cross re- action that occurs in the absence of negative selection. Ki values for chymotrypsin ranged from 10 to 20 nM. This is surprising, given the fact that the library that was positively selected for chymotrypsin binding exhibited Ki values in the same range.
It appears that the sequences selected for trypsin binding interact with chymotrypsin as well as sequences selected for chymotrypsin binding. 
Discussion Exploring specijiciy and its  structural basis using phage disp1o.v mutagenesis A pertinent characteristic of the Kunitz family of inhibitors is that they bind extremely tightly to a broad range of serine proteases Structures of APPI complexed to chymotrypsin and trypsin and BPTI to chymotrypsin 1815 Table 4.

Although the P1 side chain remains the most important effector to tight binding, these inhibitors have a surprisingly broad specificity profile as demonstrated with the structures described here.

There  is an extensive literature dealing with sequence specificity for the trypsin-like serine proteases (Graf et al., 1982; Evnin et al., 1990; Keil, 1992). The compilation of the data shows clearly that trypsin has a very strong preference for basic side chains at PI, whereas chymotrypsin shows a distinct preference for large hy- drophobics like V r ,  Trp, and Phe.
It has also been recognized that, although the extent may differ from system to system, secondary specificity plays an important role in catalysis (Hedstrom et al., 1994; Perona & Craik, 1995). In the serine protease family, the data suggest that the influence of these other subsites correlates with how optimally the PI residue interacts with its binding pocket (Keil, 1992).

hPurified protein was used in assays of APPI and BPTI inhibition Tyr, Trp) at P1 dominates substrate binding and turnover and there is only a small influence of residues at P1' and P2'.
 For the weaker PI residue, Leu, the amino acid types at P3, P2, PI', and P2' play a measurable role in binding. Interestingly, for this enzyme, there is a statis- tically significant preference for Arg and Lys at  PI', whereas the converse is true in trypsin, where these residues have a negative influence.
In this regard, it should be pointed out that there are certain subsite sequences that have a strong negative influence on substrate turnover for all these enzymes. For example, Pro at  PI ' is essentially totally disallowed and Asp at either P1' or P2 is highly disfavored. Phage display mutagenesis was used to establish whether sim- ilar trends exist for these Kunitz inhibitors and to explore issues involving binding energies and specificity.
In the procedure, five residues in the principal binding loop of APPI were targeted for random mutagenesis: positions 1 1 ,  13, 15, 17, and 19. In the con- text of the inhibitor structure, the binding loop does not have the conformational flexibility that a free substrate would possess.
The phage mutagenesis results showed, as expected, that trypsin selec- tions at P1 are limited to Arg and Lys and this takes preference over any secondary specificity. This is consistent with the trend that establishes dominance  for the good PI residues over second- ary specificities6 The picture for PI selectivity is quite different for chymotrypsin.
First, inhibitors with the expected PI residues were not isolated in the selection, and sec- ond, this apparently led to greater influence of the subsites. Of 21 sequenced clones, only 1 had a Phe at P1, 1 1 clones had an Asn, and 8 others had a His; these latter two residue types require a hydrophilic environment.
It is important to note that there is no obvious technical reason that Phe was prejudiced against, because a Phe showed a selective preference assayed against a mixture of proteases in a parallel sort using the same libraries (data not shown). 
The structure determination of the Asn and His PI mutants is underway and preliminary interpretation of the difference maps indicates that these side chains form H-bonds to the edge of the binding pocket (A.J. Scheidig & A.A. Kossiakoff, unpubl. results).

'Inhibitors from other classes, for instance, ecotin and a-antitrypsin, having a Met at their P1 position, have more extensive interactions with nonbinding pocket residues, which are the driving force for the developed binding energy.

The chymotrypsin PI selections are not surprising in light of the alanine-scan data reported by Castro and Anderson (1996). Those data showed that the KIS(I)A mutation results in a decrease in binding of only about threefold in C-BPTI.
This is in contrast to what is seen in the OMTKY3 protease-inhibitor complexes, where an alanine substitution at P1 (position Leu 18 in OMTKY3) re- duces its binding affinity to chymotrypsin by almost lo4 (Lu et al., 1997). Part of this discrepancy is due to the significantly different affinities the two classes of inhibitors inherently have to chymo- trypsin.
Although APPI and BPTI bind tightly to chymotrypsin ( K ,  = 20 X M), they probably have evolved to inhibit pref- erentially enzymes with trypsin specificity ( K ,  - M). The opposite is probably true for OMTKY3, which binds to chymo- trypsin with a K, of about 2 X IO"' M (Lu et al., 1997).
This suggests that each inhibitor family has its own special set of com- posite stereochemical elements to bind effectively to their cognate enzyme targets. 
Topographical character of the subsites Of the five binding sites probed by phage mutagenesis, only two, SI and S2', have the character of a real pocket.
The pockets do not form highly restrictive environments, as can be judged by the wide variety of side-chain  types that are accommodated (Table 4). A characteristic of subsites S5, S3, S2', and S4' is that part of the structure of the site is defined by proximal residues in the inhibitor.
That is, with the exception of SI, none of the sites are preformed prior to inhibitor binding, the inhibitor itself "bringing along" a part of the pocket. 
Space-filling renderings of the S5 (position 11) and S2' (posi- tion 17) subsites in T-APPI are shown in Figure 9.
In the phage sorts for C-APPI, the P5 residue, position 1 1, had a predilection for Arg and there was a strong preference for a large hydrophobic group at P2', position 17. Preliminary structure analyses of several mutants in- dicate that accurate modeling of the side chains into the subsites would be extremely difficult, because the orientation of the side chains of either the inhibitor, the enzyme, or both can change, as well as the interacting water structure (A.J. Scheidig & A.A. Kossiakoff, unpubl. results).

motrypsin, there is a strong preference for Arg; this large side chain  can  be  accommodated  easily  by its extension  into  the  acces- sible solvent region.
An interesting point in this regard is that, although  the  disposition of the Arg side  chain  in  chymotrypsin  is restricted to a  more  confined  binding  cleft, in trypsin  several  pos- sible  orientations for a  basic side chain  exist. In a Tl lK T-APPI mutant, the Lys side chain is oriented to H-bond to the 062 of Gln 192 (unpubl. results).
This confonnation is not available to mutants  binding to chymotrypsin  not  only  because  residue  192 is a  Met,  but  also  because the ring of Q r  146  and  the  main-chain 217-218  would interfere (Fig. 9A). 
The S2' subsite Along  with  S1,  the S2' subsite  is  a  major  contributor  to  binding based  on its ability to bury  large  side  chains of either  hydrophobic or hydrophilic  character.
In APPI  and  BPTI, the 17(I) side  chain contributes  about  140 A2 of  buried surface  area to the  complex.  As discussed  above,  the  pocket  is  somewhat  smaller  in  trypsin due to the "capping" by the T y r  151 side chain (Fig. 9B).
Given these similarities, it is noteworthy  that the chymotrypsin  selections are almost  exclusively  large  hydrophobics,  whereas those for trypsin are  generally  hydrophilic  and  a  significant  percentage of  them are small. It is probably the  case  that  the  energetics of binding  are so highly  driven  by the P1 residue  that  there is little  dynamic  range  in  the  binding  energies associated  with  the S2' pocket.

Stereochemistry at the attacking nucleophile The  stereochemistry  around  the  catalytic  machinery  in  structures of Kunitz inhibitor-protease complexes is thought to model the structure of a Michaelis complex. It has been proposed that a principal  determinant of efficient  enzyme  hydrolysis  involves  the alignment of the  attacking  nucleophile to the  scissile  bond of  the substrate  (Kossiakoff,  1987).
 The  complementarity of the  P1  side chain  to  the  enzyme  binding  pocket  presumably  plays  a  large ole in  the  precise  orientation of the  scissile  bond.  Judged  from the P1 binding  observed  in  the  trypsin  complexes,  the  configurations of the  catalytic Ser 195  and  the  P1  scissile  bond  represent  productive stereochemistries,  whereas  those of the  chymotrypsin  complexes might be affected by the less than optimal binding of the Arg (APPI)  and  Lys (BPTI) side  chains.
 Thus,  comparison  of  the  tryp- sin  and  chymotrypsin  complex  structures  can  provide  some  insight into  the  degree  to  which  binding of  nonoptimal P1 residues  might distort the stereochemistry of the attacking  nucleophile at the  scis- sile bond. 
To  make  such comparisons, it is  important o eliminate  potential artifacts stemming from stereochemical restraints applied during Structures of APPI complexed  to  chymotrypsin and trypsin and BPTZ to chymotrypsin 1819 structure  refinement.
In this regard, it was  necessary  to  modify the nonbonded  repulsion  term  between  the Ser 195 Oy and the scissile C to allow  the Oy to approach  the  carbon  atom  closer  than  the  van der Waals distance. Additionally,  the  restraint for planarity of the 15(I) peptide  group  was  removed to allow for some  distortion at  the  scissile  bond.
These alterations  led  to  a  refined  distance of 2.70 8, between  the  Ser  195 Oy and  the  carbonyl  carbon of 15(I) in  T-APPI. Further  reduction of the  van  der  Waals  radius of 195 Oy did not lead to an additional decrease in this distance.
In the C-APPI  and  C-BPTI  complexes,  the  refined  distances  were  2.68 8, and 2.75 A, respectively. Distances in this range have been re- ported  in  a  number of similar  inhibitor-protease  complexes  (re- viewed  in  Bode & Huber,  1992).

Although  the  shorter Oy-C distance  suggests  a  small  degree of covalent  character of the  bond, no apparent  distortion  in  the  pla- narity  of the  peptide  bond  toward  a  pyramidal  configuration  was observed (Fig. 10). This finding differs from that found in the 2.1-8,  rat  trypsin-APPI structure,  where  a  distortion from planarity was reported (Perona et al., 1993a).
It must be said, however, that at the  resolution of  all  these  structures,  small  distortions of the type  suggested  are  beyond  the  limits  of  confident  interpretation. 
Planar  geometry at the  peptide  bond  has  been  reported  in  a  series of  third  domain  ovomucoid  inhibitor-Streptomyces griseus prote- ase complexes  (Read & James, 1988),  whereas  a very slight  dis- tortion was  reported for the  eglin-subtilisin  complex (Bode et al., 1986).

Based  on  the  comparison  between  the  trypsin  and  chymotrypsin complexes,  the  stereochemistry  at the site of nucleophilic  attack is essentially the same for a  good  P1  side  chain  as for a poor one.  Small,  but  significant,  differences could be masked  because  the  structures  were  done  at  only  about 2 8, resolution; the most accurate method for determining such small differences is through difference map analysis in isomor- phous crystal systems, but this could not be done in this case because  each  complex  crystallized in a different  space  group.
 Nev- ertheless, it can be said that if differences do occur, they have magnitudes  less  than  a few tenths of an 8,. Additionally,  analysis of the  complexes  shows  that  the  presentation of the  inhibitors  bind- ing  loop  to  the  proteases  active  site  and  binding  pocket  involves a  more  restricted  conformation  than  would  exist for a free peptide substrate.
For instance, the disulfide bridge at position 14, the residue  preceding  P1,  influences  the  flexibility  at  the  scissile  pep- tide. In fact,  the  reason  these  proteins  act as inhibitors  rather  than substrates may  be  due to  restrictions of conformation and flexibil- ity,  properties  that  would  not  impede  hydrolysis of a free substrate.

Nevertheless, based on the high degree of complementarity ob- served for the Lys and  Arg side  chains  in  the  chymotrypsin  com- plexes, it is not clear why substrates  with  these PI residues are hydrolyzed lo4 times  more  slowly  than  optimum  side-chain  types (Hedstrom  et  al.,  1994). It is an example of the different  stereo- chemical  criteria  that are needed for simple  binding  versus  those needed  to  perform effkient chemistry.

To extract the inhibitor, the supernatant was passed over  an affinity column with trypsin covalently bound to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). 
The inhibitor was eluted from the washed affinity column (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCI, 20 mM CaCI2) with IO mM HCL, 500 mM KCl.
The eluted inhibitor was purified by pre- parative reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (10 X 250 mm)  using  a 30-min  linear  gradient of IO-40% (v/v) acetonitrile/water/O.l% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) with a 2.5 mL/min flow rate. The proteins were verified for the proper mass using a Sciex API 3 mass spectrometer equipped with an articulated electrospray source for mass analysis.

Analytical reversed-phase HPLC indicated that the affinity-purified proteins were >90% pure and the HPLC-purified samples were >99% pure. 
/?-Trypsin was purified away from other forms using a modifica- tion of published procedures (Schroeder & Shaw, 1968; Fehlham- mer & Bode, 1975).
Protein was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 20 mM CaC12, and subjected to isocratic separation at room temperature on a Mono-S ion exchange column (Pharmacia FPLC system) equilibrated with the same buffer. Excess APPI was added immediately to fractions containing &trypsin so that com- plex formation would protect /?-trypsin from proteolysis.
Buffer exchange, as well as removal of uncomplexed APPI (M, = 6.5 m a ) ,  was performed by dialysis into 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, using a dialysis membrane with a 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff. To form the 1 : 1 complex between chymotryp- sin and inhibitor, 100 pL of 2.0 mM chymotrypsin in 1 mM HCI, 20 mM CaCl, were added to 120 p L  of  2.0  mM APPI or BPTI in 20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, I O  mM CaCI2, and allowed to incubate for 12 h at 4C.
The concentration of the protein stock solutions was adjusted using the reading of a 1 : 1,000 di- luted solution [EllrZlOnm = 20.4 (chymotrypsin), 14.3 (trypsin), 17.2 (APPI and BPTI)]. 
Crystallization For crystallization of the trypsin-APPI complex, the solution was set up at 40 mg/mL in hanging drops subjected to vapor diffusion (McPherson, 1990) at 4C against a reservoir containing 25% (w/v) PEG 3400, 200 mM ammonium acetate, and 100 mM so- dium citrate adjusted to pH 6.5.
Small crystals obtained from the hanging drops were seeded into sitting drops with a protein con- centration of 26 mg/mL and equilibrated against the same reservoir solution containing 23% (w/v) PEG 3400. Crystals suitable for data collection (0.2 X 0.2 X 0.4 mm) were grown from seeds in approximately one month. Crystals of the 1:l complex between chymotrypsin and APPI were grown at 4C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method equilibrating against a reservoir solution containing 10-12.5% (w/v) PEG-6000 (Fluka), 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.0, and 5%  (v/v) dimethylacetamide.
Suitable crystals grew within a week, reaching their final size of 1.0 X 0.4 X 0.2 mm in about one month. 
Chymotrypsin-BPTI crystals were grown at room temperature in sitting drops by equilibrating a 35-pL drop containing 20 mg/mL of the complex, 0.5% (v/v) MPD, 8% (v/v) saturated ammonium sulfate, 80 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, against a reservoir containing 50% (v/v) saturated ammonium sulfate, 80 mM Tris-HCI, pH  7.5.

X-rav data  collection The data sets for the trypsin-APPI and the chymotrypsin-BPTI complexes were collected at room temperature on an Enraf-Nonius FAST area detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating Cu- anode generator operated at 45 kV, 110 mA, with a 3-mm focal spot tube and  a graphite monochromator. Data frames covering a 0.1 oscillation range were exposed for 120 s. The crystals of the chymotrypsin-APPI complex were radiation sensitive.
The reso- lution improved from 3.1 w to 2.0 A by flash-freezing the crystals, which also eliminated the radiation damage. A cryogenic data set was collected on beamline 7.1 at SSRL using a Mar image plate system (300-mm plate diameter) and reduced with the XDS pro- gram package (Kabsch, 1988a, 1993).
The data sets collected with the FAST area detector were processed with the MADNES (Mess- erschmidt & Pflugrath, 1987) and PROCOR (Kabsch, 1988b) soft- ware packages. 
Structure determination and refinement Most of the calculations were performed with X-PLOR (Briinger et al., 1987, 1990; Briinger, 1990a; Engh & Huber, 1991) and the CCP4 program suite (CCP4, 1994).
For all complexes, the starting phases for the refinement were obtained by molecular replacement using the programs X-PLOR (Briinger, 1990b) and AMoRe (Na- vaza, 1992, 1993). The starting search model for trypsin-APPI was derived from the coordinates of the trypsin-BPTI complex (PDB entry 2PTC; Bernstein et al., 1977; Marquart et al., 1983) and consisted of all protein atoms including the refined temperature factors.
The rotation-search in combination with PC-refinement and the subsequent translation-search gave one unambiguous so- lution. The starting search model for the chymotrypsin-BPTI com- plex was constructed from chymotrypsin (PDB entry 5CHA; Blevins & Tulinsky, 1985) and BPTI of trypsin-BPTI (PDB entry 2PTC; Marquart et al., 1983) by matching the core backbone atoms of chymotrypsin with the equivalent atoms of trypsin in the trypsin- BPTI structure.
Rotation searches and PC-refinement using X-PLOR produced two strong solutions that were related by a twofold symmetry axis parallel to the a* axis, consistent with a self-rotation calculation. The two rotation solutions were used in translation searches giving strong solutions only in space group P6, and not in P6s.
The two complexes are related by a pseudo twofold axis between the edges of BPTI mol- ecules that form a spiral along the sixfold screw axis with chymo- trypsin molecules bound on alternate edges of the strand of BPTI molecules. A large solvent channel runs along the sixfold screw axis, which contributes to the 74% solvent content of the crystal.

Structures of APPI complexed to chymotrypsin and trypsin and BPTI to chymotrypsin 1821 The molecular replacement for the chymotrypsin:APPI complex was performed using only chymotrypsin (PDB entry, 5CHA) as the search model. 
The  structures were refined in an iterative fashion, using cycles of X-PLOR and PROLSQ (Hendrickson, 1985) alternated with model building into SIGMAA- (Read, 1986) weighted 2F0h, - Fcalc and F,,hs - Fcrrlc electron density maps using the molecular graphics programs FRODO (Jones, 1978) and 0 (Jones et al., 1991).
Water molecules were added to the models based on peaks with proper H-bonding geometry and 3 u  density in the difference map. The program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) was used to evaluate the stereochemical and geometric quality, as well as to highlight outliers.
Chymotrypsin-APPI and chymotrypsin-BPTI were refined with the Engh and Huber (1991) protein parameters. 
The chymotrypsin-BPTI crystals diffracted anisotropically and a final anisotropic overall B-factor refinement in X-PLOR reduced the R-factor by 1.4%.
The six anisotropic B-factor parameters were refined to the following values: B11 = -2.057, B22 = -2.057, 833 = 4.1139, B12 = -0.0831, B13 = 0.0, and B23 = 0.0.  To compare the analyzed structures, the unique best set of overlapping Ca-atoms used for pairwise superpositioning of the complexes was deter- mined with the progam NEWDOME (Perry et al., 1994) with 0.5 A for maximum core movement and a IO-A radius of contact.

Furthermore, small alterations in interresidue distances in one mol- ecule compared to another were evaluated by the calculation of a difference distance matrix. For the comparison of the relative ori- entation between the inhibitor and the protease, the angle between two vectors was calculated.
The vertex point of the two vectors was set on the Ca-atom of the PI residue (inhibitor residue 15); the end point of the vectors was the midpoint of the highly conserved disulfide bridges between the inhibitor residues Cys 5 and Cys 55 on one side and the proteinase residues Cys 136 and Cys 201 on the other. These disulfide bridges are part of the very well- conserved core of the three-dimensional fold and are distant from the active site.

Phage display mutagenesis The plasmid pA4G32 was constructed by subcloning the synthetic gene encoding the APPI sequence (Castro et al., 1990) in place of the human growth hormone sequence in the phGHam-g3 plasmid developed for the monovalent display (Bass  et al., 1990; Lowman et al., 1991). The plasmid contains the alkaline phosphatase pro- moter, st11 secretion signal, the APPI gene, and codons 249-406 of the MI3 gene I11 protein (Fig. 7).
The plasmid also carries the colEl and phage f l  origins of replication as well as ampicillin resistance. The APPI gene covers the 58 residues of the Alzhe- imer's amyloid P-protein precursor (APP) (residues 287-344 of APP-751) (Ponte et al., 1988), which share homology with the basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI).
The 58  codons of the APPI gene  are followed by an amber codon (TAG), which allows APPI-gene III fusion phage to be produced in the supE XL1-Blue strain of E. coli  (Bullock et al., 1987). Using site-directed muta- genesis (Kunkel et al., 1991), one  Aat I1 site was introduced into the APPI  gene and five duplicate sites  outside the gene were elim- inated (Pst I, Aut 11, Scu I, and two BumH I), so that the final construct contains nine unique restriction sites distributed along the APPI  gene.

Library construction Codons 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 of APPI (residue numbering corresponds to that of BPTI) were mutated randomly using a syn- thetic oligonucleotide cassette. These positions correspond to the Ps, P3, PI ,   Pi ,  and Pi residues, respectively, for serine protease substrates (Schechter & Berger, 1967).
As defined, cleavage oc- curs between P1 and PI '  positions with numbered positions in the N-terminal direction and prime numbered positions in the C-terminal direction. The five codons were mutated simultaneously with the nucleotide sequence NNS (N = A/T/C/G; S = G/C) to generate all possible amino acid combinations with 32 codons.
The five NNS triplets encode 3.4 X IO' possible nucleotide sequences and 3.2 X IO6 possible amino acid sequences. To eliminate any back- ground of wild-type APPI-phage, a synthetic oligonucleotide cas- sette coding for two stop codons (TAA) and a frame shift was introduced between the Apu I and Xho I sites at APPI codons 12 and 19.
This construct was then cut at the Psi I and Aut I1 sites at codons 5 and 24 to insert an oligonucleotide cassette incorporating the random codons to create the starting library. The  two comple- mentary oligonucleotides, 5'-pGC GAA CAG GCG GAA NNS GGG NNS TGC NNS GCG NNS ATC NNS AGA TGG TAC TTC GAC GT-3' and 5C GAA GTA CCA TCT SNN GAT SNN CGC SNN GCA SNN CCC SNN TTC CGC  CTG TTC GCT GCA-3'. were annealed and the cassette was ligated into the cut vector.
The ligation products were ethanol precipitated, resuspended in  water, and electroporated (Dower et al., 1988) into JMlOl cells to yield 9 X lo6 transformants. 
Binding selections To produce phagemid particles displaying the inhibitor library, male JMlOl or XL-I Blue cells containing the plasmid library were infected with M13K07 helper phage (Vierra & Messing, 1987) at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 100 helper phage per cell.
The random inhibitor libraries were sorted for 6-12 cycles of enrichment for binding to the target protease immobilized on Affigel-IO beads (Biorad). For the im- mobilization, each protease (3 mg) was reacted with 0.5 mL of bead slurry at 5 "C for 4 h in 0.1 M MOPS, pH 8.0.

The phage-binding reactions were performed in 200 p L  con- taining 500 mM KCl, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5.  The solution contained approximately 1 X 10" phagemid particles from the starting APPI-phage display library that carry ampicillin resistance.
Also included were - 1 X 10" nondisplay- ing phagemid particles that carry chloramphenicol resistance. The nondisplaying phage are included to reduce nonspecific binding and to monitor the enrichment of displaying relative to nondis- playing phage.
For libraries that incorporate negative selection, proteases were added in solution to the binding reactions to a final concentration of 1 p M  and allowed to incubate with the phage for 5 min at 25C before the addition of beads. Ten milliliters of a bead slurry containing the positively selected protease target was added to the binding reaction and mixed by rotation at 25 "C for 2 h. The beads were washed six times with I-mL volumes of the reaction buffer to remove unbound phage.
Half  of the supernatant volume was com- 1822 A.J. Scheidig et al. bined with 1 mL of male XL- 1 Blue cells, incubated at 37 "C for 30 min to allow infection, and grown overnight in 25 mL of 2YT with M13K07 and ampicillin (50 mg/mL) to propagate the se- lected phage. The supernatant was also titered to determine the number of ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant colony-forming units/pL. The 25-pL phage cultures were PEG precipitated, re- suspended in 0.5 mL of STE (10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCI),  and  used in subsequent rounds of binding selections.

Starting from the random library, binding selections were per- formed to trypsin and chymotrypsin under four different condi- tions. Negative selection (T- or C-) was implemented by pre-incubating the library with the negative- selected protease free in solution and then selecting for inhibitors that would bind to the target protease bound to beads.

Following 6-12 rounds of binding selection, individual clones from the selected libraries were isolated and sequenced (Sanger et al., 1977). Approximately 15-20 colonies were picked at ran- dom from each selected library and ssDNA was prepared for se- quencing.
To determine the sequence distribution in the starting library, 27 independent clones were picked and sequenced. The calculated frequencies of amino acids in the starting library were used to correct the sequence distributions of the selected libraries.

Protein expression The spectrum of inhibitory activity against the three proteases was determined for the populations of selected sequences ex- pressed as  a pool, as well as individual clones that were represen- tative of the consensus sequence of each library. ssDNA prepared from the selected libraries or clones was transformed into E. coli strain 27C7, a nonsuppressor derivative of W3110 tonA (ATCC 27325), for expression (Chang et al., 1987).
Inhibitor protein was secreted free in solution as directed by the st11 signal sequence and transcription under the control of the alkaline phosphatase pro- moter. An overnight culture was inoculated (1 % v:v) into 20 p L  of AP5 minimal media containing carbenicillin (50 mg/mL) and grown for 24 h at 37C (Chang et al., 1987).
Cells were removed by centrifugation and the supernatants were dialyzed into distilled water, lyophilized, and brought up in 400 p L  of 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5. 
The concentrated supernatants were assayed for inhibitory activity toward trypsin, chymotrypsin, and crude protease.

Inhibition assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates at room temperature in a buffer of 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCI, 20 mM CaCI2, and 0.005% Triton X-100. A stock solution of trypsin was titrated with the active site inhibitor MUGB according to the method of Jameson et al. (1973).
This stock was used to calibrate a solution of al-antitrypsin inhibitor, which was used  in turn to quantitate the concentrations of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and crude protease in the binding assays. 
Inhibition assay The assays of protease inhibitory activity employed samples with a fixed concentration of protease and varying concentrations of inhibitor (Green & Work, 1953; Empie & Laskowski, 1982; Kitaguchi et al., 1990).
One-hundred milliliters of concentrated inhibitor supernatant (inhibitor concentration -1-2 mm) from one of the expressed libraries or individual clones was added to a microtiter well containing 100 mL of buffer. Forty milliliters from each well in this plate was transferred to a second plate with wells containing 210 p L  of buffer containing a standardized concentra- tion of trypsin or chymotrypsin in the range of 100 nM. Each column of wells in this plate had a fixed concentration of protease and a range of inhibitor concentrations on either side of being equimolar with the protease.
 Medium-  and  low- concentration plates were made by diluting the high-concentration plate 10- and 100-fold, respectively, with buffer. The medium- and low-concentration plates were used to measure K ,  as described previously (Dennis & Lazarus, 1994a; Seymour et al., 1994).

Following 1-3 h of incubation to allow for equilibration, en- zyme activities were measured as follows. The high-concentration plates were assayed by adding 25 p L  of a 2.5 mg/mL solution of a pNA substrate dissolved in DMSO and monitoring the absor- bance increase at 405 nm in a SLT EAR 340 AT plate reader.
pNA substrates for trypsin, chymotrypsin, and crude protease were BAPA, Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA, and Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, respectively. En- zyme activities in the medium- and low-concentration plates were assayed by adding 25 p L  of a 0.5 mg/mL solution of a MCA substrate dissolved in DMSO and monitoring the fluorescence in- crease (excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm) using a Labsystems Fluoroskan I1 plate reader. MCA substrates for trypsin, chymotrypsin, and crude protease were Boc-Ile-Glu-Gly- Arg-MCA, N-Succ-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA, and Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA, respectively.
Nonlinear regression analysis of the data was per- formed as described previously (Seymour et al., 1994).
