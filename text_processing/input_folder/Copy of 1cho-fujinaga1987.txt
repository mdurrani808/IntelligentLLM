The molecular structure of the complex between bovine pancreatic cc-chymotrypsin 
(EC 3.4.4.5) and the third domain of the Kazal-type ovomucoid from Turkey (OMTKY3) 
has been determined crystallographically by the molecular replacement method. 
Restrained-parameter least-squares refinement of the molecular model of the complex has 
led to a conventional agreement factor R of O-168 for the 19,466 reflections in the 1.8 A 
(1 A = 0.1 nm) resolution shell [I 2 a(Z)]. The reactive site loop of OMTKYS, from Lysl31 
to ArgZlI (I indicates inhibitor), is highly complementary to the surface of a-chymotrypsin 
in the complex. A total of 13 residues on the inhibitor make 113 contacts of less than 4.0 A 
with 21 residues of the enzyme. A short contact (2.95 A) from Oy of Ser195 to the carbonyl- 
carbon atom of the scissile bond between Leul81 and Glul91 is present; in spite of it, this 
peptide remains planar and undistorted. Analysis of the interactions of the inhibitor with 
chymotrypsin explains the enhanced specificity that chymotrypsin has for P; arginine 
residues. There is a water-mediated ion pair between the guanidinium group on this residue 
and the carboxylate of Asp64. Comparison of the structure of the cc-chymotrypsin portion 
of this complex with the several structures of CI and y-chymotrypsin in the uncomplexed 
form shows a high degree of structural equivalence (root-mean-square deviation of the 234 
common a-carbon atoms averages O-38 A). Significant differences occur mainly in two 
regions Lys36 to Phe39 and Ser75 to Lys79. Among the 21 residues that are in contact with 
the ovomucoid domain, only Phe39 and Tyr146 change their conformations significantly a,s 
a result of forming the complex. Comparison of the structure of the OMTKYS domain in 
this complex to that of the same inhibitor bound to a serine proteinase from Streptomyces 
griseus (SGPB) shows a central core of 44 amino acids (the central a-helix and flanking 
small S-stranded b-sheet) that have a-carbon atoms fitting to within 1-O A (root-mean- 
square deviation of 0.45 A) whereas the residues of the reactive-site loop differ in position 
by up to 1.9 A (C” of LeulSI). The ovomucoid domain has a built-in conformational 
flexibility that allows it to adapt to the active sites of different enzymes. A comparison of 
the SGPB and a-chymotrypsin molecules is made and the water molecules bound at the 
inhibitor-enzyme interface in both complexes are analysed for similarities and differences.

has been determined for the behaviour of chymo- 
trypsin towards substrates and inhibitors in 
solution (see, for example, Hess, 1971; Bender & 
Killheffer, 1973; Fruton, 1975). On the other hand, 
there are relatively few diffraction studies that have 
been concerned with the binding of inhibitors or 
substrate analogues to chymotrypsin. among them, 
the binding of N-formyltryptophan (Henderson, 
1970; Steitz et al., 1969) confirmed that the S, 
specificity pocket7 was close to the catalytic triad of 
His57, Ser195 and AsplOB. Other crystallographic 
binding studies with peptidyl chloromethylketone 
inhibitors and y-chymotrypsin showed an anti- 
parallel p-sheet hydrogen-bonded interaction 
between the main-chain nitrogen and carbonyl 
oxygen atoms of Gly216 in the enzyme and the 
residue in the Ps position of the inhibitor (Segal et 
al., 1971). There is no direct structural information 
about the binding of inhibitors in the S:, sites of 
chymotrypsin. 
A refinement of the y-chymotrypsin structure at 
1.9 A (1 A = 0.1 nm) resolution has been reported 
(Cohen et al., 1981). In addition, two independent, 
X-ray crystallographic refinements of the structure 
of a-chymotrypsin at 1.7 A resolution have been 
published (Tsukada & Blow, 1985; Blevins & 
Tulinsky, 1985). Thus, several adequate, accurate 
descriptions of the uncomplexed form of chymo- 
trypsin are available. 
The avian ovomucoids consist of three 
homologous tandem domains, each of approxi- 
mately 60 residues (Laskowski & Kato, 1980). The 
isolation, purification and determination of the 
amino acid sequences of the third domains from 
over 100 avian species have been reported 
(Laskowski et al., 1987). It is hoped that this work 
provides a large data-base on which to form a 
sequence-reactivity algorithm that could allow the 
prediction of an equilibrium association constant 
from a knowledge of the sequence of the inhibitor 
and the enzyme that it should inhibit (Laskowski, 
1980). However, before such an algorithm can be 
derived, it is necessary to understand the nature of 
enzyme-inhibitor interactions and to have the 
structural details of the residues that are in contact 
at their interface. It will then be possible to 
evaluate whether the sequence alone provides 
enough information to predict association 
constants. Towards this end we have determined 
the three-dimensional structure of a serine 
proteinase from Streptomyces griseus, SGPBS.

t This nomenclature follows that devised by Hchechter 
& Berger (1967). The scissile bond (or reactive site) of 
the inhibitors lies between P, and P’, and the residues 
towards the N and C termini are denoted P, and Pb, 
respectively. The corresponding sites in the enzyme are 
labelled S, and Sb.

(Fujinaga et al., 1982; Read et al., 1983). The three- 
dimensional structures of two other highly 
homologous ovomucoid third domains in the 
uncomplexed form have also been determined: 
OMJPQ3 from the Japanese quail (Papamokos et 
al., 1982) and OMSVPS from the silver pheasant 
(Bode et al., 1985). The crystal structure of the 
molecular complex between OMTKYS and the 
human leukocyte elastase has been reported also 
(Bode et al., 1986). 
The structure of the complex OMTKY3: SGPB 
has provided invaluable data necessary for the 
correct interpretation of the thermodynamic 
binding data of the many different species of 
inhibitor domains to this enzyme. It has confirmed 
that changes in the amino acid residues of the 
inhibitor that have little effect on the measured 
equilibrium association constant (K,) occur at 
positions that are not at the interface with the 
enzyme. On the other hand, changes in the amino 
acid residues of the inhibitor that the crystallo- 
graphic structure identified in the region of the 
contact interface can have profound effects on the 
K, values for otherwise closely related inhibitors 
(Empie & Laskowski, 1982; Laskowski et al., 1983; 
Park, 1985; Laskowski et al., 1987). For example, 
SGPB is indifferent to the replacement of a Pj 
arginine residue by methionine, because relatively 
few van der Waals’ contacts are made by the 
arginyl side-chain to SGPB (Read et aZ., 1983). 
However, replacing the Pj arginine residue by 
methionine (3rd domains of silver pheasant and 
black swan, respectively) reduces t’he K, with 
a-chymotrypsin by a factor of 45, suggesting that 
with cc-chymotrypsin, unlike SGPB, this residue 
plays an important role in the binding interactions. 
a-Chymotrypsin forms a very tight complex 
with OMTKYS (K, = 1.8 x 10” M-~) similar in 
strength to the OMTKY3 : SGPB complex 
(K, = 5.6 x lo’“M-‘; Laskowski et al., 1983). For 
the latter complex, we have suggested that such 
tight binding is due to the remarkable surface 
complementarity between the reactive-site loop 
of OMTKY3 (Ps to Pi) and the active site of 
SGPB (Read et al., 1983). A major goal of bhe 
structure determination of the molecular com- 
plex of a-chymotrypsin (CHT) and OMTKY3 
(OMTKYS : CHT) was to elucidate whether such 
complementarity exists between OMTKY3 and a 
mammalian enzyme of different structure. Tt could 
also allow us to evaluate the validity of a rigid body 
model on enzyme : inhibitor complex formation. 
Equally important, such a structure would reveal 
the details of the substrate binding subsites on the 
archetypal serine proteinase, cr-chymotrypsin, 
providing a basis on which to interpret the 
numerous binding data for these inhibitors (Park, 
1985). The comparison of the three-dimensional 
structures of the OMTKYS molecule bound to t.he 
active sites of the two different serine protrinases 
has revealed a conformational flexibility in the 
ovomucoid that could be important in broadening 
its specificity.

2. Experimental Procedures 
The complex of chymotrypsin with OMTKY3 was 
crystallized following standard procedures of vapour 
diffusion from 50% saturated (NH&SO, with 50 mM- 
KHzPO, buffer at pH 5.0 to 5.5. Characterization of the 
crystals so obtained indicated that they were monoclinic, 
space group P2,. The volume per unit molecular weight, 
V,, is 2.18 A3/dalton and is consistent with 1 molecule of 
a-chymotrypsin and 1 of OMTKYS per asymmetric unit. 
The X-ray intensity data were collected with Ni-filtered 
CuKcl radiation (40 kV, 26 mA) on a Nonius CAD4 
diffractometer in the full w-scan mode. A 1.8 A resolution 
data set was obtained from a single crystal. Eight 
standard reflections spread t’hroughout the range of 
reciprocal space were monitored at regular intervals 
(approx. every 200 reflections) and were used for 
correcting for instabilities in the source and decay due to 
crystal irradiation damage. The relevant crystal data are 
summarized in Table 1. 
The structure was solved by the technique of molecular 
replacement (Rossmann, 1972), using as the search model 
the co-ordinates for a-chymotrypsin (Birktoft & Blow, 
1972) available in the May 1981 distribution tape of the 
Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). 
These co-ordinates correspond to a 2.0 A resolution 
structure, partially refined by real-space and energy 
minimization methods. The co-ordinates of molecule I of 
the dimer were used. 
The orientation of this search model in the structure of 
the complex was obtained using the fast rotation function 
of Crowther (1972) calculated with normalized structure 
factors (IEI) over an integration range of 3 to 21 A. 
Normalized structure factor amplitudes, IE,I, for the 
observed data, were computed with the program 
ORESTES (Thiessen & Levy, 1973). The calculated 
quantities, )E,J, were determined for a chymotrypsin 
monomer placed in a cubic unit cell of symmetry PI with 
cell edges of 65 A. The data used were in the 10 to 3.5 A

resolution shell. In this range there were 1326 reflections 
for the complex with l&I 2 1.0, and 1920 calculated 
reflections with )E,J 2 2.5. The rotation function was 
calculated initially at 5” intervals over an asymmetric 
unit of rotation function space (Rao et al., 1980). The 2 
highest values of overlap in this region were 11.2 and 4.3 
standard deviations above the mean. A finer sampling of 
1” intervals in the Euler angle /l around the maximum did 
not improve the overlap. The chymotrypsin molecule was 
oriented using these rotational parameters, then its 
position in the cell was searched by a brute force 
calculation (Fujinaga, 1986). The correlation coefficient 
between observed and calculated structure factors was 
computed for the model translated at 1 A intervals. over 
all possible positions in the unit cell. Since the space 
group P2, has a polar axis in the y  direction. the 
positioning along this axis is arbit.rary and the 
translational search need only cover the quarter of the 
unit cell face perpendicular to it, in which x and z vary 
from 0 to l/2. The solution obtained initially was 
improved with a local search using a finer grid of 0.2 A. 
The maximum correlation coefficient was 0.50 for the 
data in the 5 to 4 A resolution shell. 
An attempt was made to improve this initial model by 
the addition of the OMTKY3 co-ordinates, as obtained 
from its complex with the bacterial serine proteinase 
SGPB (Read et al., 1983). To this end, the highly 
homologous active site of SGPB was superposed by a 
least-squares procedure (Program LSQEM, W. Bennett) 
on the chymotrypsin molecule rotated and translated to 
the unit cell of the OMTKYS :CHT complex. The 
positioning of the inhibitor as deduced from the best fit of 
the active sites of the enzymes was used for docking the 
OMTKYS structure to the molecular replacement 
solution for the chymotrypsin molecule. 
An initial electron density map was computed with 
phases based on this modelled complex. ,4t this stage the 
crystallographic agreement factor Rt was 0.44 for the 
data with I 2 20(l) in the 8 to 1.8 A resolution range. 
The electron density map indicated that the positioning 
of the inhibitor was not very good except for the reactive- 
site region (Fig. l(a) and (b)). Since the density was not 
clear enough to attempt a significant improvement, 8 
cycles of restrained-parameter least-squares refinement 
were carried out using the programs of Hendrickson & 
Konnert (1980). It had been hoped that refinement with 
t,ight restraint’s on the stereochemistry would improve the 
positioning of the inhibitor molecule. However, no 
significant improvement was observed when a 2nd map 
was computed. To reduce model bias, a (SlFJ - IF,/) exp 
(ia,) map was computed. where the calculated structure 
factor amplitudes and phases, IF,1 and c(,. rrspectivelv. 
were based on t’he partially refined chymotrypsm 
component only. Careful analysis of this map indicated 
that the inhibitor was grossly misoriented. Twent’y-four 
residues of the inhibitor could be refitted to the electron 
density and were used to position the complete molecule 
in a new orientat.ion (Fig. 2). A reasonable tit tcl the 
density was achieved with this rigid body reorientation of 
OMTKYY (Fig. l(c) and (d)). Refinement of the structure 
proceeded smoothly from this point (Fig. l(e) and (f)). 
Electron density maps with coefficients (2/$‘J -IJ’,I) and 
(IF,/ -IF,/) and calculated phases were computed at 
t The agreement factor R is defined as 
R = CIIF,I -IF,ll/~IF,I, where IF,/ and IF,1 are the 
observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, 
respectively. and the summations include the data in the 
specified range.

minimum was evidenced by small decreases in the 
agreement factor R, indicating the need for manual 
intervention. Both the chymotrypsin and OMTKYS 
models were examined and refitted to those maps, 
wherever necessary, in an MMS-X interactive vector 
graphics system (Barry et al., 1976) with the macro- 
molecular modelling program M3 developed by 
C. Broughton (Sielecki et al., 1982). Towards the final 
stages of the refinement, oxygen atoms, representing 
water molecules, were added to the model according to 
the position of strong peaks of electron density in the 
difference maps. 
3. Results and Discussion 
(a) Quality of the final model 
The activated molecule of cr-chymotrypsin results 
after autolytic cleavages in which two dipeptides, 
Serl4 to Argl5 and Thr147 to Asn148, are removed. 
In our present model of cr-chymotrypsin, the only 
disordered region is from Serll to Leu13, for which 
there is insufficient electron density to allow us to 
derive atomic co-ordinates. The residue numbering 
scheme that is used here is based on that for bovine 
chymotrypsinogen A (Hartley & Kauffman, 1966). 
The structural model of the OMTKYS molecule 
consists of 53 out of the 56 amino acids expected for 
this domain. The first three residues of the chain, 
Leul I-AlaZI-Ala3It, do not have corresponding 
electron density. In the OMTKYS : SGPB structure, 
it was not possible to locate the first six residues at 
the ru’ terminus of the inhibitor (Read et a.Z., 1983). 
Further refinement has allowed us to assign 
tentative co-ordinates for Val61. The corresponding 
segments of the highly homologous inhibitors 
t Residues of the inhibitor are indicated with an I 
after the sequence number to distinguish them from 
those of the enzyme.

refinement has not improved the model signficantly. The continuous thick lines correspond to the model after a rigid 
body reorientation of the inhibitor molecule as explained in the text and illustrated in Fig. 2. This rotation improved 
the overall fit to the electron density (d), but worsened the agreement in the reactive site region (c). These residues were 
refitted manually at a subsequent stage of the refinement to agree more closely with their associated electron density.

OMSVPS and OMJPQ3 have identical sequences for 
the N-terminal hexapeptide but are in different 
conformations in the two structures (Bode et al., 
1985). This all indicates that, in the absence of 
stabilizing intermolecular contacts, the N-terminal 
portions of the Kazal inhibitors are highly mobile. 
After 79 cycles of restrained least-squares refine- 
ment, the model consists of 2151 protein atoms and 
222 solvent molecules. The agreement factor R is 
0.168 for the 19,178 reflections between 8 A and 
1.8 A resolution with Z 2 o(Z). Figure 3 shows the 
R-factor in different resolution shells for the data 
used in the refinement, as well as for all of the data 
including the “unobserved” reflections (i.e. 
Z < lo(Z)). The relatively low value of the R-factor 
was obtained without loosening the restraints 
applied to the model, as can be seen from the data 
in Table 2. Only very small deviations from ideal 
geometry are present. Another indication of the 
quality of the model can be obtained from a 4-$ 
plot (Ramakrishnan 6 Ramachandran, 1965) 
shown in Figure 4. Ser77, with (c$,$) angles of 
(134”, 144”), is the only non-glycyl residue that is 
far away from an allowed region. This residue is in a 
poorly ordered loop on the surface of the enzyme. 
As can be seen in Figure 5, the temperature factor 
values (B) in this loop, from residue 73 to 79, 
correspond to one of the two highest sets in the 
whole molecule. The other one is associated with 
the residues of the cleaved autolysis loop, Arg145 to 
Tyr146 and Ala149 to Thrl51. These regions are 
also reported to be somewhat disordered in the 
native chymotrypsin structures (Cohen et al., 1981;

In fact, the variations in the temperature factor 
along the polypeptide chain are very similar among 
all these independently determined structures.

protein crystallographers, the Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 
1952), gives an estimate for the mean overall co- 
ordinate error. Such an overall value is not very 
informative. Electron density maps computed with 
calculated phases based on the final, refined model 
clearly indicate a wide range of qualities associated 
with different parts of the structure, from the 
extremely well-defined regions, to the very poor 
ones. An alternative and more useful approxima- 
tion for the co-ordinate errors can be obtained using 
Cruickshank’s formulas (Cruickshank, 1949, 1954, 
1967). Although some of the underlying assump- 
tions are invalid in protein crystallography (Read et 
al., 1983), this method makes it possible to obtain 
error estimates for the individual atoms based on 
their scattering and temperature factors, and the 
overall agreement between observed and calculated 
structure factors at the end of the refinement.

Figure 6. Variation of the co-ordinate errors as a 
f’unction of the isotropic temperature factor B as 
calculated with the Cruickshank formula (Cruickshank, 
1949, 1967). Each of the 4 curves corresponds to a 
different atom type: C, carbon; N, nitrogen; 0, oxygen 
and S, sulphur. The overall estimated radial error for the 
2373 non-hydrogen atoms in the structure of the complex 
(including 222 solvent molecules) is 0.22 A. 
Figure 6 gives the variation of the expected errors 
in the OMTKY3 : CHT complex as a function of the 
B-factors for nitrogen, carbon, oxygen and sulphur 
atoms. These values, in conjunction with Figure 5, 
indicate that, for example, the error associated with 
the main-chain atoms of the partially disordered 
residue Ser77 is O-6 A (average main-chain B-factor 
of 50 A’). However, it should be emphasized that 
for regions where the atomic positions are not well 
determined, there will be systematic errors in 
addition to the random ones described by the 
Cruickshank formula or any equivalent method. 
The uncertainty in the positions of such atoms is 
therefore expected to be larger than the calculated 
values. Other regions with poorly defined electron 
density in the final maps are mostly associated with 
longer side-chains on the surface of the molecule, 
and are listed in Table 3. On the other hand, the 
residues comprising the active site of the chymo- 
trypsin molecule have low temperature factors and 
are therefore well defined with mean co-ordinate 
errors of approximately 0.1 A (Figs 5 and 6). This is 
also the case for the residues comprising the 
reactive-site loop of the inhibitor in both the

complexes with CHT (Fig. 5), and SGPB (Read et 
al., 1983). In contrast, the crystallographic 
structures of the closely related molecules of 
OMJPQ3 (Papamokos et aE., 1982) and OMSVP3 
(Bode et al., 1985) in their free forms, exhibit 
thermal motion parameters at their reactive sites 
that are among the highest in the respective 
molecules. 
The larger B-factors for the residues in the 
reactive-site loops of the uncomplexed inhibitors 
suggests a functional significance for conforma- 
tional flexibility (Bode et al., 1985; Read & James, 
1986). A rigid inhibitor would form a very tight 
complex with its cognate enzyme, since part of the 
binding energy does not have to be used to 
compensate for the decrease in entropy due to loss 
of internal degrees of freedom (Jencks, 1975). 
However, such an inhibitor may not react with 
other related enzymes. Thus, increased conforma- 
tional flexibility is expected to broaden the 
specificity of the inhibitors but at the expense of a 
lowered association constant (Read & James, 1986). 
(b) Comparison of the chymotrypsin structure in its 
free and complexed forms 
The folding of the chymotrypsin molecule in the 
complex is essentially unchanged from the corre- 
sponding structure of a-chymotrypsin (Tsukada & 
Blow, 1985; Blevins & Tulinsky, 1985) and that of 
y-chymotrypsin (Cohen et al., 1981). All of these 
independently determined structures were 
compared with each other in two ways?. First, the 
t Far structural comparisons involving molecules 
other than the ones studied in this laboratory. 
co-ordinates were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein 
Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). 
structures were superposed pairwise, using the 234 
common a-carbon atoms that have been determined 
crystallographically in all the chymotrypsin 
molecules. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviations 
range from 0.19 A to 0.58 A. Second, the super- 
positions were repeated with only those a-carbon 
atoms that could be superposed to within 1 A of 
each other. This procedure gives an indication of 
the regions of the molecule that are “rigid”. The 
results of these superpositions are summarized in 
Table 4. There are approximately 220 a-carbon 
atoms in equivalent positions (within a 1 A cut off- 
value) among all the chymotrypsin molecules. The 
observed conformational differences do not involve 
concerted movements of large segments of poly- 
peptide chain, and the main differences are localized 
in loops in the region of Lys36 to Phe39 and Ser75 
to Lys79 (calcium-binding loop in trypsin). In 
addition, the regions around the two cleavage sites 
in the molecule, residues 14 to 15 near the N 
terminus and 147 to 148 in the autolysis loop, are in 
most cases disordered. Figure 7 shows the 
structural similarity between molecule no. 1 of 
a-chymotrypsin as determined by Tsukada & Blow 
(1985) and chymotrypsin in the complex of the 
present study. 
In order to determine the side-chains that change 
their conformations upon complex formation, we 
have compared the contact interface region in the 
structure of the complex with that in a-chymo- 
trypsin (Tsukada & Blow, 1985) and in y-chymo- 
trypsin (Cohen et al., 1981). The results of these 
comparisons are shown in Figure 8(a) and (b). It 
should be recalled that in the dimeric arrangement 
found in the crystals of a-chymotrypsin, there is a 
local 2-fold axis placed very close to Phe39 that 
results in intimate interactions between this residue 
and the active site of the symmetry-related

Figure 7. Stereoscopic view of the cc-carbon atoms tracing of the chymotrypsin molecule as determined in its complex 
with OMTKYS (thick lines) superimposed on that determined by Tsukada & Blow (1985) for the native enzyme 
(molecule no. 1; thin lines). Residues Va19 to LeulO and Ala149 to Asnl50, included in the structure of the complex but 
not drawn in the native molecule, have mean B-factors of 33 8’ and 58 A2, respectively (see Table 3 and Fig. 5). The 
superposition was based on the 234 common a-carbon atoms depicted in the native molecule (Table 4). Labels have been 
placed on every 5th c” atom and on the N and C-terminal residues of each of the 3 chains that compose the molecule. 
The regions of main chain that exhibit the largest conformational differences are Thr37 and Ser77 to Lys79, where the 
E-carbon atom positions differ by more than 1-A. 
molecule. This fact, and the effect it has on the 
conformation of the neighbouring residues, has been 
discussed (Cohen et al., 1981; Blevins & Tulinsky, 
1985; Tsukada & Blow, 1985). The presence of this 
dyad in the crystals of a-chymotrypsin explains 
why there are more residues with different 
conformations in the comparison with our structure 
(Fig. 8(a)). It is possible that only Phe39 and 
Tyr146 undergo significant conformational changes 
upon formation of the complex. The phenyl ring of 
Phe39 moves to avoid the close contacts with the 
inhibitor at Tyr201 that would occur with the 
conformation of this side-chain in both a and 
y-chymotrypsin in their free form (x1 changes from 
180” in y-chymotrypsin to - 72” in the complex). 
In an analogous manner, the side-chain of Tyr146 
moves to avoid close contacts with Asn361. The 
amide side-chain Asn361 also adopts a conforma- 
tion different’ from that in OMTKYS : SGPB 
(in OMTKY3:SGPB x1 = -85, xZ = 56; in 
OMTKYS : CHT x1 = - 179, x2 = 20). The altered 
conformations of Tyr146 and Asn361 facilitate the 
formation of a hydrogen bond between the 
p-hydroxyl group and the carbonyl oxygen of the 
amide. Substitution of Asn361 by an aspartic acid 
residue weakens the equilibrium association 
constant with SGPB (marginally by a factor of 2) 
but strengthens the association with a-chymo- 
trypsin by five times (Park, 1985). In the latter, 
this result could be due to the much stronger 
hydrogen bond that can be formed between the 
tyrosine and the aspartate carboxylate ion (cf. in 
OMTKYS the distance Asp171 ObZ...Tyr311 0” is 
very short (2.4 w in both complexes). Likewise, 
substitution of Asn361 by a serine residue has little 
effect on the equilibrium association constant with 
SGPB, although there is a major change in the case 
of a-chymotrypsin (enhanced binding by a factor of 
18). We can offer no such simple explanation for 
this large effect unless the conformational changes 
upon complex formation of the two residues 
involved, Tyr146 and Asn361, are energetically 
unfavourable. Then, with the replacement of the 
asparagine side-chain at position 361 by the smaller 
serine hydroxyl group, such changes would not be 
required. 
Finally, we note that the conformation adopted 
by Ser218, which is relatively close to that observed 
in y-chymotrypsin, allows for a main-chain 
hydrogen-bonded interaction from Ser218 N to the 
carbonyl oxygen atom of Prol41. The slight change 
in the conformation of the side-chain of Lys175 
from that in y-chymotrypsin (Fig. 8(b)) may be due 
to van der Waals’ interactions with the OMTKYS 
molecule at Prol41. 
(c) Comparison of the chymotrypsin and 
SGPB structures 
The bacterial serine proteinases, such as SGPB, 
are approximately 60 amino acids smaller than 
their pancreatic counterparts (Delbaere et al., 1975; 
Brayer et al., 1978; Sielecki et al., 1979; James et al., 
1980a). The additional residues in the pancreatic 
enzymes are associated mainly with the domain 
involved in the activation of the zymogen 
precursor. In spite of the size differences, these two 
enzyme groups have a high degree of structural 
homology (Fujinaga et al., 1985). The comparisons 
between members of these groups indicate that 
there is a central core of approximately 115 
equivalent residues with a-carbon atom positions

fit for the 234 common a-carbon atoms whose positions have been determined in all chymotrypsin molecules (Table 4). 
Only those amino acids with at least 1 atom less than 4.0 A from any atom of the OMTKY3 molecule have been 
included.

OMTKYS : CHT (thick lines) with the equivalent representation of the SGPB molecule from OMTKY3 : SGPB (thin 
lines). There is a central core of 110 residues that have a-carbon atom positions that agree to within 3.0 A (r.m.s. 
deviation, 1.36 A). The regions surrounding the active site binding cleft that depart from this structural equivalence are: 
Asp35 to His40; Gly59 to Val60; Va166 to Leu83; Ser92 to Ile99; Leu143 to Leu155; Thr166 to Asp178 Ala185 to Va1188 
and Ser218 to Thr224 (residue types correspond to those in the a-chymotrypsin molecule). 
closer than 3.0 A that can be superimposed with a 
r.m.s. deviation of approximately 1.4 A. Figure 9 
shows the a-carbon representation of a-chymo- 
trypsin superimposed on that of SGPB. It is clear 
that the central cores are equivalent, but it is also 
evident from this Figure that there are major 
differences in the conformations of surface loops 
and regions that surround the substrate binding 
sites on the enzymes. Of the 110 structurally 
equivalent residues (a-carbon atom positions closer 
than 3.0 A) between a-chymotrypsin and SGPB, 
only 28 are chemically identical. Four of the 
residues that form parts of the substrate or 
inhibitor-binding sites on the two enzymes are 
chemically different and make for quite different 
interactions with the inhibitor. These are Phe41, 
Cysl91, Met192 and Trp215 in a-chymotrypsin, 
which correspond to Arg41, Glu191, Pro192 and 
Gly215 in SGPB (the residue numbering for SGPB 
is from Fujinaga et al. (1985)). More importantly, 
perhaps, there are eight surface loops that surround 
and contribute to the inhibitor binding sites on the 
t,wo enzymes, which have completely different 
conformations and amino acid compositions. These 
regions are detailed in the legend to Figure 9. The 
loops are also seen in relation to the ovomucoid 
complex of each in Figure 10. In light of these 
differences it is remarkable that the equilibrium 
association constants of OMTKYS with these two 
enzymes differ only by a factor of 3 (Laskowski et 
rrZ., 1983; Park, 1985). 
one considers the solvent structure associated with 
each complex. There are several internal water 
molecules that are structurally equivalent in the 
bacterial and pancreatic serine proteinases (Sielecki 
et al., 1979; James et aE., 1980b) but> the surface 
solvent structures differ between the two groups. 
The solvent at the interface of the ovomucoid 
OMTKY3 and each enzyme serves to illustrate this 
(Figs 11, 12 and 13). 
There are seven water molecules buried in the S1 
binding pocket of a-chymotrypsin (Fig. 11(a)). 
These solvents are not displaced by the P, leucyl 
side-chain of the inhibitor (Leul81). Two of the 
solvents (04 and 024)T are very deep in the pocket 
are unlikely to be displaced by any P1 side-chain. 
This is also true of solvent 042, which is hydrogen- 
bonded between two b-strands (at Ser217, Thr224 
and Pro225). However, a large aromatic P, side- 
chain, such as tryptophan, would probably displace 
the three solvent molecules 014, 040 and 056. An 
ovomucoid domain with a large aromatic P, residue 
could presumably be a very tight binding inhibitor 
with a-chymotrypsin, However, no such domains 
are known to occur naturally (Laskowski et al., 
1987). 
(d) Comparison of the solvent structures in the 
two complexes 
The equivalent region of the OMTYS :SGPB 
complex has only four bound waters (Fig. 1 l(b)). 
The relatively deeply bound solvent 042 is unlikely 
to be displaced by a large P, residue. There is an 
equivalent solvent in the SGPA native structure; it 
remains bound in the product complex of AcPro- 
Ala-Pro-TyrOH with SGPA (James et al., 1980b). 
Solvents 015, 067 and 071 are part of an extensive 
hydrogen-bonded network between the inhibitor 
The structural differences between a-chymo- 
trypsin and SGPB are emphasized even more when

and SGPB. Other solvent molecules in this region 
occupy different positions in the two complexes 
partly due to the fact that the polypeptide chains 
from residue 217 to 220 adopt very different paths 
in a-chymotrypsin and in SGPB (see Fig. 11(a) 
and (b)). 
The region of contact between OMTKYS and 
a-chymotrypsin near the autolysis loop (Tyr146) is 
relatively solvent free except for a cluster of tightly 
bound water molecules finking the p-hydroxyl of 
Tyr146 to the cl-helical segment of OMTKY3 from 
Asn36I to Asn391 (Fig. 12(a)). These solvents are 
also close to the three that are associated with 
Ser218 and the Lysl3I carbonyl group. This is in 
marked contrast to the equivalent region of the 
OMTKY3 : SGPB complex, which has an extensive 
well-ordered solvent zone (Fig. 12(b)). This area is 
involved in a packing interface in the 
OMTKYS : SGPB complex whereas the equivalent 
region faces a more open channel in the 
OMTKYS : CHT structure. The intricate solvent 
network in the OMTKY3 : SGPB complex includes 
many bridging solvents between polar groups on

The presence of several hydrophobic side-chains near the autolysis loop of a-chymotrypsin (Leu143, Ala149, Cyz of 
Thrl51 and Met192) may prevent the formation of a more ordered solvent network in this vicinity in comparison to the 
highly ordered solvent structure in the equivalent region of the OMTKY3 : SGPB complex. 
the equilibrium association constants come from 
residues in direct contact between inhibitor and 
enzyme. However, the substitution of side-chains 
not in direct contact could disrupt this ordered 
solvent array. Such long-range perturbations would 
have effects on the equilibrium association 
constants that would be difficult to predict. 
Figure 13(a) and (b) shows two other views of the 
molecular interfaces. In particular, this view depicts 
the solvent structures in the proximity of the 
scissile bond Leu181-Glu191 and details the very 
different roles played by Arg21I in binding to 
SGPB or to a-chymotrypsin (Park et al., 
unpublished results). In the region included in 
Figure 13, seven solvent molecules of 
OMTKY3 : CHT (08, 090, 083, 028, 013, 010 
and 0167) have equivalent molecules in the 
OMTKY3:SGPB complex (026, 088, 019, 040, 
087, 059 and 0177). Altogether there are 18 
solvent molecules that are within 1.0 A of each 
other after superimposing the two OMTKY3 
molecules from the two complexes. 
(e) Comparison of the ovomucoid molecules 
An analysis similar to that presented for the 
chymotrypsin structures can be carried out for the 
inhibitor molecule by comparing its structure to 
OMTKY3 complexed to SGPB (Read et al., 1983)

and to that of the highly homologous molecule 
OMJPQ3 (Papamokos et al., 1982). Detailed 
comparison of the structures of the OMSVP3 with 
those of free OMJPQ3 and of OMTKY3 bound to 
SGPB have been reported (Bode et al., 1985). In 
common with the results of the comparisons of the 
several chymotrypsin structures, there is a 
conserved core in the ovomucoids but the reactive- 
site loop is found to occupy different positions in 
the three molecules. Table 5 summarizes the results 
of the various superpositions that were done 
following the same approach as described above for 
the chymotrypsin molecules. It can be seen, by 
comparison with the results depicted in Table 4, 
that the r.m.s. differences between the ovomucoid 
inhibitors are slightly larger than those between the 
various chymotrypsin structures. Despite these 
larger differences all three molecules have quite 
similar conformations locally. The a-carbon tracings 
of the three ovomucoids are shown superimposed in 
Figure 14. The complete models of the turkey 
ovomucoid molecules, as refined in its complexes 
with chymotrypsin and SGPB, are depicted in 
Figure 15. The structurally conserved central core 
consists of the N-terminal portion of the a-helix 
from Asn331 to Val411 and residues of the three- 
stranded antiparallel b-sheet from Pro221 to Gly321 
and from Leu481 to Cys561. There are three regions 
that differ significantly in the three inhibitor 
structures: the N terminus, which is disordered in

the two structures of OMTKYS; the reactive-site 
loop, from Pro141 to TyrBOI, and the loop region 
around Va1421 to Thr471. The detailed comparison 
of the OMJPQ3 structure with that of the silver 
pheasant ovomucoid (OMSVPS) also shows that 
larger deviations are confined to the N terminus 
and the region of residues 421 to 471 (Bode et al., 
1985). The similarity among the reactive-site loops 
in both these molecules and OMTKYS bound to 
SGPB suggests that this may be the conformation 
that the turkey ovomucoid adopts when it is free in 
solution. 
Table 6 lists the intramolecular hydrogen-bonded 
interactions in the OMTKYS molecule. Comparison 
of these values with those in Table V of Read et al.

hydrogen bond lengths and geometry. The 
hydrogen bond geometry differs between OMTKY3 
and OMSVPS in this region as well (Bode et al., 
1985). There is one hydrogen bond in the OMTKY3 
molecules of both complexes that is very short and 
of good geometry whereas in the uncomplexed 
OMSVP3 molecule it is long and not well formed 
(Thrl71 Oy’ . . .GlulST OE’ shortens from 3.0 A in 
the free ovomucoid to 2.5 A in the complexes). It 
appears that the water structure in the proximity of 
these amino acids does not rearrange significantly 
upon forming the complex (Bode et al., 1985). 
The comparison of the 4 and $ angles of 
OMTKY3 bound to chymotrypsin and to SGPB 
indicates that differences in either of these angles 
exceeding 20” occur only at residues SerST, GlulOT, 
TyrllT, Alal51, Va142T and Glu43T. However, for 
the three consecutive residues Ser91, GlulOI and 
TyrllT, the changes in 4 and + are compensatory, 
such that for the OMTKY3:SGPB complex the 
values of $a+fj10 and tj10 + $i I are approximately 
equal to the corresponding sums in the ovomucoid 
when bound to a-chymotrypsin. Similar relation- 
ships hold for tih2 and $43. These lead mainly to 
changes in the orientations of the connecting 
peptide planes but do not have a propagating effect 
on the overall inhibitor conformations (see Fig. 15). 
The conformational angles around the reactive sites 
in different ovomucoid structures are very similar, 
as shown in Table 7. However, the similarity does 
not extend over the entire loop region involved in 
binding. Figure 16 shows the region of OMTKYS 
from P6 to Pj as observed in the complex with 
SGPB superposed on the corresponding region in 
the complex with chymotrypsin. There is a change 
in the position of the Ps and Ps residues. This seems 
to be due to two factors. First, if the inhibitor were 
to bind to chymotrypsin with the same conforma-

Figure 16. Comparison, in stereo, of the binding modes of OMTKY3 to chymotrypsin (continuous lines) and to SGPB 
(broken lines). The residues from Ps to pj sites of the inhibitor are included (thick lines) together with those residues in 
the binding region of the corresponding enzyme (thin lines) that have at least 1 of their atoms less than 4.0 L% away from 
those of the inhibitor depicted in the Figure. The superposition of the 2 structures presented here is based on the best 
overlap of the main-chain atoms (N,C”,C,O) of His57, residue 191 (glutamic acid in SGPB; cysteine in CHT) to Ser195 
and Ser214 to Gly216 of the enzymes, and Thrl71 to Glu191 of the inhibitor. 
tion as it has when bound to SGPB there would be 
a close contact between the Ps residue, Prol41, and 
Trp172 in chymotrypsin. Second, the binding loop 
in chymotrypsin at Ser217 to Ser218 follows a path 
different from that of the corresponding residues in 
SGPB. This allows a hydrogen bond to be formed 
from Ser218N on the enzyme, to the carbonyl 
oxygen of Prol41. Table 8 shows that the majority 
of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds are similar in 
the two complexes and, in the region of P3 --, P;, 
also similar to the corresponding interactions in the 
pancreatic trypsin inhibitor-bovine trypsin 
complex (Huber & Bode, 1978). The changes in the 
conformation of the ovomucoid are accomplished 
without disruptions to the intramolecular 
hydrogen-bonding pattern. In particular, the 
hydrogen bonds from the central core to the 
reactive-site loop are maintained (Table 6 and 
Table V of Read et al., 1983). 
A closer look at the interactions between the 
inhibitor and the enzyme reveals similarities and 
differences between this complex and the 
OMTKY3: SGPB complex. Table 9 shows a 
summary of the intermolecular contacts between

chymotrypsin and OMTKYS. The majority of the 
interactions involve the reactive site loop from 
Lysl31 to Arg211, with the P, residue, Leul81, 
having by far the largest number of contacts. 
A similar pattern was observed in the 
OMTKY3: SGPB complex (Table VI from Read et 
aZ., 1983). There is a close approach of the f&r195 
Oy to the carbonyl carbon atom of the reactive-site 
bond; their interatomic distance is 2.95 A. 
A similar close interaction has been observed for 
other complexes, namely pancreatic trypsin 
inhibitor: trypsin (Huber et al., 1974; Huber & 
Bode, 1978; Marquart et al., 1983) 
OMTKYS: SGPB (Fujinaga et al., 1982) and in 
complexes between SGPA and tetrapeptide 
products (James et al., 1980b). This problem has 
been addressed in detail by Read & James (1986). 
As stated earlier, the Ps residue, Prol41, interacts 
with Ser218 in chymotrypsin, but a similar 
interaction does not occur in the OMTKYS : SGPB 
stucture because the enzyme has a different 
conformation in the corresponding region. This is 
reflected by the large number of contacts (Table 9) 
made between the inhibitor and chymotrypsin at 
the P, site (11) compared to the corresponding 
number for SGPB (2). The total number of 
intermolecular contacts is similar in the two 
structures, but the amount of solvent-accessible 
surface area that becomes buried in forming the 
complexes is slightly different. In forming the 
OMTKYS :CHT complex, the total accessible 
surface area (Lee & Richards, 1971) is reduced by 
1478 A2 from that of the isolated molecules, 
whereas the corresponding number for the 
OMTKY3 : SGPB complex is 1227 A’. Chothia & 
Janin (1975) have proposed that there is a 
correlation between the hydrophobic contribution 
to the free energy (i.e. the free energy due to the 
exposure of non-polar groups to solvent) and the 
accessible surface area. They have also proposed 
that hydrophobicity is the major factor in 
stabilizing complexes. These ideas are consistent 
with the observed association constant of 
1.8 x 10” M-I for the OMTKYS : CHT complex and 
56 x 10” M-l for the OMTKY3 : SGPB complex 
(Laskowski et al., 1983). 
Other differences in the enzyme-inhibit,or inter- 
actions exist at the P; and Pi residues (Fig. 16). In 
the OMTKYS : SGPB complex there are hydrogen 
bonds from NH and CO of the P2 residue, Tyr201, 
to Arg41 CO and NH, respectively, on the enzyme.

broken lines is related to the reference molecule by a translation of a unit cell along the b-axis. The 3 complexes 
represented in thin lines (broken and continuous) are related to the reference molecule by 2, screw axes. (b) Complex

of OMTKY3:SGPB in contact with the inhibitor of the reference complex, drawn in thick lines, are shown. The 
complex molecule shown with thin lines to the lower left of the reference molecule is generated by unit translations 
along the a and c-axes. The other 3 complex molecules depicted are generated by 2, screw axes along b. 
In chymotrypsin, the polypeptide chain follows a 
different path at the corresponding residues so that 
only the hydrogen bond from the NH of Tyr201 to 
the CO of Phe41 is formed. The carbonyl oxygen of 
Tyr201 forms a hydrogen bond to a solvent 
molecule (010) instead of interacting directly with 
the enzyme, as observed for the SGPB complex. 
There is an equivalent water molecule, 059, in the 
OMTKY3 : SGPB complex (Fig. 13). The side-chain 
of Arg211 is highly mobile in the OMTKYS: SGPB 
complex; the temperature factors of the atoms 
beyond N” are ail above 40 A2. In contrast, in the 
OMTKY3:CHT complex the side-chain atoms of 
this residue all have temperature factors below 
25 A2 (Fig. 5). The decrease in the mobility of the 
Arg211 side-chain is presumably the result of the 
van der Waals’ interaction with Phe41 and other 
water-mediated interactions to cr-chymotrypsin 
Structure of a-Chymotrypsin-Turkey Ovomucoid 417 
(Table 10). The different interactions of the two 
enzymes with the Ps residue (Fig. 13) correlate well 
with the thermodynamic data and indicate a role 
for Arg211 in binding to a-chymotrypsin but not to 
SGPB. The water-mediated ionic interaction 
between Arg211 and Asp64 will be discussed in 
more detail elsewhere (Park et al., unpublished 
results). 
The change observed in the conformation of the 
main chain of the reactive-site loop is accompanied 
by a change in the orientation of this loop with 
respect to the main body of the inhibitor. 
Consequently the inhibitor as a whole is oriented 
quite differently in the two complexes of 
OMTKY3 : SGPB and OMTKYS : CHT. This can be 
appreciated in Figure 10, where each complex is 
presented with the enzyme active site in approxi- 
mately the same orientation. There are various 
possible reasons for this change in the orientation. 
As discussed above, the interaction of the Ps and Ps 
residues of the inhibitor with residues Trp172 and 
Ser218 of chymotrypsin (Fig. 16) could cause the 
reactive-site loop to adopt a conformation different 
from that observed in the complex with SGPB. To 
accommodate this change, different orientations of 
the loop with respect to the rest of the inhibitor 
may be necessary. In addition, if such a change in 
orientation would not occur there may be close 
contacts between other parts of the inhibitor and 
the enzyme. However, modelling of a complex of 
chymotrypsin and the inhibitor in the conformabion 
that is found in OMTKYS: SGPB would indicate 
that any such clashes could be relieved locally 
without major modification in the overall 
conformation. 
The whole problem is complicated by the 
possibility that the change in the orientation of the 
inhibitor with respect to the enzyme could also be 
caused by crystal packing forces. The environment 
of the OMTKYS molecule in the monoclinic crystals 
of the complex is shown in Figure 17(a). Apart from 
the a-chymotrypsin molecule that forms the tight 
complex with OMTKY3, there are four other 
N-chymotrypsin molecules that make packing 
contact’s with the inhibitor. The corresponding 
packing arrangement of the OMTKYS : SGPB 
complex is depicted in Figure 17(b). Even though 
the overall packing densities in the two crystals are 
not very different, the inhibitor molecule, in 
complex with cr-chymotrypsin, makes many more 
caontacts (145 contacts less than 4.0 A) with 
neighbouring molecules than the one complexed 
with SGPB (83 contacts less than 4.0 A). These 
different intermolecular interactions could clearly 
have a significant effect on the relative orientation 
of the body of the inhibitor to the reactive-site loop. 
Tt is difficult to assess the contribution of each of 
these effects, though the situation could be clarified 
by crystallizing the complex in another crystal form 
or, perhaps, by computer simulation methods. In 
t’his regard, structural results on the complex of 
OMTKY3 and human leukocyte elastase suggests 
that it resembles OMTKY3:CHT (Bode et al., 
1986). Unfortunately, this is a key question that 
should be resolved before one may predict 
successfully the binding modes of new inhibitors 
based on the structures of these crystallographically 
solved complexes. 
Aside from the structural differences between the 
two complexes of OMTKY3, there is an intriguing 
difference in the kinetic rate constants for the 
release of cleaved inhibitor. The simplified reaction 
scheme for the production of cleaved inhibitor is as 
follows: 
E+I+%E+I*, 
where E is the enzyme, I is the virgin (uncleaved) 
inhibitor, I* is the modified (cleaved) inhibitor and 
C is the stable enzyme-inhibitor complex. The ratio 
k,,,/k& has been determined for the reactions of 
OMTKYS with various enzymes (Ardelt & 
Laskowski, 1985). For chymotrypsin, the ratio is 
1.25 x 106, whereas the corresponding number for 
SGPB is 4.3. It is not apparent what structural 
features give rise to such large differences in the 
kinetic behaviour of the two complexes.
