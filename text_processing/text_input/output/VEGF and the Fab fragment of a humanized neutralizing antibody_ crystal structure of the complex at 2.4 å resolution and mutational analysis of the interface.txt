Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a highly specific
angiogenic growth factor; anti-angiogenic treatment through inhibition of
receptor activation by VEGF might have important therapeutic applications in
diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and cancer. A neutralizing anti-VEGF
antibody shown to suppress tumor growth in an in vivo murine model has been
used as the basis for production of a humanized version.
Results: We present the crystal structure of the complex between VEGF and
the Fab fragment of this humanized antibody, as well as a comprehensive
alanine-scanning analysis of the contact residues on both sides of the interface.
Although the VEGF residues critical for antibody binding are distinct from those
important for high-affinity receptor binding, they occupy a common region on
VEGF, demonstrating that the neutralizing effect of antibody binding results
from steric blocking of VEGF–receptor interactions. Of the residues buried in
the VEGF–Fab interface, only a small number are critical for high-affinity
binding; the essential VEGF residues interact with those of the Fab fragment,
generating a remarkable functional complementarity at the interface.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the character of antigen–antibody
interfaces is similar to that of other protein–protein interfaces, such as
ligand–receptor interactions; in the case of VEGF, the principal difference is
that the residues essential for binding to the Fab fragment are concentrated in
one continuous segment of polypeptide chain, whereas those essential for
binding to the receptor are distributed over four different segments and span
across the dimer interface.
Introduction
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a highly
specific angiogenic factor that has been implicated both
in the de novo formation of blood vessels during embryo￾genesis (vasculogensis) and in the sprouting of new blood
vessels from pre-existing ones (angiogenesis) [1–3]. The
importance of VEGF in normal blood vessel develop￾ment is emphasized by the observation that deletion of a
single VEGF allele is lethal [4,5]. Furthermore, exces￾sive and pathogenic angiogenesis plays a crucial role in a
number of diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and
cancer [3]. The high specificity of VEGF for prolifera￾tion of vascular endothelial cells makes VEGF antago￾nists prime candidates for the suppression of pathogenic
angiogenesis. This assumption has been substantiated by
the suppression of tumor growth in vivo following treat￾ment with anti-VEGF antibodies in a murine model [6].
These results prompted the engineering of a humanized
version of murine neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody A4.6.1
[7,8], in order to investigate the beneficial effects of anti￾angiogenic treatment in humans.
There are two known cellular receptors of VEGF, KDR
(kinase domain receptor), which triggers the angiogenic
response, and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1), the
function of which is, as yet, poorly understood [9]. The
same 115 N-terminal residues of VEGF are shared by a
number of different splicing isoforms that range from 121
to 206 residues in length [10]. Plasmin cleavage of the
longer forms shows that the receptor-binding functional￾ity is contained within the first 110 residues [11]. The
crystal structure of a truncated construct of VEGF (residues
8–109) [12] demonstrates that VEGF is a member of the
cystine knot growth factor family (for a review, see [13]).
Extensive mutagenesis data allowed for the mapping of
the binding epitopes for KDR and Flt-1 onto the surface
of VEGF [14,15] — the binding site was shown to be
localized on the two symmetrical poles of the dimer [15].
This general location of the receptor-binding site was
confirmed by the crystal structure of VEGF in complex
with domain 2 of Flt-1 [16]. This structure also revealed
that although the binding determinants for both recep￾tors, as deduced from the mutagenesis studies, overlap

Research Article 1153only partially, almost all these residues are in contact
with domain 2 of Flt-1, suggesting that VEGF binds to
KDR and Flt-1 in a similar fashion.
Neutralizing monoclonal antibody A4.6.1 binds tightly to
VEGF, and this binding event prevents receptor activation
[6]. In order to gain further insights into the mechanism of
action of the antibody, we determined the crystal structure
at 2.4 Å resolution of its humanized antigen-binding frag￾ment, Fab-12 [8], in complex with the receptor-binding
domain of VEGF. A comparison of this structure with
those of free VEGF and of VEGF bound to domain 2 of
Flt-1 shows that the neutralization mechanism of the anti￾body involves steric blocking of the receptor site, and not
induced conformational changes in the ligand. We also per￾formed an extensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis analysis
[17] of both the combining site of the Fab fragment and
the binding epitope of VEGF. Although alanine-scanning
mutagenesis of the complementarity-determining regions
(CDRs) in order to determine the relative contribution of
individual residues to antigen binding has been reported
before (for example, [18]), this is the first comprehensive
mutational analysis of both the antibody and its antigen in
combination with detailed structural information. The
results show that only a small proportion of the residues in
the interface are important for high-affinity binding, and
the important residues of the antibody interact with those
of the antigen to generate a remarkable ‘functional’ com￾plementarity. These findings suggest that antigen–anti￾body interactions are qualitatively similar to other protein–
protein interactions, such as those between receptors and
their ligands [19].
Results
Accuracy of the crystallographic model
The crystal structure of the complex between the receptor￾binding domain of VEGF (residues 8–109) [20] and the
humanized Fab fragment, Fab-12 [8], of monoclonal anti￾body A4.6.1 was determined at 2.4 Å resolution and refined
to a crystallographic R value of 19.6% (free R value 26.6%,
Table 1). The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains
two Fab molecules bound to the symmetrical poles of the
VEGF dimer, and the molecular dyad of the VEGF dimer
coincides with the noncrystallographic twofold symmetry of
the complex (Figure 1). In both monomers of VEGF, only
residues 14–107 are defined by their electron density. In
both Fab molecules, the C-terminal residue Cys214 of the
light (L) chain is missing and the six C-terminal residues
Ser215–Thr220 are disordered in both heavy (H) chains. In
addition, loop 128–133 in the constant domain of both
heavy chains could not be placed with confidence and was
therefore omitted from the model.
The coordinate error of the model as deduced from a σA
plot [21] is ~0.35 Å; deviations from target-model geome￾try are 0.012 Å for bond lengths and 1.66° for bond angles.
Of all 1050 residues, 89.4% are located in the most favor￾able regions [22] of the Ramachandran plot. Four residues
are located in disallowed regions, namely residues Ser30VL
and Thr51VL (VL denotes that the residues are located in
the variable region of the light chain) of both Fab mol￾ecules in the asymmetric unit. They are part of the CDRs
L1 and L2 and will be discussed below. As a result of the
noncrystallographic symmetry restraints applied during
refinement, the root mean square deviations (rmsds)
between equivalent residues are small, namely 0.27 Å for
the mainchain atoms (0.45 Å for all atoms) between the
VEGF monomers, 0.17 Å (0.40 Å) for the VL domains,
0.42 Å (0.72 Å) for CL (light chain, constant, 0.16 Å (0.19 Å)
for VH (heavy chain, variable), and 0.40 Å (0.60 Å) for the
CH1 (heavy chain, constant) domains. 
The average temperature factor of the model is 40.5 Å2.
Although the average temperature factor of the VEGF
dimer at 40.6 Å2 is close to this, the average temperature
factors of the two Fab fragments are 23.0 Å2 and 61.4 Å2,
respectively (Figure 2). This difference is entirely accounted

domains, because the variable domains have similar average
temperature factors of 23.7 Å2 and 28.4 Å2, respectively. It
is striking that the lowest temperature factors within both
VEGF monomers are found for residues involved in the
VEGF–Fab interface (Figure 2a); moreover, these tem￾perature factors are very similar to the average observed
for the variable domains. As these residues have higher
than average temperature factors in 12 independent copies
of free VEGF [12,15], Fab binding appears to have stabi￾lized this region, enabling it to form a well-ordered inter￾molecular core that extends from VEGF to the variable
domain of the Fab fragment.
The constant domain of one Fab fragment has a very high
average temperature factor of 100 Å2. This high thermal
mobility is due to the almost complete lack of crystal￾packing contacts for this domain; similar differences in
mobility between the constant and variable parts of a Fab
fragment have been observed before [23]. It should be
noted that the presence of the second, crystallographically
independent Fab fragment enabled us to model the
average position of this domain with accuracy. This
approach is not unlike the use of nuclear magnetic reso￾nance (NMR) restraints to introduce additional informa￾tion in the refinement of ribosomal protein L9 [24], which
had similarly high thermal factors.
Overall structure of VEGF and anti-VEGF Fab
VEGF is a homodimeric protein and belongs to the family
of cystine knot growth factors, members of which share a
similar monomer fold, but differ in their dimerization
mode [13]. The structure of the receptor-binding domain
(residues 8–109) of VEGF consists of a central four￾stranded β sheet that displays the characteristic cystine
knot at one end [13] and possesses a small hydrophobic
core at the other end [12,16]. This hydrophobic core is gen￾erated by residues from loop regions connecting the
strands of the central β sheet, together with residues dis￾played on the N-terminal α helix of the second subunit,
across the dimer interface. The dimerization mode of the
VEGF homodimer is similar to that observed for platelet￾derived growth factor [25] — a dyad axis oriented perpen￾dicular to the β sheet places the two four-stranded β sheets
side by side. No mainchain–mainchain hydrogen bonds are
observed between strands across the interface, however.
The overall structure of VEGF in complex with the Fab
fragment is very similar to the unbound structure previously
reported [12]. The two monomers in the crystallographic
asymmetric unit can be superimposed onto the eight
monomers observed in the 1.9 Å crystal structure with
average rmsds of 0.73 Å (mainchain atoms, residues 15–105).
These deviations are of the same magnitude as those
among the eight monomers of free VEGF. Nevertheless,
although the overall structure is preserved in the complex,
small but significant differences are observed for some
residues at the binding epitope of the antibody (see below).
The initial framework for the humanization of the anti￾VEGF antibody was identical to that used for the anti￾HER2 antibody, anti-p185HER2 [26], but some adjustments
in framework residues were required in order to obtain tight
binding [7,8], resulting in an overall sequence identity of
88%. The structures of the variable domains of the anti￾VEGF Fab can be superimposed on that of anti-p185HER2
[27] with an rmsd of 1.04 Å (900 mainchain atoms used in
the superposition); superimposing the constant domains
yields a deviation of 0.59 Å (788 mainchain atoms). The two
antibodies differ significantly in their elbow angle, despite
having complete sequence identity among the residues in
the interface between the variable and constant domains.
For anti-p185HER2, the elbow angle is about 160° (program
CALC-AX; Joachim Meyer, personal communication), in
comparison to 140° for both copies of the anti-VEGF Fab.
Both these values fall within the range of 127°–225° previ￾ously reported for Fab fragments [28].
The CDR loops of the anti-VEGF Fab have the following
canonical structures [29]: in the light chain, CDR L1 adopts
canonical structure 2, L2 canonical structure 1, and L3
canonical structure 1; for the heavy chain, canonical struc￾ture 1 is observed for CDR H1, and canonical structure 2 for

StructureH2. To date, only a single type of structure has been
reported for CDR L2. In this CDR, the mainchain dihedral
angles at Thr51 are close to those expected for left-handed
α helices but nonetheless fall into disallowed regions [22] of
the Ramachandran plot. Interestingly, the same observation
has been made for other Fab fragments whose structures
have been determined (e.g. see [27,30,31]). Thus, it appears
that the angles observed at position 51 of CDR L2 consti￾tute a real shift from a canonical left-handed helical confor￾mation and that this reflects a general property of L2. A
similar observation holds true for position 30 in canonical
structure 2 of CDR L1.
Antigen–antibody interface
The anti-VEGF antibody binds VEGF at outer strands β5
and β6 (Figures 1 and 3), in close proximity to the β turn
between these strands. The surface area buried in the
antigen–antibody interface is 835 Å2 for the antibody
(Table 2) and 908 Å2 for VEGF (Table 3). A total of 19
VEGF residues participate in the interface. Residues from
strand β6 contribute 663 Å2 (73% of the total buried
surface area) and residues from strand β5 contribute
149 Å2 (16%). The remaining contacts to the Fab fragment
made by VEGF involve two residues displayed from the
N-terminal helix α1 (43 Å2, or 5%) and two residues from
the loop connecting α2 to β2 (53 Å2, or 6%; Figure 4).
Of the six CDRs of the antibody, L1 and L2 are not in
contact with VEGF. In the remaining CDRs, a total of 25
residues participate in binding, resulting in the following
buried surface areas: 68 Å2 (8%) for L3, 125 Å2 (15%) for
H1, 222 Å2 (27%) for H2, and 420 Å2 (50%) for H3 (Table 2).

StructureThe total buried surface area of 1744 Å2 is typical of that
observed for other Fab fragments bound to protein anti￾gens [32,33]. The CDR usage conforms to the general￾ization that L2 is often not required for binding, while
L3 and H3 are always involved [28,34]. Usually, CDRs of
the heavy chain contribute a greater amount of buried
surface than those of the light chain [32,34]. The ratio
observed for the VEGF–Fab complex, however, with only
8% contributed by the light chain and 92% by the heavy
chain, appears extreme.
The CDRs form a shallow cleft on the surface of the
antibody. The walls of the cleft are formed by L3 and H3
on one side, and H1 and H2 on the opposite side. With
the exception of His86, residues 86–94 of VEGF strand
β6 are bound in an almost extended conformation along
the floor of the cleft. His86 is at position i+2 of the type
II β turn [35] that connects strand β5–β6. Adjacent to
this histidine, a β bulge is formed between Gln87 and
Gly88 of strand β6 and Lys84 of the adjacent strand, β5
(Figure 3). Residues 89–94 form a total of five main￾chain–mainchain hydrogen bonds with the Fab fragment.
Residues 89–91 are hydrogen bonded to residues 33–31
of CDR H1, forming a short antiparallel β ladder; a short
parallel β ladder is formed between VEGF residues
91–93 and Tyr98–Gly100 of CDR H3. No mainchain–
mainchain interactions with the Fab fragment are observed
for residues 86–88.

StructureThe most prominent structural feature of the interface is
the burial of Gly88 of VEGF in a deep pocket on the
surface of the antibody-combining site (Figure 5). This
pocket is best described as a four-walled box with each
wall being made of the sidechain of a single aromatic
residue, namely residues Trp96 of CDR L3, Trp50 of H2,
and Tyr95 and Trp100D of H3. Gly88 of VEGF is sand￾wiched between the sidechains of Trp50 of CDR H2 and
Trp100D of H3. As a result, its phi and psi angles are
~180°. In addition, hydrogen bonds are formed between
Gln87 O of VEGF and Tyr95 Oη of CDR3 H3, as well as
between Tyr95 Oη of H3 and Trp96 Nε1 of L3. A similar
molecular box contains Gly92 of VEGF, which is sand￾wiched between His97 and Tyr98 of CDR H3 and nearby
residue, Tyr32 of CDR H1. Again, the mainchain torsion
angles of Gly92 of VEGF are ~180°.
No salt bridges are found at the interface, but several
sidechain-mediated polar interactions are present. The
sidechain of Gln89 of VEGF is hydrogen bonded to
Thr30 O and Thr52A NH of CDRs H1 and H2, respec￾tively. The sidechain of His90 of VEGF is buried in a
small pocket formed by Pro96, Tyr98, Ser100B and
Trp100D of CDR H3. His90 Nε2 of VEGF is hydrogen

hydrogen bonded to the guanidinium group of Arg82 of
VEGF. The interface does not contain any ordered water
molecules, although a number of waters mediating polar
interactions between VEGF and the antibody are found at
the periphery of the combining site. A sulfate ion was
located in close proximity to the combining site. The
sulfate is hydrogen bonded to Thr28, Asn31 and Tyr32 of
CDR H1 of the Fab fragment, but there are no direct
interactions with VEGF (an indirect interaction with the
sidechain of Gln79 of VEGF is mediated by a water mol￾ecule). We believe that the presence of the sulfate is a
crystallization artifact.
Alanine scanning of the interface
In order to assess the relative importance of the contact
residues at the interface, a number of mutants, each with a
single residue changed to alanine, were generated for both
VEGF and the Fab fragment. For the anti-VEGF Fab, the
contributions of all 68 sidechains within the six CDRs were
assessed by individual mutation of pY0192 Fab-phage
(Figure 6) residues to alanine (or to serine for wild-type ala￾nines). Relative binding affinities to VEGF were measured
in competitive monovalent phage enzyme-linked immuno￾absorbant assays (ELISAs) (see Materials and methods
section). The IC50 (the concentration of competitor at
which 50% inhibition of binding is observed) of the wild￾type Fab phage for VEGF was measured at 4.7 ± 1.1 nM,
comparing favorably to the measured Kd of 3.4 ± 0.9 nM for
the purified wild-type Fab using BIAcore. The use of
phage-ELISA techniques for measurement of binding
affinities greatly facilitated the scanning of CDR residues.
In order to assess the accuracy of this method, five alanine
variants representing a wide range of apparent binding
affinities by phage-ELISA were tested in a BIAcore assay
in addition to the wild type. Within the uncertainties of
each technique (±25%) excellent agreements are observed
between both methods (Table 2), showing that the phage￾ELISA technique can provide accurate measurements of
relative binding affinities.
The alanine-scan phage variants displayed a range of affini￾ties, from that of wild type to > 700 nM; all variants showed
some VEGF-specific binding (Table 2). In particular, large
decreases in affinity (> 150-fold, –∆∆G > 3 kcal/mol)
resulted primarily from substitution of residues located
within the heavy-chain CDRs: Asn31 and Tyr32 in H1;
Trp50 and Asn52 in H2; and Tyr95, Ser100B, and Trp100D
in H3. Among the light-chain CDR residues, only substitu￾tion of Trp96 produced so great an effect. Together, these
positions define the primary functional sidechain-binding
determinants. Less severe reductions in affinity (5–70-fold,
–∆∆G = 1–2.5 kcal/mol) resulted from alanine substitutions
at Tyr27, Phe29, Gly33, Met34, and Asn35 of H1, Thr52A
and Tyr53 of H2, Pro96, Tyr99, Tyr100E, and Phe100F 
of H3, and at one light-chain position, Tyr91 of L3. 
Smaller, but significant, reductions in affinity (2–5-fold,
–∆∆G =0.4–1 kcal/mol) were also observed at many posi￾tions of the heavy-chain CDRs, including those at residues
26, 51, 54, 58–59, 97–98, 100C and 101, as well as at posi￾tions 32–34, 89–90, and 95 in the light-chain CDRs. The
remaining CDR mutations, including those at the sites 
of expression-associated mutations Ser24Arg, Ser26Asn,
Gln27Glu, Asp28Gln, and Ile29Leu in CDR L1 (see Mate￾rials and methods section), showed no significant effect
upon VEGF binding affinity. Overall, the results suggest
that a large energetic contribution to the Fab–VEGF inter￾action stems from a subset of CDR residues in H1, H2, and
H3, with some contribution from L3.
The mutagenesis analysis of VEGF showed that 12 of the
19 alanine mutants tested displayed at least a fivefold
decrease in binding to mAb (murine antibody) A4.6.1

in affinity, respectively, relative to the wild type. Smaller,
but significant, decreases in binding of about 5–8 fold
(–∆∆G = ~1 kcal/mol) were found for mutations at posi￾tions 48, 79, 84, 93 and 94. The overall structural integrity
of the alanine mutants with a fivefold or greater effect on
mAb A4.6.1 binding was confirmed using a similar

mAb 32.E.1, which has a separate, dimer-dependent,

Discussion
Antigen–antibody interface
A total of 25 residues of the Fab fragment become buried
in the antigen–antibody interface upon binding to VEGF,
together constituting the structural epitope. Eight of these
residues are critical for binding, as defined by greater than
150-fold decreases in binding upon alanine substitution

Structure
Comparison of accessible surface area buried in the VEGF–Fab interface and contributions of individual residues to the antibody binding as
identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis: (a) residues from VEGF, (b) residues from the anti-VEGF Fab.             (Table 2), and form the functional epitope of the Fab frag￾ment. Together, these eight residues contribute 360 Å2
(44%) to the surface area buried in the interface. Five
residues are aromatic, the remaining three being two
asparagines and a serine. The high proportion of aromatic
residues, in particular tyrosine and tryptophan, is a feature
of the entire structural epitope, for which 11 residues are
aromatic out of total number of 25. This bias has been
noted before and reflects a general property of antibody
combining sites [23,32,36]. 
On VEGF, the functional epitope is dominated by six
residues; most important are Met81, Gln89 and Gly92,
substitution of which reduces affinity by about 70–110 fold.
Slightly smaller, but still large, contributions (22–40-fold
effects) are made by Arg82, Ile83, and Gly88. In general,
alanine-scanning mutagenesis provides a useful method of
assessing the relative contributions of individual side￾chains to the binding energy [37]. Results at glycine posi￾tions are less meaningful, however, because substitution
to alanine introduces a stiffening of the protein backbone
and requires additional space to accommodate the addi￾tional Cβ atom, without providing information on the con￾tribution of the wild-type residue to the free binding
energy of the complex. In the case of the VEGF–Fab
complex, the structure shows that steric hindrance is likely
to be the cause of the decreased affinity of the glycine to
alanine mutants at positions 88 and 92.

StructureThe direct juxtaposition of important binding determi￾nants from both functional epitopes is striking (Tables 2
and 3). The six dominant binding determinants of VEGF
are in intimate contact with the Fab fragment (Figure 4a).
The main structural feature is the binding of Gly88 of
VEGF through the aromatic box formed by the sidechains
of residues Trp96 of CDR L3, Trp50 of CDR H2, and
Tyr95 and Trp100D of CDR H3 (Figure 5). In this case,
considering the functional importance of both the glycine
and the surrounding Fab residues, the direct interactions
between the glycine and the box appear to provide signifi￾cant binding energy. In contrast, for the aromatic box sur￾rounding Gly92 of VEGF, none of the sidechains of the
Fab residues is crucial for binding. The structure shows that
in this case substitution with alanine is likely to interfere
with the formation of the numerous mainchain–mainchain
hydrogen bonds observed across the interface at this posi￾tion. Thus, the steric requirements of this region are likely
to be critical for maximum affinity. Additional juxtaposi￾tions of important binding determinants are Met81 of
VEGF and Tyr53 of H2, Arg82 of VEGF and Ser100B of
H3, and Ile83 of VEGF and Asn52 of H2. Although no
simple favorable interaction is observed for Ile83 of VEGF,
its sidechain is in close contact to a critical CDR H2
residue, Asn52. Finally, the sidechain of VEGF Gln89 is
involved in a number of hydrogen bonds with mainchain
atoms of CDRs H1 and H2.
From the data presented here, the functional VEGF
epitope for Fab binding appears to be rather small. Similar

[7] and used to produce a Fab phagemid,
called pY0101, similar to Fab-12. Variant
Y0192, an expression-optimized derivative of
Y0101 (see Materials and methods section
for details), was used for the alanine-scanning
mutagenesis described here. Residues are

Kabat et al. [56] (bottom). CDR regions are
underlined. Residues unique to the respective
sequences are indicated by shaded boxes.small binding epitopes have been deduced from theoreti￾cal considerations for the binding of lysozyme to two dif￾ferent antibodies, D1.3 and HyHEL-5 [38]. These cal￾culations have been corroborated partially by competition
studies with homologous avian lysozymes [39]. The size of
the functional epitope identified for the anti-VEGF Fab
fragment is similar to that identified for the humanized
anti-p185HER2 antibody [18], using the same method. In
this case, however, both the functional epitope of the
antigen and the crystal structure of the complex are
missing. In the case of anti-p185HER2, a set of only four
important binding determinants were identified, namely
His91VL, Arg50VH, Trp95VH and Tyr100AVH [18]. Here,
too, aromatic residues prevail and the binding determi￾nants cluster in a shallow pocket on the antibody surface. 
General similarities exist between the VEGF–Fab inter￾face and other protein–protein interactions. The inter￾action between human growth hormone and its recep￾tor has been investigated using the same methods as
described here, that is, structure determination of the
complex [40,41] and exhaustive alanine-scanning muta￾genesis of the binding partners [37,40,42]. In this case, of
32 hormone residues in contact with the receptor, only
five contribute most of the binding energy; these are in
contact with the five most important residues of the
receptor, resulting in a remarkable degree of functional
complementarity between the two epitopes [19]. From
these studies, it was proposed that only a small subset of
the residues buried in a protein–protein interface may be
the principal contributor to the binding energy; in the
growth hormone example, these residues are clustered
together in a small hydrophobic patch surrounded by
polar interactions. A similar situation was observed in an
analysis of the interaction between tissue factor and
coagulation factor VIIa [43,44], where, again, only a small
subset of residues contribute most to ligand affinity. In
this case, however, these residues form several discontin￾uous clusters on the protein surface.
In most complexes between protein antigens and antibod￾ies, a number of well-ordered water molecules are found
within the combining site [45]. It has been proposed that
water molecules are required in order to overcome imper￾fections in shape complementarity and that such imper￾fections are characteristic of protein–antibody interactions,
possibly because, in contrast to other protein–protein
interactions, antigen recognition has not been optimized
through evolution, but rather depends on rapid selection
pressure [33]. In the case of VEGF, no water molecules
are buried in the antigen–Fab interface, and excellent
complementarity is observed between segment β6 of
VEGF and the combining site. Furthermore, the observa￾tion that in the complex the temperature factors of VEGF
segment β5–β6 (Figure 2) are very similar to those of the
variable domains of the antibody and considerably lower
than the rest of VEGF suggests tight packing of the inter￾face. It is worth noting that in the complex of VEGF with
domain 2 of its Flt-1 receptor, a channel of water mol￾ecules is found in the interface [16]; similar water clusters
have also been observed in the growth hormone–receptor
interface [40]. Thus, water-mediated contacts are not spe￾cific to interfaces between antibody and antigenic protein.
With respect to these findings, a remarkable similarity

Conformational change upon binding
In addition to the crystal structure of the VEGF–Fab
complex, the structure of unbound VEGF is also known
[12,15]. The triclinic crystal structure contained eight
independent copies of the molecule in the asymmetric
unit, and superposition of the eight molecules made
possible the identification of the conformationally flexi￾ble portions of the molecule. The highest deviations were
observed within segment β5–β6, and it was shown that the
eight conformations represent different ‘snapshots’ of a
concerted ‘up and down’ loop movement [12]. In the Fab
complex, this same segment is intimately involved in anti￾body binding. Superposition of this segment, as observed
in the complex, onto the conformations seen in unbound
VEGF shows that, overall, the bound conformation fits
well within the range of conformational freedom observed
in the unligated structure (Figure 7). Two of its Cα posi￾tions do not, however, fall within the range of conforma￾tional flexibility of the unbound state. The Cα of VEGF
His90 is displaced by 1.3 Å; this corresponds to a 7.9σ
movement when considering the standard deviation of the
distance deviations among the eight monomers in unli￾gated VEGF. Similarly, a 1.2 Å (10.6σ) displacement is
observed for the Cα of VEGF Gly92 (Figure 7). We con￾clude that the anti-VEGF antibody selects one of the
available multiple conformations of this loop upon
binding, while inducing small but significant local changes
at positions 90 and 92.
The neutralizing effect of anti-VEGF antibody
Binding of VEGF by the anti-VEGF antibody prevents
the growth factor from binding to its receptors. The
overall structure of residues 8–109 of unbound VEGF is
identical to that in the complex with the Fab fragment,
demonstrating that the neutralizing effect is not the result
of antibody-induced conformational changes in the ligand
preventing receptor binding. Recently, we determined the
crystal structure of residues 8–109 of VEGF in complex
with domain 2 of Flt-1 [16]. A comparison of both struc￾tures clearly explains the neutralizing effect of the anti￾body — of the 19 VEGF residues contributing to the
interface in the VEGF–Fab complex, nine are also buried
in the interface with domain 2 of Flt-1. It is worth noting
that, of these, only a single residue, namely Ile83, is an
important binding determinant for both the antibody and
the receptor (Figure 3). The neutralizing effect therefore
appears to be due to steric hindrance, and not due to com￾petition for the same critical binding determinants.
Biological implications
A comparison of the structure of the VEGF–Fab
complex with other antigen–antibody complex structures
reveals that the binding mode of VEGF resembles that
of linear peptides more closely than that of protein anti￾gens. Whereas peptides are predominantly bound within
deep grooves, protein antigens tend to interact at the
periphery of the CDRs via a relatively flat surface [46].
Peptides bind predominantly in an almost extended con￾formation, usually with a β turn next to the terminus
[28]. In VEGF, this motif corresponds to strand β6
together with the preceding type II β turn formed by
residues Lys84–Gln87. A somewhat similar situation
was observed in the recent crystal structure of the N-ter￾minal domain of the interferon-γ receptor α chain in
complex with Fab-A6 [23]. Here, too, most of the inter￾actions of the Fab fragment (80%) are with a single con￾tinuous loop segment of the receptor, and additional
segments make less extensive contributions, generating
a discontinuous binding epitope.
Jones and Thornton [33] have shown that interfaces in
nonpermanent and nonobligatory complexes, such as
antigen–antibody and hormone–receptor interfaces;
have smaller interaction surfaces, lower packing densi￾ties and involve more polar interactions than seen in
permanent complexes that do not exist as independent
entities, such as dimeric molecules. Our results on the
VEGF–antibody and VEGF–receptor complexes are
in agreement with this analysis. The principal differ￾ence we observe is the significant extent of fragmenta￾tion of the structural binding epitope in the latter, with
fewer segments being involved for antigen–antibody
interfaces [33]. This difference is even more pro￾nounced when looking at the functional epitope,
instead of the structural epitope. In VEGF the impor￾tant residues all cluster within the continuous segment
β5–β6; similar localization of binding determinants is
observed for a second neutralizing antibody whose
functional epitope resides primarily on helix α1 [15]. In
contrast, the binding determinants of VEGF for kinase
domain receptor (KDR) are distributed over four dif￾ferent segments [15]. 
Materials and methods
Complex formation and crystallization
Residues 8–109 of VEGF were expressed, refolded, and purified as pre￾viously described [20]. Purified Fab-12 fragment was obtained from Pat
McKay (Process Sciences, Genentech, Inc.), mixed with VEGF in a 2.1:1
molar ratio, and purified by size exclusion chromatography (S-200, Phar￾macia) in 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 M sodium chloride. The composi￾tion of the resulting complex was verified by SDS PAGE and size
exclusion chromatography (data not shown). The protein solution was
concentrated to A280 = 7.8, and used in crystallization trials. Initial
hanging-drop experiments using the vapor-diffusion method resulted in
isomorphous crystals from two different conditions (15% PEG, 10% iso￾propanol, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0; and 2 M ammo￾nium sulfate, 2% MPD, 0.1 M bis-tris-propane, pH 6.5). Crystals used in
the structure determination were grown from large sitting drops by equili￾brating a mixture of 20 µl protein solution and 20 µl reservoir solution
(15% PEG, 10% isopropanol, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M MES,
pH 6.0) against 30 ml reservoir solution. Monoclinic crystals grew to a
size of 0.1 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.5 mm in 2–3 weeks. The crystals were
1164 Structure 1998, Vol 6 No 9cryoprotected by dipping in 100µl drops of reservoir solution containing
increasing concentrations of glycerol (first 5%, then 10%, then 20%),
after which they were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Data collection
A data set to 2.4 Å resolution was collected from two flash-frozen
crystals at beamline A1 at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron
Source using a charge-coupled device detector (Area Detector
Systems Corp., San Diego) and a wavelength of 0.914 Å. The crys￾tals belonged to space group P21 with cell parameters a = 89.86 Å,
b = 66.98 Å, c = 140.51 Å and β = 94.27°. For each of the two crys￾tals, a low- and a high-resolution pass were recorded and processed
independently with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK [47].
The final data set, obtained after merging 240,859 observations of
the individual data sets, contained 63,147 unique reflections (average
redundancy = 3.8) and was 96% complete in the resolution range
20–2.4 Å (RMerge(I) = 7.1%).
Structure determination and refinement
The structure of the VEGF–Fab complex was solved by molecular
replacement. Taking into consideration the inherent twofold symmetry
of the VEGF dimer, we expected that one VEGF dimer would be bound
to two Fab molecules. Because of the absence of a crystallographic
twofold rotation axis, the molecular dyad had to be noncrystallographic;
thus the asymmetric unit would contain one VEGF dimer and two Fab
fragments, yielding a Matthews parameter of 3.6 Å3/Da and a solvent
content of 66%.
Rotation functions were calculated using a VEGF dimer as a search
model ([12]; Brookhaven Protein Data Bank [PDB] accession code
2vpf). The crystal structure of a humanized anti-HER2 Fab fragment,
anti-p185HER2 ([27]; PDB accession code 1fvd), which had an 88%
identical humanization framework [8,26], was used as a model for the
Fab portion. In order to avoid bias, the CDRs were removed from the
model and a tryptophan residue was substituted by alanine for addi￾tional verification purposes. A rotation search and Patterson correlation
refinement [48] using the program XPLOR [49] yielded four distinct
peaks for the VEGF dimer with correlation coefficients of 5.3–4.9%,
while the subsequent highest peaks were below 4.3%. These four
peaks correspond to two different candidate rotation solutions, pairs
being related by the VEGF molecular dyad. Translation searches did
not allow us to identify the correct solution.
With the Fab model, rotation searches calculated with data between 8
and 4 Å resolution, allowing the elbow angle [28] to vary between 110°
and 210° in 10° steps yielded one (instead of two) unambiguous solu￾tion with a correlation coefficient of 9.8%, with the next peak at 5.6%.
The pre-oriented Fab fragment could be readily translated into the
unit cell with the program AMORE [50], and translation of the VEGF
dimer with the Fab fragment fixed yielded an unambiguous solution
for the highest of the two distinct VEGF rotation-solution candidates
(R = 48.3% and correlation coefficient = 30.8%). Inspection of this
solution with the program O [51] showed that the Fab CDRs would be
in contact with VEGF, verifying the correctness of this partial solution,
but the absence of any crystal packing contacts in one direction
demonstrated that this model was still incomplete.
At this stage, refinement of the partial model was initiated. After rigid￾body refinement followed by positional refinement with the program
XPLOR [49] using all data between 10 and 3.0 Å resolution
(R = 43.8%), clear electron density was observed for the omitted
CDRs and tryptophan sidechain in a σA-weighted (2Fo–Fc)exp(iαc)
electron-density map [21]. After several rounds of positional refine￾ment and manual rebuilding with the program O [51], all the CDRs of
the Fab fragment could be built with confidence. Clear electron
density emerged for the variable part of the second Fab molecule,
related to the first Fab fragment via the molecular dyad of the VEGF
dimer. After inclusion of this variable fragment, further positional
refinement between 10 and 3.0 Å resolution yielded a crystallographic
R value of 31.9% (free R value = 38.0%) and maps into which the
missing constant domain of the second Fab molecule was positioned,
although clear density was only visible for those parts in immediate
contact with the variable part of the molecule. Noncrystallographic
symmetry restraints were applied in all further refinement, while gradu￾ally increasing the resolution to 2.4 Å, refining restrained individual
temperature factors, and adding water molecules. At a late stage the
structure factors were corrected for observed anisotropy, yielding the
final model with a crystallographic R value of 19.6% (free
R value = 26.6%) between 8 and 2.4 Å resolution. No bulk solvent
correction was applied. 
The final model is unusual with respect to the high average temperature
factor of 100 Å2 of the constant domain of the second Fab molecule.
The use of noncrystallographic symmetry restraints forces this portion
to be similar to the well-defined constant domain of the first Fab frag￾ment. Therefore, although this domain contributes only weakly to the
overall scattering and is thus poorly defined by the observed data, it
could be accurately modeled because of the presence of the second
identical and well-defined copy. 
Construction of humanized anti-VEGF Fab phage
A monovalent, humanized Fab phagemid for alanine-scanning analysis
was constructed by mutation of clone pMB16 (Figure 6), derived from
phage humanization of the mAb A4.6.1 [7], to include additional substi￾tutions identified in an optimally humanized variant of Fab-12 [8]. Muta￾tions were made by site-directed mutagenesis [52], and verified by
Sequenase (US Biochemical) sequencing. The new variant, pY0101
(Figure 6), contained the Fab-12 sequence, except for mutations
Met4Leu in VL and Thr231Leu in VH. The former was retained from
pMB16 in order to preclude possible methionine oxidation, and the
latter was retained in order to retain the original junction (with amber
codon for soluble Fab or Fab-g3p expression) sequence to the C-termi￾nal domain of M13 g3p [7]. The Fab phagemid pY0101 was used for
initial expression and affinity enhancement experiments in which the VL1
CDR residues 24 and 26–29 were randomized. Five codons in VL1 of
pY0101 were first converted to stop (TAA) codons using the oligonu￾cleotide 5′-GG GTC ACC ATC ACC TGC TAA GCA TAA TAA TAA
TAA AGC AAC TAT TTA AAC TGG-3′. After verifying the stop-codon
template by sequencing, a library was constructed by mutagenesis with
a degenerate oligonucleotide (NNS replacing TAA codons). Fab-phage
variants were propagated overnight in XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells
(Stratagene), then precipitated and sorted as described in [53]. VEGF
binding selections yielded no affinity improvements compared with
pY0101; however, one variant, pY0192 (Figure 6), was identified with
a marked improvement in expression over pY0101. This clone, contain￾ing light chain mutations Ser24Arg, Ser26Asn, Gln27Glu, Asp28Gln,
and Ile29Leu, as well as one heavy chain mutation Met34Ile, was used
as the background for subsequent alanine-scanning mutagenesis.
Each alanine substitution (or serine substitution for wild-type alanine)
was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and verified by DNA
sequencing as described above.
VEGF binding assays using Fab-phage ELISA
Phage ELISA assays were performed and used to derive IC50 values as
described [53]. Immunosorbant plates (Maxisorp plates, Nunc Intermed)
were coated overnight at 4°C with 2 µg/ml VEGF in 50 mM carbonate
buffer and blocked with 5% instant milk. For normalization of phage
concentrations, serial dilutions of Fab phage were made in parallel in
ELISA buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween-20 in phos￾phate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with immobilized VEGF. Plates were washed, incubated for 1 hour with
rabbit anti-phage serum and horse radish peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce), washed again and developed with
o-phenylenediamine substrate (Sigma). Normalized, subsaturating con￾centrations of phage for all Fab variants, as well as wild-type (pY0192),
were mixed with serial dilutions (200 nM–0 nM) of VEGF in triplicate.
The mixture was then added to VEGF-coated plates and analyzed as
described above to determine an IC50 for each variant.
Research Article VEGF in complex with a humanized Fab Muller et al. 1165BIAcore analysis of Fab binding affinities
Y0192 Fab and several Fab variants were prepared by expression from
the Fab-phagemid constructs by transforming the phagemids into a non￾suppressor strain of E. coli [7]. Following induction of the PhoA pro￾moter, cells were harvested and osmotically shocked, and the Fabs
purified by protein G (Pharmacia) affinity chromatography [7]. Protein
concentrations were determined using absorbance at 280 nm. Fab
binding affinities were measured on a BIAcore-2000 (TM) system
(BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ), essentially as previously described [7].
Carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) were
activated with EDC (N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide
hydrochloride) and NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) according to the suppli￾er’s instructions. VEGF in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, was injected
onto the biosensor chip at a concentration of 50µg/ml to yield approxi￾mately 700–1400 resonance-response units (RU) of covalently coupled
protein. Unreacted groups were blocked with an injection of 1 M
ethanolamine. Kinetics measurements were carried out by injecting
twofold serial dilutions of Fab in running buffer (PBS containing 0.05%
Tween-20) at 25°C using a flow rate of 20µl/min. Association rates (kon)
and dissociation rates (koff) were calculated using a simple one-to-one
Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software v. 2.0; [54]). The
equilibrium dissociation constant was calculated as the ratio koff/kon.
Alanine scan of the VEGF-interface residues
Fifty alanine mutants of VEGF had been previously generated and used
to elaborate the KDR binding epitope on the hormone [15]. Nineteen of
these mutant proteins (Table 3) were used to probe all the sidechain
contacts with mAb A4.6.1 as observed in the crystal structure of the
complex. For this study, each of these mutants was purified further by
anion exchange (Pharmacia HiTrap Q, 1 ml), to remove traces of mis￾folded monomer, which is known to interact with mAb A4.6.1. Binding
affinities were measured with an ELISA that quantitated the binding of
mAb A4.6.1 to immobilized VEGF in the presence of a dilution series of
competing mutant [15].
