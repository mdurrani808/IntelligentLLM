The tissue factor (TF)-initiated blood coagulation protease cascade can be
greatly inhibited in vivo by a potent anti-human-TF monoclonal antibody,
5G9. This antibody binds the carboxyl module of the extracellular
domain of TF with a nanomolar binding constant and inhibits the for￾mation of the TFVIIaX ternary initiation complex. We have determined
the crystal structures of the extra-cellular modules of human TF, Fab
5G9, and their complex (TF5G9) to 2.4 AÊ , 2.5 AÊ , and 3.0 AÊ , respectively,
and measured the apparent inhibition constants of 5G9 on a panel of TF
mutants. In our unliganded TF structure, a 7 change in the relative
orientation between the D1 and D2 modules was observed when com￾pared with other published TF structures. Comparison of the free and
bound Fab 5G9 indicates that small segmental and side-chain variation of
the antibody complementarity determining regions occurred on com￾plexation with TF. The antibody-antigen recognition involves 18 TF anti￾gen residues and 19 Fab residues from six CDRs with one of the largest
buried surface areas seen to date. A combination of structural and muta￾genesis data indicate that Tyr156, Lys169, Arg200, and Lys201 play the
major role in the antibody recognition. The TF5G9 structure provides
insights into the mechanism by which the antibody 5G9 inhibits for￾mation of the TFVIIaX ternary complex.

Introduction
Activation of the coagulation protease cascade
propels the pathophysiology of the thrombotic dis￾eases (reviewed by Ruf & Edgington, 1994). The
coagulation cascade is initiated by the cell surface
transmembrane receptor tissue factor (TF) which
binds serine protease factor VIIa and activates the
VIIa protease domain for full catalytic function.
The complex then proteolytically activates the
macromolecular zymogen substrates, factors IX
and X, and generates the two key intermediate
enzymes for thrombin generation and cell signal￾ling. Because of its central role in initiating the
thrombogenic responses, an understanding of the
molecular mechanisms by which coagulation func￾tion can be attenuated is of wide interest and of
potential therapeutic bene®t (Levi et al., 1994) in
several life-threatening diseases, including throm￾bosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC; Edgington et al., 1992).

0022±2836/98/050873±22 $25.00/0/mb971512 # 1998 Academic Press LimitedThe structure-function relationships of TF have
been advanced through systematic mutagenesis of
TF (Ruf et al., 1994; Kelley et al., 1995) and of VIIa
(Dickinson et al., 1996). These data can now be
interpreted within the context of the three-dimen￾sional structures of TF (Harlos et al., 1994; Muller
et al., 1994, 1996; also reviewed by Martin et al.,
1995) and the TFVIIa binary complex (Banner
et al., 1996). The TF extracellular domain folds into
two ®bronectin-type III modules, D1 and D2, that
are also presented in members of the cytokine
receptor family (Bazan, 1990). An extended hydro￾phobic intermodule interface results in a relatively
rigid orientation of the two modules (Harlos et al.,
1994; Muller et al., 1994, 1996). The mutagenesis
experiments demonstrated that both modules con￾tribute to an extended binding site for the protease
VIIa. The functionally derived ligand interface is in
excellent agreement with the interface determined
from the three-dimensional structure of the
TFVIIa complex (Banner et al., 1996). TF binds the
protease through contacts that involve each of the
various structural components of VIIa: (1) the g￾carboxy glutamic acid-rich (Gla) module interacts
with a hydrophobic patch containing the solvent￾exposed disul®de bridge of the D2 module of TF;
(2) the ®rst epidermal growth factor-like module
(EGF-1) packs into a groove formed by the inter￾face between the D1 and D2 modules of TF; and
(3) EGF-2 and the protease module have a continu￾ous interface with the D1 module of TF. The inter￾faces of VII/VIIa EGF-1 and Gla modules with TF
are formed predominantly by hydrophobic inter￾actions, suggesting that these two light chain mod￾ules provide a tether for the protease. The protease
module interacts with a cluster of residues of TF
(Banner et al., 1996) that have functional impli￾cations (Dickinson et al., 1996) on the ability of TF
to confer allosteric changes to the VIIa protease
module in order to enable its full catalytic activity.
The interactions which support the assembly of
the macromolecular substrates, factors X and IX,
with TFVIIa are still not well understood. Factor
X is preferentially hydrolyzed when bound to a
phospholipid membrane, probably through its
amino-terminal Gla-module (Krishnaswamy et al.,
1992; Ruf et al., 1991c). Macromolecular substrate
activation also involves the Gla-module of VIIa
(Ruf et al., 1991a), which is oriented toward the
membrane, as deduced from the TFVIIa complex
(Banner et al., 1996). It is, therefore, reasonable to
assume that interaction of the Gla-modules of both
enzyme and substrate may play a signi®cant role
in the association of TFVIIa with macromolecular
substrate to form the transient ternary complex.
Furthermore, residues Lys165 and Lys166 in the
D2 domain of TF are localized adjacent to the Gla￾domain in the TF-VIIa interface, and these two
basic residues are important for activation of
macromolecular substrate (Ruf et al., 1992a).
Epitope mapping of inhibitory antibodies of TF
has also provided evidence consistent with this
model. Whereas most inhibitory antibodies are
found to compete with VIIa binding to TF, mono￾clonal antibody 5G9 rapidly binds the preformed
TFVIIa and inhibits association of macromolecular
substrate (Ruf & Edgington, 1991). Antibody 5G9
displays these potent anti-thrombotic effects in vivo
and is currently being tested as a therapeutic to
interrupt TF-initiated coagulation (Edgington et al.,
1992). Antibody 5G9 is directed against the D2
module of TF (Ruf et al., 1991b) and is a competi￾tive inhibitor for macromolecular substrate factor X
activation, as de®ned by kinetic analysis (Ruf &
Edgington, 1991). The crystallization of TF in com￾plex with a Fab fragment of this antibody (Ruf
et al., 1992b) now provides an opportunity to
investigate the structural basis of this inhibition
and of macromolecular substrate recognition by
the TFVIIa complex.
Antibody-protein complex structures have
become a paradigm for understanding protein-pro￾tein interactions (Jones & Thornton, 1996). The
interactions in the antibody-antigen interface are
often weaker than the corresponding subunit inter￾faces of multimeric proteins or of small molecule
inhibitor-protease complexes (Sheriff, 1993; Jones &
Thornton, 1996). Of the 59 antibody-antigen struc￾tures that have had their coordinates deposited in
the PDB database (Bernstein et al., 1978) up to Feb￾ruary 1997, 20 complexes have proteins as their
antigens (for reviews, see Davies et al., 1990;
Sheriff, 1993; Wilson & Stan®eld, 1993, 1994;
Padlan, 1994; Webster et al., 1994; Braden & Poljak,
1995; Sheriff, 1997; Cohen et al., 1996). The anti￾body-protein structures are restricted mainly to
lysozyme (Amit et al., 1986; Sheriff et al., 1987;
Padlan et al., 1989; Fischmann et al., 1991; Chitarra
et al., 1993; Bhat et al., 1994; Lescar et al., 1994;
Braden et al., 1994; Chacko et al., 1995; Cohen et al.,
1996), neuraminidase (Tulip et al., 1992a,b; Malby
et al., 1994), and anti-idiotope antibodies (Ban et al.,
1994; Fields et al., 1995; Braden et al., 1996). Other
protein antigens include histidine-containing pro￾tein (HPr; Prasad et al., 1993), in¯uenza virus
hemagglutinin HA1 monomer (Bizebard et al.,
1995), and N10-staphylococcal nuclease (Bossart￾Whitaker et al., 1995).
Extensive conformational changes in an antibody
upon binding small molecular mass antigens have
been illustrated, for example, in anti-peptide Fab
17/9 (Rini et al., 1992), anti-DNA Fab BV04
(Herron et al., 1991) and anti-HIV-1 Fab 50.1
(Stan®eld et al., 1993). These structures provided
clear evidence for induced ®t as a mechanism for
antibody-antigen recognition (Rini et al., 1992;
Stan®eld et al., 1993). It now appears that there is a
wide range of variation in the extent of confor￾mational changes induced by a ligand in different
antibody systems. For protein antigens, the anti￾gen-induced antibody conformational changes
have so far been of lesser magnitude than those
seen with some hapten or peptide ligands. In this
study, the crystal structures of TF and Fab 5G9
have been determined in both free and liganded
forms. Evaluation of any antibody conformational
874 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complexchanges following antigen binding can then be
made, as well as assessment of the relative contri￾butions of polar and hydrophobic interactions to
the stability of the antibody-antigen complex.
Results and Discussion
Crystal structure of Fab 5G9
The current Fab 5G9 (isotype IgG1, k) model
consists of residues 1 to 214 from both the light
chain and the heavy chain. The Fab 5G9 structure
was re®ned to an R-value of 21.1% and an Rfree
value (BruÈ nger, 1992a) of 30.4% for data between
8 AÊ and 2.5 AÊ (Table 1). The 5G9 model has an
excellent overall ®t to 2Fo ÿ Fc maps with an aver￾age real space correlation coef®cient (Jones et al.,
1991) of 0.87 for main-chain atoms. Residues that
have relatively low real space correlation coef®-
cients are all in solvent-exposed regions with high￾er-than-average thermal parameters. Most of the
residues are clustered in energetically favorable
(89.3%) or allowed (98.1%) regions of the Rama￾chandran plot. AlaL51 of the light chain is located
as usual in a less favorable region that corresponds
to position (i  1) of a classic g turn (Milner-White
et al., 1988), as found in other Fab structures
(Stan®eld et al., 1990; Rini et al., 1992; Tulip et al.,
1992a; Arevalo et al., 1993; Braden et al., 1994;
Malby et al., 1994).
Fab 5G9 is like a typical anti-protein antibody
with a concave and undulating surface (Wilson &
Stan®eld, 1994). The elbow angle in Fab 5G9 is
133.0. The conformations of CDR loops L1, L2, L3,
H1, and H2 are consistent with their sequence-pre￾dicted canonical structure types (Chothia et al.,
1989), which are type 2, 1, 1, 1, and 2, respectively.
Crystal structure of tissue factor
The TF crystal has two molecules (I and II) in
the crystal asymmetric unit. The current TF model
contains residues 5 to 83, and 89 to 211 for mol￾ecule I, and residues 5 to 83, 89 to 115, 121 to 134,
138 to 157, 164 to 182 and 186 to 210 for molecule
II. The missing TF residues include the N-terminal
residues (1 to 4) for molecule I, a loop in the D1
module of TFs that connects strands F and G (resi￾dues 84 to 88), which is also poorly de®ned in
other TF structures (Harlos et al., 1994; Muller et al.,
1994, 1996), and some shorter loops (116 to 120,
135 to 136, 158 to 163, 183 to 185) in the membrane
proximal D2 module of molecule II. The two TF
molecules have been re®ned to an R-value of
21.7% and an Rfree value of 29.7% between 8 and
2.4 AÊ . Most of the residues (86.1%) have energeti￾cally favorable conformations and no residues
have disallowed conformations.
The two TF molecules in the asymmetric unit are
related by a 90.5 rotation about the crystallo￾graphic axes [0.0, 0.95, ÿ0.30] and a translation of
101.9 AÊ , ÿ0.7 AÊ , ÿ12.5 AÊ , which corresponds to a
very small peak (1s) in the self-rotation function.
The r.m.s.d. between the two TF molecules for 177
Ca atoms is 0.38 AÊ . Ramachandran plots of the two
TF molecules are similar with r.m.s. differences on
phi and psi of 9.7 and 10.7, respectively (as calcu￾lated by LSQMAN; Kleywegt & Jones, 1994a). The

Crystal structure of TF5G9 complex
The TF5G9 molecule is ``L'' shaped with
molecular dimensions of 77 AÊ  78 AÊ  101 AÊ
(Figure 1). The TF5G9 complex crystals contain
two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crys￾tal. Each of the two TF5G9 models consists of resi￾dues 1 to 214 for both Fab light and heavy chains
and residues 4 to 82, and 91 to 211 for TF. As in
the unliganded TF structure, some residues (83 to
90) in TF D1 module could not be located in the
electron density maps and were omitted from the
®nal model. The current model has an R-value of
20.6% and an Rfree value of 27.6% for re¯ections
between 7.0 AÊ and 3.0 AÊ (Table 1).
The two molecules in the crystal are related by a
75 rotation around the crystallographic b-axis
with a translation component of 71.4 AÊ , 59.6 AÊ ,
57.2 AÊ , which corresponds to the strongest non￾crystallographic peak (9s) in the self-rotation func￾Figure 1. Two orthogonal views of the TF5G9 complex in stereo. TF is in magenta; Fab 5G9 heavy and light chains
are in blue and light blue. A loop in TF (residues 83 to 90) was not seen in the electron density and is represented by
a broken line. N and C represent the amino and carboxyl termini, respectively. Figures 1 to 6, 8 and 9 were created
by MidasPlus2.0 (Ferrin et al., 1988; Huang et al., 1991).
876 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex  tion map. The r.m.s. deviations between the two
complexes are 0.24 AÊ for all Ca atoms and the
r.m.s. differences of main-chain torsional angles
phi and psi are 9.1 and 8.9, respectively, which
illustrates that the two complexes are highly simi￾lar. However, the average B-value of the second
complex B (42 AÊ 2
) is slightly higher than that of
the ®rst complex A (33 AÊ 2
) and corresponds to a
lower real space correlation coef®cient (0.77 versus
0.81). Hence, molecule A is used in the following
analyses unless otherwise stated.
Fewer residues (74%) are clustered in the most
favorable region of the Ramachandran plot com￾pared to the unliganded TF and 5G9 as expected
from the lower resolution (3 AÊ versus 2.4 to 2.5 AÊ ).
All residues are within allowed regions except for
AlaL51 and SerH97 in both molecules. As in the
uncomplexed 5G9 antibody, AlaL51 is in a classic
g turn (Milner-White et al., 1988). In the unliganded
5G9 antibody, SerH97 of CDR H3 is in the (i  1)
position of a type IV loop, as identi®ed by pro￾gram NAOMI (Brocklehurst & Perham, 1993), in
which it has an allowed left-handed helix confor￾mation with phi, psi values of 92.0 and ÿ27.1,
respectively. In the TF5G9 complex, the main￾chain carbonyl oxygen of SerH97 binds to TF
Lys169 Nz through a hydrogen bond, which results
in a less favorable conformation for SerH97 (phi,
psi angles of 96.3 and ÿ50.0, respectively).
TF5G9 is the second reported protein structure
that crystallizes in space group P2 as found from a
survey of the February 1997 release of the PDB
database (Bernstein et al., 1978). The only other
macromolecule entry in a P2 space group is for
pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PDB code 1dik,
Herzberg et al., 1996). As pointed out by Wukovitz
& Yeates (1995) in their discussion of the crystal
packing of monomeric proteins, P2 is an unfavored
space group for protein crystals. The TF5G9
crystal has some very large solvent channels with
cross sections of 22 AÊ  56 AÊ , 22 AÊ  22 AÊ , and
26 AÊ  31 AÊ along the crystallographic a, b and
c-axes, respectively (Figure 2). The intermolecular
packing interactions are dominated by b-strand ±b￾strand interactions between two neighboring mol￾ecules. This unusual packing and peculiar L-shape
of the complex (Figure 1) might account for the
adoption of a P2 lattice, and explain the fragility
and the weak diffraction of the crystals (I/sI of 7.2
to 3 AÊ ).
D1 and D2 module association in TF structures
Two human TF structures have been previously
determined at 2.2 AÊ (Harlos et al., 1994, PDB code
1boy) and at 2.4 AÊ (Muller et al., 1994, PDB code
1hft), followed by a 1.7 AÊ structure (Muller et al.,
1996, PDB code 2hft). Both human TFs crystallized
in the same space group, P41212, with the same cell
parameters and one molecule in the asymmetric
unit. The two structures are highly similar with a
r.m.s.d of 0.44 AÊ for 194 Ca atoms. The overall
structure of TF in the TFVIIa complex is also very
similar to that of the uncomplexed TFs with a
r.m.s.d. of 0.53 AÊ for 170 Ca atoms (Banner et al.,
1996). The only signi®cant difference was a small
shift in the loop containing Leu133 and Phe144.
The TF in our TF5G9 complex structure is simi￾lar to the published TFs with an r.m.s.d. of 0.61 AÊ
for 185 Ca atoms (compared to 2hft). Our unli￾ganded TF differs from these TF structures with an
overall r.m.s. deviation of 1.33 AÊ for 197 corre￾sponding Ca atoms (compared to 2hft). Superposi￾tion of the individual D1 and D2 modules,
however, shows much lower r.m.s.d. values of
0.59 AÊ for 89 D1 Ca atoms and 0.57 AÊ for 98 D2 Ca
atoms. Calculation of the intermodule angle
between D1 and D2 modules by program O (Jones
et al., 1991) shows that our unliganded TF structure
has an intermodule angle of 134 for both TF mol￾ecules I and II, different from those of 2hft (127)
and 1boy (127). So, despite a large intermodule
hydrophobic interaction (Muller et al., 1996), a lim￾ited degree of orientational ¯exibility (7)
between the TF D1 and D2 modules is permitted
(Figure 3). Compared with the other TF structures

a Only Fab-protein complexes with full coordinates deposited in the PDB are listed here. The VL-VH rotatio
n angle upon binding (Stan®eld et al., 1993) was calculated for Fabs where full coordi￾nates of both the free (unliganded) and antigen-bound structures are available. VL and VH, variable domain of heavy and light chain of Fab: Ag, antigen; HEL, hen egg lysozyme; PEL, pheasant
egg lysozyme; BEL, bobwhite quail egg white lysozyme; GEL, guineafowl egg white lysozyme; N9, N9 neuraminidase; HPr, histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein.what relationship these factors have to the differ￾ence in the intermodule angles.
Conformational changes in Fab 5G9 upon TF
antigen binding
The elbow angle of Fab 5G9 in the TF5G9 com￾plex (129) is close to that of the unliganded Fab
(133) at the lower end of those observed in Fab
structures (127 to 227, Wilson & Stan®eld, 1994).
A comparison of all 428 Ca atoms between free
and bound Fab 5G9 gives an r.m.s.d. of 0.72 AÊ .
The corresponding r.m.s. difference for the Ca
atoms of the CDR loops is 0.64 AÊ , comparable to
the overall r.m.s. difference for all Ca atoms and,
thus, indicates that the overall structure, as well as
the combining site, of the free and bound Fab 5G9
is similar (Figure 4). The largest Ca atom shifts in
the CDR loops upon complex formation are in
CDR L3 residues GlyL92 (1.5 AÊ ) and AsnL93
(1.8 AÊ ).
Despite these small overall shifts in the CDR
loops, some differences appear signi®cant
(Figure 4). The light chain CDRs have slightly lar￾ger Ca r.m.s. deviations (0.79 AÊ ) than those of the
heavy chain (0.52 AÊ ). The individual CDRs have
r.m.s. deviations of 0.80 AÊ , 0.65 AÊ , 0.87 AÊ , 0.16 AÊ ,
0.47 AÊ , and 0.75 AÊ for L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, and H3,
respectively. The shifts of L1 and L3 loops are
small, but larger than the overall r.m.s.d. values of
the 5G9 light chain. In addition, a 30 swing of the
TyrH98 side-chain is critical for making two hydro￾gen bonds to the TF main-chain carbonyl oxygen
of Lys149 and the side-chain amide group of
Asn171 (Figure 5).
Stan®eld et al. (1993) have observed a substantial
rotation (16) of the variable heavy (VH) chain rela￾tive to the variable light (VL) chain in Fab 50.1-pep￾tide complex. They also proposed that this VL±VH
rotation is related to the length of CDR H3 loop
and the size of the buried surface area at the
VL±VH interface. The availability of both free and
TF-bound 5G9 allows us to calculate the Fab 5G9
VL±VH rotation angle upon antigen binding. Fab
5G9 has a relatively large VL±VH interface
(1439 AÊ 2
) compared with the smallest observed so
far for Fab 50.1 (1063 AÊ 2
; Stan®eld et al., 1993;
Table 2). Upon TF antigen binding, Fab 5G9 under￾goes only a small VL±VH rotation (2.8), that is
similar to that seen in other Fab-protein complexes
(Table 2).
Antibody-antigen interactions
The six CDRs of Fab 5G9 form a large and some￾what concave surface. The tips of the CDRs are all
approximately in the same plane with a small
depression between VL and VH particularly on the
VH side (Figure 1). From these CDRs, 19 residues
interact with 18 antigen residues from four of the
six b strands (C0
, C, F and G) of TFs D2 module
(Figure 6). The TF epitope consists of
C-strand residues Lys149, Ile152, Thr154, Tyr156,
C0
-strand residues Lys165, Lys166, Thr167, Ala168,
Lys169, Thr170, Asn171, F-strand residues Gln190,
Val192, Pro194, and G-strand residues Val198,
Arg200, Lys201, Asp204 (Table 3).
The interacting surfaces of TF and Fab 5G9
(Figure 7) have a good shape and charge comple￾mentarity, a feature observed in other antibody￾protein antigen systems and a recurrent feature of
antibody-antigen recognition (Davies et al., 1990;
Wilson et al., 1991a,b; Wilson & Stan®eld, 1993,
1994; Padlan, 1994; Webster et al., 1994; Davies &
Cohen, 1996). The surface areas buried on TF and
Fab 5G9 as a result of the complex formation are
891 AÊ 2 and 923 AÊ 2 (Table 2), respectively, as calcu￾lated by program MS with a 1.7 AÊ probe
(Connolly, 1983), which is one of the largest anti￾body-antigen interaction surfaces seen so far
(observed range for protein antigens and Fabs are
538 to 901 AÊ 2 and 556 to 982 AÊ 2
, respectively, see
Table 2).
The framework residues of the antibody usually
contribute only a very small surface area to antigen
binding (Wilson & Stan®eld, 1994), as seen here
Figure 5. Interaction of TF C0
-strand with Fab 5G9. Residue Lys169 of TF C0
-strand (magenta) is accommodated in a
pocket between the Fab CDRs L3 and H3 (magenta). The unliganded Fab 5G9 L3 and H3 CDR loops are shown in
green and were superimposed on the liganded structure through the framework residues. The subtle movement of
5G9 H3 and L3 loops in the bound form allows formation of six hydrogen bonds with TF.
880 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complexwith only 5% of the total contact area (Table 2).
The heavy chain accounts for 67% of the total anti￾body-antigen contact surface, whereas the light
chain only contributes 33%. This skewed percen￾tage of contact area for the light chain is at the
lower end of the observed range for known anti￾body-protein complexes (ranging from 21% for Fv
E5.2 to 49% for Fab HyHEL-5, Table 2), and closer
to those seen in antibody-peptide or antibody-hap￾ten complexes (10% to 40%; Wilson & Stan®eld,
1994). The light chain makes 32 contacts (eight, six,
and 18 for L1, L2, and L3, respectively) to the anti￾gen, whereas the heavy chain contributes 109 of
the total 141 contacts (47, 39, 23 for H1, H2, and
H3, respectively). A total of 15 hydrogen bonds
(ten VH, ®ve VL) occurs between TF and 5G9 with
two main-chain ±main-chain hydrogen bonds from
Thr167 O ±SerL94 N (L3) and Lys169 N ±GlyL92 O

The numbers listed here include hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and van der Waals interactions (less than 3.9 AÊ between the epitope
residues of TF and Fab 5G9's CDR residues, in Kabat and Wu numbering: Kabat et al., 1991). a Indicates one hydrogen bond is made.
b Indicates two hydrogen bonds are made. The Table was calculated by HBPLUS (McDonald & Thornton, 1994).
Figure 7. An ``open-book'' (along the yellow line) represention of the contact surfaces of the TF5G9 complex shows
the charge and shape complementarity between Fab 5G9 (right) and antigen TF (left). The surface was color-coded
from blue to red for positive and negative charge. The interacting surface of the TF D2 module is positively charged
(K166, K169, R200, K201), whereas the antibody generally has complementary negatively charged residues (D95H,
E93L, D52H). The charge distribution was calculated by GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991).
882 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex(L3) (Tables 3 and 5), which is typical (six to 17,
Davies & Cohen, 1996) for antibody-protein com￾plexes.
The TF epitope residues can be grouped into
four linear polypeptide segments (Table 3 and
Figure 6). The C-strand residues 149 to 156 only
interact with 5G9 VH and account for approxi￾mately 20% of the total van der Waals contacts (28)
and buried surface area (165 AÊ 2
). On the other
hand, residues 165 to 171 of the C0
-strand segment
interact primarily with 5G9 VL, with seven hydro￾gen bonds, four of which involve TF main-chain
atoms. Indeed, the CDR L3 loop resembles a short
antiparallel b-strand interacting with the TF C0
-
strand and extending the C0
, C, F, G b-sheet of TF
(Figure 6). This TF segment accounts for 30 to 39%
of all interactions in terms of van der Waals con￾tacts (43) and buried surface area (330 AÊ 2
). Resi￾dues 200 to 204 of strand G contribute 22 to 32% of
total interactions (45) and buried surface area
(201 AÊ 2
). Strand F has fewer interactions (17% of
total) for residues 190 to 198 (25 van der Waals
contacts and 153 AÊ 2 of buried surface) with Fab
5G9.
Although many TF residues are involved in the
TF5G9 interactions, a few key residues (Novotny
et al., 1989) can be identi®ed based on the current
TF5G9 structure. Tyr156 of the TF C-strand makes
12 contacts with the heavy chain of Fab 5G9,
which include one hydrogen bond between its
side-chain OH and AspH52 Od
2 of CDR H2
(Tables 3 and 5). This residue uses one third of its
side-chain surface (60.0 AÊ 2 out of total 187 AÊ 2
;
Table 4; Miller et al., 1987) to interact with Fab
5G9. Another key TF epitope residue is Lys169 in
the C0
-strand, which is deeply buried in a pocket
formed by CDR loops L1, L3 and H3. The contact
area between Lys169 and 5G9 is 101 AÊ 2 (78 AÊ 2
from the side-chain), which is almost one-half of
the total surface area of a lysine residue (211 AÊ 2

The number of van der Waals contacts for each TF residue is taken from Table 3. The contact surface areas (AÊ 2
) for
side-chain and main-chain atoms of TF epitope residues are calculated by the program MS (Connolly, 1983) with a
1.7 AÊ probe radius (Gelin & Karplus, 1979). The total contact surface areas are zero for other TF residues not listed
here. The right side of the Table shows the Ki values for the inhibition of the mutant TFVIIa complex by 5G9. The Ki
for inhibition of wild-type TFVIIa complex on factor X activation by Fab 5G9 is 3.4(0.3)  10ÿ9 M; corresponding to
a G of ÿ11.5 kcal/mol. G is the difference between G values of TF mutants and wild-type TF
(Gmutant ÿ Gwild-type). The standard errors shown are from three independent measurements. The number of van der
Waals contacts were taken from Table 3.
Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex 883                 Miller et al., 1987). This interaction involves six van
der Waals contacts and three main-chain and side￾chain hydrogen bonds (Figures 5 and 6; Table 5).
Two basic TF residues, Arg200 and Lys201, also
appear to play a key role in antibody binding.
These two residues alone contribute 140 AÊ 2 (mostly
from their side-chains, Table 4) of the total 891 AÊ 2
antigen contact surface area, and make 36 out of
the total 141 antibody-antigen contacts (Table 3).
Their side-chains form four hydrogen bonds with
the 5G9 heavy chain (Figure 6), three of which are
with 5G9 main-chain atoms and one with an acidic
side-chain, AspH52, from CDR H2 which becomes
completely buried in the interface. Hydrogen
bonds between charged groups have been pro￾posed (Fersht et al., 1985) to be stronger (4.5 kcal/
mol) than regular hydrogen bonds (two to three
kcal/mol). In a study of the HyHEL-5-HEL com￾plex (Chacko et al., 1995), a 1000-fold reduction in
the binding constant of a lysozyme mutant (R68K)
was ascribed mainly to the loss of only one anti￾body-antigen charged hydrogen bond. Thus, the
large contact area and the polar hydrogen bonds
between TF Arg200 and Lys201 and Fab 5G9, plus
a good charge complementarity (Figure 7), implies
that Arg200 and Lys201 are critical residues for
antibody 5G9 recognition.
All these key residues (Tyr156, Lys169, Arg200,
and Lys201) are quite polar. In fact, the whole TF￾5G9 interface is polar and hydrophilic in nature
(Table 3), in contrast to typical mutimeric proteins,
which usually have hydrophobic interfaces (Jones
& Thornton, 1996).
Water molecules have now been recognized as
playing an important role in the antibody-antigen
interface (Bhat et al., 1994; Wilson & Stan®eld,
1994; Cohen et al., 1996). The TF5G9 model does
not include any water molecules due to the moder￾ate resolution of the structure determination. Only
three small cavities are found in the antibody-anti￾gen interface that are primarily apolar and hydro￾phobic. The largest cavity lies between TF Thr154
and the CDR H1 and H2 loops with a volume of
36 AÊ 3
. Although this cavity analysis is based on
the 3 AÊ complex structure, it seems to disfavor a
major role for water molecules in this antibody￾antigen interface. However, no conclusive asser￾tions can be made until a higher resolution struc￾ture of the complex is obtained.
Comparison of mutagenesis data with the
TF5G9 structure
In many cases, protein-protein interactions are
dominated by only a few ``hot spot'' residues
(Novotny et al., 1989; Covell & Wallqvist, 1997).
Some examples are human growth factor ±human
growth factor receptor complex (Clackson & Wells,
1995; Wells, 1996), NC41 Fab±N9 in¯uenza virus
neuraminidase (Nuss et al., 1993), and barnase-bar￾star (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993). An analysis of the
barnase-barstar interface (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995)
by single mutations and double mutant cycles
(Carter et al., 1984; for a recent review, see
Horovitz, 1996) has identi®ed two strong inter￾actions (with coupling energies of more than
3.0 kcal/mol) that had not been noted previously
from examination of the crystal structure as the
interacting distances were greater than 4.4 AÊ . The
authors conclude that an interaction cannot simply
be assessed by distance alone. On the other hand,
a recent calculation of protein-protein binding free
energy (Covell & Wallqvist, 1997), based on
changes in buried surface area due to residue-resi￾due contacts and nearby crystallographic water
molecules (Wallqvist & Covell, 1996) has found
that all the interactions identi®ed by double
mutant cycles in the barnase-barstar system can be
fully accounted for by considering water molecules
in the barnase-barstar interface. More studies are
needed to address these important issues.
A panel of TF mutants (some of them are mul￾tiple point mutants) were prepared during our
TF5G9 crystal structure study. We measured the
binding constants of these mutants with 5G9 anti￾body, and compared the results with the structural

884 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complexdata (Tables 3 and 4). Surprisingly, at ®rst glance,
a group of TF mutants, K165A/K166A and Y157A,
have apparent inhibition constants (Ki
) that are
lower (i.e. stronger binding to Fab 5G9) than that
of wild-type TF (3.4(  0.3)  10ÿ9 M; Ruf &
Edgington, 1994). Fab 5G9 is a competitive inhibi￾tor of factor X binding to the TFVIIa complex. The
TF5G9 binding was measured indirectly through
5G9's competition with factor X for TFVIIa bind￾ing (see also Materials and Methods). Since Lys165
and Lys166 of TF are critical residues for substrate
factor X association (Ruf et al., 1992a), the decrease
in Ki for these mutants is likely to result from less
ef®cient competition by factor X for these mutants
under the experimental conditions. The importance
of residue Tyr157, which lies underneath Lys165
and Lys166, is indirect and is likely due to its role
in positioning these lysine residues. However, we
cannot entirely exclude the possibility that the
removal of these side-chains of TF by Ala
mutations actually increases the free energy of
binding between TF and 5G9.
A strong and qualitative correlation between
structural data (number of van der Waals contacts
and contact surface area) and Ki is observed for the
mutants of key TF epitope residues (Table 4,
Figure 8). Mutation of any of these residues pro￾foundly diminishes the binding between TF and
5G9, and disrupts 5G9's ability to inhibit TFVIIa
complex formation. Mutation of TF Tyr156 to
alanine results in an increase of the Ki to
2.1  10ÿ6 M, that corresponds to more than
4.0 kcal/mol reduction of binding free energy.
A double mutation of critical residues Arg200 and
Lys201 to alanine also reduces the TF5G9 binding
af®nity by at least 4.0 kcal/mol. Likewise, a triple
mutation of K169A/N171A/N173A results in a
large G (Gmutant ÿ Gwild-type) over the wild￾type (>4.0 kcal/mol). Lys169 appears to be the
most important of these three residues, as it has
the largest contact area (101 AÊ 2
) with Fab 5G9
among these three residues (Table 4).
A double mutation of Ser195 and Arg196 of TF
to alanine leads to a large reduction of binding
energy (>4.0 kcal/mol); there are no interactions
between these residues and Fab 5G9. It seems that
the effect of these two residues is not from direct
interactions, but rather from the local structural/
hydration rearrangements of the alanine replace￾ments. The crystal structure of TF shows that
Ser195, Arg196, Asn199, Arg200, and Lys201 are in
a loop linking b-strands F and G; the loop confor￾mation appears to be stabilized by the Arg196 gua￾nidinium side-chain that is deeply buried in a
pocket formed by Asn105, Phe147 and Glu199.
Mutational deletion of Arg196 may alter the con￾formation of the loop, displace the key interacting
residues Arg200 and Lys201, and thus abolish the
recognition of TF by Fab 5G9. A similar argument
could be used to explain the effect of mutation on
Asn199, which has little side-chain (0.4 AÊ 2
) inter￾action with 5G9 but has a measurable effect on
5G9 binding (G of 1.1 kcal/mol) upon alanine
replacement.
Figure 8. Space-®lling model of the surface of the D2 module of TF. Shown in pale-blue are TF residues that are in
contact with Fab 5G9 (Table 3). Other contact residues are those that have been mutated and color-coded according
to the loss of binding free energy upon alanine substitution: red, more than 4 kcal/mol; yellow, 1 to 4 kcal/mol;
green, less than 1 kcal/mol.
Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex 885  TF Lys149 hydrogen-bonds to the 5G9 CDR H3
loop through its main-chain carbonyl oxygen. Fab
5G9 inhibits the double mutant K149A/D150A,
with a slightly increased Ki of 2.5(0.42)  10ÿ8 M
(corresponding to a G of 1.2 kcal/mol).
Mutations of other C0
-strand residues of TF (T167A
and T170A mutants) have only unmeasurable or
small effects on TFVIIa inhibition (G of 0.0
and 1.0 kcal/mol, respectively), which is readily
explained by the TF5G9 structure. The TF C0
-
strand uses mostly its main-chain atoms to make
hydrogen bonds with Fab 5G9's light chain (four
out of ®ve hydrogen bonds, Table 5), with the only
exception being the side-chain of the key Lys169
residue. These data imply that Fab 5G9's inter￾action with the TF C0
-strand is largely speci®ed by
TF main-chain atoms.
In conclusion, our crystal structure of TF5G9
and the mutational study showed that four
(Tyr156, Lys169, Arg200, Lys201) out of 18 TF epi￾tope residues have a major contribution (>4 kcal/
mol) to the 5G9 antibody recognition. Three other
residues (Lys149, Thr170, Leu176) have some effect
(1 kcal/mol) on antibody-antigen interaction.
Thus, despite our limited TF mutational study on
only a subset of the observed 5G9-interacting resi￾dues, a generally good correlation between the
binding energy and the structural data, which
includes van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bond￾ing, buried surface, and the charge and shape com￾plementarity (Tables 3 and 4), can be seen.
However, the current crystal structure cannot com￾pletely explain all of the mutational results,
especially for those mutants which have relatively
minor effects on 5G9 binding. For example, while
Leu176 of TF barely interacts with Fab 5G9 (side￾chain contact area of 2.0 AÊ 2
), its mutation to ala￾nine causes a measurable reduction on Fab 5G9
binding (G of 1.0 kcal/mol).
Inhibitory mechanisms of Fab 5G9
The structure of the TF5G9 complex also offers
insights into 5G9's inhibition of binding of factors
IX or X to TF. As 5G9 antibody can bind to the pre￾formed TFVIIa complex (Ruf & Edgington, 1991),
the 5G9 antibody epitope and the VIIaTF interface
are inferred to be non-overlapping. The TFVIIa
structure (Banner et al., 1996) shows that the epi￾dermal growth factor-like modules and the pro￾tease module of VIIa are located some distance
from the antibody epitope. The only potential over￾lap would come from the VIIa Gla-module which
binds to the D2 module of TF. Positioning the Gla￾module of the TFVIIa crystal structure (Banner
et al., 1996; PDB code 1dan) onto our TF5G9 struc￾ture (Figure 9) by superimposing the D2-modules
of TF in the two complex structures shows close
proximity but no overlap between Fab 5G9 and the
Gla module of VIIa. Lys165 and Lys166 of TF, that
are the key residues for macromolecular substrate
factor X binding to the TFVIIa complex (Ruf et al.,
1992a), are within the TF interface with Fab 5G9.
Hence, clear overlap exists on the TF surface
between the Fab 5G9 recognition site and the pro￾posed binding site for factor X (Lys165 and
Lys166). Fab 5G9 then must act as a direct compe￾titor for factor X substrate binding, which con®rms
the previous conclusions from kinetic studies (Ruf
& Edgington, 1991).
It is noteworthy that the Gla module of VIIa also
plays an important role in the recognition of
macromolecular substrates (Ruf et al., 1991a).
Hence, both the VIIa Gla module and the adjacent
regions of TF may be the recognition surfaces for
factor X in formation of the transient ternary
TFVIIaX complex. The proximity of Fab 5G9 to
VIIa (Figure 9) implies that binding of 5G9 to TF is
also likely to hinder sterically the docking of factor
X substrate to the VIIa Gla-module, or to restrict
conformational ¯exibility of the Gla-module and
affect factor X substrate assembly or product
release. The potent inhibitory mechanism of Fab
5G9 is, therefore, best rationalized by the occu￾pancy of a surface-exposed recognition site that
plays a central role in the assembly of the
TFVIIaX transient ternary complex. A de®nite
answer to this inhibitory mechanism requires a
crystal structure of the TFVIIaX ternary complex.
Materials and Methods
Crystallization and data collection (Tables 1 and 6)
Sitting-drop techniques (Stura et al., 1992) were used
in all crystallization experiments. Protein solutions
(2.5 ml) were mixed with 2.5 ml precipitant solutions; the
Figure 9. Binding of Fab 5G9 to TF does not inhibit
binding of factor VIIa. The Gla-module of VIIa in the
TFVIIa complex structure (cyan, from PDB code 1dan;
Banner et al., 1996), positioned by superimposing the TF
D2 modules of the 1dan structure to that of the TF5G9
structure, does not overlap with the epitope of Fab 5G9
(in green) in the TF D2 module which is in CPK rep￾resentation. Shown in gray are carbon atoms, red for
oxygen atoms, blue for nitrogen atoms and yellow for
sulfur atoms. Some selected residues of 5G9 and Gla￾module are labeled to clarify the orientation.
886 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex mixed solution was then allowed to equilibrate at 18C
over 1 ml of precipitant solution. X-ray diffraction data
were collected on either of two Siemens multiwire area
detectors in our laboratory using CuKa radiation from an
Elliott GX-18 rotating anode generator with a 100 mm
focal cup, operating at 40 kV and 55 mA, or a Siemens
rotation anode generator with a 300 m focal spot, operat￾ing at 50 mA, 80 kV, with Franks focusing mirrors
(Harrison, 1968) and a helium cone to reduce back￾ground scattering. Diffraction data were processed with
the XENGEN program package (Howard et al., 1987).
Expression and crystallization of tissue factor
The extracellular domain of human TF, consisting of
residues 1 to 218, was over-expressed in inclusion bodies
in E. coli and refolded in vitro as described (Stone et al.,
1995). TF crystals can be routinely grown from 20 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), at a 40 mg/ml protein con￾centration. The ®rst diffraction quality crystals were
actually crystallized, unexpectedly, in two days from an
NMR tube containing approximately 3.5 mM uniformly
15N-enriched (99 atom%) TF (at 85 mg/ml) in 20 mM
KNa2PO4, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 10% (v/v) 2
H2O and 90%
(v/v) H2O (pH 7.0) at 5C. Clusters of the shiny TF
extracellular domain crystals in the NMR tube were har￾vested, separated into individual crystals, and stored in
a 10% (w/v) 10 K polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution in
a constant temperature incubator at 22C. The crystals
were stable in this solution for over a year, as judged by
their X-ray diffraction. The TF crystals have a typical size
of 0.5 mm  0.2 mm  0.3 mm, and are space group
P212121 with cell parameters of a  64.4 AÊ , b  85.8 AÊ ,
c  112.9 AÊ . The Matthews (1968) coef®cient (Vm) is
2.9 AÊ 3
/Dalton, assuming the asymmetric unit contains
two molecules, and corresponds to a solvent content of
55%.
Crystallization of Fab 5G9
The production, puri®cation, and crystallization of
Fab 5G9 have been described (Ruf et al., 1992b). Two
slightly different crystal forms of Fab 5G9 were obtained
using 17.5% PEG 10 K at pH 8.5 and 1.35 M sodium
citrate at pH 5.5 as precipitants, and protein concen￾trations of 16 mg/ml and 23 mg/ml, respectively. Both
crystal forms are orthorhombic, P212121, with typical
sizes of 0.5 mm  0.4 mm  0.3 mm (citrate form) and
0.6 mm  0.35 mm  0.2 mm (PEG form), with slightly
different cell parameters of a  89.1 AÊ , b  90.5 AÊ ,
c  59.3 AÊ (citrate) and a  91.6 AÊ , b  93.7 AÊ , c  60.7 AÊ
(PEG). Diffraction data from both crystal forms have
been collected to 2.4 AÊ . Only the crystal structure of PEG
crystal form is reported here. The PEG crystal form con￾tains one Fab molecule in the asymmetric unit and has a
Matthews coef®cient (Matthews, 1968) of 2.4 AÊ 3
/Dalton
with a solvent content of 46%.
Production, purification and crystallization of
TF5G9 complex
Crystals of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-expressed
TF (Ruf et al., 1992b) complexed with Fab 5G9 were
grown in 1.7 to 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium
citrate (pH 5.0 to 5.5), 0.2% 2-methyl-2,4-pentane diol
(MPD), and 2% PEG 600 at an equal 5G9:TF molar
ratio. The crystals grew extremely slowly, taking six to
nine months to reach a maximal size of
0.4 mm  0.4 mm  0.8 mm. The crystals are monocli￾nic, P2, with unit cell parameters a  142.3 AÊ , b  73.3 AÊ ,
c  115.9 AÊ and b  90.9. The Vm is 3.7 AÊ 3
/Dalton
based on two TF5G9 complex molecules in the asym￾metric unit, with a solvent content of 64%.
Structure determination and
crystallographic refinement
Fab 5G9
The 5G9 structure was determined by the molecular
replacement (MR) method using X-PLOR (BruÈ nger,
1992b) and MERLOT (Fitzgerald, 1988) software
packages. The McPC603 (PDB code 1mcp, Satow et al.,
1986) and HyHEL-5 (PDB code 3hfm, Cohen et al., 1996;
Sheriff et al., 1987) Fabs were used as MR search models
due to their high sequence similarity to Fab 5G9. Of
these two models, HyHEL-5 has the highest amino acid
identity (82%) in both heavy and light chains, whereas
McPC603 has 80% sequence identity in the light chain,
but only 40% in the heavy chain. The McPC603, how￾ever, gave the best Crowther rotation function for the
``whole'' Fab model using MERLOT. The relative orien￾tation of the variable and constant domains of 5G9 was
then re®ned by the PC-re®nement algorithm of X-PLOR
(BruÈ nger et al., 1987). The X-PLOR package was also
used to solve the translation function and to re®ne Fab
5G9 model using the slow cooling protocol (BruÈ nger
et al., 1990). Several cycles of re®nement and model
building with 10% OMIT maps were carried out using
FRODO (Jones, 1978, 1982). The Fab 5G9 coordinates
have been deposited in the PDB with code 1fgn.
Tissue factor
The initial structure determination of the extracellular
domain of TF was attempted by multiple isomorphous
replacement (MIR) since no TF structure was available at
that time. The TF crystals from the NMR tube were quite
sensitive to ionic strength; the crystals crack even in
50 mM salt. A no-salt medium (10% PEG 10 K) was,
therefore, chosen as the soaking mother liquor. The pH
values of the heavy atom solutions were carefully
adjusted to the required value (pH 7) by addition of
small amounts of NaOH and HCl solutions. After an
extensive heavy atom screening of 30 possible deriva￾tives, samarium chloride (SmCl3), platinum(II) 2,20
,60
,20
-
terpyridine chloride (Pt(terpy)Cl), and trimethyllead
acetate ((CH3)3PbOAc) gave reasonable isomorphism
and good quality Patterson maps (Table 6). For the
SmCl3 derivative crystal, both isomorphous and anoma￾lous data were carefully collected. It is worthwhile to
note that, after soaking in the SmCl3 solution, the TF
crystals were seriously etched, lost their shiny surface
and sharp edges and became more like rugged balls. The
crystals, however, still retained a strong birefringence
and diffracted reasonably well.
The XtalView 2.0 package (McRee, 1992) was used to
merge derivative and native data and to calculate differ￾ence Patterson maps. Among the three derivatives,
SmCl3 had the best isomorphism. The isomorphous Pat￾terson map was readily solved by hand, and con®rmed
by analysis of the anomalous Patterson map. Phases
from the SmCl3 derivative were used to cross-phase the
other two derivatives in order to determine their heavy
atom positions. The PHASES program package (Furey &
Swaminathan, 1990, 1997) was used to reject outliers
from the merged re¯ection data, to re®ne the derivatives,
Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex 887        and to calculate ®nal phases. All heavy atom sites were
con®rmed to be signi®cant by criteria that included ®t to
difference Patterson maps, reasonable occupancies, and
proper re®nement behavior. The ®nal ®gure of merit
was 0.471 for 7181 phased re¯ections up to 3.6 AÊ (see
Table 1). The relative phasing power (FH/e) of the ®nal
MIRAS phases showed the SmCl3 derivative was stron￾gest with 1.66 and 1.07 for isomorphous and anomalous
data, respectively, whereas the other two derivatives had
lower phasing powers of 0.98 (to 4.5 AÊ ) for the
Pb(CH3)3OAc derivative and 1.03 (to 5.5 AÊ ) for the
Pt(terpy)Cl derivative, which was consistent with weaker
peaks in the difference Patterson maps. These two
derivatives were included because they contributed to
the data completeness for phased re¯ections in the low
resolution range, which was important for the automatic
solvent mask generation in the solvent ¯attening pro￾cess.
The combined phases from these three derivatives
were then solvent ¯attened (Wang, 1985) with the
PHASES package using a solvent content of 45%, which
is smaller than that estimated by the Matthews coef®-
cient, to avoid ¯attening the protein molecule. The elec￾tron density map after solvent ¯attening showed a clear
molecule/solvent boundary and some continuous den￾sity, but the overall quality was not suf®cient for an
unambiguous trace of the molecule (Figure 10). Further
solvent ¯attening, histogram matching, and averaging
methods using DM of CCP4 (Cowtan, 1994) were
applied to the MIRAS phases using the molecular mask
and symmetry operators that relate the two TF molecules
in the asymmetric unit. The MIRAS phases were greatly
improved as judged by the drop of Rfree from 0.573 to
0.363 in the 15 to 3.6 AÊ range, the overall increase in the
mean ®gure of merit (FOM) from 0.48 to 0.79, and a sub￾stantial improvement in the quality and interpretability
of the maps. A portion of the MIRAS map at 3.6 AÊ at
various stages of density modi®cation is shown in
Figure 10.
Two TF crystal structures from two different labora￾tories (Harlos et al., 1994; Muller et al., 1994) were pub￾lished during our heavy atom screening, and the Ca
coordinates of the 1boy TF structure became available to
us from Dr C. W. G. Boys. A backbone model of TF was
constructed using SYBYL (TRIPOS Associates Inc., 1992)
from these Ca coordinates, and the side-chains added by
the MODELLER program (Sali & Overington, 1994).
After eliminating unreasonable repulsions by hand, the
model was energy minimized to give a starting model
for molecular replacement. A rotation function solution
for one TF molecule was quite clear from both the real
space search of X-PLOR (Huber, 1985) and the reciprocal
space search by AMoRe (Navaza, 1994, implemented in
the CCP4 Suite, CCP4, 1994); the highest peak of 16.2s
intensity in the AMoRe 3.5 to 8 AÊ search was 4.6s above
the next peak. The correctly rotated TF model was posi￾tioned into the unit cell by the phased translation func￾tion (Read & Schierbeek, 1988) using the MIRAS phases.
The phased translation function gave a strongest solution
with a peak height of 18.3s for the ®rst TF molecule,

888 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their ComplexFigure 10 (legend opposite)which was 13.2s higher than the next peak. The
rotational peak for the second molecule in the asym￾metric unit was buried in the noise level (sixth strongest
peak in the AMoRe 3.5 to 8 AÊ search). The current sol￾ution was actually not identi®ed until a later stage from
a partial T2 translational function search, which took
advantage of the ®rst TF molecule being correctly posi￾tioned. The phased translation function of this TF orien￾tation gave a peak of 11.3s, which was 6.8s higher than
the next peak.
Rfree cross validation (BruÈ nger, 1992a), based on a 10%
randomly omitted data set, was used throughout the
re®nement. The relative orientations of the TF molecules
and their D1 and D2 modules were re®ned by the rigid
body re®nement protocol in X-PLOR, leading to a drop
in R-value from 41.8% to 37.0% and the Rfree from 41.6%
to 37.0% for data in the 15 to 4 AÊ range. The next stage
of re®nement and model building used 2Fo ÿ Fc shake
OMIT maps (McRee, 1993), generated with a random
error (0.25 AÊ ) added to the model. The crystal diffrac￾tion was found to be highly anisotropic with greater
decay along the crystallographic c* axis than along the a*
and b* axes. An overall anisotropic B-value (6.8, 4.5,
ÿ11.3 AÊ 2
), estimated from X-PLOR, was applied to the
data set to correct the anisotropy. Prominent peaks in
Fo ÿ Fc maps and 2Fo ÿ Fc maps were picked and scruti￾nized against their neighboring atoms to select for
chemically reasonable water molecules. The TF coordi￾nates have been deposited in the PDB with code 1tfh.
TF5G9 complex
The molecular replacement method was used to pos￾ition both the TF and Fab 5G9. The orientation and trans￾lation of 5G9 was relatively straightforward since we
had a ``perfect'' Fab model from the 5G9 structure deter￾mination. The molecular replacement of TF, however,
turned out to be dif®cult, even though the search model
was quite close to the ®nal model. No obvious rotation
function solutions could be identi®ed by using either the
entire TF or separate D1 or D2 modules as MR models,
despite enormous searching windows (different models,
integration radii and resolution ranges) and extensive
use of many search algorithms, which included recipro￾cal space search by ALMN and AMoRe (Navaza, 1994)
of CCP4, real space search (Huber, 1985) and direct
rotation search (DeLand & BruÈ nger, 1995) as
implemented in X-PLOR. This dif®culty was assumed to
stem from similarity in the topology and overall three￾dimensional structures of the TF modules and the Fab
domains (particularly with the constant domains).
Indeed, by simply subtracting the amplitudes corre￾sponding to the Fab component from the observed
amplitudes using the following formula (where K is the
scaling factor);

we were able to identify the correct rotation solution for
the D2 module of both independent TFs by X-PLOR's
rotation function and PC re®nement using the modi®ed
experimental amplitudes in the range of 15 to 5 AÊ . The
correct solution was still not the strongest peak in
X-PLOR's PC re®ned list (number six on the list). How￾ever, a solution was identi®ed by running the partial T2
translation function, in which the positions of Fab 5G9
were ®xed, on the ®rst 50 X-PLOR rotation function sol￾utions. The D1 module of the TF was then placed into
the cell assuming a similar intermodule angle between
D1 and D2 as that of unliganded TF; no steric clashes
resulted with neighboring molecules in the cell. The
second TF molecule of the complex was generated using
the known NCS relationship between the two 5G9 mol￾ecules. It is worthwhile to point out that the TF D2
search model used in this aspect of the molecular repla￾cement accounts for only approximately 8% of the
scattering atoms in the asymmetric unit, which demon￾strates the effectiveness of the subtraction method.
Zhang & Matthews (1994) have previously elaborated
on a similar addition/subtraction strategy to enhance
the molecular replacement method.
Before re®nement, 889 re¯ections (2.5% of the total
34,656 I > sI re¯ections) were set aside for calculating
Rfree and monitoring the re®nement process. The relative
orientation of the six domains (VH, VL, CL, CH1 of 5G9
and D1, D2 of TF) were re®ned by X-PLOR's rigid body
re®nement protocols in 15 to 6 AÊ and 15 to 4 AÊ resol￾ution ranges; no noticeable domain movements were
observed. After the initial slow-cool re®nement, the
resulting 2Fo ÿ Fc map was averaged by the RAVE pro￾gram suite (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994b), with the molecu￾lar mask generated by the MAMA program (Kleywegt &
Jones, 1993). The NCS matrix was derived from the mol￾ecular replacement models by the lsq_explicit command
of the O program (Jones et al., 1991), and was re®ned
against the 2Fo ÿ Fc map to give a correlation coef®cient
of 0.70. The models were rebuilt according to a twofold
averaged map generated by RAVE and re®ned by
X-PLOR. From this point on, only the ®rst TF5G9 mol￾ecule was re®ned and the second molecule was gener￾ated by the NCS matrix through X-PLOR's NCS strict
statement. This procedure doubled the ratio of observed
re¯ections to re®nement parameters to a value of 1.9.
The B-values of the model were re®ned by groups (two
per residue), and were reset to 20 AÊ 2 before re®nement.
After several cycles of positional re®nement and model
building against shake OMIT maps, an R-value of 24.9%
(I > sI data) was obtained between 7.0 AÊ and 3.0 AÊ with
an Rfree of 28.1%. The model at this stage had reasonable
stereochemistry (r.m.s.d. of 0.010 AÊ and 2.1 for bond
lengths and bond angles, respectively), phi  psi distri￾bution (73.1 residues in most favorable regions), and
real-space ®t of the overall atoms to the 2Fo ÿ Fc map
(overall correlation coef®cient of 0.80). The NCS con￾straints were relaxed to NCS restraints with an Rfree
optimized force constant of 20 kcal/(molAÊ 2
) for main￾chain atoms and 10 kcal/(molAÊ 2
) for all other non￾hydrogen atoms; the R-value then dropped to 20.6%
(I > sI data, or 24.6% for all data). This reduction in
R-value, although accompanied by an increase in the
number of the re®nement parameters due to the relax￾ation of NCS constraints, was validated by a reduction
in Rfree from 28.1% to 27.6%. The release of NCS-con￾straints to NCS-restraints does not have any major effect
on the overall structure as can be seen from the rela￾tively small r.m.s. deviations between NCS-restraint and
NCS-constraint models (0.23 AÊ each for the 196 Ca and
58 CDR Ca atoms). The TF5G9 coordinates have been
deposited in the PDB with code 1ahw.
Structure analyses
The r.m.s.d. of the CDR loops between the free and
TF-bound Fab 5G9 were calculated after superimposing
their respective framework residues of the variable
domain (light chain VL 1 to 23, 35 to 49, 57 to 88, 98 to
107, and heavy chain VH 1 to 30, 36 to 49, 67 to 98, 107
to 117) by LSQKAB (Kabsch, 1976). All residues are in
890 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their ComplexKabat-Wu numbering (Kabat et al., 1991). Ramachandran
plots were calculated by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al.,
1993), buried surface areas with the program MS
(Connolly, 1983) with a 1.7 AÊ probe radius (Gelin &
Karplus, 1979) and standard van der Waals radii (Case
& Karplus, 1979) with water molecules excluded from
the calculation, and hydrogen bonds and van der Waals
contacts by HBPLUS (McDonald & Thornton, 1994).
To calculate the intermodule angle of the TF structure,
the D1 and D2 modules were ®rst superimposed by the
lsq_explicit command of O program (Jones et al., 1991)
using the following residues pairs: D1 11 ± 17, D2 112 ±
118; D1 21 ± 26, D2 123 ± 128; D1 33 ± 39, D2 151 ± 157; D1
46 ± 51, D2 166 ± 171; D1 55 ± 59, D2 173 ± 177; D1 70 ± 76,
D2 186 ± 192; D1 93 ± 99, D2 201 ± 207, which gives the
lowest r.m.s.d. between these two sets of Ca atoms. The
angle was then retrieved from the trace of the overlap
matrix.
Effect of TF mutations on the Ki for inhibition of
TFVIIa by Fab 5G9
Fab 5G9 is a competitive inhibitor of factor X/IX sub￾strate activation by the TFVIIa complex. The effects of
mutations in TF on the binding of 5G9 in a competition
assay were characterized as follows. Wild-type or
mutant TF expressed by transient transfection of Chinese
hamster ovary cells was incubated with serial dilutions
of 5G9 (0.03 to 2700 nM) for 15 minutes at ambient tem￾perature, followed by the addition of enzyme VIIa
(5 nM) and substrate factor X (50 nM) in the presence of
5 mM CaCl2. Factor Xa generation was quenched after
15 minutes at ambient temperature and the concen￾trations of factor Xa in each reaction was quanti®ed with
chromogenic p-nitroanilide substrates. Rates of factor Xa
generation versus the antibody concentration were ®tted
to a model of competitive inhibition of the antibody with
factor X, yielding a Ki for each of the mutants and wild￾type TF.
