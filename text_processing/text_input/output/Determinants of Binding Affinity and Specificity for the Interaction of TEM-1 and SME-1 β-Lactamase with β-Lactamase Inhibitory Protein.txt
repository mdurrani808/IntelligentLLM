The hydrolysis of -lactam antibiotics by class A -lac￾tamases is a common cause of bacterial resistance to
these agents. The -lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP)
is able to bind and inhibit several class A -lactamases,
including TEM-1 -lactamase and SME-1 -lactamase.
Although the TEM-1 and SME-1 enzymes share 33%
amino acid sequence identity and a similar fold, they
differ substantially in surface electrostatic properties
and the conformation of a loop-helix region that BLIP
binds. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed to
identify the residues on BLIP that contribute to its bind￾ing affinity for each of these enzymes. The results indi￾cate that the sequence requirements for binding are
similar for both enzymes with most of the binding free
energy provided by two patches of aromatic residues on
the surface of BLIP. Polar residues such as several
serines in the interface do not make significant contri￾butions to affinity for either enzyme. In addition, the
specificity of binding is significantly altered by muta￾tion of two charged residues, Glu73 and Lys74, that are
buried in the structure of the TEM-1BLIP complex as
well as by residues located on two loops that insert into
the active site pocket. Based on the results, a E73A/Y50A
double mutant was constructed that exhibited a 220,000-
fold change in binding specificity for the TEM-1 versus
SME-1 enzymes.
Protein-protein interactions play a central role in many cel￾lular processes, such as signal transduction, the immune re￾sponse, and biochemical regulation of enzyme function. Engi￾neering of protein-protein interactions or the rational design of
drugs that disrupt interactions requires an understanding of
the physical basis of affinity and specificity within an interface
(1). Protein-protein interfaces are commonly large (900 Å2
)
and exhibit good shape and electrostatic complementarity (2–
5). Hydrophobic patches on the surface of one protein com￾monly pack against hydrophobic patches on the other protein,
whereas charged residues also commonly match across an in￾terface. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis has been used to exper￾imentally test the contributions of individual residues to pro￾tein interactions (6, 7). Studies of several interfaces suggest
that functional epitopes determined by mutagenesis are more
restricted than structural epitopes revealed by x-ray crystal￾lography (8). The presence of a small subset of “hotspot” resi￾dues that contribute significantly to the binding free energy of
a complex may be a general feature of protein-protein inter￾faces (3). Based on current understanding, however, it is not
possible to reliably predict the energetic contributions of indi￾vidual residues based on the structure of a protein-protein
interface (5). Therefore, additional structure-function studies
are required to generate a detailed understanding of the criti￾cal components of protein-protein interfaces.
-Lactam antibiotics such as the penicillins and cephalospor￾ins are among the most frequently used antimicrobial agents.
Resistance to these drugs is most commonly due to the action of
-lactamase enzymes. -Lactamases catalyze the hydrolysis of
the amide bond in the -lactam ring to create an ineffective
antimicrobial (9). There are four classes (A–D) of -lactamases
based on primary sequence homology (10). TEM-1 and SME-1
are class A -lactamases that are found in Gram-negative
bacteria. These enzymes are clinically significant because of
their ability to confer -lactam antibiotic resistance, which has
become a serious threat for human health. Both enzymes are
able to hydrolyze most of the penicillins and early cephalospor￾ins but not third generation cephalosporins. SME-1 has a wider
substrate spectrum than TEM-1 in that it catalyzes the hydrol￾ysis of carbapenem antibiotics (11). The TEM-1 and SME-1
enzymes are 33% identical at the amino acid sequence level.
The x-ray structure of the TEM-1 and SME-1 -lactamases
have been solved and indicate the enzymes possess a similar
fold (12, 13). The charge characteristics of TEM-1 and SME-1
are substantially different, however, with pI values of 5.4 and
9.5, respectively (11).
The -lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP)1 is a 165-amino
acid protein produced by Streptomyces clavuligerus that has
been shown to be a potent inhibitor of class A -lactamases
including TEM-1 (14–16). The x-ray structure of BLIP reveals
that it is a flat molecule composed of a tandem repeat of a
76-amino acid domain (16). The two domains form a concave
surface that is largely lined with uncharged, polar residues
such as serine and tyrosine. However, there are also three
tryptophan and two phenylalanine residues that contribute to
two hydrophobic patches on the concave surface. The co-crystal
structure of BLIP with TEM-1 -lactamase indicates that BLIP
uses the large (2636-Å2
) concave surface to clamp over a pro￾truding loop and helix region of TEM-1 (residues 99–114) (17).
In addition, at the periphery of the interface, two loops from
BLIP insert into the active pocket of TEM-1 to block substrate
binding (17). BLIP also contains three charged residues on its

45706 This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.orgsurface, Asp49, Glu73, and Lys74, which become buried on com￾plex formation with TEM-1 (17). Asp49 is on a loop inserted into
the TEM-1 active site pocket and has previously been shown to
contribute to binding (14, 15). The role of residues 73 and 74
has not yet been assessed. However, Albeck and Schreiber (14)
have demonstrated that electrostatic interactions between
BLIP and TEM-1 strongly influence the association kinetics for
complex formation. At neutral pH, both TEM-1 and BLIP carry
a net negative charge, and mutations at the periphery of the
interface that decrease the negative charge on either molecule
increase the association rate (14, 18).
In this study, alanine-scanning mutagenesis has been per￾formed to determine the functional epitope of BLIP for binding
two class A -lactamases from Gram-negative bacteria. Ala￾nine-scanning mutagenesis is a powerful tool for understand￾ing the contributions of the side chains of individual residues to
binding affinity (6, 7, 19, 20). The apparent binding constants
(Ki
) of wild type BLIP and 23 alanine mutants for the interac￾tion with TEM-1 and SME-1 were determined using a kinetic
assay of -lactamase inhibition. Several previous studies have
focused on the TEM-1BLIP complex (14, 15, 17, 18, 21–23).
The use of SME-1 in this study allowed an additional investi￾gation into the determinants of binding specificity. It was found
that the specificity of binding is significantly altered by muta￾tion of two charged residues, Glu73 and Lys74, that are buried
in the structure of the TEM-1BLIP complex as well as by
residues located on two loops that insert into the active site
pocket. This information was used to engineer a BLIP molecule
with a 220,000-fold change in binding specificity relative to
wild type.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Materials—All enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs
except for Pfu polymerase, which was purchased from Stratagene. Ol￾igonucleotide primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technolo￾gies. Talon cobalt resin was purchased from Clontech. Cephalosporin C
was purchased from Sigma. Cation exchange columns (SP Fast Flow)
were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.
BLIP Cloning and PCR Mutagenesis—Wild type, D49A, and F142A
BLIPs with N-terminal His tags were constructed previously (15). All
other BLIP mutants were constructed by overlapping PCR (24) and
cloned into pGR32 with an N-terminal His tag as previously described
(15). The external PCR primers used to amplify BLIP were as follows:
PD-bla1 (top strand, N-terminal), 5-CGGGGAGCTCGTTTCTTA￾GACGTCAGGTGGC-3; MALBLI-2 (bottom strand C-terminal), 5-GG￾GAAATCTAGATTATACAAGGTCCCACTGCCG-3. A SacI site in PD￾bla1 and an XbaI site in MALBLI-2 allowed the PCR product to be
digested with SacI and XbaI and cloned into SacI and XbaI-digested
pTP123 following treatment of the vector with calf intestinal alkaline
phosphatase (15). The internal top and bottom primers used for con￾structing the BLIP mutants are shown in Table I. The double mutant
E73A/Y50A was constructed by overlap extension PCR using the BLIP
Y50A mutant as the template and E73A top and bottom as inside
primers. The coding sequences of the R160A and W162A mutants
overlap with the MALBLI-2 primer, and therefore the inside primers
for the two mutants were not useful, and the external MALBLI-2 was
modified to contain the appropriately mutated codon. GCC was chosen
as the alanine codon for the mutants because of its abundant usage in
Escherichia coli (25). The DNA sequence of each mutant was confirmed
by the dideoxy chain termination method using an ABI 3100 capillary
DNA sequencer.
BLIP Expression and Purification—Wild type BLIP and the BLIP
mutants were expressed and purified using the protocol published
previously with minor changes (15). The plasmids containing either
wild type BLIP or the mutants were electrotransformed into E. coli
RB791 (equivalent to strain W3110 lacIQL8) (26). An overnight culture
of each mutant was grown at 37 °C with shaking in 10 ml of LB medium
in the presence of 12.5 g/ml chloramphenicol. 1.5 liters of LB medium
containing 12.5 g/ml chloramphenicol were then inoculated using the
10-ml overnight culture. The culture was then grown shaking at 37 °C
until A600  1.2. For induction of BLIP, 3 mM isopropyl-1-thio--D￾galactopyranoside was added to each culture, and the cultures were
allowed to grow overnight at 25 °C. The cells were pelleted and frozen
at 80 °C for at least 1 h. The frozen cells were then thawed and
resuspended in 40 ml of B-Per (Pierce). The cell debris was removed by
centrifugation, and the soluble protein in the supernatant was purified
over a 4-ml TALON cobalt resin column (Clontech) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. A 10 mM imidizole wash step was utilized
to remove protein from the column that bound less tightly than the
His-tagged BLIP. BLIP was eluted using a buffer consisting of 50 mM
imidizole in washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl and 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0).

a The coding sequences for these mutants overlap with MALbli-2 primer. Therefore, these constructions were performed by one-step PCR with
the PDbla-1 primer and modified Malbli-2 primers as described in Experimental Procedures.
Analysis of -Lactamase-BLIP Interactions 45707           Fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE to estimate purity and yield.
Fractions with more than 90% purity were pooled, concentrated, and
then changed into 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.0, buffer using Amicon
Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp.). SDS-PAGE was used
to determine the purity of the BLIP preparations (Fig. 1). BLIP concen￾trations were determined by Bradford assay with a standard curve
calibrated by quantitative amino acid analysis of purified, wild type
BLIP (27).
TEM-1 and SME-1 -Lactamase Expression and Purification—
TEM-1 -lactamase was purified to greater than 95% homogeneity as
previously described (28). SME-1 was expressed and purified from
E. coli as previously described (29).
Kinetic Inhibition Assay—The kinetic assay was performed as de￾scribed previously with minor changes (15). The assays were performed
in a 96-well quartz plate. 12 reactions were monitored simultaneously
in a Tecan ultraviolet spectrophotometer controlled by Magellan (Phe￾nix) software. 2 nM TEM-1 -lactamase or 4 nM SME-1 -lactamase was
incubated with 12 different concentrations of BLIP for 1 h at 25 °C in 50
mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albu￾min. 100 M cephalosporin C (Km is 700 M for TEM-1 and 1300 M for
SME-1) was added to the -lactamase/BLIP incubation buffer with a
12-channel pipetter. The final reaction volume was 0.3 ml, and hydrol￾ysis of cephalosporin C was monitored at A280. Plots of the concentration
of free -lactamase versus inhibitor concentration were fit by nonlinear
regression analysis to Equation 1,

where [Efree] is the concentration of active -lactamase calculated from
the measured velocity and the activity and concentration of uninhibited

RESULTS
Determination of the Functional Epitope for BLIP Binding to
TEM-1 -Lactamase—Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of BLIP
was performed to identify the determinants critical for binding
TEM-1 -lactamase. Amino acid residues in BLIP within 4 Å
from TEM-1 in the co-crystal structure were chosen for mu￾tagenesis (17). Wild type BLIP and the 23 BLIP mutants were
expressed in E. coli and purified (Fig. 1), and apparent binding
constant data were obtained using a kinetic assay of inhibition
of -lactam hydrolysis (Fig. 2, Table II). Residues that result in
a 10-fold decrease in binding affinity when mutated are con￾sidered components of the functional epitope. By this defini￾tion, 11 residues including Phe36, His41, Asp49, Tyr53, Lys74,
Trp112, Phe142, His148, Trp150, Arg160, and Trp162 (Fig. 3) com￾prise the functional epitope. The critical residues are largely
located in two patches near the center of the interface as well in
the two loops that insert in the active site pocket of the enzyme
(Fig. 3).
As described above, two loops on BLIP (loop 1, residues
46–51; loop 2, residues 136–144) insert into the active site of
TEM-1 -lactamase (17). Within loop 1, Asp49 forms two salt
bridges and two hydrogen bonds with four conserved TEM-1
residues that are essential for enzyme activity: Ser130, Lys234,
Ser235, and Arg244 (17). The carboxylate of Asp49 assumes the
position of the carboxylate of penicillin G in the acyl-enzyme
complex of TEM-1 with penicillin G (17). Phe142 accounts for
most of the van der Waals interactions in loop 2, and it mimics
the benzyl group of penicillin G for binding TEM-1 (17). As
expected based on these interactions and consistent with pre￾vious results, mutation of these residues to alanine results in
20-fold loss of binding affinity for TEM-1 -lactamase (Table
II). Other loop residues do not play a significant role in binding
with the exception of Tyr50. Surprisingly, mutation of this
residue to alanine results in a 50-fold increase in binding
affinity. Tyr50 forms extensive van der Waals interactions in￾teractions with Pro107, Val216, and Met129 of TEM-1. In addi￾tion, Tyr50 forms an aromatic patch on BLIP together with
residues Tyr51, Phe36, His41, and Tyr53. The aromatic ring of
Tyr50 is located between the hydrophobic rings of Pro107 of
TEM-1 and Tyr51 of BLIP. Perhaps the Tyr50 side chain hin￾ders Asp49 or other residues in loop 1 from assuming optimal
interactions in the active site of TEM-1 -lactamase. For ex￾ample, removal of the bulky Tyr50 side chain could result in
better contacts between BLIP residues His41 and Tyr51 and the
TEM-1 enzyme.
The x-ray structure of the BLIPTEM-1 complex reveals sev￾eral ordered water molecules at the interface between BLIP
and the Gln99–His112 region of -lactamase (17). The water
molecules are clustered near polar residues such as several
serines on the concave surface of BLIP. Mutation of Ser35,
Ser39, Ser71, and Ser113 at the interface had no effect on binding
(Table II). It has been proposed that the intervening waters at
the BLIP-TEM-1 interface may form an adaptable interface
that allows BLIP to bind several different -lactamase se￾quences (17). These results suggest that the BLIP side of this
interface is also adaptable in that the serine residues do not
contribute to binding affinity.
Two negatively charged BLIP residues in the interface, Glu31
and Glu73, do not contribute to binding affinity (Table II).
There is a salt bridge between Glu31 and Lys215 of TEM-1 that

WT, wild type. 5 g of protein was loaded into each lane.
45708 Analysis of -Lactamase-BLIP Interactions      is partially exposed to the solvent (17). The solvation effect may
limit the contribution of Glu31 to binding affinity. Glu73 is fully
buried inside the interface and makes hydrogen bonds with
Glu104, Tyr105, and Ser106 of TEM-1. Removal of the Glu73 side
chain, however, does not affect binding affinity to TEM-1
(Table II).
In contrast, mutation of several positively charged residues
on the binding surface of BLIP significantly increased Ki values
(Table II). The mutated residues include Lys74, Arg160, His41,
and His148. The significance of the histidine residues may arise
from their ring structure rather than the partial positive
charge, which will be discussed below. Lys74 is fully buried at
the interface and makes a salt bridge with Glu104 from TEM-1
and neutralizes a negative region formed by Glu73 of BLIP and
Glu104 of TEM-1 (17). Schreiber and colleagues (14, 18) have
shown that electrostatic effects strongly influence the associa￾tion rate and thereby the equilibrium constant for the BLIP￾TEM-1 interaction. It was observed that mutations that reduce
the negative charge on either molecule increase the association
rate. Since removal of the Lys74 side chain increases the neg￾ative charge of BLIP, the mutation may act by slowing the
association rate. A similar explanation may apply to Arg160,
which is near the periphery of the interaction surface. How￾ever, the aliphatic portion of the side chain also makes packing
interactions with His148, Trp150, and Trp162 in BLIP that, as
described below, form an aromatic patch on BLIP that is crit￾ical for binding affinity. The only positively charged residue
that did not affect binding when mutated to alanine was

yellow. The aromatic patch from domain one includes residues Phe36,
His41, Tyr50, and Tyr53, whereas the patch from domain two includes
residues His148, Trp150, and Trp162. The figure was prepared with Py￾MOL (W. L. DeLano; available on the World Wide Web at
www.pymol.org).
Analysis of -Lactamase-BLIP Interactions 45709Arg144. This residue is at the edge of loop 2 on the periphery of
the binding surface and remains largely exposed on complex
formation. The lack of effect is not surprising from the stand￾point of its limited direct interactions with -lactamase, but it
might have been expected to decrease affinity based on the
change in electrostatics (14, 18).
In contrast to the diverse effect of mutating hydrophilic
residues, the majority of the hydrophobic residues tested con￾tribute significantly to the BLIPTEM-1 interaction (Table II).
The mutation of these residues to alanine increases Ki values
at least 20-fold. It should be noted that all hydrophobic resi￾dues mutated in this study are also aromatic residues. Two
patches of aromatic residues account for most of the binding
affinity, with His148, Trp150, and Trp162 forming one patch and
Phe36, His41, Tyr50, and Tyr53 near loop 1 forming the other
(Fig. 3). Mutation of Trp150 results in the largest increase
(370-fold) in the Ki value among all mutants tested (Table II).
The patch centered at His148 makes extensive interactions with
Gln99-Asn100 and Leu102-Val103 in TEM-1 -lactamase,
whereas the patch near loop 1 makes contacts with Ser106-
Pro107-Val108 of TEM-1. Leu102-Val103 and Pro107-Val108 are
conserved positions in the loop-helix domain among several
class A -lactamases (10). In addition, a previous study from
this laboratory demonstrated that residues Leu102, Val103,
Ser106, Pro107, and Val108 in TEM-1 are important for binding
to BLIP (23). Therefore, the residues in the critical aromatic
patches in BLIP largely interact with TEM-1 residues that are
also important for binding. This suggests that the residues in
the aromatic patches make precise interactions with the
TEM-1 residues in these regions.
Determination of the Functional Epitope for BLIP Binding to
SME-1 -Lactamase—SME-1 -lactamase is 33% identical to
TEM-1 but differs significantly from TEM-1 in both surface
charge and shape in the loop-helix region that BLIP binds (Fig.
4). The inhibition assay indicated that wild type BLIP inhibits
SME-1 with a Ki of 2.4 nM, which is 5-fold weaker than the
interaction with TEM-1 (Fig. 2, Table II). Clearly, the differ￾ence in both surface charge and shape of SME-1 does not
abolish the protein-protein interaction. The differences be￾tween the TEM-1 and SME-1 -lactamases provide an inter￾esting system with which to investigate the determinants of
binding specificity for BLIP.
The functional epitope of BLIP for binding SME-1 (10-fold
increase in Ki
) consists of 12 residues: Phe36, His41, Asp49,
Tyr50, Tyr51, Tyr53, Glu73, Trp112, His148, Trp150, Arg160, and
Trp162 (Table II). The sequence requirements for the SME-1-
BLIP interaction are, in general, similar to those for the TEM￾1-BLIP interaction. For example, the two aromatic patches
critical for the TEM-1-BLIP interaction are also critical for the
SME-1-BLIP interaction. The loop 1 residue Asp49 that makes
multiple interactions in the active site of TEM-1 is also impor￾tant for binding to SME-1, as is the positively charged residue
Arg160. Finally, the multiple serine residues are not essential
for the interaction of BLIP with either enzyme.
There are, however, two significant differences between the
functional epitopes of BLIP for TEM-1 and SME-1. First, two
charged residues buried at the interface strongly influence
binding specificity. Glu73 is very important for binding to
SME-1 -lactamase but does not contribute to binding TEM-1
-lactamase. In contrast, Lys74 is important for binding
TEM-1, but the K74A substitution actually binds SME-1 10-
fold tighter than wild type BLIP. As stated above, Lys74 of
BLIP interacts with Glu73 of BLIP and Glu104 of TEM-1 -lac￾tamase. Based on a sequence alignment between TEM-1 and
SME-1, the equivalent residue to Glu104 of TEM-1 is Tyr104 of
SME-1, which would interact differently with Lys74. In addi￾tion, the topology of the loop-helix region is somewhat different
between TEM-1 and SME-1 in this region (Fig. 4), which could
alter multiple interactions. Finally, the mutation of Lys74 in￾creases the negative charge on BLIP, which may augment
electrostatic interactions with the positively charged SME-1
(14). It should be noted, however, that mutation of Arg144 and
Arg160 would have a similar effect on electrostatics, but these
mutations either do not affect or are detrimental for binding to
SME-1 (Table II).
The second significant difference in sequence requirements
for binding the enzymes is that mutation of loop 1 residues
Tyr50 and Tyr51 either improves or does not affect binding of
BLIP to TEM-1 -lactamase but significantly reduces affinity
for SME-1. In contrast, mutation of loop 2 residue Phe142 sig￾nificantly reduces binding to TEM-1 but has a relatively minor
effect on binding affinity for SME-1. In fact, none of the loop 2
residues examined displayed significantly altered Ki values for
SME-1 when mutated to alanine. Taken together, these data
suggest that loop 1 of BLIP does not make optimal interactions
with the TEM-1 active site, whereas loop 2 of BLIP does not
interact strongly with the SME-1 active site. Subtle differences
in the active sites of the enzymes may influence the loop inter￾actions. Alternatively, differences in the interactions of BLIP
with the loop-helix region of the -lactamases may alter the
positioning of the loops with respect to the enzymes. Although
the exact mechanisms for changes in binding affinity are not
clear, it is apparent that a relatively small number of residues,
Glu73, Lys74, Tyr50, Tyr51, and Phe142, are important determi￾nants of the binding specificity of BLIP.
Engineering the Binding Specificity of BLIP—The observa￾tion that single alanine substitutions result in large changes in
the binding specificity of BLIP suggested that the binding
specificity could be drastically altered with just a few changes
in sequence (Fig. 5). For example, the BLIP mutant containing
the Y50A substitution binds TEM-1 -lactamase 50-fold tighter
than wild type but binds SME-1 13-fold weaker. In addition,
the E73A mutant binds TEM-1 with the same affinity as wild
type BLIP but binds SME-1 1,100-fold weaker than wild type
(Fig. 5, Table II). Because the Tyr50 and Glu73 residues are not
in direct contact in the BLIP structure and mutations of resi￾dues that are not in contact often act additively when combined
(31), it was reasoned that the Y50A/E73A double mutant would
possess the combined effects of the mutations and thereby
exhibit a vast difference in binding specificity for TEM-1 versus
SME-1 -lactamase. This was found to be the case, since the
Y50A/E73A double mutant binds TEM-1 -lactamase 10-fold
tighter than wild type BLIP, whereas it binds SME-1 18,300-
fold weaker than wild type (Fig. 5, Table II). As a result, wild
type BLIP exhibits a 5-fold preference for binding TEM-1 ver￾sus SME-1 -lactamase, whereas the double mutant displays a
1.1 million-fold preference for binding TEM-1 versus SME-1

of BLIP can be drastically altered with relatively few amino
acid substitutions.
DISCUSSION
The common functional epitope of BLIP for binding both
TEM-1 and SME-1 -lactamase consists of 9 of the 23 residues
mutagenized and includes positions Phe36, His41, Asp49, Tyr53,
Trp112, His148, Trp150, Arg160, and Trp162 (Fig. 3). These resi￾dues represent two aromatic patches in addition to Asp49 from
loop 1. It is interesting that each domain of BLIP contributes
an aromatic patch (Fig. 3). The locations of the patches with
respect to the binding surfaces, however, are somewhat differ￾ent. For example, the patch from domain one includes residues
Phe36, His41, and Tyr53 and is located in the center of the
binding interface provided by domain one. The periphery of this
patch contains the polar residues Ser35, Ser39, and Ser71, which
do not contribute substantially to binding of either -lacta￾mase. This type of organization has been noted for several
protein-protein interaction interfaces, and it has been proposed
that the major role of the residues on the periphery of the
critical residues is to serve as an “O-ring” to occlude bulk
solvent from the hotspot (8).
The aromatic patch from domain two includes residues
His148, Trp150, and Trp162. Although not an aromatic residue,
Arg160 is critical for binding and also packs into this hotspot
(Fig. 3). In contrast to the patch from domain one, this patch
is located near the periphery of the binding interface (Fig. 3).
For example, His148, Trp150, Arg160, and Trp162 retain 1.1,
28.6, 71.2, and 26.0 Å2 of accessible surface area in the
complex, respectively, due to their position near the edge of
the interface. In contrast, Phe36, His41, and Tyr53 from patch
one exhibit only 0.3, 0.0, and 0.46 Å2 of accessible surface
area in the complex, respectively, due to their more centered
position in the domain one binding interface. Therefore, it
appears that the aromatic patch in domain two does not
require a ring of surrounding residues to protect the hotspot
(8). Finally, it is of interest that Trp112 is critical for binding
but does not belong to either of the aromatic patches. Rather,
Trp112 serves as a bridge between the aromatic patches from
domains one and two (Fig. 3B).
Analysis of an extensive alanine-scanning database has
shown that the amino acid composition of hotspots is enriched
for tryptophan, arginine, tyrosine, aspartate, isoleucine, and
histidine residues (8, 32). With the exception of isoleucine,
these residues are also enriched on the binding surface of BLIP
(17). Of the 23 BLIP residues within 4 Å of the TEM-1 -lac￾tamase surface, 13 are within this class. In general, these
residues were also found to be important for the -lactamase￾BLIP interaction (Table II). For example, all three of the tryp￾tophan residues, both of the histidine residues, and the loop 1
aspartate residue at the interface are important for binding to
both TEM-1 and SME-1 -lactamase. In contrast, only one of
the four tyrosine residues at the interface contributes signifi￾cantly to binding TEM-1 -lactamase based on the mutation
results. However, two additional tyrosines on loop 1, Tyr50 and
Tyr51, are important for binding SME-1 -lactamase.
Phenylalanine is not enriched at hotspots in the alanine￾scanning database (32). Nevertheless, it is important at the
BLIP interface in that Phe36 is a critical residue from one of the
aromatic patches and Phe142 on loop 2 is critical for binding
TEM-1 -lactamase. These results are consistent with an anal￾ysis of structurally conserved residues and binding energy
hotspots that showed tryptophan and phenylalanine are con￾served at interaction surfaces but not on the exposed surface
of proteins (33). In addition, analysis of the alanine-scanning
database as well as structurally conserved residues in binding
sites indicates that serine residues are very rarely found in
energy hotspots (8, 33). This is true for the BLIP interface as
well in that none of the four serines at the interaction interface
make a significant contribution to the binding of either -lac￾tamase. A similar result was reported for the peripheral polar
residues in the human growth hormone and hormone receptor
complex (20). The serines on the periphery of BLIP interact
with water molecules that bridge the interface with -lacta￾mase. The intervening water molecules may contribute to the
adaptability of the periphery of the interface.
BLIP binds a number of -lactamases from both Gram-neg￾ative and Gram-positive bacteria (16). Examination of the bind￾ing of the alanine scan mutants to TEM-1 and SME-1 -lacta￾mase indicates that most of the positions, including the two
aromatic patches, make similar contributions to binding each
enzyme. Only a relatively small number of residues influence
binding specificity. Two fully buried charged residues in BLIP,
Glu73 and Lys74, contribute to the specificity of binding, as do
Tyr50 and Tyr51 located on loop 1 and Phe142 on loop 2. Schre￾iber and colleagues (14, 18) have shown that alteration of
charged residues on the periphery of the BLIP-TEM-1 -lacta￾mase interface can strongly influence the association rate and
thereby the equilibrium binding constant. Although Glu73 and
Lys74 are not in the periphery but rather fully buried in the
binding interface, it is possible that they could act on the
association rate. It has previously been suggested that buried
electrostatic interactions may contribute to specificity (34).
Further studies are required, however, to determine the mech￾anism for the specificity change associated with Glu73 and
Lys74.
The roles of Tyr50, Tyr51, and Phe142 in binding specificity
may be due to altered interactions between loop 1 and loop 2
with the TEM-1 and SME-1 active sites. Removal of the Tyr50
side chain significantly increases binding affinity of BLIP with
TEM-1 but not SME-1 -lactamase (Table II). The side chain of
Tyr50 fits into a pocket formed by TEM-1 residues Pro107,
Met129, and Val216 (17). Although the catalytic machinery of
the SME-1 active site is similar to TEM-1, there are several
differences that could prevent similar interactions from occur￾ring. For example, the equivalent Tyr50-interacting residues in
SME-1 are Pro107, Tyr129, and Thr216 that form a somewhat
FIG. 5. Comparison of G values for binding to TEM-1 (white
bars) and SME-1 (black bars) for BLIP alanine mutants. Relative
binding free energy is the difference between binding free energy of
wild-type BLIP versus the alanine mutants: G  RTln(Ki

Analysis of -Lactamase-BLIP Interactions 45711   altered binding pocket. In contrast, Tyr51 packs onto Tyr50 but
does not directly contact -lactamase. Changes at Tyr51, how￾ever, could alter the position of Tyr50 or the conformation of
loop 1 and thereby affect binding.
Replacement of the Phe142 side chain with alanine signifi￾cantly reduces binding affinity of BLIP with TEM-1 but not
SME-1 -lactamase. The Phe142 side chain interacts with sev￾eral TEM-1 active site residues including Glu104, Tyr105,
Asn170, Gly238, and Glu240. The equivalent residues in SME-1
are Tyr104, His105, Asn170, Cys238, and Ala240. These differences
may result in a poor interaction between loop 2 and SME-1 and
therefore little contribution from Phe142.
The ability to engineer protein-protein interactions or design
binding sites could facilitate the design of new therapeutics.
One interesting challenge is to engineer the specificity of pro￾tein interactions. Wild type BLIP exhibits a 5-fold binding
affinity preference for TEM-1 versus SME-1 -lactamase. The
results of the mutational analysis, however, suggested that the
binding specificity of BLIP could be tailored to interact strongly
with one substrate but not another. For example, the K74A
mutant exhibits a significant change in binding specificity in
that it binds SME-1 460-fold tighter than TEM-1 rather than
5-fold weaker as seen with wild type BLIP. Thus, a single
amino acid substitution in BLIP resulted in a 2300-fold change
in specificity versus wild type.
The observation that the E73A mutation greatly reduced
BLIP binding to SME-1 while not affecting binding to TEM-1 as
well as the finding that the Y50A mutant bound more tightly to
TEM-1 but not SME-1 suggested that the Y50A/E73A double
mutant would exhibit greatly altered specificity. This was the
case, since the double mutant exhibited a 1.1 million-fold
preference for binding TEM-1 versus SME-1 -lactamase. Be￾cause wild type BLIP exhibits a 5-fold preference for TEM-1 the
double mutant exhibits a 220,000-fold change in binding
specificity.
One reason for the changes in specificity observed here is
that the Tyr50 side chain not only does not favor binding to
TEM-1 -lactamase; it actually decreases affinity by an order of
magnitude. Similarly, Lys74 side chain decreases affinity of
BLIP for SME-1 by more than an order of magnitude. A large
increase in affinity upon mutation of a residue has not been
frequently observed in other protein-protein interfaces (6, 7, 35,
36). Nevertheless, it is clear from these results that the binding
affinity of BLIP for either TEM-1 or SME-1 -lactamase has
not been optimized by evolution. This is not surprising in that
it is very unlikely that BLIP evolved to bind either TEM-1 or
SME-1 -lactamase, since BLIP is produced by a Gram-positive
soil bacterium, and TEM-1 and SME-1 -lactamase are found
in Gram-negative enteric bacteria (37). The role of BLIP in the
biology of S. clavuligerus is not known, so it is difficult to
speculate on the selective pressures that did shape BLIP
function.
Although BLIP binds to several class A -lactamases, it does
not efficiently bind other classes of -lactamase or penicillin￾binding proteins (16). The results presented here suggest that
BLIP can be engineered to serve as an inhibitor of a number of
clinically important -lactamases and penicillin-binding pro￾teins. More generally, the results suggest that the specificity of
protein-protein interactions can be modified with limited
amino acid substitutions.
