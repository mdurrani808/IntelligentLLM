NMR spectroscopy studies and biosensor interaction
analysis of native and site-directed mutants of insulin￾like growth factor I (IGF-I) was applied to identify the
involvement of individual residues in IGF-I binding to
IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1). Backbone NMR chem￾ical shifts were found to be affected by IGFBP-1 binding
in the following residues: Pro2
, Glu3
, Cys6
, Gly7
, Gly19,
Pro28–Gly30, Gly32, Arg36, Arg37, Gln40–Gly42, Pro63, Lys65,
Pro66, and Lys68–Ala70. Three IGF-I arginine side chains
were identified by NMR to participate in IGFBP-1 bind￾ing. All IGF-I arginine residues were replaced by ala￾nines, using site-directed mutagenesis, in four single
substituted variants, IGF-I(R21A), IGF-I(R50A), IGF￾I(R55A), and IGF-I(R56A), and one double replacement
mutant, IGF-I(R36A/R37A). Biosensor interaction analy￾sis binding studies demonstrate the involvement of
Arg36-Arg37 and Arg50 in IGFBP-1 binding, while exper￾iments with the IGF-I receptor implicate Arg21, Arg36-
Arg37, and Arg56 as part of the receptor binding epitope.
These overlapping binding surfaces explain why IGF-I
receptor and IGFBP-1 binding to IGF-I is competitive.
The C terminus of free, but not IGFBP-1-bound, IGF-I is
found to exist in two distinct, NMR-detectable confor￾mations at 30 °C. One possible explanation for this struc￾tural heterogeneity could be cis-trans isomerization of
the Cys6
–Cys48 disulfide bond.
The insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I1 and IGF-II) bind with
nanomolar affinities to specific binding proteins present in
extracellular fluids (1). These IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs)
prolong the half-life of the IGFs, are believed to participate in
the in vivo folding of IGFs (2), and inhibit IGF binding to the
insulin receptor. The IGFBPs have also been shown to either
inhibit or stimulate the growth-promoting effects the IGFs
have on cell cultures, most likely by altering the interaction of
IGFs with their cell surface receptors (3).
There are at least six different IGFBPs that have homolo￾gous amino acid sequences. Human IGFBP-1, -2, -3, and -5
each contain 18 cysteine residues in conserved positions; IG￾FBP-4 contains two additional cysteines; and IGFBP-6 has only
16. The characteristic N-terminal cysteine pattern of the IG￾FBPs, GC(G/S)CCXXCAXXXXXXC, can also be found e.g. in
the human proteins MAC25 (4) and connective tissue growth
factor. The disulfide mapping and three-dimensional struc￾tures of these binding proteins remain elusive.
Solution NMR structures of IGF-I (5–9) (Fig. 1), IGF-II (10,
11), and insulin itself (12, 13) are available. Several mutagen￾esis studies have addressed the localization of IGFBP binding
determinants on the IGFs. A naturally occurring N-terminally
truncated form of IGF-I, des(1–3), has been found to be 5–10-
fold more potent in stimulating protein synthesis in rat myo￾blasts (14), explained by a 60-fold lower affinity for IGFBPs
present in these cells (15). Clemmons et al. (16) have found that
mutation of the IGF-I residues 3 and 4 as well as 49–51 leads
to reduced affinity for IGFBP-1. A more detailed understanding
of the nature of the interactions between the insulin-like
growth factors and their moderating binding proteins may be
used to aid design of more potent IGF-derived pharmaceutical
agents.
In this article, we present a heteronuclear NMR study of 15N￾and 13C-labeled IGF-I. By a comparison of the IGF-I chemical
shifts in the presence and absence of IGFBP-1, a structural
binding epitope could be defined. The NMR analysis indicates
that three arginine side chains in IGF-I are affected by complex
formation with IGFBP-1. To further confirm the identity and
the importance of these interactions and to probe possible
differences between the structural and functional binding
epitope (17), site-directed mutagenesis was utilized. Every
IGF-I arginine was replaced by alanine through the construc￾tion of four single substituted variants, R21A, R50A, R55A, and
R56A, and one double replacement mutant, R36A/R37A. The
effect on binding was evaluated using Biosensor kinetic inter￾action analysis, and as a comparison, the binding of IGF-I to
immobilized IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in the presence of IG￾FBP-1 was evaluated to test for the presence of overlapping
residues involved in both IGFBP-1 and IGF-IR binding.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein Production—The IGF-I variants were produced intracellu￾larly in Escherichia coli as fusions to the IgG binding domain Z derived
from the B domain of staphylococcal protein A (18). The production of
labeled IGF-I followed closely the previously published procedures for
IGF-II labeling and IGF-I variant production (19, 20). E. coli RV308
ompT containing the plasmid pKP522, was grown in defined minimal
medium with (15NH4)2SO4 as the sole source of nitrogen and, in the case
of double labeling, (15N and 13C) with 13C-glucose as the sole carbon
source. Protein was recovered from inclusion bodies by resuspension in
6 M guanidine HCl followed by IgG affinity chromatography as de￾scribed by Jansson et al. (20). The IGF-I moiety was released from the
Z fusion partner by hydroxylamine-mediated cleavage (20, 21). Separa￾tion of the IGF-I products after cleavage was performed by cation
exchange chromatography using a Mono S column (Amersham Phar￾macia Biotech). The elution gradient was from 10 to 52% B in 20 min.
Buffer A contained 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.4, 10% ethanol;
buffer B contained 1 M ammonium acetate, pH 5.4, 10% ethanol. The

This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org 24701final purification, separating native and mismatched IGF-I forms (22),
was performed using a C8 reverse-phase HPLC column. IGFBP-1 and
IGF-IR were produced in mammalian expression systems and purified
as described (23).
Sample Preparation—IGF-I labeled with 13C and 15N was studied by
NMR either alone or in complex with IGFBP-1 at 600 mM and pH 3.4.
Between this pH and its pI value (4.8; determined by isoelectric focus￾ing), IGFBP-1 precipitates. Previous observation of the aggregation
tendencies of IGF-I, as well as IGFBP-1, when free in solution, dictated
that the complex was formed at dilute concentrations with an excess of
IGFBP-1, in 7 ml of 1 mM sodium citrate buffer and then subsequently
concentrated by reduction of the sample volume to 200 ml using a
vacuum rotation concentrator.
Site-directed Mutagenesis—Introduction of point mutations in IGF-I
was performed in a two-step sequential PCR reaction using two general
IGF-I primers in combination with two specific primers for each muta￾tion. The general primers were designed for the expression vector
pKP522, containing a synthetic IGF-I gene (19). The general 59 primer
59-AGT AGA CGC GAA TTC TAA CGG -39 covered the EcoRI cloning
site and the general 39 primer 59-AAT CAG CAA GCT TCT AAG CAG
ATT-39 covered the HindIII site. Mutations were introduced by first
producing two separate PCR fragments from each general primer to a
specific primer at the point of mutation. This results in two overlapping
fragments, one from the 59-end to the mutagenesis site and one from the
mutagenesis site to the 39-end. The obtained PCR fragments were
mixed, and a second round of PCR using the general primers was
performed. The mutation primers used for each variant were as follows:
R21A:1, 59-TTG TTT GCG GTG ACG CTG GTT T-39; R21A:2, 59-GTT
AAA ATA AAA ACC AGC GTC A-39; R3637A:1, 59-GGT TCT TCT TCT

CAG G-39; R56A:1, 59-CTT GCG ACC TGC GTG CTC TGA A-39;
R56A:2, 59-CAA TAC ATT TCC AGA GCA CGC A-39. The PCR reactions
were performed according to Ref. 24. PCR primers were synthesized by
Cybergene AB (Huddinge, Sweden). PCR deoxynucleotides were ob￾tained as a premixed 10 mM solution (Boehringer Mannheim) while the
Taq polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. All the mutations were veri￾fied using automated dideoxy sequencing on an ABI 373 (Applied
Biosystems).
The IGF-I variant proteins were produced as described for labeled
protein except for the use of Terrific Broth/Glycerol medium (Sigma).
All purified proteins were verified by quantitative amino acid analysis,
laser desorption mass spectrometry, and analytical reverse-phase
HPLC.
Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J 720
spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Japan). Protein samples were dissolved in 10
mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 0.1
mg/ml. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 184 nm at a step resolution
of 0.1 nm and a scanning speed of 5 nm/min. Each spectrum is the
average of five accumulated scans. Subsequently, actual concentration
of each protein sample was determined by quantitative amino acid
composition analysis.
NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed on Var￾ian Unity and Unity1 500- and 600-MHz spectrometers. The following
spectra were recorded: 1
H-15N HSQC (25), 1
H-13C CT-HSQC (26),
HNCO (27), HNCACB (28), CBCA(CO)NH (29), CBCA(CO)HA (30),
three-dimensional HCC(CO)NH-total correlation spectroscopy, and
three-dimensional CC(CO)NH-total correlation spectroscopy (31, 32)
and simultaneous 15N- and 13C-edited three-dimensional nuclear Over￾hauser effect spectroscopy (33).
The spectra were processed with the NMR-Pipe program (34) using
linear prediction in the 15N and/or 13C dimensions of the three-dimen￾sional spectra. The spectra were assigned with the interactive graphics
program ANSIG (35) adapted for multidimensional heteronuclear NMR
spectra (36).
Biosensor Kinetic Measurements—The binding affinities of the IGF-I
variants were measured using BIAcore real time kinetic interaction
analysis (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The measurements were per￾formed as previously published (23), with IGFBP-1 or IGF-IR as the
immobilized part of the complex. The acceptor protein was immobilized
via primary amine groups utilizing N9-ethyl-N9-(dimethylaminopropyl)-
carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide coupling reagents (37). Protein ab￾sorption and coupling were performed at pH 4. Immobilization was
performed at 5 ml/min using 13 HBS (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.05% P20). All kinetic experiments were per￾formed using 13 HBS as the driving buffer at a flow rate of 8 ml/min.
The injection of analyte was controlled using the Kinject command in
the BIAloguey control software. All of the variants were injected in
concentrations of 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 640 nM for both the IGFBP-1
and IGF-IR experiments. Kinetic measurements were performed by
injection of each analyte for 300 s followed by disassociation in buffer
flow for 400 s. The temperature in all kinetic experiments was 25 °C.
Binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR in the presence of IGFBP-1 was tested using
immobilized IGF-IR and free IGF-I in concentrations of 8, 16, 33, 66, and
131 nM and complexed to IGFBP in IGF-I/IGFBP-1 proportions of 2:1
and 1:5. Kinetic parameters were calculated using the kinetics evalua￾tion software package BIAevaluation 2 (Biacore AB). Protein concen￾tration was determined using quantitative amino acid analysis.
RESULTS
Earlier NMR studies of unlabeled IGF-I showed very poor
spectral quality at pH values above 3.0 and in a concentration
range of 3–7 mM due to dimerization (5). Others have reduced
the IGF-I self-association at 2–10 mM protein concentration,
and thereby improved the spectral quality, by the addition of
10% (8) or 20% (9) acetic acid. In this study, we have not used
acetic acid, since it influences the IGF-I/IGFBP-1 binding af￾finity. We found that spectral quality for IGF-I is marginally
improved by dilution to submillimolar concentrations and con￾firm that, as pointed out by Cooke et al. (5), elevated temper￾atures improve the spectral quality significantly.
We made use of IGF-I labeled with 15N as well as 13C and 15N
to aid these NMR studies. The molecular masses of the labeled
IGF-I material were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrom￾etry to determine the isotope incorporation levels. The mass of
the 15N-labeled IGF-I was found to be 7740, which corresponds
to an 15N incorporation level of 99.98%. The 13C,15N-labeled
IGF-I mass of 8063.5 corresponds to a 99.97% degree of isotope
labeling.
The NMR signals from the backbone of 13C,15N-IGF-I were
initially assigned at 50 °C and pH 3.4 for compatibility with
previously published 1
H assignments (5) and optimization of
the spectral quality. The NMR methodology used was to per￾form sequential walks in either HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH

disulfide bonds (6–48, 18–61, and 47–52) are displayed in yellow. The
side chains of all arginines (residues 21, 36, 37, 50, 55, 56) are shown
explicitly. The figure was generated using MOLSCRIPT (49).
24702 IGFBP-1 Binding Epitope on IGF-Ispectra or HNCO and CBCACOHA spectra. A total of 84% of
the 1
HN, 15N, 13Ca, and 13Cb chemical shifts and 71% of the 13C9
chemical shifts could be assigned. The residues that remained
elusive and for which no assignments could be made at 50 °C
are the N-terminal residue Gly1
, Cys6
, and the polypeptide
segment Asp45–Phe49.
Cooke et al. (5) could assign 87% of the backbone and 72% out
of the total number of protons. No assignments whatsoever
could be made for residues 18, 34–37, 50, 63, 68, and 69 in that
study. For the studies performed with acetic acid present (6, 8),
virtually complete assignments were accomplished.
Once our attempts were started to form complexes between
IGF-I and IGFBP-1, it became clear that spectral quality for
the complex was improved by lowering the temperature to
30 °C. For internal consistency, the backbone assignment pro￾cedure was repeated on a fresh sample of 13C,15N-IGF-I, but
now at 30 °C and pH 3.4. The spectral quality of IGF-I alone at
this temperature, however, only allows partial assignments.
The IGF-I residues for which any assignments can be made
unambiguously at 30 °C are Pro2
-Glu3
, Gly7
, Gly19, Pro28–
Thr41, Ser51, Met59, and Pro63–Ala70. When comparing the
IGF-I chemical shifts at 30 and 50 °C, only a few residues
exhibit differences deviating from the expected temperature
dependence. The 15N chemical shift of Ala70 changes almost 1
ppm more than warranted by the temperature change, while
the 13Ca and 13Cb differences for Ala70 are not only half a ppm
larger than expected but in the opposite direction.
IGF-I labeled with 13C and 15N was studied in complex with
IGFBP-1 at 600 mM, 30 °C, and pH 3.4. A few more, but far from
all, IGF-I resonances can be assigned unambiguously in the
complex than in the free state despite the monomer molecular
mass increase from 7 to 30 kDa. The residues for which any
unambiguous resonance assignments can be made in the com￾plex at 30 °C are Pro2
, Glu3
, Cys6
, Gly7
, Pro28–Gly42, Ser51,
Leu54, Arg55, Glu58, Met59, Pro63–Ala70.
Fig. 2 shows 15N HSQC spectra of IGF-I with and without
IGFBP-1 present and highlights the larger 15N/1
HN chemical
shift differences. Significant chemical shift differences, defined
as greater than 0.15 ppm for 15N or greater than 0.3 ppm for
either of the 13Ca or 13Cb resonances, are observed for residues
Pro2
, Glu3
, Gly7
, Gly19, Pro28–Gly30, Gly32, Arg36, Arg37, Gln40-
Thr41, Pro63, Lys65, Pro66, and Lys68–Ala70 (Table I). For one
additional residue, Gly42, chemical shift differences can be
inferred indirectly by comparing expected 30 °C chemical shifts
in the free state, based on chemical shifts observed at 50 °C for
this state, with measured chemical shifts at 30 °C for the
complexed state.
In addition, from Fig. 2 it is apparent that at least three of
the arginine Ne
/He chemical shifts are affected, implying that
arginine side chains are involved in the IGF-I/IGFBP-1 inter￾action. Based on the identified backbone chemical shift pertur￾bation upon complexation, it is plausible that Arg36 and Arg37
participate in the binding epitope.
Novel triple resonance NMR experiments by Yamazaki et al.
(38) allow the assignment of arginine guanidino 15N and 1
H
chemical shifts in a conformationally independent manner. To
accomplish this, it is, however, necessary to have the 13Cd and
Hd chemical shifts of the arginine side chains assigned. It is
FIG. 2. The 1
H and 15N chemical shift differences between free IGF-I (red) and IGF-I in complex with IGFBP-1 (green) displayed
by overlaying two 15N-HSQC NMR experiments using the computer program ANSIG (35, 36). Resolved cross-peaks significantly affected
by complexation with IGFBP-1 are indicated with labeled arrows. The asterisk marks the cross-peak from Ala70 in a minor conformation of free
IGF-I present at 30 but not 50 °C.
IGFBP-1 Binding Epitope on IGF-I 24703also possible to observe cross-peaks for the 15Ne
, 1
He
, 13Cd
, and 13Cg nuclei of the arginine side chain in the HNCACB experi￾ment. For IGF-I in complex with IGFBP-1 and alone at 30 °C,
cross-peaks can be found for all six arginine side chains, while
only one arginine side chain group is detectable in free IGF-I at
50 °C. The 13Cd and 13Cg chemical shifts are very similar and
only vary by a few tenths of a ppm, respectively. To match these
with the correct residue, it is necessary to assign the 13Cd and 13Cg chemical shifts, for instance, in a CC(CO)NH-total corre￾lation spectroscopy experiment. The spectral quality of this
experiment is too poor (particularly for free IGF-I at 30 °C) to
unambiguously assign the IGF-I arginine 13Cd and 13Cg nuclei.
Consequently, it has not been possible, in our hands, to
uniquely assign the arginine guanidino groups of IGF-I, and
subsequently deconvolute the arginine participation in the IG￾FBP-1 binding epitope, using current NMR techniques alone.
Instead, arginine to alanine substituted IGF-I variants
R21A, R36A/R37A, R50A, R55A, and R56A were constructed by
site-specific in vitro mutagenesis. Clones were DNA-sequenced
and found to correspond to the anticipated sequences. The
IGF-I and IGF-I variants were produced in E. coli and purified
to homogeneity, essentially as described previously for other
IGF-I variants (20). Quantitative analysis of amino acid com￾position and determined molecular masses correspond to the
theoretically expected values for all variants (data not shown).
The far-UV CD spectra of IGF-I and the IGF-I variants were
determined (Fig. 3). The spectra are almost completely coincid￾ing over the entire wavelength range, indicative of a highly
similar overall secondary structure content. Because of this
lack of structural changes, all variations in binding affinities
between IGF-I and its variants are expected to be caused by
differences in side chain properties.
The kinetic measurements of IGF-Is binding to IGFBP-1 and
IGF-IR (Fig. 4) were performed at a number of different con￾centrations for each ligand. The total estimated error from
concentration determination, pipetting, and data fitting was
less than 10%, corresponding to a calculated error of less than
10% in the measured rates and less than 22% in the calculated
Ka values. The results from the biosensor measurements of
IGF-I arginine-substituted variants are summarized in Table
II. In the binding of IGF-I variants to IGFBP-1, R36A/R37A,
R50A, and R55A display significantly altered association rates
(ka), whereas only R36A/R37A and R50A have significantly
changed dissociation rates (kd). The binding kinetics of argi￾nine-substituted variants to IGF-IR display alterations in both
association and dissociation. The R21A, R36A/R37A, and R50A
have decreased association rates. Dissociation is significantly
increased for the R21A, R36A/R37A, and R56A variants.
The binding of IGF-I to immobilized IGF-IR was studied in
the presence of different ratios of IGFBP-1, to test for the
presence of overlapping IGFBP-1 and IGF-IR binding epitopes.

24704 IGFBP-1 Binding Epitope on IGF-IThe IGF-IzIGFBP-1 complex does not bind to the receptor when
the IGFBP-1 excess is 5-fold as shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore,
a 50% association rate decrease, compared with unassociated
IGF-I, can be observed for IGF-IR binding of an IGF-I/IGFBP-1
mixture in a 2:1 ratio. This is consistent with only free IGF-I
binding to the receptor and indicative of overlapping binding
sites for the receptor and IGFBP-1 on IGF-I, resulting in mu￾tual exclusion of binding.
DISCUSSION
The NMR chemical shift of a given nuclei depends on its
electronic environment. If this environment changes, then so
will the chemical shift. Perturbations of chemical shifts upon
the addition of a ligand are a reliable indication of intermolec￾ular interaction (39). Recent examples of studies where chem￾ical shift perturbations were used to identify structural binding
epitopes include CD4 peptide binding to HIV-1 (40) and antag￾onist binding to calmodulin (41). Most of the NMR interaction
studies published to date involve a small molecule (Mr 500–
2000) binding to a relatively large protein (Mr 20,000–25,000).
The desired approach is to titrate in the smaller molecule,
thereby simplifying the assignment procedure for the complex,
since many chemical shift assignments can be directly trans￾ferred from those in the free target molecule, and yielding data
on the binding kinetics. McAlister et al. (42) present a recent
example where NMR signals from the smaller CD2 (domain 1;
99 residues) were observed, while the larger interaction part￾ner CD48 (soluble part; 193 residues) was successively added.
The study presented here, where a 23-kDa protein is docked to
a 7-kDa target, had to be conducted on a preformed complex.
Previous observation of the aggregation tendencies of IGFBP-1,
as well as IGF-I, when free in solution, necessitated the forma￾tion of the complex at dilute conditions with an excess of IG￾FBP-1 and subsequently concentrated.
The chemical shift differences found in IGF-I when compar￾ing the molecule alone and in complex with IGFBP-1 involve
residues Pro2
, Glu3
, Cys6
, Gly7
, Gly19, Pro28–Gly30, Gly32,
Arg36, Arg37, Gln40–Gly42, Pro63, Lys65, Pro66, and Lys68–Ala70
(Table I and Fig. 6). This area spans the better part of one face
of the molecular surface. For comparison, the amino acid resi￾dues so far identified to affect IGFBP-1 affinity in mutagenesis
studies are also shown in Fig. 6. The mutations known to affect
IGFBP-1 affinity are found highly localized in a small portion
of, but not constrained to, the interaction surface as defined by
NMR. The arginine residues (positions 21, 36, 37, 50, 55, and
56) all circle the area where the chemical shift perturbations
are found. It is, however, geometrically consistent that IG￾FBP-1 affinities are unaffected by mutating residues 21, 55,
and 56, since they are most distant from the interaction
surface.
One interesting observation is that the chemical shifts of the
C-terminal residues, Lys68–Ala70, are perturbed by the pres￾ence of IGFBP-1. In this study, two alternative conformations
of the C-terminal IGF-I polypeptide segment Ala67–Ala70 can
be observed for free IGF-I at 30 °C but not 50 °C. The 15N/1
HN
chemical shifts for Ala70 in the minor conformation are, as
indicated in Fig. 3, significantly closer to the chemical shifts
when bound to IGFBP-1 (Dd 1
HN 5 0.08; Dd 15N 5 20.79) than
those in the major conformation (Table I). It is conceivable that
the chemical shift perturbations observed for the C terminus of
IGF-I (light green in Fig. 6) upon the addition of IGFBP-1 at
30 °C, are a result of a change in its conformational equilibrium
to favor the (in free IGF-I) less populated conformation. As a
consequence of this, chemical shift differences might be observ￾able between the free and complexed form of IGF-I that result
from a different conformational population, i.e. indirect struc￾tural changes, and not direct contact with the binding protein.
In light of this observation, it is possible that none of the
residues in the C terminus (Pro63–Ala70) participate in making
structural contact with IGFBP-1. This is in accordance with the
binding studies performed on the fusion protein IGF-I-Z, where
the IgG binding staphylococcal protein A module Z was fused
directly to the C terminus of IGF-I (43). The IGFBP-1 binding
on-rate to IGF-I-Z was found to be reduced to 23% of the
wild-type value, while the off-rate remained essentially the
same. The unchanged dissociation rate would indicate that the
C terminus is not directly involved in the functional epitope.
Bulky extensions such as Z would, on the other hand, cause
steric hindrance for IGFBP-1 to approach IGF-I-Z as judged by
the lowered association rate.
The 15N and 13Ca shifts of Gly7 both change by more than 1
ppm (when temperature effects have been accounted for) when
the temperature is lowered from 50 to 30 °C. The 15N chemical
shift for Ser51 is also perturbed more than expected by just
temperature differences. This observation and the fact that the
disulfide-connected residues Cys6 and Cys48 could not be as￾signed in free IGF-I at any temperature raise the question of
whether this disulfide bond is undergoing intermediate ex￾change. Otting et al. (44) have described how a minor form of
bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor was found to correspond to
the cis isomer of a disulfide bond and has shown that this
conformational equilibrium leads to attenuation of signals from
residues in the vicinity of this bond. It is tempting to suggest
that part of the problem with the spectral quality of IGF-I,
especially at ambient temperatures, stems from such a confor￾mational exchange between cis and trans disulfide bonds be￾tween Cys6 and Cys48 (cf. Fig. 1). Supporting such a speculation
is the fact that cross-peaks from the 13Ca and 13Cb nuclei of
Cys6 can be observed after IGFBP-1 has been added to the
IGF-I molecule, suggesting that the kinetics of this exchange is
affected by the presence of IGFBP-1. It is possible that the two
observed C-terminal conformations correspond to the cis and
trans isoforms of the Cys6
–Cys48 disulfide bond. The Ser51
residue packs next to the C-terminal residue Ala70 (Fig. 6), and
a conformational change in the area of the disulfide bond could
be translated to the C terminus. IGF-I is a notoriously difficult
molecule to study structurally. Over a decade of attempts have
not yielded any crystal structures, and the NMR structures (5,
8, 9) are fraught with problems. The cis-trans isomerization
hypothesis has yet to be proven but aids in advancing the
understanding of the dynamic nature of the IGF-I molecules
structure, which could be a possible explanation, apart from
the aggregation tendencies of IGF-I, for this elusiveness.
Detailed studies of the intermolecular interactions between

IGF-I and IGF-IzIGFBP-1 mixtures flowed over immobilized
IGF-I receptor. The plot shows the relative response in resonance
units (RU) plotted against time for the different ligand mixtures with a
16 nM IGF-I concentration.
IGFBP-1 Binding Epitope on IGF-I 24705human growth hormone and the soluble form of its receptor
(hGHbp) have shown that the functional binding epitope, con￾tributing to the actual binding energy, can be significantly
smaller than the structural binding epitope, as defined by x-ray
crystallography (17). While human growth hormone involves
33 side chains in the interaction with hGHbp, two of these
contribute 75% of the total binding energy. In this regard, it is
interesting to probe the importance of single residues within
the structural IGFBP-1 binding epitope on IGF-I defined by the
NMR experiments. Arginine side chain guanidino groups are
found to be central in stabilizing interactions between proteins
(45), between proteins and drugs (46), and between proteins
and DNA (47), and they therefore constitute logical targets for
such probing. Given the observed involvement of IGF-I argi￾nine side chains in IGFBP-1 binding by NMR spectroscopy, we
have concentrated our initial probing, presented in this report,
to the six arginine residues surrounding the identified struc￾tural binding epitope.
The CD secondary structure analysis shows that the argi￾nine to alanine mutants have similar secondary structure con￾tent as native IGF-I and are likely to share the same overall
fold. This contrasts with our previous study on IGF-I alanine
scanning mutants of the IGF-I B-helix region (19) (residues
8–18), where structural aberrations occurred in single substi￾tuted variants, resulting in altered kinetic properties due to the
change in structure. The present mutants are all at charged
surface residues, positions apparently less influential on the
overall structure. The measured changes in binding character￾istics are thus likely to be only the result of side chain proper￾ties and not contributions from global structural rearrange￾ments in the molecule.
One arginine residue, Arg50, is unambiguously determined
by biosensor technology to be involved in IGFBP-1 binding,
since the R50A mutant has about a third of the wild type
affinity. The R36A/R37A double mutant affinity is also low￾ered, but the individual amino acid contributions cannot be
distinguished. The observed decreased association and minor
influence on dissociation for these mutants is consistent with
neutralizing charged residues that contribute to binding elec￾trostatically during association but do not contribute signifi￾cantly to the stability of the formed complex.
From these results and from data in the literature, we can
make a model of the patch on IGF-I involved in IGFBP-1
binding (Fig. 6). The surface expands from the small surface
patch of previously identified amino acids 1–4 (15, 16) and
49–51 (16) with one arm into the area of residues 36/37. The
36/37 region is known also to be important for IGF-IR binding.
Therefore, these measurements would explain why IGFBP-1
and IGF-IR binding is competitive. The effects of the arginine
mutants on receptor binding shows that the affinities are af￾fected to a greater extent than in IGFBP-1 binding. The asso￾ciation rate decreases in all cases, although significantly only
for R21A, R50A, and especially the C-region R36A/R37A double
mutant. The importance of the C-region (residues 30–41) in
IGF-IR binding has been stated previously (48). The increased
dissociation rates for the R21A, R36A/R37A, and R56A vari￾ants show the direct involvement of these residues in IGF￾IzIGF-IR complex stabilization.
The IGF-IzIGFBP-1 complex does not associate to immobi￾lized IGF-I receptor (Fig. 5). This observation leads to the
conclusion that only free IGF-I is capable of binding to the
IGF-IR, since the binding determinants on IGF-I for IGFBP-1
and IGF-IR are overlapping. It is consequently likely that the
reverse experiment, attempting to accelerate IGF-I disassocia￾tion from IGF-IR by the presence of IGFBP-1, would show no
difference because of the overlapping IGF-IR and IGFBP-1
binding epitopes on IGF-I. The finding that the receptor un￾dergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding (20),
possibly hiding the ligand further, supports this conclusion.
The IGF-I arginines are highly conserved in vertebrates. The
only common variant is the arginine to glutamine substitution
at position 50 in chicken, frog, and salmon. The arginine at
position 55 is interesting in that it actually has a slower IG￾FBP-1 association compared with the R55A mutant. We con￾clude that arginine 55 is not directly involved in stabilizing
IGF-IR binding, and the conservation of this residue therefore
suggests that it is important for other functions (e.g. specificity
in binding to other ligands, such as other IGFBPs or receptors).
It has previously been demonstrated that replacement of the
homologous residues in IGF-II, Ala-Leu, to the IGF-I sequence
FIG. 6. Molecular surfaces of IGF-I (5) rendered by the modeling software ICM (50) showing the residues for which chemical shift
perturbations are detected upon complexation with IGFBP-1 at 30 °C (green) (a) and arginine residues found in this work to affect
the IGFBP-1 binding affinity upon mutations to alanine (dark blue), residues found through deletion or mutation by others to be
involved in IGFBP-1 binding (light blue; residues 1–3 (15), 4 (16), and 49–51 (16)), and arginine residues found in this work not to
be involved in IGFBP-1 binding (light red) (b). Residues for which two conformational forms are found at 30 °C in the absence of IGFBP-1
and that exhibit chemical shift perturbations upon complexation (Lys68, Ser69, and Ala70) are indicated in a in a lighter shade of green, since their
involvement in the structural epitope is less clear. The Ala67 residue is labeled, since it also can be found in two conformational forms at 30 °C.
24706 IGFBP-1 Binding Epitope on IGF-IArg-Arg will decrease IGF-II/M6-P receptor binding (1). IGF-I
residues 55 and 56 are thus important modulators of IGF
receptor specificity.
In this paper, we present data that enhance the understand￾ing of the interaction of IGFBP-1 and IGF-I by defining amino
acid residues of IGF-I as being part of the binding patch with
IGFBP-1. The methods used include heteronuclear NMR to
identify possible amino acid residues involved in binding and
mutagenesis to verify functional involvement in binding. Res￾idues Pro2
, Glu3
, Cys6
, Gly7
, Gly19, Pro28–Gly30, Gly32, Arg36,
Arg37, Gln40–Gly42, Pro63, Lys65, Pro66, and Lys68–Ala70 were
identified by the NMR spectroscopy analyses as structurally
affected by binding. In addition, a number of arginine residues
that are possibly structurally involved in binding were identi￾fied by the NMR studies, and these were mutated to test for
functional involvement in the interaction. We conclude that
residues 36/37 and residue 50 are functionally involved in
IGFBP-1 binding, while residues 21, 55, and 56 are not. Resi￾dues 36/37 (together with 21 and 56) are also involved in
binding to the IGF-I receptor. This explains the competitive
binding of IGFBP-1 and IGF-IR to IGF-I, since the presence of
either will partly block the other’s binding surface on IGF-I.
