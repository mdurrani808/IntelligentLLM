An additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm for the inter￾action of members of the Kazal family of protein inhibitors with six
selected serine proteinases is described. Ten consensus variable
contact positions in the inhibitor were identified, and the 19
possible variants at each of these positions were expressed. The
free energies of interaction of these variants and the wild type
were measured. For an additive system, this data set allows for the
calculation of all possible sequences, subject to some restrictions.
The algorithm was extensively tested. It is exceptionally fast so
that all possible sequences can be predicted. The strongest, the
most specific possible, and the least specific inhibitors were de￾signed, and an evolutionary problem was solved.
The pioneers of protein chemistry (1, 2) demonstrated that for
many proteins the sequence suffices to specify reactivity.
This demonstration was equivalent to showing that for such
proteins sequence to reactivity algorithms (SRAs) must exist.
However, the search for such SRAs was not highly productive
and was largely stalled by looking for these SRAs in two steps:
sequence to folding and folding to reactivity. Our SRA relies in
its first step on recognition of homology. In the second and more
difficult step, it relies on additivity.
Additivity is a major predictive principle in chemistry (3). In
protein chemistry amino acid residue additivity was studied by
various workers as soon as site-specific mutagenesis became
tractable. Additivity was applied to various protein reactions,
among them protein unfolding, protein–protein and protein–
ligand association, enzyme kinetics, and hydrolysis of internal
peptide bonds in proteins (4–14). The use of the additivity
principle in biochemistry recently was reviewed (15).
Here we report on a successful, 20-year-long (16) effort to
determine an additivity-based SRA (Fig. 1) for predicting the
equilibrium constants of some serine proteinases with members
of the Kazal family (17, 18) of standard mechanism (17),
canonical (19) protein inhibitors. This family is named after L.
Kazal, discoverer of the first of the pancreatic secretory trypsin
inhibitors, PSTI, that are present in all vertebrates. The family
has many members. Among them are ovomucoids, abundant
proteins in avian egg whites, which consist of three tandem Kazal
domains (20). Ovomucoids from closely related species of birds
were shown to differ strikingly in their inhibitory specificity (21).
Ovomucoid third domains from 153 species of birds were
isolated and sequenced (22–24), and their interactions with
serine proteinases were studied. The strongest association equi￾librium constant, Ka, for a member of this set is 1.4 3 1012 M21;
the weakest measured is 7.1 3 102 M21. These results underscore
the need for an algorithm because identifying a protein as an
ovomucoid third domain does not predict that it will or will not
be an effective inhibitor of a particular serine proteinase.
Aside from the large range of Ka values among closely related
natural variants, additional strong reasons for choosing a stan￾dard mechanism, canonical inhibitor family, were the anticipated
additivity of individual contact residue contributions (see below)
and the availability in our laboratory of techniques for measuring
Ka values for enzyme-inhibitor pairs over the 103 M21 to 1013
M21 dynamic range with an accuracy of 620%.
Materials and Methods
Enzymes. Bovine chymotrypsin Aa (CHYM) and subtilisin Carls￾berg (CARL) were purchased from Worthington and Sigma,
respectively, and human leukocyte elastase (HLE) was from
Elastin Products, St. Louis. Porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE),
freed from all chymotrypsin and trypsin activity, was a gift from
the late M. Laskowski, Sr. (Roswell Park Memorial Institute,
Buffalo, NY). Streptomyces griseus proteinases A and B (SGPA
and SGPB) were purified in this laboratory from pronase. These
were compared with standards given by D. A. Estell (Genencor
International, Palo Alto, CA), L. Smillie (University of Alberta),
and J. Travis (University of Georgia, Athens).
Natural Kazal Domains. Natural ovomucoid third domains were
prepared and characterized as described (22–24). Natural ovo￾mucoid first domains were obtained by CNBr cleavage of entire
ovomucoid for OMHPA1 (from gray partridge, Perdix perdix)
and OMHMP1 (from Himalayan monal pheasant, Lophophorus
imperianus), and by thermolysin hydrolysis for OMBWS1 (from
black-winged stilt, Himantopus himantopus). They were charac￾terized by amino acid analysis and sequencing. The R44S variant
of human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (HPSTI) and
goose pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor are described in
Table 3.

Results and Discussion
Selection of Targets and the Wild Type. Among the natural third
domains we sequenced most are effective inhibitors of some
chymotrypsins, elastases, and subtilisins. Only a few inhibit trypsins
and Glu-specific SGP (27). None are effective inhibitors of furin
and proprotein convertases. Therefore, we selected six enzymes:
CHYM, PPE, CARL, SGPA, SGPB, and HLE. All are among the
best studied of serine proteinases. Three are bacterial and three are
mammalian. They all have hydrophobic S1 pockets that range from
small (PPE) to very large (CHYM). All of them are strongly
inhibited by OMTKY3 (28) as are many other enzymes. In addition,
OMTKY3 very nearly represents the most probable sequence
among the 153 species we examined (24). Therefore, it was chosen
as the wild type.
Selection of Contact Positions. X-ray crystallography of complexes
of OMTKY3, of many of its variants, and of some PSTI variants
with SGPB, CHYM and HLE showed that a consensus set of 12
contact positions in the inhibitors is in contact with the enzymes
(29–34) (Fig. 2). When sequences of ovomucoid third domains
from 153 species are compared, the seven most variable positions
in the 51 residue domains all lie in the consensus contact residue
set (24). Analysis of Kas of most of these variants indicates that
changes among the residues in the consensus contact set fre￾quently cause very large changes in Ka. In sharp contrast, changes
in noncontact residues often do not affect Ka values beyond
experimental error. The few clear Ka changes caused by non￾contact residues are all small. Therefore, it appears that the 12
residue consensus set suffices to determine changes in Ka relative
to OMTKY3. However, further reduction is possible. Most of the
hypervariable contact residues are also highly exposed but two
of the contact residues, P3 Cys-16 and P159 Asn-33, serve clear
structural roles and show no (P3) or very little variation (P159)
from sequence to sequence. This strong conservation at P3 and
P159 persists in all of the 471 known sequences (see data at
http:yywww.chem.purdue.eduyLASKOWSKI) of Kazal inhibi￾tors. Therefore, we designated the remaining 10-residue set
(Figs. 1 and 2) as the variable consensus contact set.

residues (47). The 12 colored residues comprise the consensus contact residue set
(24, 29–31). Of these 12, the two in green are structural and accept very few
mutations in evolution. In contrast, the remaining 10 are hypervariable (22, 48).
Changing one of the white (noncontact) residues for another has little effect on
DG°, whereas changing one of the colored ones often has a very large effect.

BIOCHEMISTRYExpression of Variants, Measurement of DG°. Because additivity will
be assumed, to have a general SRA we need to have the wild type
(OMTKY3) and 19 possible coded variants at each of the 10
variable contact positions. Happily, all 191 variants could be
expressed and were soluble and stable. The 191 3 6 5 1,146
equilibrium constants for the interaction of each variant with our
six selected enzymes were measured. The values for P1 variants
were already reported (25). The remainder will be published
separately and may be requested now from the corresponding
author. Again happily, all of the equilibrium constants fell into
the 103 M21 to 1013 M21 dynamic range of measurements. The
lowest was 4.8 3 103 M21 and the highest was 8.2 3 1012 M21.
This was not a foregone conclusion. In a set of seven eglin C
variants at P1, the Leu-45 variant (wild type) interacts with
SGPA and SGPB too strongly for direct measurement whereas
the Asp-45 and Glu-45 variants interact with PPE too weakly
(35). For each of the six selected enzymes, for variants at each
of the 10 variable consensus contact positions, i, there are 19
association equilibrium constants Ka(X). These were converted
to DG°(X) 5 2RT ln Ka (X) values. These in turn were converted
at each of the 10 variable consensus contact positions to DDG°
(XTKY i X) 5 DG° (X) 2 DG° OMTKY3 values.
The SRA. If a variant differs from OMTKY3 only by changes
among the 51 2 12 5 39 noncontact positions, we state that its
predicted DG° is simply the value for OMTKY3. If a substitution
is among the 10 variable consensus residues, we add to DG°TKY
the single DDG° (XTKY i X) term. For more changes in contact,
we sum the DDG° (XTKY i X) terms

The simple additivity of the DDG° (XTKY i X) is the major
approximation involved in this work. It is its use that makes our
SRA so simple. There are some restrictions on the application
of Eq. 1 to predict DG° for the association of any Kazal domain
with any of the six enzymes we selected. Many Kazal family
members are present in multidomain proteins, such as ovomu￾coid (20). Here we predict only for single Kazal domains, such
as PSTI or for isolated domains of multidomain proteins such as
turkey ovomucoid. The decision not to vary the green residues
in Fig. 2 (P3 Cys-16 and P159 Asn-33) requires that these must be
present in all of the inhibitors we predict. A group of Kazal
inhibitors, called nonclassical (36), have at P5 a disulfide-bridged
Cys. We have no information on disulfide-bridged Cys, only on
reduced Cys. The SRA is based on an assumption that the
variable consensus contact set of residues is additive. This
additivity is equivalent to assuming that the interactions, if any,
among the contact residues present in the free inhibitors do not
change appreciably on formation of complexes with enzymes.
This assumption is not valid for the P2 Thr-17–P19 Glu-19 residue
pair (Fig. 2). The side chains of these two residues are hydrogen￾bonded to each other in the free inhibitor (37). The hydrogen
bond shortens on complex formation with SGPB (29) and
CHYM (30) but not with HLE (31). The same shortening is seen
when the structure of variant 3 of PSTI (38) (this variant has P2
Thr-17 and P19 Glu-19) is compared in free inhibitor and in
complex with chymotrypsinogen (34). A few tests based on DDG°
value indicate major P2–P19 pair nonadditivity. We therefore
restrict our predictions to the 39 P2–P19 pairs we measured rather
than to all possible 400 pairs. A simple wording of the restriction
is that either P2 Thr or P19 Glu (or both) must be present. The
elimination of this restriction would widen the scope of SRA to
more Kazal inhibitors, and in other protein systems there will be
patches of nonadditivity in generally additive situations. For
avian ovomucoid third domains where the P2 Thr–P19 Glu is very
common, the P2–P19 restriction allows one to deal with substan￾tial majority of the domains. For Kazal inhibitors at large where
this is not common, the current SRA encompasses a significant
minority (about 30%) of sequenced domains.
Testing the SRA. To use Eq. 1 to obtain DG°
predicted, we need only
the sequence of the Kazal domain of interest. Therefore, there
is no need to have the protein. However, to test the SRA, we
need to have the protein to obtain its DGmeasured ° for interaction
with the enzymes.
DG8
I 5 DG8

measured. [2]
The subscript I on DG°
I was designed (7) to indicate interactions
and therefore to be a measure of nonadditivity. In our system,
the nonadditivity component of this term is a measure of the
change in interactions on complex formation. However, DG°
I also
contains two other terms. One arises from the changes in
noncontact residues (white circles in Fig. 2), which are neglected
in Eq. 1. The other arises from errors in measurement of DG°
values as DGmeasured ° (directly) and more importantly DG°
predicted
(indirectly) involve such measurements.
The test set of proteins for an SRA can be either designed or
natural. In our case, the choice was easy. We already had a set of
DG° values for the interaction of the six enzymes we study with 92
different, natural ovomucoid third domains. The contact residues in
these domains are hypervariable (24). These domains were gath￾ered to serve as a primary data source for the construction of the
SRA (4, 39). As we became facile with the production of recom￾binant OMTKY3 variants in the 1990s (25), the acquisition of
natural variants ceased. The SRA described above is based solely
on the data on 190 single variants of OMTKY3 in the contact region
(Fig. 2) and on the OMTKY3 itself. The set of the natural variant
data were thus available as a test set. The raw test set contains
somewhat less (443) than 92 3 6 5 552 DG° values as limitations
in the amounts of available material did not allow for the deter￾mination of some binding constants for weak interactions. The 443
DG° values were sieved for sequences that meet the current SRA
restrictions and 398 remained. Predictions were made for all of
them (Eq. 1) and the DG°
I values (Eq. 2) were calculated. The
average absolute value of DG°
I is 510 calymol. This is small com￾pared with the range of 13.5 Kcalymol in DG°. It is also small
compared with the expectations of inhibitor designers. Surprisingly,
this value is significantly smaller than the 900 calymol for the set of
17 P1 variants of OMTKY3 interacting with SGPB (40) based on the

Our predictions here are based on the SRA and the sequence alone.
Eqs. 1 and 2 lend themselves to error analysis. From the fits
obtained and the reproducibility of the about 3,000 DG° values
determined in our laboratory, we conclude that the average
standard deviation, s, is DG° 6 100 calymol. This finding
corresponds to log Ka 6 0.075 and Ka 6 20%. Note that this is
an average value. At both the upper Ka 5 1013 M21 and lower Ka
5 103 M21
, s is much greater. s is significantly smaller for
OMTKY3, which was measured very frequently and served as a
control in various experiments. However, in view of the difficulties
in estimating individual s values, we consider only a constant one.
We make the calculations at 2s level.
In Eq. 2, both DGmeasured ° and DG°
predicted have experimental
errors. For DGmeasured ° , it is s. For DG°
predicted, the error depends
on k, the number of variable consensus contact residues in
OMTKY3 that are replaced by others in the predicted variant.
Eq. 2 can be rewritten as:

because each DDG° (XTKY i X) term is the difference between
DG° (Xi) and DG°
TKY. Of the terms of interest to us here, the DG°
(Xi) terms and the DGmeasured ° terms are independent variables.
On the other hand, when several DG°
TKY terms occur, these are
not. For the entire system

We divided the entire 398-member DG° measured set on the
basis of the number of contact region substitutions. Cases where
DG°
I is within the limits of Eq. 4 are called additive, outside the
limits but within twice the limits partially additive, and outside
that nonadditive (Table 1). Obviously larger absolute errors were
allowed at k 5 6 than for k 5 0 (changes not in contact).
However, after that correction is made, small deviations from
additivity will not show at all at k 5 0 and 1 as there is no
additivity there. Such corrections are expected to be much
smaller for k 5 2 where there is only one potential pairwise
nonadditivity than at k 5 6 where there are many pairwise, triple,
quadruple, pentuple, and one hexuple potential nonadditivities.
The 398 DGmeasured ° set also was divided according to the
enzyme (Table 2). Clearly, CARL is the worst. It is the only
member of the subtilin family of enzymes in our set. Also there
is no three-dimensional structure of OMTKY3 or any Kazal
inhibitor in complex with CARL, even though there are many
structures of CARL in complex with other standard mechanism
(17), canonical (19) protein inhibitors. Thus, some of its contact
residues may not be in the consensus set. SGPA is the best. We
are unable to account for its difference from SGPB but we use
SGPA for calculation of the distribution of DG° values for all
possible contact region sequences.
The test above was made on avian ovomucoid third domains
that are similar to OMTKY3. For these, the largest k value is 6.
It will be more interesting to make a comparably large test with
other members of the Kazal family. However, only a small set was
available. Table 3 summarizes what we obtained after sieving this
set for our restrictions, which in this case were more bothersome
than for avian ovomucoid third domain. The two top sequences
are for PSTIs, the bottom three for avian ovomucoid first
domains. It should be noted that domains in many multidomain
Kazal inhibitors could be readily divided into a type and b type
domains (41). Ovomucoid first and second domains are a type
whereas the third domains are b type. Therefore, ovomucoid first
and third domains while homologous are very different proteins.
For HPSTI and OMHMP1 k 5 8; for the three other compar￾isons k 5 9, the largest number allowed by our sieve. Of the 17
cases where comparisons could be made, 15 are additive, one is
partially additive and one is nonadditive, a somewhat similar
distribution as in ovomucoid third domains. On this limited

BIOCHEMISTRYnumber of tests, we conclude that SRA holds for all Kazal
inhibitors provided that the restrictions are met.
Why do Kazal inhibitors work so well in the SRA? (i) The
association is nearly lock and key rather than induced fit. (ii) The
putative P1 residue always inserts into the S1 cavity of the
enzyme, however deleterious this is to local binding. (iii) Com￾pared with other protein reactions the DDG° terms observed
here are very large. (iv) In contrast to antigen–antibody inter￾actions the main chain–main chain contributes importantly to
the interaction energy (42). (v) In contrast to nuclease–nuclease
protein inhibitor system, the side-chain interactions are largely
hydrophobic and not electrostatic (10). (vi) The inhibitor is
globally convex and local interactions are mainly of the inhibi￾tor’s side chains inserting into the enzyme’s pockets. (vii) A
method of measuring Kas accurately and over a wide dynamic
range is available. Many of us think that it is the last of these that
is most important for success.
It seems highly likely that the SRAs can be developed for several
other families of standard mechanism canonical protein inhibitors
of serine proteinases. However, what is most intriguing is whether
additivity-based SRAs can be developed for some other protein–
ligand and protein–protein interactions. We are hopeful.
Applications of the Additivity-Based SRA. Eq. 1 is very simple. Aside
from the SRA data that are already available, it requires only the
sequence of the variable consensus contact set. Therefore, the value
of DG° can be predicted for proteins whose sequences are known
only from DNA sequencing and that were never isolated or
expressed. We made many such predictions. Predictions also can be
made for postulated nodal sequences in phylogenetic trees or for
sequences constructed to meet some design objectives (see example
below). Because the additivity-based SRA is so very fast many
potential designs can be screened before settling on the ones we
want to express. But most surprisingly we can calculate DG° values
for all possible sequences of Kazal inhibitors interacting with a
stated enzyme.
For the demonstration, we chose SGPA as it is the most additive.
However, studies with the five other enzymes gave similar results.
Subject to our restrictions (see above) there are 39 3 208 > 1012
possible sequences that affect the value of DG°. All of these were
calculated on a personal computer in a few days. There was not
enough memory to store them all but their distribution could be
compiled and is given in Fig. 3. Even though it appears continuous
it is not. There is a largest (weakest possible inhibitor) DG° value on
the left side (not shown) and smallest (strongest possible inhibitor)
shown on the right side. This value could have been obtained from
the calculation but additivity provides an even simpler way (39). A
sequence composed of best residues at each of the 10 positions is
the best possible sequence. Such sequences and their Kas are listed
for all six enzymes in Table 4. They are all very strong. All are larger
than the 1013 M21 upper limit of the measurement range. Additivity
allows for simple calculation of the weakest possible Ka (largest
DG°) but this is not likely to be useful. Additivity also allows for the
calculation of the average DG° (25.13 kcalymol for SGPA).
The designs in Table 4 are not only very strong but generally
rather specific for only one of the six enzymes. There are a few
exceptions. The strongest inhibitor for SGPB is less than 10-fold
stronger for SGPB than SGPA. It is possible to sacrifice some of
the strength for specificity (39). Table 5 lists the results. The
inhibitors are now very specific and still moderately strong. The
opposite notion (not shown) is of interest. Defense against
parasites is a postulated function of many proteinase inhibitors.
As there are very many possible parasites, least specific inhibitors
may well be nature’s goal.
It is of interest to compare the distribution of all possible
variants to that of a large set of natural variants. The predicted
values (predicted because the lowest values on the left are too
weak to measure) for all species of birds, whose ovomucoid third
domains were sequenced and comply with our restrictions
(140y153) are shown in red (Fig. 3). It is seen that the variance
of this distribution is narrower than that of all possible values and
that they are much stronger than the average of all possible Kazal
inhibitors. Except for the few very weak ones they fall in the
measurable range. Nature appears to evolve very strong but not
strongest possible inhibitors.

Based on our SRA, these sequences in a Kazal inhibitor scaffold are predicted to produce greatest possible Kas (in bold) for each enzyme at pH 8.3, 21°C. Only
the residues in the consensus contact region (see Fig. 2) are shown. C denotes half cystine, C denotes cysteine.
1414 u www.pnas.org Lu et al.The comparison of the distributions allows us to answer an
interesting question in evolution. The variable consensus residue
sets of Kazal inhibitors are hypervariable, and yet the residues in
this set exert very large effects on DG° values. This is an apparent
contradiction. According to the widely accepted neutral muta￾tion theory (43), the structural and functional residues in pro￾teins are conserved. It is the surface residues that are not
functionally important that rapidly fix mutations. If inhibition of
serine proteinases were not the function of ovomucoids, there
would be no paradox (44). But the superposition of the two
distributions clearly implies that the residues in the consensus
contact set are selected for strong inhibition and one of the
functions of ovomucoids is the inhibition of serine proteinases.
Having the complete distribution of reactivity parameters for
all possible variants of a protein was highly useful. We anticipate
that the readers will come up with many better uses of such data
and that such uses will drive others to attempt to develop
additivity-based SRAs for the systems they study.

mechanism, replaced residues near the reactive site, and characterized
ovomucoid. Early work on structures of avian ovomucoid third domains
by W. Bode and R. Huber was of great importance. M. Laskowski, Sr.,
L. Smillie, J. Travis, W. Bachovchin, and N. Yoshida donated serine
proteinases. M. C. Laskowski helped with error analysis, and M. J.
Laskowski assisted with the title. The National Institutes of Health
supported this research at Purdue for the first 18 (of 20) years.
