ABSTRACT: A series of mutants of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), at residues involved in intramolecular
interactions that shape and constrain the binding loop, were studied to determine their relative importance
for inhibition of the serine protease subtilisin BPN′, and for resistance of the inhibitor to proteolysis.
These functional properties were investigated in tandem with the crystal structures of the mutant inhibitor￾enzyme complexes. A dense hydrogen bonding network that supports the binding loop in the vicinity of
the scissile bond was found to be important both for enzyme affinity and for stability to proteolysis.
Structural analysis, in combination with biochemical measurements, allows differentiation of the structural
components most important for resistance to proteolysis and/or binding. The most critical participating
residues in the network were found to be Thr-58, Glu-60, Arg-65, and Gly-83. Glu-60 is more important
for resistance to proteolysis than for binding, while Arg-65 and two other Arg residues play a greater role
in binding than in resistance to proteolysis. Structural comparisons reveal a wide variety of subtle
conformational changes in response to mutation, with built-in robustness in the hydrogen bond network,
such that loss of one contact is compensated by other new contacts.
Chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2)1 inhibits the serine protease
subtilisin by binding in the active site with a dissociation
constant of 3.0 × 10-12, and resisting proteolysis (3, 4). It
was previously thought that inhibition by CI2 and a large
class of similar protein inhibitors might be caused by a barrier
to reaction, perhaps due to extreme rigidity at the enzyme￾inhibitor interface or misalignment of reacting groups. Our
earlier work has shown, however, that CI2 acylates subtilisin
BPN′ rapidly, but that further reaction is retarded because
peptide religation is favored over hydrolytic attack on the
acyl-enzyme complex; in Scheme 1, k-2 is much greater
than k3, resulting in an apparent equilibrium between the
Michaelis complex and the acyl-enzyme complex (3). We
refer to this phenomenon as the clogged gutter mechanism,
in which the tight and oriented binding of the leaving group
peptide (H2N-R′ in Scheme 1) prevents acyl-enzyme
hydrolysis and product dissociation, favoring the back
reaction (3). The root of the inhibitory power of CI2 therefore
lies in the resistance of the acyl-enzyme complex to
hydrolysis. Our previous studies have found that side chain
interactions between CI2 binding loop residues and subtilisin
contribute only modestly to proteolytic resistance (5), while
interactions with the CI2 protein core that stabilize the
conformation of the binding loop backbone are the primary
determinants of this resistance (6). Here we investigate
intramolecular contacts between the CI2 core and the binding
loop that control binding loop conformation and mediate
inhibitory function.
Examination of the structure of the CI2-subtilisin BPN′
complex reveals that the binding loop of CI2 protrudes from
the globular hydrophobic core of the inhibitor, supported and
conformationally constrained by a grouping of polar and
charged residues forming a dense network of hydrogen bonds
and electrostatic interactions [the H-bond network (3, 6-8)]
(Figure 1). These residues serve to facilitate enzyme￾inhibitor recognition by shaping the binding loop backbone
into a conformation complementary to the enzyme active
site. Residues of the H-bond network flank the cleavage site
targeted by subtilisin, leading us to speculate that this
network may play a key role in the retention and orientation
of the leaving group peptide following formation of the acyl￾enzyme complex, preventing hydrolysis and favoring reli￾gation.

Published on Web 04/16/2005In this paper, we use mutagenesis to analyze the impor￾tance of each residue in the H-bond network of CI2, both
for the initial binding step, as measured by enzyme-inhibitor
dissociation constants, and for the subsequent clogged gutter
effect, as measured by overall rates of inhibitor hydrolysis.
We mutated each H-bonding side chain to Ala, including
Thr-58, Glu-60, Arg-62, Arg-65, and Arg-67, and deleted
the H-bonding C-terminal Gly-83. We also constructed three
additional mutants, Thr-58 f Pro, Glu-60 f Ser, and the
double mutant Met-59 f Arg/Glu-60 f Ser, since analogous
mutations of eglin c, a homologue of CI2, have been
previously reported to result in more rapid cleavage of that
inhibitor (9). We report the effects of each of these mutations
on the dissociation constants between CI2 and subtilisin, and
on the rates of cleavage of CI2 by subtilisin. We also report
crystal structures for the CI2 mutants in complex with
subtilisin BPN′, allowing us to correlate changes in hydroly￾sis and binding with structural features.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Subtilisin BPN′. His-tagged recombinant subtilisin BPN′
was prepared as described previously (6). Active enzyme
concentrations were determined by a kinetic assay with
succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide as described previ￾ously (6).
CI2. Truncated recombinant CI2 was expressed and
purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (6).
Throughout the text, we use the amino acid numbering of
the original full-length protein sequence. The CI2 expression
construct was mutagenized using the PCR-based QuikChange
method (Stratagene); the mutant expression constructs were
verified by DNA sequencing. Mutant CI2 proteins were
expressed and purified following the same protocols used
for the wild-type inhibitor (6). Wild-type and mutant CI2
concentrations were determined by peak integration from
HPLC absorbance traces and by titration with subtilisin BPN′
at a known concentration, as described previously (6).
Subtilisin Inhibition (binding) Studies. CI2 is a potent slow,
tight-binding inhibitor of subtilisin (4). Inhibition constants
(Ki) were calculated from the reduced rates of subtilisin hy￾drolysis of a chromogenic substrate, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro￾Phe-p-nitroanilide, in the presence of wild-type or mutant
CI2; all assay conditions, procedures, equations, and analyses
have been described in detail previously (6). The reported Ki
values represent mean values from two or more experiments.
Hydrolysis Studies. The initial linear rate of depletion of
intact CI2 in time course incubations with subtilisin BPN′
was monitored by HPLC, as described previously (6). For
each time point, HPLC injections were performed in dupli￾cate, and remaining CI2 quantities were determined by peak
integration of absorbance traces and comparison to standard
curves generated from known quantities of pure CI2 (6).
Crystallization. Most mutant complexes were crystallized
by vapor diffusion essentially as described previously (5).
Lyophilized subtilisin BPN′ and CI2 were each dissolved in
10 mM NaOAc (pH 5.8), and were mixed in a 1:1.2
stoichiometric molar ratio, at a total protein concentration
of 4-6 mg/mL. Crystals were grown at 4 °C in hanging
drops, typically over a reservoir of 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH
4.6), 20% 2-propanol, and 15% PEG 2000; drops were
prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein and reservoir
solutions. Variations in the protocol for individual CI2
mutants were as follows: the E60A and R67A CI2 com￾plexes were crystallized with 15% PEG monomethyl ether
750; the R62A CI2 complex was crystallized with 15% PEG
4000; and the E60S CI2 complex was crystallized with 15%
PEG 4000, with 4% acetone added to the crystallization drops
and reservoir. The M59R/E60S CI2 complex was crystallized
in the P21 crystal form by microseeding a drop containing
1.5 mg/mL total protein, 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 4.6), 20%
2-propanol, and 15% PEG 2000, with seeds obtained by
dounce homogenization of poorer quality M59R/E60S CI2
complex crystals. The M59R/E60S CI2 complex was crystal￾lized in the P61 crystal form by the hanging drop method
over a reservoir of 25% PEG 8000 and 0.05 M potassium
phosphate (pH 4.5), at a total protein concentration of 4 mg/
mL. The R65A CI2 complex was crystallized by macro￾seeding into a drop containing 1 mg/mL total protein, 0.1
M sodium citrate (pH 4.6), 20% 2-propanol, and 15% PEG
2000, and with a subtilisin:CI2 stoichiometry of 1:3. The
R65A CI2 complex macroseeds were grown by microseeding
a similar drop with seeds obtained by dounce homogenization
of wild-type complex crystals.
Crystal Data Collection and Processing. For each variant
CI2 complex, synchrotron X-ray data were collected from a
single crystal at 100 K using an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD
detector at Advanced Light Source beamline 5.0.1 or 8.3.1
(Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA).
The automation package ELVES (10) was used to direct

fragments of CI2 are depicted as R and R′, respectively. The scissile
peptide bond targeted by the enzyme links the R fragment (residues
1-59) and the R′ fragment (residues 60-83).

(12) for scaling and merging the reflections. For all structures
except that of the M59R/E60S double mutant complex,
crystals were of space group P6522 and the same unit cell
observed for a previous series of mutant complexes (5), and
the structure of the M59K CI2-subtilisin BPN′ complex
(PDB entry 1TM3) was used as a starting model for
refinement. Test sets comprised of 5% of the total reflections,
inherited from the M59K CI2 complex, were excluded from
refinement to allow calculation of the free R-factors. For the
M59R/E60S double mutant complex, crystals were of space
group P21 or P61, with a unit cell not observed previously.
The initial models for these structures were obtained by
molecular replacement using EPMR (13), using as the search
model the wild-type CI2-subtilisin complex in space group
P212121 (PDB entry 1LW6), with solvent molecules omitted
(3). All models were improved through alternating cycles
of manual rebuilding using the interactive graphics program
O (14), automated refinement using REFMAC5 (15), and
automated solvent addition using ARP/WARP (16). Model
validation was carried out using PROCHECK (12) and
WHATCHECK (17). Superpositions were performed using
GEM (18), and structure figures were generated with
InsightII (Biosym Technologies).
RESULTS
Inhibition Constants and Hydrolysis Rates of CI2 Mutants
ReVeal DiVerse Effects that Range from Negligible to Greater
Than 3 Orders of Magnitude. The data from inhibition and
hydrolysis studies with the CI2 mutants are presented in
Table 1; the Ki is equal to the dissociation constant Kd, and
kcat is the overall rate of turnover. These results are consistent
with previous mutational studies of CI2 (8, 19). Among the
residues mutated in this study, central participants in the
H-bonding network Gly-83, Glu-60, and Thr-58 prove to be
the most critical for resistance to hydrolysis, followed by
Arg-65. A similar pattern is seen in the effect on inhibition,
but with Arg-65 playing a greater role. Mutation of Arg-62,
a peripheral participant in the H-bonding network, has
comparatively little effect on hydrolysis or inhibition, while
mutation of Arg-67 has an intermediate effect.
All Mutants except G83∆ CI2 Were Crystallized in
Complex with Subtilisin BPN′. Most of the CI2 mutant
complexes were successfully crystallized with only minor
variations in conditions employed previously for the CI2-
subtilisin complex (5). The crystals were rod-shaped with
hexagonal cross sections, and belonged to space group P65-
22. However, three of the mutant complexes, those with the
R65A, M59R/E60S, and G83∆ CI2 variants, proved to be
resistant to crystallization. For these mutants, we extensively
screened additional additives and attempted a variety of
methods of seeding nucleation. Suspecting that the difficulty
might relate to hydrolysis of these CI2 mutants by subtilisin
under the conditions of crystallization, we also screened
higher ratios of CI2 to subtilisin. For the R65A mutant
complex, we eventually achieved success through heteroge￾neous microseeding with wild-type complex crystal seeds,
followed by macroseeding into fresh protein drops. The cross
seeding resulted in epitaxial growth in a crystal lattice
indistinguishable from that of the wild-type complex. For
the M59R/E60S CI2 complex, crystals eventually formed
spontaneously in additive screens, but these were imperfect
clusters of thin needles that diffracted poorly. Serial micro￾seeding produced long, thin rectangular plates of space group
P21, with a unique unit cell. The M59R/E60S CI2 complex
also crystallized in another crystal form, belonging to space
group P65, under different conditions identified in a sparse
matrix screen. These crystals were star-shaped and quite
fragile, with more limited diffraction resolution. For the
G83∆ CI2 complex, all of the methods described above were
attempted repeatedly, along with additional pH and temper￾ature screens, as well as variations in protein purification
procedures. We observed the growth of multiple crystal
forms; however, these crystals were invariably composed of
subtilisin alone. One of the crystal forms exhibited a low￾density lattice with a cavity adjacent to the active site large
enough to accommodate CI2. Mass spectrometric analysis
of washed crystals revealed the presence of many small
peptides derived from CI2, but no intact G83∆ CI2 was
detected. All attempts to produce crystals of the intact G83∆
CI2 complex failed.
Crystal Structures of CI2 Mutant Complexes ReVeal an
Interconnected H-Bond Network. X-ray structures, ranging
from 1.5 to 1.8 Å resolution, were obtained for complexes
of subtilisin BPN′ with all the CI2 mutants described except
the G83∆ mutant. A summary of data collection and
refinement statistics is presented in Table 2. Global structural
comparison indicates that no gross changes in the CI2
backbone structure have been introduced by the mutations.
Superpositions were based on the R-carbon positions of all
residues of subtilisin minus the His tag, plus the residues of
the CI2 binding loop (residues I56-I61). The residues of
the CI2 core were not used in superpositioning, because the
junction between the CI2 core and binding loop displays a
degree of flexibility, with slight hinge angle variations
between the mutant complexes. Average root-mean-square
(rms) deviations of the atoms used in superpositioning, from
the corresponding atoms in the wild-type structure, were
between 0.05 and 0.10 Å for all structures except the T58P
CI2 complex (0.157 Å) and the M59R/E60S CI2 complex
(0.235 Å).
In all structures, the backbone atom positioning of CI2
binding loop residues 58-63, encompassing the targeted
scissile bond, is essentially unchanged. In all cases, the
majority of the H-bonds are conserved, though subtle shifts
in side chain positions result in small changes in H-bond
donor to acceptor distances (Table 3). Though small, these
differences are significant and likely to indicate changes in
the strengths of the relevant interactions, since the estimated
standard uncertainties of atomic positions in all structures

CI2 Hydrogen Bond Network Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 18, 2005 6825are in the range of 0.04-0.07 Å based on a maximum
likelihood estimation (15). The CI2 binding loop residues
are among the more highly ordered protein regions in the
complexes, suggesting that the coordinate error associated
with these residues is lower than for average protein atoms.
Where H-bonding functional groups have been removed, we
observe a number of different structural effects stemming
from the mutations. In some structures, the functional group
and potential H-bonds are deleted with only very slight
conformational changes in surrounding residues and solvent
waters, while in other cases, new bridging waters are
incorporated into the H-bond network replacing the deleted
functional groups. In yet other instances, most notably with
the R65A CI2 mutant, more substantial reorganization of
adjacent side chains alters the H-bonding network such that
the most critical missing contacts are substituted with new
H-bonds (Figure 2).
Mutation of Thr-58 Results in the Loss of Loop-Stabilizing
H-Bonds. The structure of the T58A CI2 complex suggests
that the ∼100-fold increases in both dissociation constant
and hydrolysis rate with this mutant are largely attributable
to the loss of the H-bonds from Thr-58 to Glu-60 and Arg￾67. We observe no significant backbone adjustment, no
substantial alteration of the ordered solvent molecules, and
only very subtle changes in side chain positioning within
the H-bonding network, including closer contact between the
side chains of Glu-60 and Arg-67, which draw nearer by
0.4 Å (Figure 2A).
The greater impact on both dissociation constant and
hydrolysis rate of the T58P mutation can be attributed to
the loss of an additional hydrogen bond between the N atom
of Thr-58 of CI2 and the Gly-100 backbone carbonyl of
subtilisin. Loss of this intermolecular backbone H-bond
results in displacement of a subtilisin loop (residues 97-
101) by as much as 1.2 Å, relieving a potential steric clash
(Figure 3). We observe subtle adjustments in the H-bond
network similar to those seen in the T58A CI2 complex, and
in addition, Glu-60 displays partial occupancy of an alterna￾tive, non-H-bonding conformation.

6826 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 18, 2005 Radisky et al.Mutation of Glu-60 Results in Replacement of Cross-Loop
Side Chain H-Bonds with SolVent-Bridged H-Bonds. In the
E60A mutant complex, replacement of the Glu-60 carboxy￾late with two new bound solvent molecules causes the
observed substantial increase in both dissociation constant
and hydrolysis rate. The new waters S381 and S407 replace
the Glu-60 carboxylate oxygens, forming solvent-bridged
H-bonds (Figure 2C). The Arg-67 side chain also extends
slightly further than in the native inhibitor, shortening the
Arg-67 to Thr-58 contact by 0.3 Å.
Substitution of Glu-60 with Ser rather than Ala has a
slightly weaker impact on both inhibition and hydrolysis,
perhaps because the Ser-60 hydroxyl can form a direct
hydrogen bond with Arg-65. A new water molecule, S97,
bridges H-bonding contacts with Thr-58, Arg-65, and Ser￾60 (Figure 2D). As in the E60A CI2 complex structure, the
Arg-67 to Thr-58 distance is shortened by 0.5 Å.
Mutation of Arg-65 Results in Side Chain Rearrangement
and Formation of New H-Bonds, Compensating for Lost
Critical Contacts. Glu-60, Arg-65, and Gly-83 are held
together by a web of H-bonds and appear be a functional
unit. Gly-83 stabilizes the Arg-65 side chain conformation
such that it in turn supports the Glu-60 side chain. Since
mutation of Gly-83 or Glu-60 accelerates proteolytic hy￾drolysis greatly, one expects that mutation of the intervening
Arg-65 will have a similarly striking effect. The more
moderate rate of hydrolysis observed in the R65A CI2 mutant
at first appeared to be something of an anomaly. The
explanation may be found in the structure of the R65A
mutant complex, in which substantial reorganization of the
H-bonding network allows the Arg-67 side chain to com￾pensate for the missing Arg-65 guanidinium. In this complex,
the Arg-67 side chain shifts more than 2.5 Å to assume a
position intermediate between the original positions of Arg￾65 and Arg-67, making most of the critical contacts of both
residues (Figure 2E). The only H-bond from the native
complex that is completely eliminated and not replaced in
the R65A mutant is that between Arg-65 NH1 and Glu-60
OE2. The efficient side chain restructuring, maximizing the
number and strength of potential H-bonds, explains why the
kinetic results with the R65A mutant give an underestimation
of the true importance of the Arg-65 residue.
Mutation of Arg-67 Results in the Loss of Three Cross￾Loop H-Bonds. We observe no substantial structural adjust￾ments in the R67A CI2 complex. Thus, we can attribute the
modest increase in hydrolysis rate and dissociation constants
with this mutant directly to loss of the Arg-67 side chain
and the three H-bonds in which it normally participates
(Figure 2F). Removal of the Arg-67 side chain leaves a
solvent accessible gap through the center of the binding loop,
through which a tube of continuous electron density threads.
This density, which we have modeled as a PEG chain, is
quite diffuse, suggesting that no specific and discrete
H-bonds are formed between the solvent chain and the
protein.
The M59R/E60S CI2 Complex Resembles the E60S

CI2 Hydrogen Bond Network Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 18, 2005 6827more compromised with regard to inhibition and resistance
to hydrolysis; this is in line with our previous results showing
relatively small functional effects upon mutation of the Met￾59 P1 residue of CI2 (5). Despite crystallizing in a different
crystal form belonging to space group P21, the structure of
the double mutant reveals that the backbone in the binding
loop region of residues 58-63 is indistinguishable from the
other complexes. The side chain positioning and hydrogen
bond network very closely resemble that found in the E60S
CI2 single mutant complex. The new Arg-59 P1 residue fits
into the S1 binding cleft of subtilisin like the wild-type Met.
The M59R/E60S CI2 backbone further from the region
of contact with subtilisin shows much greater divergence
from the wild-type structure. A second, somewhat lower￾resolution (2.0 Å) structure of this complex, in a crystal form
belonging to space group P61, shows essentially the same
structure for the subtilisin-contacting residues and the H-bond
network, but more distant regions of CI2 diverge substantially
from both the P21 structure and the wild-type complex
structure, leading to the conclusion that the structural
differences further from the contact interface, rather than
being propagated from the sites of mutation, are probably
caused primarily by differences in crystal packing forces
between the various crystal forms.
The Arg-62 Side Chain of CI2 Is of Limited Functional
Importance. Inhibition and hydrolysis assays indicate that
Arg-62 plays only a minimal role in the stabilizing H-bond
network. Mutation of the Arg-62 side chain to Ala increases
the dissociation constant by less than 1 order of magnitude,
and has little effect on the resistance of CI2 to hydrolysis
by subtilisin. Many other CI2 mutants, including those at
residues uninvolved in the H-bond network, show multiple
alternative conformations of the Arg-62 side chain (Figure
4), further indicating that the native conformation featuring
an H-bond between Arg-62 and Glu-60 is only marginally
favored.
DISCUSSION
As a general trend, the rate of CI2 hydrolysis correlates
inversely with binding affinity, in agreement with our
previous observations (Figure 5) (5). The observed correla￾tion between the mutational effects on inhibitor binding and
hydrolysis is not surprising, since the same CI2 residues near
the enzyme interface are responsible both for constraining
the binding loop into a conformation complementary to the
enzyme active site and for providing the network of
interactions that serve to retain and orient the leaving group
peptide following formation of the acyl-enzyme complex,
preventing hydrolysis and accelerating peptide religation.
Hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme complex requires partial
dissociation of the leaving group peptide to allow access by
the hydrolytic water, and inhibitors with stronger binding
affinity in the intact form are likely to remain more resistant
to dissociation in the cleaved form. Mutations that weaken
the binding affinity of the intact inhibitor are therefore likely
also to increase the rate of leaving group dissociation and
hydrolysis.
While the structural determinants of binding and hydrolysis
are inextricably linked, the deviation of individual mutant
inhibitors from the correlation is particularly revealing, since
it distinguishes residues more important for one function
versus the other. The three Arg to Ala mutations, at CI2
residues 62, 65, and 67, all have a more deleterious effect
on binding affinity than on hydrolysis rate, indicating that
these residues are more critical for providing the correct
conformation for initial binding than for retention of the
leaving group peptide following formation of the acyl￾enzyme complex. Once the acyl-enzyme complex forms,
the covalent linkage between the enzyme and inhibitor plays
a role in maintaining the conformation of the CI2 binding
loop, reducing the importance of the cross-loop H-bonds
involving the Arg residues. By contrast, the role of Glu-60
becomes even more critical following formation of the acyl￾enzyme complex. The Glu-60 residue is unique in that the
mutations at this site have a greater effect on leaving group
retention and preventing hydrolysis than they do on inhibitor
binding. This is perhaps unsurprising, since Glu-60 is the
amino-terminal residue of the leaving group peptide, and

6828 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 18, 2005 Radisky et al.interactions of the glutamic acid side chain are expected to
be important in orienting this residue as the attacking
nucleophile in the religation reaction.
Among the complexes examined here, the diverse struc￾tural changes in response to mutation range from the very
subtle to the more substantial. In some structures, new solvent
molecules spatially replace truncated side chains, in some
cases bridging electrostatic interactions between the remain￾ing protein functional groups, while in other structures, no
significant solvent reorganization is observed. For most
mutations within the H-bond network, numerous subtle
structural adjustments are propagated throughout the entire
H-bond network, resulting in some interaction distances
becoming shorter and presumably stronger, while others
become longer and likely less important for structural
stabilization. In several cases, side chains that were previ￾ously held in a single conformation become more disordered,
with multiple partially occupied conformations. Finally, in
some structures, side chain movement is great enough to
result in a shuffling of H-bonding partners. For each
mutation, the functional effects observed are created not only
by simple mutation of a side chain and the loss of interactions
in which it participated but also by numerous small local
adjustments throughout the H-bond network. The most
striking example of this phenomenon is found in the R65A
CI2 mutant, where most of the H-bonds in which Arg-65
normally serves as a donor are conserved, with Arg-67 taking
the place of Arg-65.
The same network of H-bonds found in CI2 appears to be
conserved throughout the closely related I13 family of
protease inhibitors, also known as the potato I class of
inhibitors (20). Most have a Thr residue in the P2 position,
an acidic residue (more often Asp) in the P1′ position, Arg
residues at P3′, P6′, and P8′, and a C-terminal glycine residue.
Structural and mutational studies with several of these
homologues hint at a conserved functional role for the
H-bond network as well. Mutation of H-bonding residues
in eglin c leads to accelerated hydrolysis (9, 21), and mutation
of Arg residues in Curcurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor V
results in increases in both the rate of hydrolysis and
conformational flexibility of the binding loop (22, 23).
Related inhibitors that naturally lack one or more of these
conserved charged or polar residues are also likely to be more
susceptible to hydrolysis; for example, chymotrypsin inhibitor
1, which contains substitutions at Thr-58 and Arg-67, is
cleaved by target proteases more rapidly than CI2, although
it does still function as an inhibitor (24, 25). The structures
of mutant CI2 complexes presented here provide models for
how such inhibitors, lacking a full complement of H-bonds
to stabilize the binding loop, may nevertheless function
through conformational optimization of the existing elec￾trostatic side chains.
CI2 and a few other members of the I13 family of protease
inhibitors are unusual in that the stabilizing interactions
between the protein scaffold and the binding loop are almost
entirely comprised of electrostatic interactions between
charged and polar residues, while in most other families of
inhibitors, disulfide bonds play a role in constraining the
binding loop conformation. However, even among disulfide￾stabilized inhibitors, H-bond networks are still important for
maintaining the inhibitory conformation of the binding loop.
For example, the I12 family of Bowman-Birk inhibitors
features a conserved Thr residue in the P2 position, and a
conserved Ser residue in the P1′ position (20). The Thr
hydroxyl group H-bonds to the Ser hydroxyl group as well
as to the P5′ backbone amide, and additional backbone
H-bonds further stabilize the binding loop (26, 27). Studies
with synthetic peptides reproducing the structural motif of
the Bowman-Birk binding loop have shown that replace￾ment of the Thr at P2 makes the loop more susceptible to
hydrolysis (28). Another example is found in the I1 family
ovomucoid inhibitors, which, like CI2, typically feature Thr
in the P2 position H-bonding to Glu in the P1′ position, as
well as an intraresidue H-bond between the Glu backbone
amide nitrogen and the side chain carboxylate (29, 30). The
I3 family Kunitz-type inhibitors found in plants also feature
a binding loop shaped and constrained by an extensive
H-bond network (31, 32). When an Asn residue central to
the network was mutated in a member of this family, the
original H-bond network was nearly conserved, through side
chain conformational adjustment and inclusion of new
solvent atoms (33), reminiscent of our observations of the
CI2 mutants presented here. These and other similar inhibi￾tors may all function via the clogged gutter mechanism that
we have elaborated for CI2. Hydrogen bond networks that
link inhibitor binding loops to protein scaffolds may be a
common motif by which the leaving group peptide is retained
following formation of the acyl-enzyme complex, resulting
in inhibitor religation and slowing proteolysis.
A more general insight to be gleaned from this study
concerns the importance of structural information when one
wishes to interpret biochemical data from mutant proteins
in terms of specific atomic interactions. It has become
somewhat commonplace to see quantitative free energy
values in protein folding, intermolecular binding, or enzyme
catalysis attributed to a particular H-bond, electrostatic, or
hydrophobic interaction on the basis of mutagenesis experi￾ments, often in the absence of high-resolution structural
information. While such studies are suggestive, and can
provide order-of-magnitude estimations, it is prudent to
recognize that any given mutation may represent a complex
mix of subtle structural adjustments, as seen here.
The results presented here are best interpreted in light of
the clogged gutter mechanism, which postulates rapid
formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate, followed by
favorable religation of the peptide bond, regenerating the
intact inhibitor (3). We previously showed that CI2 binding
loop mutations at residues that directly interact with subtilisin
have a modest impact on hydrolysis rates, with residues on
the leaving group side of the scissile bond showing a
somewhat larger effect than those on the acylating side,
consistent with the idea that R′-side interactions play a role
in retaining and positioning the leaving group peptide to favor
religation (5). We demonstrated that the CI2 protein core
plays a much more critical role in slowing hydrolysis and
favoring religation, as evidenced by the fact that linear or
cyclized peptides that mimic the isolated CI2 binding loop
sequence are rapidly hydrolyzed by subtilisin (6). Here we
have shown that the network of hydrogen bonds and
electrostatic interactions connecting the CI2 binding loop to
the protein core provides structural integrity and conforma￾tional stability relevant both for binding affinity and for
control of inhibitor religation. The most critical interactions
are those involving the Gly-83 C-terminus, the Arg-65 side
CI2 Hydrogen Bond Network Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 18, 2005 6829chain, the Glu-60 side chain, and the Thr-58 side chain.
Mutation of these key residues accelerates hydrolysis by 2-3
orders of magnitude. The H-bond between Thr-58 and Glu￾60 bridges the cleavage site, while the interactions between
Gly-83, Arg-65, and Glu-60 tie the leaving group R′ peptide
tightly to the protein core, assisting in leaving group retention
and accelerating the religation reaction. These intraloop
electrostatic interactions, combined with enzyme-inhibitor
interface complementarity and the covalent linkage between
the enzyme and inhibitor in the acyl-enzyme intermediate,
work together to arrest and reverse proteolysis.
