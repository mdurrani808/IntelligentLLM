ABSTRACT: The endonuclease group of E colicins are a family of bacterial toxins whose cytotoxic activity
in a producing host is inactivated by a specific immunity protein. The DNase of colicin E9 can be bound
and inhibited by both cognate and noncognate immunity proteins, the dissociation constants for which
span a range of 12-orders of magnitude. DNase binding specificity of the immunity proteins is governed
primarily by helix II, the sequence of which is variable in this family of proteins. Heteronuclear NMR
experiments have identified helix III along with helix II as the likely DNase binding site, although other
regions of Im9 also showed perturbations on binding the E9 DNase. In the present work, we have used
the NMR experiments as a guide for alanine scanning mutagenesis of Im9. Our data show that helices
II and III of Im9 are indeed the DNase binding site and in addition quantitate the relative binding energy
associated with each helix. We find that the conserved residues of helix III make the largest relative
contribution toward E9 DNase binding. In conjunction with previous studies, the data suggest that
specificity in the colicin-immunity system is governed by a dual recognition mechanism in which highly
stabilizing interactions emanating from the conserved regions of an immunity protein act as the binding
site anchor and these are modulated by interactions from neighboring, nonconserved amino acid residues.
This modulation is likely to take the form of both favorable and unfavorable interactions, the balance of
which define the specificity of the protein-protein interaction. The generality of such a dual recognition
mechanism in other systems is also discussed.
Specificity in protein-protein interactions is a poorly
understood phenomenon, yet specific recognition of one
protein by another underpins many biological processes. We
have been addressing questions of specificity in protein￾protein recognition in the colicin DNase-immunity protein
system. Colicins are a large and varied family of plasmid￾encoded bacterial toxins, and immunity proteins are inhibitors
that are coproduced to suppress the action of the toxin in
the host. Of the many types of bacteriocidal activities that
colicins can display we have focused our attention on a class
of toxins which are members of the E group colicins and
which kill Escherichia coli cells through the action of an
endonuclease domain (1). The toxins initiate cell death by
first binding to the vitamin B12 receptor of E. coli cells
followed by translocation across both bacterial membranes.
The E group DNase colicins are 61 kDa proteins composed
of domains responsible for receptor binding and membrane
translocation as well as a C-terminal, nonspecific DNase
domain (2), which can be overproduced and purified
separately from the rest of the toxin (3). Within the E group
of colicins four DNase-type toxins have been identified,
known as colicins E2, E7, E8, and E9, which share a high
sequence identity in the regions of the protein implicated in
receptor binding and translocation but are only ∼80%
identical in their DNase domains (4). The DNase activity
of each toxin is inhibited by a specific immunity protein,
Im2, Im7, Im8, and Im9,1 respectively, which share ∼50%
sequence identity. These are 9.5 kDa proteins which form
tight, stoichiometric complexes with their cognate endo￾nucleases (5-7). The complexes are released from the
producing cell into the surrounding environment through the
action of a third protein (the lysis protein), and it is as a
heterodimeric complex that cell killing begins (8, 9).
Recent work from our laboratory has shown that the E
colicin DNase-immunity protein system is a rich source of
structural and thermodynamic information concerning the
specificity of interprotein complexes within families of
closely related proteins. The structures for Im9 and Im7,

Published on Web 01/13/199812), are similar and best described as distorted, antiparallel
four-helix proteins. Im9 binds to its cognate endonuclease,
in the form of the whole toxin or the isolated 15 kDa E9
DNase domain, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd)
of 10-16 M in buffers of low ionic strength, which is one of
the tightest protein complexes yet reported in the literature
(13). The two proteins associate at the rate of diffusion to
form an encounter complex which undergoes a slow con￾formational change to yield the final stable complex. The
noncognate immunity proteins will also bind and inhibit the
activity of the E9 DNase but with much weaker affinities,
10-4 M for Im7, 10-6 M for Im8, and 10-8 M for Im2. The
complexes formed with the Im2 and Im8 proteins also go
through a two-state association mechanism with rate con￾stants almost identical to those of Im9, implying that the
same conformational change is triggered by cognate and
noncognate immunity protein binding alike (14). The
noncognate complexes, however, dissociate >106
-fold faster
than Im9. The resulting binding affinities for this family of
homologous proteins for the E9 DNase span 12 orders of
magnitude which essentially matches the entire range of
known thermodynamic stabilities for protein complexes
described in the literature (14).
Homologue scanning mutagenesis has shown that the
specificity of an immunity protein for its target endonuclease
derives almost entirely from helix II, which is variable in
sequence in this family of proteins (15). Substituting this
helix from Im9 into the Im2 framework switches the
biological specificity of Im2 so that it now becomes specific
for ColE9. The resulting chimeric immunity protein binds
almost as tightly to the E9 DNase as wild-type Im9. By
including buried sequences from helix I which interact with
helix II, full E9 DNase binding is obtained, implying that
helix packing also plays a role in specificity, presumably by
controlling the precise orientation of residues from helix II.
While it is clear which regions of an immunity protein
govern its specificity, what is still unresolved is how they
inactivate a colicin endonuclease and what mechanism of
recognition is adopted which enables proteins sharing more
than 50% sequence identity to bind to the E9 DNase with
dissociation constants that span the millimolar to femtomolar
affinity range. A clue to this mechanism has come from
heteronuclear NMR experiments in which the E9 DNase
binding site on the Im9 protein has been delineated (16).
The amide resonances of 15N-labeled Im9 in complex with
the 15 kDa E9 DNase domain have been assigned and
chemical shift perturbations categorized using 1
H-15N HSQC
experiments. Helix II, the specificity helix, is strongly
perturbed along with residues from helix III, which is
conserved in the immunity protein family. In the present
work, we have conducted an alanine scan across this putative
E9 DNase binding surface of Im9 and quantified the relative
binding energy of amino acid side chains. The alanine
scanning data confirm that helices II and III are the DNase
binding site and reveal for the first time the relative
contributions to binding of conserved and nonconserved
regions of the immunity protein. We suggest a mechanism
of DNase selectivity for the immunity proteins based on these
data and discuss the relevance of this mechanism in terms
of other protein-protein recognition systems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains and Media. E. coli strains JM105 (supE,
endA, sbcB15, hsdR4, rpsL, thi, ∆(lac-proAB), F′ [traD36,
proAB+, lacIq, lacZ∆M15]) and JM83 hsdR, a restriction￾deficient derivative of E. coli JM83 (Ara+, Lac+, Pro, thi,
rpsL, ø80∆lacZM15), were used as the host strain for the
plasmids. Cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth
or on plates of LB agar, supplemented where necessary with
ampicillin (100 µg/mL).
Site-Directed Mutagenesis, Protein Purifications, and
Protein Determinations. Purification of the DNase domain
of colicin E9, the Im9 protein, and tritiated Im9 ([3
H]Im9)
have all been described previously (3, 7, 13). Site-directed
mutagenesis of the imm9 gene was carried out as described
by Osborne et al. (16). The resulting immunity gene was
cloned into the expression vectors pTrc99A or pKK233-2
(Pharmacia) and introduced into the the host E. coli strain
JM83 by transformation. In each case, the directed mutation
and the entire immunity gene sequence were verified by
double-stranded DNA sequencing using an ALF sequencer
(Pharmacia) and the reagents and protocols supplied by
Pharmacia. Expression was induced by the addition of 1
mM isopropyl â-D-thiogalactoside at an optical density at
550 nm of between 0.6 and 0.8 and the protein purified as
described previously for the Im9 protein (7).
Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid
analysis and from the absorbance at 280 nm. The molar
absorption coefficients determined for the proteins are E9
DNase, 17 550 M-1 cm-1
, and Im9, 11 400 M-1 cm-1 (13).
Electrospray Mass Spectrometry. The mass of each
purified protein was confirmed by eletrospray mass spec￾trometry as described previously (17).
Association Kinetics. Stopped-flow kinetic measurements
were made using an Applied Photophysics biosequential
stopped-flow spectrofluorometer (slit widths ) 5 nm) using
an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and monitoring the
fluorescence emission above 320 nm. All reactions were
performed in 50 mM Mops buffer, pH 7.0, containing 200
mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothretol (DTT), at 25 °C,
essentially as described by Wallis et al. (13). Association
between the E9 DNase and Im9 was monitored under
pseudo-first-order conditions using a 4-20-fold excess of
immunity protein over E9 DNase (0.35 µM). The resulting
biphasic fluorescence traces were fitted to a double expo￾nential equation.
Dissociation Kinetics. Dissociation rate constants were
determined by radioactive subunit exchange using strategies
similar to those described previously (13-15). For Im9
Asp51Ala, where the dissociation rate constant is less than
the limiting value of the radioactive method (3.9 × 10-3 s-1
;
t1/2 < 3 min) dissociation was monitored by stopped-flow
fluorescence. The E9 DNase (5 µM) was premixed with a
slight excess of Im9 Asp51Ala (6 µM) and chased with an
equal volume of a 10-fold excess of Im9 Tyr54Ala (60 µM).
The data were fitted to a first-order rate equation.
Data Analysis. A two-step reaction model has been
proposed by Wallis et al. (13) for the interaction of the E9
DNase with Im9 (eq 1), where nuclease (N) and immunity
protein (I) form an encounter complex (NI*) in a rapid
binding step, which then undergoes a slow isomerization to
the final bound state (NI).
Colicin-Immunity Protein Recognition Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 2, 1998 477In this case, the equilibrium dissociation constant is given
by the expression:
For the E9 DNase-Im9 complex, the rate of formation
of the encounter complex is rate determining for the forward
reaction and hence Kd ) koff/k1, where koff is the overall
dissociation rate constant measured by subunit exchange
kinetics and k1 is the bimolecular association rate constant
measured by stopped-flow fluorescence (13). Values of
∆∆Gbinding were calculated as +RT ln[Kd(mutant)/Kd(wild
type)], where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute
temperature.
Immunity Protein Denaturation and Stability. Fluores￾cence spectroscopy was used to monitor the denaturation of
immunity proteins and to determine their relative stabilities.
All experiments were conducted with a Shimadzu RF5000
spectrofluorometer, thermostated at 25 °C in filtered 50 mM
potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, using an excitation
wavelength of 295 nm to ensure only tryptophan excitation.
The excitation and emission bandwidths were 5 nm, and 3
mL quartz cuvettes were used throughout. Each immunity
protein (generally 1-2 µM) was equilibrated in buffer
containing guanidine hydrochloride (0-3 M, for a minimum
of 2 h at 25 °C), and the fluorescence emission was observed
at 354 nm, with the exception of Im9 Pro47Ala where
fluorescence measurements were recorded at 370 nm, which
was the wavelength showing the greatest difference in
fluorescence intensity between the folded and unfolded states.
The relative immunity protein stabilities were determined
using strategies similar to those described by Kellis et al.
(18). For small differences where denaturation curves
overlap the relative stability was determined at a single
concentration of Gdn‚HCl near the midpoint of the dena￾turation curve of wild-type Im9 (1.6 M Gdn‚HCl) by
For large differences in stabilities (His46Ala, Pro47Ala,
Leu52Ala, Ile53Ala, Tyr54Ala, Leu36Ala, Val37Ala,
Ser63Ala, and Val68Ala) where the denaturation transitions
do not overlap, the relative stability was determined by
extrapolating the free energy of unfolding at each individual
concentration of Gdn‚HCl to an intermediate concentration
for the wild-type and mutant curves. This assumes linearity
in the dependence of ∆G on Gdn‚HCl only over a small
range beyond the experimental data. The intermediate Gdn‚
HCl concentrations used were 1.2 M for His46Ala and 1 M
for Leu33Ala, Leu36Ala, Val37Ala, Pro47Ala, Leu52Ala,
Ile53Ala, Tyr54Ala, Ser63Ala, and Val68Ala.
Accessibility Determination of Side Chains. The acces￾sible surface areas of the mutated amino acid side chains of
Im9 were obtained from calculations based on its NMR
structure using the program SURFACE from the Collabora￾tive Computational Project No. 4 program suite (Daresbury
laboratory, Warrington, Cheshire, U.K.). These were ex￾pressed as the percent exposure of the side chain to the
solvent relative to the accessible surface of the same residue
in a tripeptide model of Gly-X-Gly (19).
RESULTS
Candidates for Alanine Mutagenesis. A putative E9
DNase binding site has been identified through heteronuclear
NMR experiments on 15N-labeled Im9 bound to the unlabeled
E9 DNase domain (16). The NMR data were obtained from
2D 1
H-15N HSQC spectra which allowed the complexation￾induced perturbations of the Im9 amide resonances to be
quantified. More than 60 of the 86 amide resonances were
perturbed to some degree on binding the DNase, and these
fell into three general categories: the “large” chemical shift
perturbation category consisted of residues 27-29, 34, 35,
38, 49, 50, and 53-55, the “intermediate” category com￾prised residues 23, 33, 36, 41-44, 46, 48, 52, 60, 63, 68,
and 69, and the small category contained the remaining
residues (Figure 1; see figure legend for details of the NMR
analysis). Twenty-six residues in total were identified within
the large and intermediate categories, the majority of which
(20 from the 26) fell between residues 27-55 and include
helix II, helix III, the turn that connects them, and the loop
connecting helix I and helix II (Figure 1). Five residues
(Cys23, Glu31, Val34, Glu42, and Tyr54), which represented
the three chemical shift perturbation categories, were mutated
to alanine and their dissociation rate constants from com￾plexes with the E9 DNase determined. The observed
changes in off-rates showed general agreement with the
chemical shift categorization of these residues, supporting
the way in which the E9 DNase binding site had been
assigned (16).
The alanine scan presented in this paper is focused around
residues whose amides showed large and intermediate
changes in chemical shift on binding the E9 DNase since
these seemed the most likely to encompass the DNase
binding site. We have continued with the characterization
of the five original mutants described above and have
determined their association rate constants and hence the
equilibrium dissociation constants for the mutant Im9-E9
DNase complexes. A further 29 alanine mutants have been
constructed representing most of the residues highlighted by
NMR but also including ten residues (24, 26, 30-32, 37,
45, 47, 51, and 56) which fell below the chemical shift
cutoffs used to define the DNase binding site. This latter
group was chosen because their location in Im9 suggested a
possible role in binding.
Im9 alanine mutants were overproduced and purified as
described in the Materials and Methods section and the
masses of purified proteins confirmed by electrospray mass
spectrometry. In each case, the masses of the mutant proteins
corresponded to the predicted mass to within 1 Da (data not
shown). Stability and kinetic measurements were carried
out twice on each preparation of mutant protein. The
equilibrium dissociation constants for the mutants were
determined from the individual association and dissociation
rate constants as described in the Materials and Methods
section.
Association Kinetics. Stopped-flow fluorescence was used
to determine the association rate constant, k1, for each of
the 34 alanine mutants. Association between the E9 DNase
and Im9 is essentially diffusion controlled in buffer of low

magnitude of the association rate to enable accurate deter￾mination of k1 under pseudo-first-order conditions, 200 mM
NaCl was included in all the experiments. For each of the
alanine mutants, a biphasic association profile was observed
on binding the E9 DNase, similar to that determined for wild￾type Im9, in which an initial fluorescence enhancement, due
to the bimolecular collision of the two proteins, is followed
by a fluorescence quench, due to a conformational change
in the DNase (13, 14). Under the conditions used in the
current experiments (pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, and 25 °C) k1
for Im9 binding to the E9 DNase is ∼1 × 108 M-1 s-1 and
the rate of the conformational change is 4-5 s-1
. Values
of k1 for each of the mutant Im9-E9 DNase complexes are
listed in Table 1 and depicted in Figure 2A. The association
rate constants vary little (<3-fold) for most of the alanine
mutants, the largest differences observed for mutations of
acidic residues Asp51Ala and Glu41Ala where k1 is reduced
by 6- and 4-fold, respectively. The effects of these substitu￾tions are consistent with electrostatic steering playing an
important role in the bimolecular collision, in agreement with
previous studies of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex (13). A
further point relating to the magnitude of these effects is
that the electrostatic contribution to association will be
diminished due to the presence of 200 mM NaCl in the
reaction buffer, implying that these differences would be even
larger in the absence of salt. For each of the alanine mutants,
the rate constant of the fluorescence quench step was similar
to that for the wild-type immunity protein, showing that the
conformational change that follows the formation of the
encounter complex is not compromised by any of the
mutants.
Dissociation Kinetics and Binding Energies. The dis￾sociation rate constant (koff) for most of the mutant complexes
was determined by radioactive exchange kinetics in which
the unlabeled mutant complex was chased with radiolabeled
Im9 (13-16). In each case, the exchange process was
followed to at least 50%, and the data were fitted using first￾order kinetics. This technique for determining koff can only
be used for complexes with slow dissociation rates (koff < 4
× 10-3 s-1
). For the Asp51Ala complex, the off-rate is faster
than this, and so a stopped-flow fluorescence experiment was
devised to determine this rate constant. This experiment
relies on the observation that binding of Im9 Tyr54Ala to
the E9 DNase results in a significantly lower fluorescence

FIGURE 2: Association and dissociation rate constants of alanine
mutations. Panel A shows the effect of Im9 alanine substitutions
on the rate of association (k1) of the E9 DNase with Im9 (see
Materials and Methods section for details). The horizontal line
represents k1 for the wild-type Im9-E9 DNase complex. Panel B
shows the effect of Im9 alanine substitutions on the dissociation
rate constant (koff) of E9 DNase-Im9 complexes. With the
exception of the Asp51Ala mutant, rate constants were determined
by radioactive subunit exchange. The dissociation rate constants
were calculated as described previously (13, 14) and are summarized
in the Materials and Methods section. The horizontal line represents
koff for the wild-type Im9-E9 DNase complex. In both panels, the
error bars represent the standard errors from duplicate experiments.
The secondary structure shown above the figure represents the main
structural elements of Im9 which were targetted for mutagenesis.

elements is explained in the text.
Colicin-Immunity Protein Recognition Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 2, 1998 479enhancement compared to wild-type Im9 (and Im9 Asp51Ala)
(data not shown). A complex of Im9 Asp51Ala and E9
DNase was therefore chased with Im9 Tyr54Ala. The
subsequent fluorescence decay was fitted to a first-order rate
equation and provides a direct measure of the off-rate for
this complex (data not shown). From the relative fluores￾cence intensities of each complex, the overall fluorescence
change was found to correspond closely to the estimated
value assuming complete exchange. Similar fluorescence
chase experiments have been used to determine off-rates for
noncognate E9 DNase-Im9 protein complexes (14). Values
of koff for each of the mutant Im9-E9 DNase complexes
are listed in Table 1 and shown in Figure 2B. The
dissociation rate constant of the native complex under the
conditions used is ∼2 × 10-6 s-1
.
Values of ∆∆Gbinding relative to wild-type Im9 were
calculated from the dissociation constants (where Kd ) koff/
k1) for all the alanine mutants as described in the Materials
and Methods section, and the data are presented in Table 1.
The alanine substitutions range from those that have little
or no effect on the relative binding energy (e.g., Asp26Ala
or Glu32Ala) to those that have intermediate effects in the
range 1-3 kcal/mol (e.g., Glu41Ala and Ser50Ala) and those
that have substantial effects on binding of the order of 3-6
kcal/mol (e.g., Asp51Ala, Tyr54Ala, and Val34Ala). The
binding energies are depicted on the structure of free Im9 in
Figure 5b,e.
The stability of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex is governed
by the rate of complex dissociation, and so alanine mutations
which affect binding do so by increasing koff (Table 1 and
Figure 2B). This phenomenon has been well documented
in other systems such as growth hormone binding to its
cognate receptor (20) and barnase binding to barstar (21).
The dependence of complex affinity on the rate of dissocia￾tion has been discussed in the literature (for example, 22)
and reflects the large number of interactions that have to be
broken in order that the complex can dissociate. Conse￾quently, there is a large activation barrier for dissociation,
estimated for the E9 DNase-Im9 complex from Arrhenius
plots as 26 kcal/mol (13). By contrast, the activation barrier
for association between the E9 DNase and Im9 is very low
(∼4 kcal/mol), reflecting the fact that it is a diffusion￾controlled process.
Stabilities of the Im9 Alanine Mutants. The side chains
for some of the residues of Im9 whose amide chemical shift
resonances were perturbed in the original NMR experiments
are partially or completely buried in the unbound protein
(11, 16). However, since the structure of bound Im9 is not

480 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 2, 1998 Wallis et al.known, the direct involvement of such residues in binding
the E9 DNase remains a possibility. Hence these residues
were also substituted for alanine. As a result, many of the
alanine mutations might be expected to affect the confor￾mational stability of Im9, and so it was of interest to
determine the stabilities of all the alanine mutants. Another
reason for investigating their stabilities stems from our recent
observation that mutations which affect immunity specificity
often affect the stability of the protein as well (15).
The conformational stability (∆∆Gstability) for each alanine
mutant relative to wild-type Im9 was determined using
guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn‚HCl) induced denaturation and
tryptophan emission fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluo￾rescence emission maximum of Im9 is 334 nm and shifts to
354 nm on denaturation. Coincident with denaturation is a
5-fold increase in fluorescence, indicating that the emission
from the single conserved tryptophan (Trp74) in Im9 is
highly quenched in the native protein. The native and
denatured fluorescence spectra of the majority of the Im9
alanine mutant proteins were similar to those of Im9.
However, for some of the more destabilized mutants, such
as His46Ala and Pro47Ala, the fluorescence intensity of the
native proteins was increased relative to Im9 and the λmax
was shifted to the red, indicating greater exposure of the
tryptophan residue. Both of these residues lie close to Trp74;
indeed, the imidazole of His46 forms a stacking interaction
with the indole ring, which is consistent with their effects
on fluorescence and the stability of the protein.
Im9 displays a single, cooperative and reversible dena￾turation transition from which the ∆GH2O was determined,
according to the method of Pace (23), to be -4.8 kcal/mol.
The relative stabilities of each of the alanine mutants were
determined as described in the Materials and Methods
section. The denaturation curve of Im9 in Gdn‚HCl, together
with those of two of the most destabilized alanine mutants,
Im9 Leu52Ala and His46Ala, is shown in Figure 3.
∆∆Gstability values for all the alanine mutants are listed in
Table 1. In general, the mutation of buried residues in a
protein is expected to have a greater effect on stability than
the mutation of surface-exposed residues. To test this in
the case of Im9, changes in protein stability of the alanine
mutants were compared with the degree of exposure of each
side chain (Figure 4A), where surface accessibility was
calculated relative to the exposure of that side chain in the
tripeptide Gly-X-Gly (19). The stability and accessibility
data in Figure 4A show a reasonable correlation; as acces￾sibility of the side chain decreases, the changes in stability
increase. As might be expected, buried hydrophobic residues
are highly destabilizing when mutated to alanine (∆∆Gstability
> 1 kcal/mol). Two notable exceptions, however, are Pro47
and Tyr54, which have significant portions of their side
chains exposed to solvent but are very destabilizing when
mutated to alanine (∆∆Gstability ) 2.9 kcal/mol), reflecting
their important structural roles. Pro47 is part of the turn
between helices II and III which helps sculpt the interactions
around Trp74, and the side chain of Tyr54 sits in a pocket
made up of Ile53 and Ser50 of helix III and Val37 of helix
II. The crystal structure of Im7 shows the equivalent tyrosine
residue forming a hydrogen bond with the base of helix I,
thereby tethering the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein
(12). This interaction is not apparent in the current solution
structure of Im9, but this may be a consequence of insuf￾ficient distance restraints.

Colicin-Immunity Protein Recognition Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 2, 1998 481with crystal structures of protein complexes have shown that
perturbed NMR resonances give a good estimate of the
binding surface but that shifts outside the interaction site are
also observed (24, 25). The expectation then is that not all
of the 1
H-15N amide perturbations which occur in Im9
originate from residues within the DNase binding site. The
NMR perturbation data of Osborne et al. (16), depicted on
the structure of free Im9 in Figure 5, suggest that the main
area of DNase recognition is the surface made up of residues
displayed from helix II and helix III (Figure 5a) but that
significant amide shifts are also observed in other regions
(Figure 1), most notably on the underside of this surface
(Figure 5d). Using these data as a guide, it should be
possible to distinguish energetically important residues from
unimportant sites by alanine mutagenesis.
Alanine mutants of Im9 might be expected to display one
of four effects; (1) changes in E9 DNase binding, (2) changes
in Im9 stability, (3) changes to binding and stability, or (4)
no effect. A plot of ∆∆Gbinding against ∆∆Gstability (Figure
4B) shows that each of these categories of mutants can be
identified. Residues lying close to the y-axis (>1 kcal/mol)
are those which affect binding, with minimal change in
protein stability. Conversely, residues lying close to the
x-axis (>1 kcal/mol) are those which disrupt protein stability
significantly but not DNase binding. Residues toward the
center of the plot perturb both binding and stability while
those clustered around the origin (<1 kcal/mol on each axis)
have little effect on either property.
The least squares fit of ∆∆Gbinding against ∆∆Gstability
(Figure 4B) intersects the y-axis at ∼1 kcal/mol, and we have
used this as the basis for identifying the E9 DNase binding
site. A ∆∆Gbinding of 1 kcal/mol is equivalent to an increase
in the dissociation rate constant for the complex of 5.4-fold
(assuming the association rate constant remains unaffected),
which seems a reasonable cutoff considering the largest
increase in koff that we measured (for the Asp51Ala mutation)
was >3000-fold (∆∆Gbinding ) 5.9 kcal/mol). Following on
from this analysis of ∆∆Gbinding, two distinct groups of
mutants emerge which help delineate the functional epitope
on Im9: (1) those which fall below the fitted line, indicating
a relatively small effect on binding (∆∆Gbinding ) 0-1 kcal/
mol), and (2) those which coincide with or lie above the
fitted line, indicating a significant effect on binding (∆∆Gbind￾ing ) 1-6 kcal/mol). Using these criteria a total of 12
residues can be identified which perturb binding significantly
(Glu30, Leu33, Val34, Val37, Glu41, Gly49, Ser50, Asp51,
Tyr54, Tyr55, Pro56, and Val68). With one exception
(Val68), all these residues come from helices II and III and
lie clustered together in Im9 (colored red, magenta, and
yellow in Figure 5b,e). All of the remaining 22 residues

show ∆∆Gbinding of <0.5 kcal/mol (labeled blue in Figure
5b) and 11 of 0.5-1 kcal/mol (labeled green in Figure 5b).
Many of these residues flank the energetically important
amino acids.
In agreement then with the NMR data, the alanine scan
suggests that the major binding interactions are centered
around residues on helix II and helix III (Figure 5). In
addition, it seems that many of the residues on the underside
of the two helices are not important for binding (compare
Figure 5d with Figure 5e). While there is general agreement
between the NMR and mutagenesis data, there are some
notable discrepancies. Several residues which showed
substantial chemical shift perturbations in the NMR experi￾ments (such as Lys35 and Ser28) have no effect on E9 DNase
binding when substituted for alanine while other residues,
such as Asp51, fell below the cutoffs used in interpreting
the chemical shift changes observed in the HSQC experi￾ments but make substantial interactions toward the E9 DNase.
Notwithstanding these caveats, it is clear that the NMR
experiments provided a good working model of the E9
DNase binding surface of Im9, which has been substantiated
by the alanine scan.
Further analysis of the 12 residues identified in Figure 4B
suggests that they may not all be directly involved in binding.
∆∆Gbinding due to the Gly49Ala mutation is almost certainly
due to disruption of steric complementarity at the complex
interface since it results in the addition of a side chain rather
than its removal. The side chain of Val68 is buried between
helices I and IV in the Im9 structure and is the only residue
highlighted by this analysis which is not part of the helix
II/helix III interface. Its effect on ∆∆Gbinding may be due to
changes in protein conformation rather than direct participa￾tion in binding, and this would be compatible with the large
∆∆Gstability (Figure 4). The same could apply to other buried
residues such as Val37, which disrupts binding and stability
to a similar extent as Val68.
Leu33 and Tyr54 are two residues which have substantial
effects on both binding and stability (Figure 4B). Their
effects on binding, however, are unlikely to be solely through
changes in stability since other (buried) residues near the
binding site are even more destabilizing but have a minimal
effect on binding (for example, His46 and Ile53). A
significant portion of Tyr54 is exposed to solvent, forming
part of a hydrophobic patch on the surface of Im9 bridging
Tyr55 and Val34, both important binding residues. Hydro￾phobicity is an important component of protein-protein
interactions (26-28), and so it seems likely that Tyr54 serves
both a structural and functional role in Im9. Similar
arguments apply to Leu33, although unlike Tyr54 a signifi￾cant portion of the side chain of this residue is buried in the
hydrophobic core of Im9. Even so, ∆∆Gbinding on substitution
for alanine is much greater than that seen for other residues
of similar accessibility and stability, for example, Leu36 and
Val37 (Figure 4A), implying a role in binding.
In summary, the alanine mutagenesis data point to 10
residues (Glu30, Leu33, Val34, Val37, Glu41, Ser50, Asp51,
Tyr54, Tyr55, and Pro56) as being important for binding
the E9 DNase, all of which project from helices II and III.
Seven of these have little effect on the stability of Im9 when
substituted for alanine (Glu30, Val34, Glu41, Ser50, Asp51,
Tyr55, and Pro56), while the remaining three residues
(Leu33, Val37, and Tyr54) appear to have both structural
and functional roles.
DISCUSSION
Problems in Protein-Protein Recognition. In recent years
a number of systems have provided important information
on the structures and thermodynamics of protein complexes.
Examples include hormone-receptor complexes (20, 27, 29),
RNase-inhibitor complexes (21, 30, 31) and antibody￾antigen complexes (32-35). Nevertheless, two key ques￾tions concerning protein-protein recognition remain to be
answered. (1) Why do different protein complexes possess
different affinities? (2) How is specificity defined in families
of homologous proteins? The first question, related to the
biological role of the complex, highlights one of the main
problems in protein-protein recognition, that of the very
diverse affinities that can describe interprotein complexes;
for example, the Kds for the complexes cited above range
from 10-6 to 10-14 M. Calculating protein complex binding
affinities has proven elusive (36) although there have been
successful empirical models (32) based primarily on the
amount of buried surface area in protein-protein complexes
(37, 38). The second question arises because within a family
of homologous proteins binding specificity must be built
upon a common structural framework. In antigen-antibody
complexes, for example, Kds ranging from 10-6 to 10-9 M
are achieved by six variable loops built upon the conserved
â-sheet framework structure of the immunglobulin fold (34,
35). While the sequence of the loops is undoubtedly the
main determinant of antibody specificity, the framework itself
can affect the conformation of the loops and hence specificity
(39). The DNase-specific immunity proteins Im2, Im7, Im8,
and Im9 bind the E9 DNase with dissociation constants
ranging from 10-4 to 10-16 M (14). Therefore, this is a
FIGURE 6: Structure of Im9 showing the residues which dominate
the binding interactions toward the E9 DNase. The ten residues
which the alanine scan data suggest are the major contributors
toward E9 DNase binding energy are shown in the figure. Color
code: red, residues from helix III which act as the anchor of the
E9 DNase binding site; green, variable residues of helix II which
govern protein-protein interaction specificity.
Colicin-Immunity Protein Recognition Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 2, 1998 483unique system in which to address how such varied stabilities
can be achieved within a family of structurally homologous
proteins.
A Dual Recognition Model for Immunity Specificity. We
have proposed previously that the differing stabilities of
cognate versus noncognate interactions could be determined
by a few key residues whose contribution to binding energy
is dependent on their structural context (14). The results of
the alanine scan provide experimental evidence for such a
mechanism of selectivity. The main DNase binding interac￾tions on Im9 are dominated by up to 10 residues: five from
helix III (Ser50, Asp51, Tyr54, Tyr55, and Pro56) and five
from helix II (Glu30, Leu33, Val34, Val37, and Glu41).
The residues from helix III make the largest relative
contribution to DNase binding, accounting for approximately
two-thirds of the binding energy (whether amino acids which
affect protein stability are included or not). Importantly,
these residues are conserved in the immunity protein family
(Figure 5c). The residues displayed from helix II are not
conserved and while only contributing around one-third of
the relative binding energy are known to govern colicin￾DNase binding specificity (15). This is analogous to other
protein complexes where residues which govern specificity
do not themselves contribute significantly to the binding
energy (40, 41). Our data argue for a dual recognition model
for colicin-immunity binding in which the conserved
residues of helix III serve as the anchor of the binding site
and contribute the greatest binding energy while the variable
residues of helix II make a relatively small contribution to
binding energy but determine the specificity of the protein￾protein interaction.
The apparent binding energy associated with the five
conserved anchor residues of helix III in the cognate Im9-
E9 DNase interaction is of the order of 15-19 kcal/mol.
Yet the E9 DNase binding energy associated with the
noncognate immunity proteins Im7, Im8, and Im2 is ∼6, 8,
and 10 kcal/mol, respectively (14). Since the structures of
the immunity proteins are very similar (11, 12), this implies
that these residues cannot contribute the same binding energy
in the noncognate complexes. In other words, the potentially
stabilizing interactions of the anchor residues of helix III
are modulated by the specificity-determining residues of helix
II. This model further implies that the residues of helix II
serve two roles: making unique interactions that contribute
to binding energy (approximately one-third in a cognate
complex) and participating in steric and electrostatic clashes
which modulate the stabilizing interactions emanating from
the conserved residues of helix III.
Modulation of Anchor Interactions by the Specificity￾Determining Residues of Helix II. Closer inspection of the
residues on the surface of helix II suggests ways in which
this modulation might occur, for example, position 34 which
abuts the binding site anchor of helix III (Figure 5a,b). In
the cognate E9 DNase-Im9 complex Val34 makes a
significant interaction with the E9 DNase since mutating it
to alanine destabilizes binding by 2.6 kcal/mol but does not
affect the stability of Im9 itself (Figure 4). Furthermore, it
seems likely that a hydrophobic recognition site on the E9
DNase exists that is designed to accept the valine side chain
of position 34 in Im9. This being the case, it is of interest
to note that the magnitude of complex destabilization that
results from the Val34Ala substitution is of the same order
as that expected for the removal of buried methyl groups
from the hydrophobic core of a folded protein (42); in several
mutagenesis studies it has been found that the conformational
stability of a protein is destabilized by 1.5 ( 0.5 kcal/mol
per buried methylene. This is similar to the destabilization
energy associated with the removal of each of the methyl
groups of Val34 in the E9 DNase-Im9 complex (1.3 kcal/
mol), implying that this residue fits into a closely packed,
hydrophobic pocket on the surface of its target enzyme. The
relevance of this comparison to specificity in the colicin
DNase-immunity system becomes clear from the identity
of this residue in other immunity proteins; position 34 is an
aspartic acid residue in Im8 and Im7 and an asparagine
residue in Im2. Indeed, substituting the valine of Im9 for
an aspartic acid residue found in Im8 causes the resulting
mutant protein to cross-react with colicin E8 in a biological
plate assay even though Im9 itself does not show such cross￾reactivity (43).
The presence of an unpaired charge in the hydrophobic
core of a globular protein is highly destabilizing (42). Placed
in the context of the alanine scanning data on Im9 and the
specificity differences between the immunity proteins, part
of the mechanism of specificity for these proteins may have
its basis in this fundamental principle of protein stability.
Assuming that all the immunity proteins have the capacity
to form the stabilizing anchor interactions (from helix III),
then achieving these with a noncognate immunity protein
might result in the immersion of a charged or polar residue
in a binding pocket on the E9 DNase designed to accom￾modate a hydrophobic residue. In this way, the stabilizing
interactions of the binding site anchor could be counteracted
by the instability generated from having the wrong amino
acid at position 34. Similar situations could pertain for other
residues along helix II such as position 41 which is a glutamic
acid in Im9 (and contributes ∼2 kcal/mol binding energy)
but an isoleucine and leucine residue in Im8 and Im7,
respectively.
Colicin-Immunity Protein Complexes and Other Protein￾Protein Interaction Systems. The analogy between protein￾protein recognition and the topology of a folded protein has
previously been recognized by others, a good example being
the work of Wells and co-workers on growth hormone
binding to its receptor (27, 41). An alanine scan across the
binding surfaces of both binding partners showed that the
main determinants of complex stability were complementary
hydrophobic interactions at the center of the binding site
while peripheral residues tended to be polar or charged
groups that contributed little to binding energy but which
were implicated in receptor specificity. There are some
similarities to the E9 DNase-Im9 interaction since some of
the main binding determinants in Im9 are large hydrophobic
groups (two tyrosines and a valine). There are significant
differences however, such as the presence of an important
charged residue, Asp51, in the binding site and the involve￾ment of hydrophobic residues such as Val34 in specificity.
Several polar and charged residues have already been
identified in the E9 DNase as being involved both in
specificity (44) and in the mechanism of the enzyme (17),
and these residues may be involved in the interaction with
the charged groups of Im9.
The modulation of binding energy from conserved interac￾tion sites by neighboring variable residues would appear to
484 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 2, 1998 Wallis et al.be a mechanism of specificity that is operating in other
protein families as well as colicin-immunity complexes.
Signal transduction proteins, for example, which contain
conserved SH2 and SH3 domains all recognize a specific
motif, phosphotyrosyl-containing peptides and polyproline
sequences, respectively, but specificity is mediated through
neighboring nonconserved residues (45, 46). Interestingly,
this mediation can take the form of charged-for-hydrophobic
residue substitutions as in the case of the Fyn tyrosine kinase
SH3 domain binding the HIV-1 Nef protein with high affinity
(46, 47).
Modulation of binding energy by destabilizing interactions
has also been used to select specific topological isomers of
four helical bundles in the area of protein design (48).
Although this destabilization was primarily through repulsion
of like charges, it may be possible to engineer similar
topological restraints by charge-for-hydrophobic residue
substitutions as occurs in the immunty protein system.
In conclusion, our observation that conserved residues
dominate the binding interaction between immunity proteins
and colicin DNases may be a general phenomenon in
protein-protein recognition involving structurally homolo￾gous proteins. This is a logical mechanism of selectivity in
evolutionary terms since the appearance of novel specificities
need only require the mutation of a select few residues which
modulate the binding interactions emanating from the
conserved protein scaffold.
