T cells probe a diverse milieu of peptides presented by molecules
of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) by using the T￾cell receptor (TCR) to scan these ligands with high sensitivity and
specificity1
. Here we describe a physical basis for this scanning
process by studying the residues involved in both the initial
association and the stable binding of TCR to peptide–MHC,
using the well-characterized TCR and peptide–MHC pair of
2B4 and MCC-IEk (moth cytochrome c, residues 88–103)2
. We
show that MHC contacts dictate the initial association, guiding
TCR docking in a way that is mainly independent of the peptide.
Subsequently, MCC-IEk peptide contacts dominate stabilization,
imparting specificity and influencing T-cell activation by mod￾ulating the duration of binding. This functional subdivision of
the peptide–MHC ligand suggests that a two-step process for
TCR recognition facilitates the efficient scanning of diverse
peptide–MHC complexes on the surface of cells and also makes
TCRs inherently crossreactive towards different peptides bound
by the same MHC.
The ab TCR is a heterodimeric molecule consisting of variable
and constant immunoglobulin domains in which the complemen￾tarity determining regions (CDRs) of the variable domains com￾prise the peptide–MHC binding surface3
. The TCR binds peptide–
MHC in a conserved diagonal orientation that positions the CDR1
and CDR2 loops mainly over the MHC and the CDR3 loops over
peptide. TCR recognition is highly sensitive to small numbers of
ligands among thousands of different peptide–MHC complexes
and yet is often highly specific for a particular peptide–MHC
combination1
.
The ability of a peptide–MHC complex to activate a T cell
generally correlates with the strength and duration of TCR binding2
.
We evaluated the contribution of individual residues in MCC-IEk to
TCR binding by mutating amino acids to alanine (or glycine if the
original amino acid was alanine) and measuring the effects using
surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 1 and Table 1). When mapped onto
the structure of MCC-IEk (ref. 4), these measurements delineate a
broad contact surface for the 2B4 TCR (Fig. 2a), which is similar to
that seen in the crystal structures of other TCR and peptide–MHC
complexes3
. MHC residues spanning Gln 61 to Ala 72 on the a￾chain and Gln 64 to Thr 77 on the b-chain of MCC-IEk all
contribute to binding affinity. These residues include charged,
polar and neutral residues (such as b-chain Asp 76, b-chain Thr
77, a-chain Ala 65), and most contribute only modestly to binding
stability (two- to fourfold decreases in affinity). A small cluster of
residues spanning positions 64–73 on the b-chain has a larger
impact on stability (8- to 40-fold decreases in affinity) and may
comprise an MHC anchor point for TCR recognition, similar to
that seen in a complex of a TCR and a class I MHC molecule5
.
Notably, alanine substitutions at each of the three TCR contact
positions in the MCC peptide6,7 result in very large decreases in
affinity, such that binding is not measurable (on the basis of BIAcore
3000 sensitivity, this corresponds to more than a 200-fold decrease
in binding). As compared with MHC contact residues, the much
larger contribution of peptide contact residues to complex stability
indicates that the peptide is a hotspot for TCR binding.
In apparent contrast to these observations, alanine scanning
mutagenesis of the 2C TCR, in conjunction with competitive
enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent binding assays to either the
agonist ligand SIYR-Kb or the alloreactive ligand QL9-Ld
, suggests
a smaller energetic role for those portions of the TCR that contact
peptide than those observed here8,9. But the 2C TCR forms a poor
complementary fit to peptide when bound to Kb
, as compared with
other TCR/peptide–MHC complexes10,11. Perhaps these few poor
contacts must be overcome by increasing the relative energetic
importance of MHC contacts for stable binding, thereby contribut￾Figure 1 Binding of 2B4 TCR to wild-type MCC-IEk and selected point mutants in the

CDR3b loop consists largely of glycine, may miss important
stabilizing contacts between the polypeptide backbone of the
CDR3b loop and the peptide ligand. Mutagenesis of peptide
contacts for the 3L.2 (ref. 12) and A6 (ref. 13) TCRs suggests that
a peptide energetic hotspot may be a more common feature of TCR
and peptide–MHC interactions.
We analysed the contribution of individual residues in MCC-IEk
to the initial association with 2B4. The interactions that are
important for this transition-state complex can be determined by
analysing association rate constants. This type of analysis, phi (f)
value determination, has been used to study unimolecular protein
folding pathways and the association-induced folding of protein
fragments14. The f value for a given residue incorporates its
contribution to the activation energy of association, normalized
by its contribution to the free energy of binding. Contacts with f
values of zero are not formed in the transition state nor involved in
the initial association, whereas those with large f values (up to a
maximum of one, which represents full formation in the transition
state) help to guide the course of the reaction.
In the 2B4/MCC-IEk complex, 8 out of the 11 contacts on the
MHC helices that contribute to binding affinity are also present in
the transition state, with f values ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 (Fig. 2b
and Table 1). These residues comprise a continuous surface on the
a- and b-chains of the MHC molecule and surround the central
portion of the peptide antigen. f values for the peptide contacts of
2B4 on MCC-IEk could not be calculated from alanine mutations,
because binding was undetectable. We therefore characterized a set
of peptide variants in which portions of amino acid side chains were
modified or removed without abolishing detectable TCR binding or
grossly changing the peptide–MHC structure. By choosing peptide
variants that in combination delineated each amino acid side chain,
we could infer a f value for each residue.
We found that TCR contacts with the MCC peptide mainly
influence the off rate of binding but not the on rate (Table 1). In
particular, the f values for all variants at positions 97 and 102 of the
peptide are zero, which indicates that specific TCR contacts with
these residues do not form in the transition state. The f value for the
central peptide contact, as judged by the Lys99 ! Arg variant, is
0.17 and shows a high degree of specificity for the positive charge at
the tip of the lysine side chain. This value is smaller than that for
most of the MHC contacts and suggests only partial involvement in
the transition state. Notably, the MCC-IEk residues with the largest
f values are charged residues on the MHC helices. Molecular
modelling indicated that these residues comprise patches of elec￾trostatic complementarity with the 2B4 TCR, which is consistent
with other studies that indicate that long-range electrostatic steering
can have an important role in protein–protein association15,16.
It is noteworthy that peptide contacts with TCR contribute
substantially to complex stability and yet have little effect on
association, whereas MHC contacts contribute little to stability
but dominate association. This dichotomy is marked, as our
measurements suggest that the MCC peptide accounts for ,85%
of the stabilization energy, but only ,10% of the association energy
(Methods). We conclude that MHC interactions guide the docking
of the TCR with only minor contributions from the peptide,
whereas peptide contacts largely determine the stability of binding.
To determine whether our observed functional subdivision of
MCC-IEk was a general property of peptide–MHC or a unique case,
we analysed the data for another well-studied TCR/peptide–MHC
system, A6/Tax-HLA-A2 (refs 5, 13). Although kinetic data for all of
the residues comprising the A6 interaction surface on Tax-A2 were
not available, we applied f analysis to all published MHC and
peptide contacts (see Supplementary Information). The available
data suggest that MHC contacts are more prominent in the
transition state than are peptide contacts. Four out of the six
MHC contacts that we analysed have f values between 0.5 and
1.0, whereas all peptide contacts have f values that are less than 0.3

loops of the A6 TCR and has a f value of 0.56. Given the unusually
fast association rate of the A6 TCR (105 M21 s
21
), as compared with
most TCR agonist ligands (103
–104 M21 s
21
; ref. 2), the f values for
its association might be expected to be higher throughout the
epitope, as is observed.
We also measured the average backbone distances between TCR
CDR loops and their contacts on MHC helices and peptide in the
crystal structures of four TCR/peptide–MHC complexes, including
two class-I-restricted and two class-II-restricted TCRs (Protein Data
Bank (PDB) accession codes, 2CKB, 1FO0, 1D9K and 1FYT). We
found that on average a greater distance separates the TCR from
peptide than from MHC, especially for the CDR1 and CDR2
contacts with peptide–MHC. These differences range from 0.2 to
0.8 A˚ and, although small, are significant and show that an
approaching TCR will initially encounter the MHC helices, which
will present a structural barrier to the TCR and force longer range
contacts with the peptide. Although the depth of the bound peptide
varies in different class I and class II MHC molecules, with some
class I peptides having an upward bulge, in general most of the
peptide surface in peptide–MHC structures is deep in the binding
groove and lies below the surfaces of the MHC helices3
.
These structural features of TCR/peptide–MHC complexes,
together with our current data, suggest a two-step mechanism for
TCR recognition (Fig. 3). In this model, initial TCR–MHC inter￾actions, aided by minor contributions from TCR contacts with the
peptide, guide the TCR to its ligand. This is followed by a final
folding of the two CDR3 loops of the TCR over the peptide. T-cell
activation would be triggered only on the formation of stable
peptide contacts. This model suggests that MHC restriction may
be viewed as a ‘kinetic gatekeeper’ that promotes peptide sampling
by guiding the docking of TCR onto peptide–MHC in a way that is
mainly independent of peptide. It is intriguing that the CDR3 loops
of TCRs are highly flexible and mobile in the unbound state17 and
adopt conformations that cannot specifically contact peptide resi￾dues without substantial rearrangement, sometimes up to 15 A˚ (refs
3, 18). In contrast, the CDR1 and CDR2 loops are much more rigid,
generally showing little or no rearrangement on binding peptide–
MHC. Thus, the TCR may scan MHC molecules using a ‘lock and
key’ type of binding with its CDR1 and CDR2 loops, followed by an
induced fit of its CDR3 loops over the peptide19,20.
A two-step TCR recognition mechanism might be necessary to
scan efficiently the many thousands of peptides displayed by MHC
molecules on an antigen-presenting cell. It would also help explain
the inherent crossreactivity of TCRs21, because the CDR3 loops of
the TCR could adopt several conformations and thus form stable
contacts with structurally very different peptides. Studies of other
protein–protein interactions indicate that small subsections of a
binding epitope can account for a significant portion of the total
stabilization energy, comprising a binding ‘hotspot’22. In our
studies, we have found that different parts of a binding surface
may have distinct roles in the association and stabilization of a
protein complex, comprising association and stabilization hotspots.
This functional subdivision of a binding epitope might be especially
important for interactions in which one binding partner must
search quickly among many similar targets for an optimal one,
such as in the recognition of specific sequence motifs by DNA￾binding proteins.
The functional subdivision of the peptide–MHC epitope would
have broad implications for T cell biology. One example is in thymic
development, during which the TCR repertoire undergoes selection
to yield T cells that are skewed to recognize self-MHC alleles23,24. A
study has indicated that MHC reactivity is inherent in the germline￾encoded portions of the TCR25, which suggests that most TCRs may
have rudimentary scanning capability. Our studies indicate that the
TCR recognition of MHC and peptide can be separable events,
which suggests that thymic selection may imprint MHC restriction
by enriching for TCRs that can scan a particular self-MHC and may
be unable to scan other MHCs efficiently. Although most MHC
polymorphisms are buried in the peptide-binding groove, high￾resolution structural studies indicate that they can still have signifi￾cant effects on MHC helix conformation and may thereby influence
scanning26,27. The mature TCR repertoire need not be enriched for
specific V regions, however, because structural studies indicate that
there is flexibility in MHC recognition by a given V region and
therefore no specific MHC ‘footprint’ for TCR binding3,18. Thymic

TCR that arises from CDR3 loop flexibility, which enables inter￾actions with self-peptide–MHC that may resemble a foreign pep￾tide–MHC28 or may be very different. A similar process may be
involved in peripheral T-cell homeostasis, which also depends on
recognition of self-peptide–MHC29. A
Methods
Alanine-scanning mutagenesis
Sites of mutation were chosen on the basis of the following two criteria: first, positions
known from T-cell activation studies using peptide–MHC mutants to have biological
effects on T-cell recognition (refs 6, 7; and M. Krogsgaard and L.C.W., unpublished data);
and second, likely positions of contact deduced from homology modelling using the
crystal structures of 2C/dEV8-H2Kb (PDB accession code 2CKB) and IEk bound to a
haemoglobin peptide (PDB accession code 1IEA). We chose residues such that mutations
would affect only interaction with the TCR and not the structure of the rest of the peptide–
MHC surface. Notably, the three peptide residues that form TCR contacts point up and
away from the peptide-binding cleft and do not contact MHC. In addition, we minimized
complications arising from conformational heterogeneity by mutating residues on the
peptide–MHC, which undergoes minimal conformational change on binding TCR. There
was no evidence for large-scale destabilization or unfolding of peptide–MHC owing to our
mutations, as all mutants contained bound peptide, had small and distinct effects on
association and dissociation, and were bound by an antibody specific for native structure
(14.4.4). Local structural perturbations caused by mutations could affect this type of
analysis by changing the effective concentration of molecules that are competent for
binding; however, the rate of such conformational fluctuations is much faster than our
observed protein association rates, suggesting a pre-equilibrium of binding-competent
species. In combination, our mutants comprised about 75% of the total surface area
buried under the footprint of the TCR and covered the highest contact points on the
peptide–MHC surface.
Protein production and purification
We produced MCC-IEk and the various mutants by in vitro refolding of bacterially
produced recombinant a- and b-subunits with chemically synthesized peptides. MHC
mutants were produced by PCR site-directed mutagenesis and verified by DNA
sequencing. The a-subunit of IEk contained a carboxy-terminal amino acid tag encoding a
signal sequence for attaching biotin with the BirA enzyme. Bacterial IEk subunits were
expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 pLysS as inclusion bodies. After bacterial lysis,
inclusion bodies were washed with detergent buffers. Subunits were solubilized and
oxidized in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride and then diluted to a final concentration of
2 mM in a redox folding buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 25%
glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM reduced and 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 10 mM peptide
(MCC 88–103 wild-type sequence, ANERADLIAYLKQATK) and protease inhibitors.
Correctly folded material was purified by affinity chromatography with 14.4.4. antibody
against IEk
, biotinylated with BirA enzyme, and size-purified on an S200 sephacryl fast
protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) sizing column.
We produced 2B4 TCR as a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane￾bound protein in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using a Cell Pharm
system (Cellex Biosciences). Protein was cleaved from the CHO cells with PI-PLC enzyme
and purified sequentially on two antibody affinity columns (A2B4, against TCRa and H57,
against TCRb). TCR was size-purified on an S200 sephacryl FPLC column before use.
BIAcore measurements of binding
Kinetic parameters for 2B4 binding to wild-type MCC-IEk and mutants were obtained on
BIAcore 2000 and 3000 instruments (BIAcore). Peptide–MHC was attached by the C￾terminal biotin tag on the IEk a-subunit to a streptavidin sensor chip surface to a total
resonance unit (RU) value of 250–500. Binding constants were not dependent on the
amount of peptide–MHC coupled to the sensor chip. Subsequent to sensor chip loading
with peptide–MHC, extra biotin-binding sites were blocked by injection of free biotin. All
measurements were baseline-corrected by subtracting TCR injected over a blank, biotin￾blocked surface, and all mutant measurements were referenced to wild-type MCC-IEk
,
which was measured simultaneously. We injected 2B4 TCR in PBS plus 0.005% P20
(BIAcore) at a flow rate of 30 ml min21 at 25 8C, over a concentration range of 1–150 mM
according to the peptide–MHC mutant being measured. Data were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir
binding model using both separate on rate and off rate determinations and global fitting
(BiaEval, BIAcore). Rate constants were the same, within error, for both methods of fitting
and did not vary systematically with the concentration of 2B4 TCR. Two residues (Glu 79
on the a-chain and Glu 59 on the b-chain of IEk
), which are located far outside the
predicted 2B4 binding surface and do not affect T-cell activation6
, do not contribute to 2B4
binding affinity. As predicted, the kinetic binding parameters of alanine mutants at these
positions are identical to those of wild-type MCC-IEk
.
Data analysis
The dissociation of 2B4 from MCC-IEk is described by the following equation:
½2B4=MCC–IEk O
koff
kon
½2B4þ½MCC–IEk
where koff is the dissociation constant and k on is the association constant. R is the gas
constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The equilibrium constant for dissociation is
Keq ¼ koff =kon; and DG ¼ RT lnKeq: The association constant for binding can be
converted to an activation energy, Ea ¼ 2RT lnkon: Comparison of activation energies for
wild-type versus mutant MCC-IEk are given as f values, which are calculated as DEa
normalized by DDG (ref. 14):
f ¼ 2RT lnðkon;wt=kon;mutÞ= 2 RT lnðKeq;mut=Keq;wtÞ
To estimate the contribution of peptide to stabilization and activation energies, we first
calculated a total stabilization energy of 7.17 kcal mol21 and a total activation energy of
4.91 kcal mol21
, which were based on an equilibrium binding constant of 5.5 mM and an
association rate of 4,000 M21 s
21
, for the binding of 2B4 to wild-type MCC-IEk
.
For stabilization, we assumed that the MCC peptide was subdivided into two largely
independent contact points comprising residues Tyr 97/Lys 99 and Thr 102. This was
based on structural studies of MCC-IEk
, which indicate that Tyr 97 and Lys 99 are in close
proximity4
, and on binding measurements of the double peptide mutant Tyr97Phe/
Thr102Ser, which show the additive effects of the single mutants. Assuming that each
peptide contact point accounts for 3.14 kcal mol21 (on the basis of alanine mutations at
each of the three peptide contact positions), we calculated a net peptide contribution that
is about 85% of the total binding energy.
For association, only position 99 of the peptide contributes to the activation energy.
Assuming that Lys 99 contributes a stabilization energy of 3.14 kcal mol21
, its f value of
0.17 yields a net peptide contribution of 0.53 kcal mol21
, which is about 10% of the total
activation energy.
TCR/peptide–MHC distance measurements
We measured TCR/peptide–MHC distances with the program O7, using lists of published
TCR/peptide–MHC contacts (both van der Waals and hydrogen-bond contacts).
Distances were measured between the backbone a-carbons of contacting residues, which
were classified as either TCR–peptide or TCR–MHC, and averaged for comparison.

APC-dependent proteolysis
of the mitotic cyclin Clb2
is essential for mitotic exit
Ralph Wa¨ sch & Frederick R. Cross

Cyclin degradation is central to regulation of the cell cycle.
Mitotic exit was proposed to require degradation of the S phase
cyclin Clb5 by the anaphase-promoting complex1,2 activated by
Cdc20 (APCCdc20)
3
. Furthermore, Clb5 degradation was thought
to be necessary for effective dephosphorylation and activation of
the APC regulatory subunit Cdh1 (also known as Hct1) and the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 by the phosphatase
Cdc14, allowing mitotic kinase inactivation and mitotic exit3–7.
Here we show, however, that spindle disassembly and cell div￾ision occur without significant APCCdc20-mediated Clb5 degra￾dation, as well as in the absence of both Cdh1 and Sic1. We find
instead that destruction-box-dependent degradation of the mito￾tic cyclin Clb2 is essential for mitotic exit. APCCdc20 may be
required for an essential early phase of Clb2 degradation, and
this phase may be sufficient for most aspects of mitotic exit. Cdh1
and Sic1 may be required for further inactivation of Clb2–Cdk1,
regulating cell size and the length of G1.
CDC20 is essential for mitosis. Cdc20-dependent degradation of
the securin Pds1 is required for chromosome separation. pds1
deletion (pds1D) allows chromosome separation but not mitotic
exit in cdc20D cells8
, suggesting that additional APCCdc20 targets
must be degraded. Cdc20-dependent degradation of Clb5 was
proposed to be essential for mitotic exit, as cdc20D pds1D clb5D
cells are viable3
.
To determine whether APCCdc20-dependent Clb5 degradation
was dependent on the Clb5 destruction box (D box)9,10we expressed
Clb5 and Clb5Ddb (where the D box is deleted) from the GAL1
promoter in cdc20D or CDC20 cells. cdc20 deletion stabilized Clb5
(ref. 3). Deletion of the Clb5 D box stabilized Clb5 similarly with or
without CDC20 (Fig. 1a), suggesting that the D box was the main
target for Cdc20 recognition. Inactivation of additional candidate
Clb5 D boxes (RXXL), SCF or Cdh1 did not affect Clb5 stability
(Supplementary Information Fig. S1a, b). Unexpectedly, D-box
deletion from endogenous CLB5 had little cell cycle phenotype,
although Clb5 abundance was significantly deregulated (Figs 1b, c
and 2f, g). Thus D-box-dependent Clb5 degradation is not required
for exit from mitosis and viability.
To examine the D-box dependence of Clb5 proteolysis at
endogenous expression levels during mitotic exit, we constructed
cdc20D pds1D GALL-CDC20 yeast strains3 containing CLB5 or
CLB5Ddb (exact gene replacement). Both strains arrested before
mitotic exit on glucose medium (unlike cdc20D pds1D clb5D (ref.
3)), indicating that CLB5Ddb restrained mitotic exit in the cdc20D
pds1D background. Therefore it is unlikely that the Clb5 D box is
required for inhibition of mitotic exit, although it could still be
required for other untested mitotic Clb5 functions. GALL-CDC20
re-induction released mitotic arrest (Fig. 1d–f), and wild-type Clb5
was completely degraded 20 min later. Clb5Ddb showed only
moderate decline at later time points. The mitotic cyclins Clb2
and Clb3 were degraded rapidly after release, in both strains, and
this degradation initiated while Clb5Ddb levels were high (Fig. 1e,
f). Thus, significantly inhibiting APCCdc20-dependent Clb5 degra￾dation had no effect on mitotic exit (Fig. 1d–f).
The moderate decline in levels of Clb5Ddb in this experiment
could result from minor Cdc20-dependent degradation signals in
Clb5 that are independent of the D box. This decline is probably not
required for mitotic exit, as strong overexpression of Clb5Ddb￾haemagglutinin (HA) from the GAL1 promoter caused lethality but
did not block mitotic exit10. Furthermore, amino-terminal Myc￾tagging made Clb5Ddb almost completely stable, and was lethal at
endogenous expression levels without an evident block to mitotic
exit (Supplementary Information Fig. S2a, b). It is possible that the
moderate Cdc20-dependent decline in Clb5Ddb could combine
with inhibition by the Sic1 Clb kinase inhibitor11 to effectively
eliminate Clb5Ddb activity at endogenous expression levels. There￾fore, to more fully deregulate Clb5Ddb activity we also deleted SIC1.
CLB5Ddb sic1D GAL-SIC1 strains were semi-lethal on glucose
medium (GAL-SIC1 off) (Fig. 2f), but a shift to glucose caused
accumulation of cells with replicated but unseparated DNA, and
without long mitotic spindles (Fig. 2b). Thus these cells were
primarily defective in entry into mitosis and not in mitotic exit.
We constructed a CLB5Ddb sic1D GAL-SIC1 cdc15-2 strain to
examine a single cycle of mitotic exit. These cells exited mitosis
(disassembled mitotic spindles) after release from cdc15-2 anaphase
block, despite Sic1 depletion (to below the level of detection) for 4 h
in glucose medium at 37 8C (Fig. 3a). Compare Sic1 re-accumu￾lation in cdc15-2 SIC1 strains, 10–20 min before spindle disassembly
(Fig. 3a). Unlike Clb5, Clb5Ddb persisted through the cdc15-2
anaphase block and subsequent release (Fig. 3a).
To examine mitotic exit in sic1D CLB5Ddb cells in an unper￾turbed cell cycle, we incubated a sic1D CLB5Ddb GAL-SIC1 strain in
glucose medium to deplete Sic1, elutriated small-budded cells and
released into mating-factor to block the succeeding cell cycle after
mitosis. Incubation in glucose for 30 min depleted Sic1 to about
physiological levels in the initial elutriated fraction, but cell division
occurred normally (Fig. 3b). Incubation in glucose for 60 min
depleted Sic1 to below the level of detection, and most cells still
completed cell division on schedule (Fig. 3b). The small number of
cells that failed to divide were mostly blocked before nuclear
division. Thus, we observed no inhibition of mitotic exit by
Clb5Ddb, even in the absence of Sic1. Clb5Ddb only gradually
