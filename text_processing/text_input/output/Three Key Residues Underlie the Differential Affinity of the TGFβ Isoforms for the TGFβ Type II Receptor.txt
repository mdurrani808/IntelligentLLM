TGFb1, b2, and b3 are 25 kDa homodimeric polypeptides that play crucial
non-overlapping roles in development, tumor suppression, and wound
healing. They exhibit 70–82% sequence identity and transduce their signals
by binding and bringing together the TGFb type I and type II receptors,
TbRI and TbRII. TGFb2 differs from the other isoforms in that it binds TbRII
weakly and is dependent upon the co-receptor betaglycan for function. To
explore the physicochemical basis underlying these differences, we
generated a series of single amino acid TbRII variants based on the crystal
structure of the TbRII:TGFb3 complex and examined these in terms of their
TGFb isoform binding affinity and their equilibrium stability. The results
showed that TbRII Ile53 and Glu119, which contact TGFb3 Val92 and
Arg25, respectively, together with TbRII Asp32, Glu55, and Glu75, which
contact TGFb3 Arg94, each contribute significantly, between 1 kcal molK1
to 1.5 kcal molK1
, to ligand binding affinities. These contacts likely underlie
the estimated 4.1 kcal molK1 lower affinity with which TbRII binds TGFb2
as these three ligand residues are unchanged in TGFb1 but are
conservatively substituted in TGFb2 (Lys25, Ile92, and Lys94). To test this
hypothesis, a TGFb2 variant was generated in which these three residues
were changed to those in TGFbs 1 and 3. This variant exhibited receptor
binding affinities comparable to those of TGFbs 1 and 3. Together, these
results show that these three residues underlie the lowered affinity of
TGFb2 for TbRII and that all isoforms likely induce assembly of the TGFb
signaling receptors in the same overall manner.

Introduction
Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) isoforms
regulate cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and
expression of extracellular matrix proteins and are
the founding members of a highly diversified
superfamily of w25 kDa signal ligands.1 These
isoforms, and other structurally related proteins of
the TGFb superfamily, such as activins, bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and growth and
differentiation factors (GDFs), exert their biological
effects by binding and bringing together two pairs
of structurally similar, single-pass transmembrane
receptors, classified as types I and II.2 The ligand￾mediated assembly of these two receptor types
triggers an intracellular phosphorylation cascade,
initiated by the serine-threonine kinase domain of
the type II receptor, which transphosphorylates the
adjacent type I kinase.3 The type I kinase in turn
phosphorylates the nuclear-translocating Smad

transcription of target genes.
There are three TGFb isoforms in mammals. The
isoforms, termed TGFbs 1–3, are each encoded by a
distinct gene, share between 70% and 82% sequence
identity, and are expressed in a developmentally
regulated tissue-specific fashion.1 They exhibit
overlapping biological activities in vitro although
the phenotypes of the isoform-specific null mice are
non-overlapping. TGFb1 null mice have an auto￾immune-like inflammatory disease,5 TGFb2 null
mice exhibit perinatal mortality and developmental
defects,6 and TGFb3 null mice have cleft palate and
are defective in lung development.7 This indicates
that each isoform fulfills a distinct role in vivo.
The three TGFb isoforms have been shown to
transduce their signals by binding the TGFb type I
and type II receptors, TbRI and TbRII, respectively.8
TGFb2 differs from TGFbs 1 and 3, however, in that
it binds TbRII with an affinity about 1000-fold
weaker (corresponds to a reduction of its binding
free energy of about 4.1 kcal molK1
).9–11 Consistent
with this altered pattern of TbRII binding, cell
responsiveness to TGFb2 has been shown to be
dependent upon a third abundant TGFb binding
protein, known as betaglycan.12
The assembly on the cell surface of the complex
between TbRI and TbRII and the TGFb isoforms has
been shown through experiments with differen￾tially tagged receptors to occur with a 2:2:1
stoichiometry.13,14 This stoichiometry has been
confirmed in part through the determination of
the structure of the TbRII extracellular domain
(TbRII-ED) bound to the TGFb3 dimer.15 This
showed that TbRII-ED binds by wedging itself
between the fingers on the distal ends of the
dimer. There is no contact between the two bound
TbRII-ED and neither TbRII-ED nor TGFb
undergo significant structural rearrangements
upon binding.15–17 There is at present no structural
information available for the TbRI extracellular
domain (TbRI-ED), although based on the crystal
structure of the 2:1 BMP type Ia receptor extracellular
domain (BMPRIa-ED) complexed to BMP-2,18 it has
been proposed that all type I receptors of the TGFb
superfamily bind their cognate growth factors by
binding at the dimer interface in a manner similar
to that of BMPRIa.18
The objective of the studies reported here was to
identify interactions that contribute to the affinity
and specificity of TbRII:TGFb isoform binding. This
was accomplished by generating a series of single
amino acid TbRII-ED variants. These were charac￾terized in terms of their stability using fluorescence
and their TGFb isoform binding properties using
native gels, surface plasmon resonance, and cell￾based Smad phosphorylation assays. The results
showed that the effects of the substitutions on
affinity are largely due to alterations in ligand
contacts, not stability, and that complex formation
is mediated by a linear array of hydrophobic
residues that bind in a hydrophobic cleft and by
two flanking hydrogen-bonded ion pairs. TbRII
Ile53 and Glu119, which contact TGFb3 Val92 and
Arg25, respectively, together with TbRII Asp32,
Glu55, and Glu75, which contact TGFb3 Arg94,
were each shown to contribute significantly,
between 1 kcal molK1 to 1.5 kcal molK1
, to ligand
binding affinities. These contacts likely underlie the
4.1 kcal molK1 lower affinity with which TbRII
binds TGFb2 as these three ligand residues are
unchanged in TGFb1 but are conservatively sub￾stituted in TGFb2 (Lys25, Ile92, and Lys94). To test
this hypothesis, a TGFb2 variant was generated in
which these three residues were changed to those in
TGFbs 1 and 3. This variant exhibited receptor
binding affinities comparable to those of TGFbs 1
and 3. Together, these results show that these three
residues underlie the lowered affinity of TGFb2 for
TbRII and that all isoforms induce the assembly of
the TGFb signaling receptors in the same overall
manner.
Results
Variant TbRII-EDs
The initial objective of this study was to
determine the contribution of individual TbRII￾ED residues toward TGFb isoform binding. The
residues chosen for study were those that contact
TGFb3 in the crystal structure of the TbRII￾ED:TGFb3 complex.15 These, as shown in Figure 1,
vary in contact area from 4 A˚ 2 to 90 A˚ 2 and were
each initially substituted with alanine. Three
additional interfacial variants were also chosen
for study, D32N, S52L, and E119Q. S52L was
chosen as Ser52 is changed to alanine in other
mammalian species (Figure 1(b)). D32N and
E119Q were chosen to assess the extent to
which electrostatic effects play a role in the
interaction between TbRII Asp32:TGFb1/b3
Arg94 and between TbRII Glu119:TGFb1/b3
Arg25 (Figure 1(a)).
Seven non-interfacial variants, N47A, V62A,
E75A, H79A, F110A, M112A, and I125A, were also
chosen for study. E75A was chosen as Glu75 forms a
water-mediated hydrogen-bond with Arg94 of
TGFb3 in the TbRII-ED:TGFb3 crystal structure
(Figure 1(a)). Substitution of this residue was
predicted to affect TGFb isoform binding affinities.
V62A, H79A, and M112A were chosen by virtue of
their structural homology to critical ligand contact
residues, Phe42, Trp60, and Phe83, identified in
ActRIIa.19,20 Substitution of these residues was
predicted to have little if any effect on TGFb isoform
binding affinities as TbRII and ActRIIa have been
shown to interact with their ligands through
interfaces that are entirely distinct.15,20 N47A,
V62A, F110A, and I125A were chosen as these
correspond to surface-exposed residues that lie
outside the two possible binding interfaces. Substi￾tution of these residues was also predicted to have
little if any effect on TGFb isoform binding affinities.
48 Differential Affinity of TbRII for TGFb IsoformsTbRII-ED:TGFb isoform binding as detected
by native gel electrophoresis
The binding of TGFb isoforms by TbRII-ED can
be monitored using native gels. This is illustrated by
the data presented in Figure 2(a). TbRII-ED, which
has a molecular mass of about 15 kDa and is highly
soluble at the pH of the gel, migrates rapidly and
appears as a sharp band near the gel front
(Figure 2(a), all subpanels, lane 1). TGFb isoforms,
which have molecular masses of about 25 kDa and
are insoluble at the pH of the gel (pH 6.8), exhibit no
detectable bands (Figure 2(a), all subpanels, lane 2).
The addition of increasing amounts of TbRII-ED to
a fixed amount of TGFb1 or TGFb3 homodimer
leads to a complex band that migrates to a position
midway along the length of the gel. This increases
in intensity up to the point at which two equivalents
of TbRII-ED have been added (Figure 2(a), first and
third subpanels from the left, lanes 3–6), consistent
with the expected TGFb:TbRII-ED 1:2 stochiometry.
The results obtained with TGFb2 differ as the
complex band was absent at all TbRII-ED:TGFb2
ratios examined (Figure 2(a), second subpanel from
the left, lanes 3–8). The fact that TGFb1 and TGFb3
form complex bands with TbRII-ED, but TGFb2
does not, is attributed to the reduced affinity of
TbRII-ED for this isoform. To rule out the possibility
that the absence of a complex band was due to
altered mobility of the TbRII-ED:TGFb2 complex,
the native gel was carried out at a lower tempera￾ture (2 8C instead of 22 8C; Figure 2(a), rightmost
subpanel). This resulted in the appearance of a
complex band at the expected position, indicating

structure. (a) Stereo diagram of the TbRII:TGFb3 interface. Backbones are gray, disulfide bonds are black, and contact

lines and ordered interfacial water molecules are shown as red spheres. (b) Major interactions evident in the
crystallographic interface are indicated by double-headed arrows. Classification of the interactions, and the interfacial
contact areas, are indicated on the left.
Differential Affinity of TbRII for TGFb Isoforms 49that the absence of the complex band at the higher
temperature is not caused by the altered mobility of
the complex. The fact that the complex band
appears at the lower temperature, but not the
higher temperature, is probably caused by a
reduction in the dissociation rate of the complex,
koff, at the lower temperature. The fact that the
complex band with TGFb2 was more diffuse and
free TbRII-ED was present, even when TGFb2
was in excess, suggests that the reduction in koff
caused by the lower temperature is not sufficient
to fully suppress dissociation of the complex
during the course of electrophoresis. These results
demonstrate that the native gel binding assay
reports in a qualitative way on TbRII:TGFb isoform
binding in solution.
Qualitative assessment of TbRII-ED
substitutions on binding affinity
The contribution of individual TbRII-ED residues
to TGFb1/b3 binding was assessed using native
gels. This was accomplished by combining two
equivalents of each TbRII-ED variant with one
equivalent of TGFb1 or TGFb3 homodimer. These
mixtures, together with TbRII-ED alone controls,
were then electrophoresed through 12% native gels.
To reduce problems encountered with proteolysis of
the N-terminal segment, all substitutions were
made in the background of TbRII-D14-ED, a form
of the receptor lacking the poorly conserved 14
N-terminal residues. To demonstrate that TbRII￾D14-ED retained high affinity binding to TGFb1
and TGFb3, as previously shown,21 complexes were
formed with TGFb1 or TGFb3 and then electro￾phoresed on native gels as before. The results,
shown in Figure 2(b) and (c), revealed well-defined
complex bands regardless of whether the
full-length (subpanel labeled RII) or truncated
(subpanel labeled RII-D14) receptor
was used, confirming that the N-terminal trunca￾tion indeed has little or no effect on TGFb isoform
binding.
Representative TGFb1 and TGFb3 native gel
binding data for the 15 interfacial and seven
non-interfacial TbRII-D14-ED variants is shown in
Figure 2(b) and (c), respectively (native gel binding
data for all other variants is provided as
Supplementary Data). For 11 interfacial variants,
including L27A, F30A, D32A, D32N, I50A, T51A,
S52L, I53A, E55A, E119A, and E119Q, complex
formation with TGFb1 and TGFb3 was found to be
either completely eliminated (see, as an example,
F30A and E119A) or significantly diminished (see,
as an example, I53A) (Figure 2(b) and (c), respect￾ively). For the remainder of the interfacial variants,
including S49A, S52A, V77A, and D118A, complex
formation with TGFb1 and TGFb3 was unaffected
(see, as an example, S52A) (Figure 2(b) and (c),
Figure 2. Qualitative analysis of wild-type and variant TbRII-ED:TGFb isoform binding by native gel electrophoresis.
(a) Titration of a fixed amount (1.5 mg) of TGFbs 1, 2, and 3 with increasing amounts of wild-type TbRII (0–3.0 molar
equivalents) are shown in the three leftmost subpanels, respectively. The gels were each run for about 1 h at 22 8C and
stained with Coomassie blue. Titration of a fixed amount of TGFb2 (1.5 mg) with increasing amounts of wild-type TbRII is
shown in the rightmost subpanel. This titration was performed as above, but at a lower temperature (2 8C, rather than
22 8C). TbRII:TGFb isoform complexes are indicated by horizontal arrows. (b) and (c) The effect of a representative set of
TbRII substitutions on complex formation with TGFbs 1 and 3 (native gel data showing the full panel of 22 TbRII-ED
variants is provided as Supplementary Data). The data are presented in pairs, with two equivalents of receptor alone
(2.0 mg) in the left lane and two equivalents of receptor (2.0 mg) mixed with one equivalent of TGFb1 or TGFb3
homodimer (1.8 mg) in the right lane. The individual receptor variants were analyzed on separate gels and were aligned
relative to one another based on the migration of the loading dye. The migration of some of the receptor variants, such as
E119A, was retarded relative to wild-type. This was attributed to a decrease in the net overall charge of the receptor at the
pH of the gel (8.8). This follows as such behavior was only observed for receptor variants in which the net overall charge
was changed (see Supplementary Data).
50 Differential Affinity of TbRII for TGFb Isoformsrespectively). For the non-interfacial variants, the
results were much different, in that all, with the
exception of E75A, had no effect on complex
formation with TGFb1 and TGFb3 (see, as an
example, V62A, H79A, and M112A) (Figure 2(b)
and (c), respectively).
These results, even though qualitative, are
consistent with expectations based on the TbRII￾ED:TGFb3 crystal structure. They show, for
example, that the receptor substitutions each yield
similar results when tested with either TGFb1 or
TGFb3, consistent with the observation that resi￾dues of TGFb3 contacted by TbRII in the TbRII￾ED:TGFb3 crystal structure are identical to those in
TGFb1.15 They also show that the interfacial
variants that affect complex formation are, for the
most part, of residues that exhibit favorable
electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, or hydrophobic
contacts in the crystal structure of the TbRII￾ED:TGFb3 complex (Figure 1). Those that do not
are either substituted with alanine in other species
(Ser52) or lie on the periphery of the binding
interface (S49A, V77A, and D118A) (Figure 1). The
fact that the non-interfacial variant, E75A, affected
complex formation, is consistent with the favorable
electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions
that it exhibits in the crystal structure (Figure 1).
The fact that none of the other interfacial variants
affected complex formation is consistent with
expectations from the structures that have been
reported;15,20 V62A, H79A, and M112A are
especially important in this regard as these show
that TbRII does not bind TGFb isoforms with the
concave surface of the receptor, as has been shown
for ActRIIa and ActRIIb.20,22
Quantitative assessment of TbRII-ED
substitutions on binding affinities
The assessment of binding affinities described
above provides valuable information as to
the identity of residues critical for binding. The
qualitative nature of these data however limits the
conclusions that one can draw concerning their
relative importance. To obtain further information,
the effects of the receptor substitutions on ligand
(TGFb1 and TGFb3) binding were quantified
using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This was
accomplished by immobilizing TGFb1 or TGFb3 and
by recording the steady-state SPR response as varying
concentrations of TbRII-ED variants were injected
over these surfaces (Figure 3(a)). Scatchard analysis of
the maximal SPR response when steady state had
been reached as a function of receptor concentration
was then used to obtain an equilibrium dissociation
constant, Kd, for each variant (Figure 3(b)). Such an
approach yielded Kd values of 200 and 290 nM for
wild-type TbRII-ED interactions with TGFbs 1 and 3,
respectively. These values are in good agreement with
those previously determined using an in-depth
kinetic analysis of TbRII-ED binding to TGFb1
(KdZ160 nM),23 thus validating our experimental
approach.
The fitted Kd values obtained from the SPR
analysis are listed in Table 1. There were found to
lie within the TbRII-ED concentration ranges used
for all variants, except S52L, thus justifying the use
of Scatchard plots for analysis of the variants as
well. For the S52L variant, weak binding together
with a limiting amount of available receptor,
precluded us from flowing this TbRII-ED variant
at concentrations above the apparent Kd value. Kd
values for this variant are therefore approximate,
although it is nevertheless clear that S52L exhibited
the lowest affinity among the variants tested.
The effects of the substitutions on binding
affinities were assessed by calculating DDGbind
values, where DDGbindZDGwildtypeKDGvariant
where DGwildtype and DGvariant correspond to the
free energies for disassociation of ligand–receptor
complexes with wild-type and variant receptor,
respectively. These DDGbind values are presented
graphically in Figure 4. This shows that the
substitutions that led to the largest DDGbind values
are those that also led to disruption of complex
band formation on native gels (broken boxes). The
correlation in this regard is essentially perfect, as
the 12 variants (11 interfacial; one non-interfacial)
that exhibited disrupted binding by native gels all
have DDGbind values above thresholds of 1.2 and
1.4 kcal molK1 for TGFb1 and TGFb3, respectively,
while all other variants had DDGbind values below
these thresholds (Figure 4).
The 12 substitutions that have the largest
effects on affinity are in residues that assume
characteristic positions within the binding inter￾face. Five of these are hydrophobic residues,
which form a linear array, Ile50-Phe30-Thr51-
Ile53-Leu27, and which occupy a long but
shallow hydrophobic cleft between the connecting
loops at the tips of the TGFb fingers (Figure 1).
The unique position of these residues within the
interface, together with the fact that their
substitution to alanine would diminish their
hydrophobic contact area with TGFb, supports
the notion that these receptor residues contribute
to affinity through hydrophobic contact. This
notion is further supported by the results
obtained with Ser52. The substitution of this
residue with alanine had only minor effects on
affinity (0.2–0.4 kcal molK1
), whereas substitution
with leucine drastically diminished affinity, the
largest change of any variant characterized
(Figure 4). This is indicative of tight packing at
the interface as Ser52 is fully buried and lies at
the point of closest approach between the
backbones of TbRII and TGFb3 (5.5 A˚ between
the Ca carbon of TbRII Ser52 and the backbone
Ca carbon of TGFb3 V92 and 3.8 A˚ between the
Ca carbon of TbRII Ser52 and the carbonyl carbon
of TGFb3 Tyr91). The methyl group of the alanine
at this position is likely accommodated, whereas
the isopropyl group of the leucine, owing to its
larger volume, likely introduces steric overlap
that prevents the receptor and ligand from fully
engaging one another.
Differential Affinity of TbRII for TGFb Isoforms 51The remainder of the substitutions that effect
affinity are of charged residues, Asp32, Glu55,
Glu75, and Glu119. In the crystal structure of the
TbRII:TGFb3 complex, Asp32 and Glu119 lie on
opposite sides of the hydrophobic array and engage,
via hydrogen-bonded ion pairs, the guanidinium
groups of the positively charged arginine residues
located on the tips of the loops connecting the fingers
of the ligand (Arg94 and Arg25, respectively).
Conservative (Asp32 substituted with asparagine or
Glu119 substituted with glutamine) or non-conserva￾tive (Asp32 or Glu119 substituted with alanine)
substitutions of either lead to comparable
and significant disruption of binding affinity
(1.4–2.0 kcal molK1
) (Figure 4). This indicates that
Asp32:Arg94 and Glu119:Arg25 interact both
through electrostatic attraction and through hydro￾gen-bonding. This follows as substitution of the
carboxylate group of Asp32 or Glu119 with either
a methyl group (alanine) or an amide group
(asparagine or glutamine) would be expected to
fully disrupt the charge-charge interaction. The full or
partial disruption of the hydrogen-bonding interac￾tions is also anticipated as the two oxygen atoms of
the side-chain carboxylate of the parent residues are
each shown to function as hydrogen-bond acceptors
in the crystal structure of the TbRII:TGFb3 complex
(hydrogen-bond donors in each case are the H3 and
the Hz atoms of the side-chain guanidinium groups of
the two respective arginine residues). The substituted
methyl group of alanine cannot obviously function
in this capacity, although neither can the amide group
of asparagine or glutamine, as this functionality
has only one acceptor group, not two as in aspartate
or glutamate.
Two other charged residues that contribute to
affinity, but to a lesser extent, are Glu55 and
Glu75. Glu55, which affected the binding affinity

long-range (ca 7 A˚ ) electrostatic interaction with
Arg94 of TGFb1/b3. Glu75, which affected the
binding affinity by 1.0–1.1 kcal molK1 when sub￾stituted with alanine, appears to stabilize the
complex by interacting with Arg94 of TGFb1/b3,
although in this case indirectly via a water￾mediated hydrogen-bond.
Assessment of TbRII-ED substitutions
on antagonist activity in cultured cells
Previous results have shown that TbRII-ED can
function to antagonize the biological activity of
TGFbs 1 and 3.24,25 This antagonistic activity
presumably results from the ability of TbRII-ED to
bind and sequester the TGFb isoforms. Therefore,
antagonistic potency and binding affinity should
correlate. To test this, the antagonistic potency of the
wild-type receptor and variants were measured by
quantifying the level of Smad2 phosphorylation in
cultured MCF-10A cells as induced by 1 ng mlK1
TGFb3, either alone or in the presence of wild-type
or one of the 22 TbRII-ED-D14 variants. The
concentrations of TbRII-D14-EDs used in this
experiment, 50 mg mlK1
, are somewhat higher
than used in previous studies,26 but were necessary
because most of the variants, whether they carried a
substitution at an interfacial position or not,
exhibited only weak antagonism at the usual
concentration (5 mg mlK1
). This reduction in
potency is likely related to two factors: one is that
the N-terminal truncation causes a small increase
(ca factor of two) in the Kd values (Table 1); another
is that most of the substitutions, whether interfacial
or not, also cause at least a factor of two increase in
TGFb isoform Kd values (Table 1). The latter effect
most likely arises due to minor perturbations in
structure, which in turn, indirectly affect affinity.
The results of the Smad2 phosphorylation experi￾ment are shown in Figure 5. This shows that, except
for E75A, all of the non-interfacial variants
antagonize the induction of Smad2 phosphoryl￾ation (Figure 5, broken boxes). The fact that E75A
does not antagonize is consistent with the results of
the in vitro binding studies that showed that this
variant exhibited weak complexes with TGFbs 1
and 3 on native gels and a perturbation in its
binding free energy (DDGbind) above the threshold
values of 1.2 and 1.4 kcal molK1 with these
isoforms, respectively. The 11 interfacial variants

did antagonize. These results show that the
measurements of binding affinity made in vitro
correlate well with the potency of the TbRII-ED
variants as TGFb antagonists in cell-based
assays. This confirms that the mode of binding
defined in vitro using native gels and SPR
analysis corresponds with the ability of the
receptors to bind and sequester TGFb3 from the
cell surface TGFb receptors.
Assessment of the effects of the point
substitutions on stability
The differential effects of the interfacial and non￾interfacial substitutions on binding affinities
suggest that their effects are principally through
alterations in ligand contacts, not through effects on
protein stability. To examine this experimentally, the
equilibrium stability of all TbRII-ED variants were
measured using a GdmCl unfolding assay. This was
accomplished by preparing multiple samples con￾taining increasing concentrations of GdmCl and by
measuring the steady-state fluorescence emission

analyzed by Western blotting using either an anti-phospho-Smad2 (Ser465/Ser467) antibody (top panel) or an antibody
to assess equal loading (lower panel). The data shown were collected in two separate experiments; the first experiment
includes the controls and receptor variants included in lanes 1–20; the second includes the controls and receptor variants
included in lanes 21–28. The loading control antibody used for the first experiment was anti-GAPDH; the loading control
antibody used for the second experiment was MSH2. Continuous and broken boxes designate interfacial and non￾interfacial variants, respectively. Asterisks designate variants that did not form complexes in native gels with either

54 Differential Affinity of TbRII for TGFb Isoformsfrom the single tryptophan residue, Trp65. To
show that unfolding was reversible, samples were
prepared both by the addition of increasing
concentrations of denaturant to native protein or
by the addition of non-denaturing buffer to
denatured protein.
Typical data, obtained for the wild-type protein
and three variants, are shown in Figure 6. The
“unfolding” (open) and “refolding” (filled)
points superimpose, indicating that each undergo
reversible transitions. The fact that the curves are
S-shaped, even for highly destabilized variants such
as E75A, indicates that all of the variants are folded
and adopt stable tertiary structures in solution in
the absence of denaturant. The unfolding curves
were fitted to a two-state unfolding model to
quantify alterations in stability. The fitted para￾meters, along with error estimates, are listed in
Table 2.
The 22 TbRII-ED variants exhibit a wide range of
unfolding free energies (DGU). Roughly one quarter
of the variants, including F30A, D32N, S52A,
S52L, and E55A, are more stable than wild-type
(DDGU ! K0.3 kcal molK1
). Another quarter of the
variants, including L27A, D32A, I53A, V77A, E119A,
E119Q, and H79A, are not substantially altered
relative to wild type (K0.3 kcal molK1
!DDGU
!0.3 kcal molK1
). The last two quarters, including
N47A, S49A, I50A, T51A, D118A, N47A, V62A, E75A,
F110A, M112A, D118A, and I125A are less stable than
wild-type (DDGU O 0.3 kcal molK1
) (Table 2).
The simplest way by which changes in stability
might alter binding affinity is by increasing
the proportion of the denatured form of the protein
present in solution at equilibrium. Thus, if the
measured affinities were determined principally by
the effects of the substitutions on stability, one would
predict that the variants that led to an increase in
stability, or no change in stability, would largely be
unaffected in terms of their ligand binding affinities,
whereas those variants that led to the largest changes
in stability, would be most strongly affected. This
clearly is not the case for the set of variants presented
here as most of the variants that had the largest effects
on affinity, such as L27A, F30A, D32A, D32N, T51A,
S52L, E119A, and E119Q (Figure 4), were either of
comparable or greater stability than wild-type
(Table 2). Conversely, most of the variants that led to
only modest changes in affinity, such as S49A, N47A,
F110A, M112A, and I125A (Figure 4), were among
those that exhibited the largest decreases in stability
(Table 2). This shows that the lowered affinities are not
generally caused by lowered stability, although it
does not preclude the possibility that such indirect
effects diminish affinities for some of the variants,
especially those that are highly destabilized, such as
I50A and E75A.
The other aspect of the stability data worth noting is
that there appears to be no systematic pattern
between the location of residues in the three￾dimensional structure and their reduction in equili￾brium stability. Thus, among the residues that are
most stabilized, one, I50, is exposed and lies near the
center of the ligand binding site, two others, N47 and
S49, are surface-exposed and lie adjacent to the
ligand binding site, while three others, F110A,
M112A, and I125A, are buried and lie on the concave
surface of the protein opposite the ligand binding site.
The lack of any type of consistent pattern provides
further support for the notion that the effects of
the substitutions on binding affinity are by and large
direct and not the consequence of a systematic
alteration in structure.
TGFb2 K25R V92I K94R exhibits TGFb1/b3-like
affinity for TbRII
The crystal structure of the 2:1 TbRII-ED:TGFb3
complex revealed that the TGFb3 residues that
contact TbRII are identical to those in the high
affinity ligand TGFb1, but are conservatively
substituted at three positions (Arg25 to Lys, Val92
to Ile, and Arg94 to Lys) in the low affinity ligand
TGFb2.15 The results presented here have further
shown that substitution of the corresponding
contact residues in TbRII-ED, Glu119 which con￾tacts Arg25 of TGFb1/b3, Ile53 which contacts
Val92 of TGFb1/b3, and Asp32, Glu55, and Glu75
which contact Arg94 of TGFb1/b3, each lead to
perturbations in binding free energies (DDGbind) for
Figure 6. Stability measurement of wild-type TbRII-ED
and variants by guanidinium chloride unfolding. The
data are presented as plots of the normalized intrinsic
fluorescence emission intensity at 350 nm (ordinate)
versus the concentration of GdmCl (abscissa). Individual
samples, used to obtain the corresponding data points in
the Figure for TbRII-D14-ED (circles), F30A TbRII-D14-
ED, (triangles), V62A TbRII-D14-ED (squares), or E75A
TbRII-D14-ED (diamonds) were prepared by either
adding a stock solution of GdmCl to a sample of protein
in native buffer (open points, buffer comprised of 25 mM
sodium phosphate, 0.10 M NaCl, pH 7.0) or by adding
native buffer to denatured protein (filled points, protein
dissolved initially in 25 mM sodium phosphate, 0.10 M
NaCl, 4.0 M GdmCl, pH 7.0). The data were then fit to a
two-state unfolding model (continuous lines) using the
program ProFit (QuantumSoft, Zu¨rich, Switerzland). The
parameters for the fits, along with error estimates, are
listed in Table 2.
Differential Affinity of TbRII for TGFb Isoforms 55TGFb1 or TGFb3 of 1.0 kcal molK1
, or more
(Table 1). This suggests that these three conservative
substitutions in TGFb2 may indeed underlie the
4.1 kcal molK1 lower affinity with which TbRII
binds TGFb2.9–11 To evaluate this hypothesis,
a TGFb2 variant, TGFb2 K25R I92V K94R or
TGFb2-TM, was prepared and examined in vitro
using native gels and SPR.
The results of the native gel binding assay show
that when TbRII-ED and TGFb2-TM are mixed
together and electrophoresed, a well-defined TbRII￾ED:TGFb2-TM complex band is formed (Figure 7(a),
lane 7). The complex band is also observed with
TGFb3 (lane 5) as expected, but not with TGFb2 (lane
6), demonstrating that the three substitutions restore
high affinity binding to TGFb2. To quantify this
change, the affinity of TbRII-ED and TbRII-D14-ED
for TGFb2-TM was measured using SPR. This was
accomplished in the same overall manner as before
and yielded apparent Kd values of 0.48 and 1.3 mM for
binding of TGFb2-TM to TbRII-ED and TbRII-D14-
ED, respectively. These Kd values are higher than
those measured for TGFb1 by a factor of three to four
and are higher than those measured for TGFb3 by a
factor of approximately two (Table 1). These three
substitutions therefore confer TGFb2 with a binding
affinity for TbRII that is only slightly reduced relative
to that of TGFbs 1 and 3.
Receptor binding and biological activity of
TGFb2 K25R V92I K94R in cultured cells
There exist a number of cell lines that have been
shown to exhibit a diminished biological response
to TGFb2.9,12,27–29 This diminished response has
been correlated with the absence of betaglycan
expression and has been attributed to the dimin￾ished affinity of TbRII for this isoform.9,12 Therefore,
in such cell lines, TGFb2-TM should elicit its
response with a potency that more closely matches
that of TGFb3. To examine this experimentally, the
growth inhibitory activity of TGFb2-TM was
compared with that of TGFb2 and TGFb3 in
cultured fetal bovine heart endothelial (FBHE)
cells. This particular assay is one of the most widely
used to assess the biological activity of TGFb and is
especially appropriate for the present application as
these cells do not express betaglycan9 and have
been shown to respond to TGFb3 at concentrations
that are two to three orders of magnitude lower
than that of TGFb2.9,30
The growth inhibition experiments were carried
out by culturing FBHE cells to mid log phase and by
treating them with varying concentrations of
TGFb3, TGFb2-TM, or TGFb2 in the presence of
an added radiolabeled nucleotide precursor
(5-[125I]iodo-20
-deoxyuridine). The results, shown

TGFb2 and about tenfold less than TGFb3. The
twofold lower affinity that TbRII exhibits for
TGFb2-TM compared to TGFb3, may account for
part of the reduced growth inhibitory potency of
TGFb2-TM.
To further examine TGFb2-TM with regard to this
gain-of-function, affinity labeling experiments were
carried out with iodinated TGFb isoforms labeled to
the same specific activity and rat L6E9 myoblasts,
which lack betaglycan.12 Figure 7(c) shows, as

TbRII and TbRI (upper right), even at concen￾trations of 250 pM, which are sufficient to produce a
clear and distinct labeling with TGFb1 or TGFb3
(upper and lower left, respectively). Importantly,
the labeling of TbRI and TbRII by TGFb2-TM is
clearly detectable at a concentration of 25 pM
(lower left), comparable to that observed with
TGFbs 1 and 3 (upper left and lower right,

this assay, these results clearly affirm that the three
conservative substitutions in TGFb2-TM confer this

Discussion
The differential affinity of TbRII for the TGFb
isoforms has been well documented in the litera￾ture.9,31,32 The differences in affinity have recently
been quantified using mimicry of TbRII:TGFb cell
surface interactions, coupled with SPR biosensor
analysis.10,11 These studies have shown that the Kd
of TbRII for TGFb1 and TGFb3 (5–30 pM) is
approximately 1000-fold lower than that for
TGFb2 (5 nM). This corresponds to a reduction in
the binding free energy of the receptor for TGFb2 of
about 4.1 kcal molK1
.
The Kd values measured using these approaches,
in which the TbRII extracellular domain is dimer￾ized and immobilized on the biosensor surface,10,11
are in general much lower than those measured
when the TbRII extracellular domain is monomeric
and in solution,23,33 as in this study. This difference,
which is some four orders of magnitude for TGFb1
and TGFb3, and undetermined for TGFb2 due to
weak binding, is attributed to the fact that TGFb
isoforms have two equivalent non-interacting sites
for TbRII, and that avidity effects contribute
significantly to binding.10,11
The crystal structure of the 2:1 TbRII-ED:TGFb3
complex has shown that the ten TGFb3 residues
that contact TbRII are identical to those in TGFb1,
but are substituted at three positions in the low
affinity ligand, TGFb2.15 The three TGFb1/b3 to
TGFb2 substitutions are Arg25 to lysine, Val92 to
isoleucine, and Arg94 to lysine. Through studies of
TGFb isoform chimeras, it has been shown that
replacement of Val92-Gly93-Arg94-Lys95 in TGFb1
with Ile92-Gly93-Lys94-Thr95 from TGFb2 weakens
binding to the TbRII extracellular domain and
decreases potency in a LS513 colon cancer cell
growth inhibition assay.32 Taken together, these
findings suggest that the three substituted residues,
in spite of their similar nature, might underlie the
diminished affinity of TGFb2 for TbRII.15
To investigate this hypothesis, mutagenesis was
used to identify residues within the TbRII extra￾cellular domain that contribute significantly to
TGFb isoform binding. These studies were carried
out by generating single amino acid substitutions
within the TbRII extracellular domain, and by
assessing stabilities by denaturation with GdmCl
and affinities for binding the high affinity TGFb
isoforms, TGFbs 1 and 3, using native gel electro￾phoresis and SPR (such methods could not be used
to assess affinities for TGFb2 due to weak binding).
The affinities determined by the two techniques
were fully consistent with one another and with
relative potencies determined in a cell-based Smad
phosphorylation assay. The substitutions did lower
the stability of several of the receptor variants, but
for the most part, these effects had only negligible
effects on the measured affinities.
The receptor residues that contact the three
variable residues of the ligand were found to be
among those that contributed greatest to TGFb
isoform binding. Thus, Ile53 of TbRII, which is the
primary contact with Val92 of TGFb1/b3, led to a
decrease in affinity of 1.2–1.4 kcal molK1 when
substituted with alanine; Glu119 of TbRII, which
is the primary contact with Arg25 of TGFb1/b3, led
to a decrease in affinity of 1.4–1.7 kcal molK1 when
substituted with alanine or glutamine; Asp32,
which is in primary contact with Arg94 of TGFb1/
b3, led to a decrease in affinity of 1.4–2.0 kcal molK1
when substituted with alanine or asparagine; Glu55
and Glu75 of TbRII, which are the secondary contacts
with Arg94 of TGFb1/b3, each led to a decrease in
affinity of 1.0–1.3 kcal molK1 when substituted with
alanine (Table 1). These findings are important,
because through additive effects, they provide a
plausible mechanism to account for the estimated
4.1 kcal molK1 lower affinity with which TbRII binds
TGFb2.
The studies of the receptor variants also provided
information regarding the specificity of the inter￾actions. Thus, comparable and significant effects on
affinity were observed when Asp32 and Glu119 of
the Asp32 TbRII-Arg94 TGFb1/b3 and Glu119
TbRII-Arg25 TGFb1/b3 hydrogen-bonded ion
pairs, respectively, were conservatively (Asp32
substituted to asparagine and Glu119 substituted
to glutamine) or non-conservatively (Asp32 and
Glu119 both substituted with alanine) substituted.
Thus, substitution of Asp32 with either alanine or
asparagine led to a decrease in binding affinity of
1.4–1.7 kcal molK1 and 1.5–2.0 kcal molK1 for
TGFb1 and TGFb3, respectively (Table 1). The
substitution of Glu119 with either alanine or
glutamine led to a decrease in binding affinity of
1.4–1.7 kcal molK1 and 1.5–1.6 kcal molK1 for
TGFb1 and TGFb3, respectively (Table 1). This, as
articulated in Results, is likely a consequence of the
fact that both the electrostatic and hydrogen￾bonding components contribute to the interaction.
This conclusion is important because it provides a
plausible explanation as to why the conservative
substitution of arginine residues (Arg25, Arg94)
with lysine on the ligand side also leads to a
significant disruption of binding affinity, as
suggested by the results reported by Burmester
and co-workers.32
To further evaluate the overall hypothesis, the
three variable receptor contact residues in TGFb2
were changed to match those in TGFbs 1 and 3. This
TGFb2 variant, designated TGFb2-TM, was shown
through native gel electrophoresis and SPR to bind
TbRII-ED with an affinity just twofold lower than
that of TGFb3 and three to fourfold lower than
TGFb1. This shows unequivocally that the three
substitutions underlie the diminished affinity of
TGFb2 for TbRII. The underlying source of the
remaining two to fourfold lower affinity is not
known at present, although possible sources
include slight differences in the structural frame￾work of TGFb2 relative to TGFbs 1 and 3,34,35
58 Differential Affinity of TbRII for TGFb Isoformsand/or the possible influence of non-interfacial
residues that differ between TGFb2 and the other
isoforms. To examine whether the enhanced affinity
between TGFb2-TM and TbRII-ED translated into
enhanced biological activity, the potency of this
variant was compared to that of TGFb2 and TGFb3
in a fetal bovine heart endothelial (FBHE) cell
growth inhibition assay. This experiment showed
that TGFb2-TM exhibited a growth inhibitory
potency intermediate between that of TGFb2 and
TGFb3. This increase in potency, which was highly
reproducible and well beyond experimental
error of that measured for TGFb2, is consistent
with the binding data with TbRII-ED as well as the
efficient crosslinking observed between TGFb2-TM
and cell-surface TbRII. The fact that the growth
inhibitory potency of TGFb2-TM was below that
measured for TGFb3 is attributed in part to the
twofold lower affinity with which TGFb2-TM binds
TbRII-ED.
The results presented here extend the previous
information available concerning the structural
basis of TGFb receptor assembly10,11,15,32,36 by
identifying critical contacts used by TbRII to
contact the ligand and by demonstrating that the
three conservatively substituted residues in
TGFb2 indeed underlie its lowered affinity for
TbRII. These findings, together with previous
findings reported by others,10,11,15,32,36 suggest
that TGFb2 is no different from TGFb1 or
TGFb3 in either its overall structure or its mode
of interaction with the TGFb signaling receptors.
TGFb2 has however apparently co-evolved with
TbRII in such a way that its affinity for the type
II receptor has dropped by about 4.1 kcal molK1
so that it no longer binds with sufficient affinity
to enable responses at biologically relevant
concentrations (picomolar to subpicomolar). The
affinity, however, has evidently not dropped so
much that it cannot be compensated in a yet-to￾be-defined manner by the co-receptor betaglycan.
These differences in receptor binding properties
are likely significant, as this has presumably
enabled further diversification of function
amongst the TGFb isoforms through cell-specific
expression of the co-receptor betaglycan.
Materials and Methods
Expression and purification of TbRII-ED and variants
Two different wild-type TbRII extracellular domain
constructs, designated TbRII-ED and TbRII-D14-ED,
were prepared for the current study. These correspond
to either the entire extracellular domain of the human
receptor or a truncated variant lacking 14 residues on
the N terminus.37 The former is 136 residues in length,
with the first residue designated as 1, while the latter
is 122 residues in length, with the first residue
designated as 15. All variants were constructed in the
TbRII-D14-ED background by PCR mutagenesis and
were expressed and purified in the manner described,38
except 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF,
1 mM benzamidine, and 0.5 mM N-a-tosyl-L-lysyl￾chloromethyl ketone were included in the final
purification step. The identity of wild-type TbRII-ED
and variants were verified by dialyzing small aliquots
into distilled water and by determining the mass using
an electrospray mass spectrometer (LCQ, Thermo
Finnigan, San Jose, CA).
Native gel binding assay
Two equivalents of TbRII-ED in 25 mM Mes (pH 6.0)
was mixed with one equivalent of human TGFb1, TGFb2,
or TGFb3 in 40 mM acetic acid. TGFb1 was produced by
CHO cell expression and was purchased from R&D
Systems (Minneapolis, MN). TGFb2, TGFb2 K25R I92V
K94R, and TGFb3 were produced by Escherichia coli
expression, oxidatively folded to the disulfide-linked
homodimer, and HPLC purified as described.39 Protein
concentrations were determined using the corresponding
calculated extinction coefficients40 and the measured UV
absorbance at 280 nm. Receptor-ligand mixtures, along
with receptor and ligand alone controls, were analyzed by
addition of an equal volume of 2x native gel sample buffer
(50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.45), 20% (v/v) glycerol) and by
electrophoresing at 22 8C for approximately 1 h through
12% (w/v) native polyacrylamide gels containing a short
(1 cm) stacking gel buffered with 0.13 M Tris–HCl at
pH 6.8 and a longer (6 cm) running gel buffered with
0.38 M Tris–HCl at pH 8.8.
Surface plasmon resonance measurements
CM5 sensor chips, N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS), N-ethyl-N0
-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC), and 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.5)
were purchased from Biacore Incorporated (Piscataway,
NJ). Recombinant human TGFb1 and human TGFb3
expressed in CHO and Sf21 cells, respectively, were
purchased from R&D Systems (Minnepolis, MN).
Recombinant human TGFb2 K25R I92V K94R was
expressed in E. coli, refolded, and purified as described
above.
TGFb isoforms were coupled to CM-5 sensor chip
surfaces through the standard amine coupling pro￾cedure at a flow rate of 5 ml minK1
. Sequential
injections consisted of a 0.05 M NHS and 0.2 M-EDC
mixture (30 ml) followed by solutions of TGFb isoforms
(0.8–1.6 mg/ml) in 10 mM formic acid (pH 4.0) until
the amount of coupled TGFb yielded between 2.5!103
to 5.0!103 resonance units (RUs). A solution of 0.1 M
ethanolamine was then used to block the remaining
activated sites. Control dextran surfaces were generated
by replacing the TGFb solutions with formic acid
alone.
All SPR measurements were made at 25 8C at a flow
rate of 5 ml minK1
. Running buffer (20 mM Hepes
(pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% Tween￾20; HBS), was used to dilute all TbRII-ED variants
injected on the TGFb isoform surfaces. Binding proper￾ties were determined by injecting buffer solutions,
together with five different concentrations of the TbRII￾ED variants, over the TGFb isoform surfaces as well as
over the control surfaces for 300 s, after which time the
TbRII-ED solutions were replaced by HBS buffer for 50 s.
The concentrations of the TbRII-ED variants ranged from
0.6 mM to 6 mM for N47A, S49A, S52A, I53A, T51A,
V77A, and M112A, from 1 mM to 12 mM for D32A, I50A,
E55A, V62A, E75A, F110A, and I125A, from 0.9 mM to
Differential Affinity of TbRII for TGFb Isoforms 599 mM for E119A, from 3 mM to 30 mM for TbRII-D14, from
2 mM to 20 mM for L27A and E119Q, from 4 mM to 25 mM
for D32N, from 5 mM to 40 mM for S52L, from 6 mM to
60 mM for F30A and H79A, and from 0.065 mM to 0.5 mM
for full-length wild-type TbRII-ED. The TGFb isoform
surfaces were regenerated between each series of
injections using two 50 ml pulses of 20 mM HCl at a
flow rate of 100 ml minK1
, followed by an EXTRACLEAN
and a RINSE procedure carried out according to the
BIACORE manual.
Resonance unit values at steady-state, Req, for each
TbRII-ED variant were determined by subtracting the
value obtained using the TGFb isoform surface from the
corresponding value obtained using the control surface.
The apparent dissociation constants, Kd, were then
determined by Scatchard analyses. The final set of Kd
values and errors were determined through analyses of
all variants in triplicate. The one exception was the S52L
variant, whose Kd value was determined through analysis
of a single Scatchard plot. This was necessary as this
variant bound weakly and as a consequence significantly
greater quantities of receptor were required to complete
the measurements.
Stability measurements
TbRII-ED stabilities were measured by monitoring the
intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as a function of the
guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) concentration. This was
accomplished by preparing a total of 20–30 3.00 ml
samples, each consisting of a fixed amount of protein
(60 mg) mixed with a known concentration of GdmCl in
25 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl. The reversi￾bility of the folding-unfolding transition was investigated
by adding protein in non-denaturing buffer to solutions
containing increasing concentrations of GdmCl, or by
adding protein in 4.0 M GdmCl to solutions of non￾denaturing buffer with decreasing concentrations of
GdmCl. The fluorescence intensities were then measured
at 21 8C with an SLM 500C fluorimeter equipped with a
thermostated cell holder. Excitation was by means of a
tungsten lamp with a 2 nm bandwidth at 285 nm. The
emission wavelength was 350 nm with a 5 nm band￾width. The raw fluorescence intensities were fitted in a
non-linear fashion to a two-state unfolding model with
linear baselines to yield DGU, the free energy of unfolding
in the absence of denaturant, and the m-value, defined as
dðDGUÞ=dð Þ ½GdmCl .
41 The concentration of the GdmCl at
the midpoint of the unfolding transition, Cm, was
calculated from the ratio of DGU to the m-value.41
Smad phosphorylation assays
Smad2 phosphorylation assays26 were performed by
treating exponentially growing human mammary
epithelial MCF-10A cells with 1 ng mlK1 TGFb3 and
50 mg mlK1 wild-type TbRII-D14-ED or variant for
30 min. The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS
and lysed in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl,
1% Nonidet P-40 containing protease (Roche) and
phosphatase (1 mM NaVO3 and 1 mM NaF) inhibitors.
Twenty micrograms of total protein were then separa￾ted with SDS-PAGE and transferred to a HyBond-ECL
nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ). The membrane was blocked with
TBST (100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl,
0.05% Tween-20) containing 5% (w/v) non-fat dried
milk and then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti￾phospho-Smad2 (Ser-465/467) antibody (Upstate Bio￾technology) overnight or an anti-GAPDH antibody
(Ambion) for 1 h. After three washes with TBST, the
membrane was incubated with HRP-linked anti-rabbit
or anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz) for 1 h and
washed again. Bound complexes were visualized
using chemiluminescence procedures (NEN Life
Science Products, Boston, MA).
Growth inhibition assays
The effect of TGFb isoforms on the proliferation of
cultured fetal bovine heart endothelial (FBHE) cells was
tested as described by Cheifetz et al.
9 Briefly, FBHE cells
were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured with
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supple￾mented with 10% (v/v) Fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco-BRL,
Carlsbad, CA) and 100 mg mlK1 endothelial cell mitogen
(Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA). Once FBHE
cells reached a density of 50,000 cells per well, TGFb
isoforms were added at the indicated concentrations in
fresh media without endothelial mitogen, and the cells
were then incubated for another 48 h. DNA synthesis was
measured during the last 8 h of the TGFb isoform
treatment by pulsing the cells with 5-[125I]iodo-20
-
deoxyuridine (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) at 1 mCi mlK1
.
Affinity labeling
TGFb1, TGFb2, TGFb2 K25R I92V K94R, and TGFb3
were labeled with 125I as described.9 Iodinated TGFbs,
added with sufficient unlabeled ligand to have them at
the same specific radioactivity (5.53!106 cpm/pmol),
were used to affinity label L6E9 rat skeletal myoblasts as
described.42 Briefly, confluent monolayers of L6E9 cells
were incubated with the radiolabeled TGFb isoforms at
concentrations of 5, 25, 50, or 250 pM for 3 h at 4 8C. After
extensive washing of the unbound ligand, disuccinimidyl
suberate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added to cross-link
the receptor-bound ligand complexes, which were
solubilized in the presence of Triton X-100. These
complexes were displayed by subjecting the Triton
X-100 cell extracts to SDS-PAGE followed by phosphor￾imager autoradiography.
