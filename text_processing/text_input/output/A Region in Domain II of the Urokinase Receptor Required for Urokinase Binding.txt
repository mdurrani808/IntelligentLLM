The urokinase receptor is composed of three homolo￾gous domains based on disulfide spacing. The contribu￾tion of each domain to the binding and activation of
single chain urokinase (scuPA) remains poorly under￾stood. In the present paper we examined the role of
domain II (DII) in these processes. Repositioning DII to
the amino or carboxyl terminus of the molecule abol￾ished binding of scuPA as did deleting the domain en￾tirely. By using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we iden￾tified a 9-amino acid continuous sequence in DII
(Arg137–Arg145) required for both activities. Competi￾tion-inhibition and surface plasmon resonance studies
demonstrated that mutation of Lys139 and His143 to ala￾nine in soluble receptor (suPAR) reduced the affinity for
scuPA ;5-fold due to an increase in the “off rate.” Mu￾tation of Arg137, Arg142, and Arg145, each to alanine, leads
to an ;100-fold decrease in affinity attributable to a
10-fold decrease in the apparent “on rate” and a 6-fold
increase in off rate. These differences were confirmed
on cells expressing variant urokinase receptor. suPAR￾K139A/H143A displayed a 50% reduction in scuPA-medi￾ated plasminogen activation activity, whereas the 3-ar￾ginine variant was unable to stimulate scuPA activity at
all. Mutation of the three arginines did not affect bind￾ing of a decamer peptide antagonist of scuPA known to
interact with DI and DIII. However, this mutation abol￾ished both the binding of soluble DI to DII–III in the
presence of scuPA and the synergistic activation of
scuPA mediated by DI and wild type DII–DIII. These
data show that DII is required for high affinity binding
of scuPA and its activation. DII does not serve merely as
a spacer function but appears to be required for inter￾domain cooperativity.
Urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA)1 has been im￾plicated in angiogenesis, wound healing, fibrinolysis, and for￾mation of tumor metastases. The capacity of uPA to promote
remodeling of clots and basement membrane through its enzy￾matic activity and to promote cell adhesion through non-enzy￾matic processes is modulated by its interaction with its cellular
receptor, uPAR (1). The interaction between the uPAzuPAR
complex and b integrins has been implicated in cell adhesion
and migration (2, 3). uPAR2/2 mice exhibit defective leukocyte
recruitment to inflamed peritoneum due to impaired cell adhe￾sion (4). uPAR-dependent signaling has also been implicated in
various signal transduction events, cell differentiation, and
tumor dormancy (5–11).
uPAR can be expressed on the surface of many but not all cell
types as a 281-amino acid, three-domain glycosylphosphatidyl￾inositol (GPI)-linked protein (12). Each domain consists of
81–87 amino acids that are characterized by a generally con￾served pattern of cysteine residues, which are separated from
each other by ;11-amino acid linker sequences. There is ;20%
amino acid sequence similarity among the domains at the
amino acid level (13). However, the mechanism by which the
three domains interact to generate a high affinity binding site
for uPAR and to participate in cell adhesion and scuPA activa￾tion remains largely unresolved.
We (14) and others (15, 16) have reported that scuPA binds
to soluble domain I of uPAR (sDI), albeit with ;50-fold lower
affinity than full-length suPAR or GPI-linked uPAR and with
even lower affinity to a soluble fragment composed of domains
II and III (sDII/DIII) (14). In addition, each fragment of suPAR
displays less capacity to activate scuPA than the intact recep￾tor (14). Proteolytic cleavage of uPAR between the DII and DIII
generates a soluble fragment composed of DI and DII that
binds uPA with an affinity similar to that of isolated sDI (16).
Thus, the connection between the domains of suPAR is essen￾tial to generate a high affinity site. The fragment containing
DII and DIII may come into close proximity to DI to form an
extended binding site for uPA (17). Alternatively, DII and DIII
may contain auxiliary binding sites that are independent of the
site within DI.
Potential contact sites for uPA on the surface of sDI and
sDIII have been probed using mutagenesis, chemical protec￾tion, and cross-linking approaches (17–20), but direct contact
between these portions of uPAR and uPA itself has not been
proven. Furthermore, the contribution of domain II within the
intact receptor to uPA binding has received little attention (21).
The studies reported here identify a region in domain II com￾posed of 9 amino acids that is required for scuPA to bind

28532 This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org
 at BRUNEL UNIV on March 25, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from full-length uPAR with high affinity. Mutation of three arginine
residues within this region of uPAR reduces the affinity of
scuPA binding to a level comparable to that of domain I alone
and abolished the capacity of suPAR to activate scuPA in the
absence of amino acid substitutions in domain I or domain III.
These results demonstrate that domain II is required for high
affinity binding of scuPA to uPAR.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Chemicals and Reagents—scuPA, two chain uPA, and polyclonal
anti-uPAR antibody were the kind gifts of Dr. J. Henkin (Abbott).
Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were purchased from American
Tissue Type Culture Collection, (Manassas, VA). Tissue culture me￾dium, bovine serum, and Lipofectin were from Life Technologies, Inc.
Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) was from Ox￾ford Glycosystems (Wakefield, MA). Chymotrypsin and pepsin were
from Sigma, Na125I from (NEN Life Science Products), and IODO￾BEADS from Pierce. Plasminogen and Spectrozyme PL were gifts of
American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT).
Construction of Domain Swap uPAR Variants—cDNA encoding do￾mains I and III (DI–DIII; amino acids 1–92 and 192–281) was con￾structed using two-step polymerase chain reaction by looping out DII
(amino acids 93–191) using full-length uPAR/pGEM as a template.
Each PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA at the HindIII and EcoRI
sites. cDNA encoding DII was constructed from two-step PCR with a
mutation at position 191 of glycine to arginine to permit carboxyl￾terminal processing and GPI linkage (22). To add DII (final amino acid
sequences 1–92, 192–281, and 93–191) to the carboxyl terminus of
DI-DIII, DI-DIII/pcDNA and DII/pcDNA were used as templates in the
second step of the PCR. To add DII to the amino terminus of DI-DIII
(final amino acid sequences 93–191, 1–92, 192–281), the wild type
sequence at position 191 was restored. DII/pcDNA and DI-DIII/pcDNA
were then used as templates in the second step of the PCR. After the
nucleotide sequence of each final construct was confirmed, COS cells
were transfected using Lipofectin. Expression levels of uPAR were
measured by ELISA using polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody. Binding of
anti-uPAR and scuPA to cells expressing each variant were demon￾strated to be .90% PI-PLC-sensitive. Specific binding of 125I-scuPA to
these transiently transfected cells was measured as described below.
Mutagenesis of uPAR Domain II—Alanine-scanning mutagenesis
within the second domain of uPAR, residues 137–145, was performed
both in clusters and as individual mutations. cDNA encoding the full￾length uPAR, generously provided by F. Blasi (Milan, Italy), was sub￾cloned into pBluSK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate pBluSK/
uPAR(EcoRI-HinIII). The five residues, Arg137, Lys139, Arg142, His143,
and Arg145, were all mutated to alanine (Arg137 3 Ala, Lys139 3 Ala,
Arg142 3 Ala, His143 3 Ala, and Arg145 3 Ala), designated m5A) using
the ExSite PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).
pBluSK- uPAR (EcoRI-HinIII) was amplified using the sense oligonu￾cleotide 59 GCCGCCCTCGCTGGCTGTGGCTACCTTCCCGGC 39 and
the antisense oligonucleotide 59 GTCATCCTCTTGTATCCCCTTCAC￾CTTCCTGGAT 39. The recombinant clone, designated pBluSK-m5A￾uPAR, was subcloned into pTracer-SV40 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at
the KpnI site to yield pTracer-m5A-uPAR. pTracer-m5A-uPAR was
then used as template to generate pTracer-m2A-uPAR (Lys139 3 Ala
and His143 3 Ala, designated m2A) or pTracer-m3A-uPAR (Arg137 3
Ala, Arg142 3 Ala, and Arg145 3 Ala, designated m3A) using the
QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Mutation of
individual residues was performed using a two-step PCR (23) with
pTracer-SV40/uPAR (KpnI) as the template. Plasmid DNA was trans￾fected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells using Lipofectin, and the
cells were grown in 10% Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium, 10%
fetal bovine serum and selected for Zeocin resistance. Clones expressing
high, intermediate, and low levels of uPAR were chosen based on the
ELISA and/or flow cytometry with rabbit polyclonal anti-uPAR anti￾body (24) in the presence and absence of PI-PLC.
Radiolabeling of Proteins—scuPA, suPAR, and soluble domain I of
suPAR (sDI) were radiolabeled with Na125I (NEN Life Science Prod￾ucts) using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s in￾structions. Free 125I was removed by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25
(PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Binding of scuPA to 293 Cells—Stable 293 cells lines expressing
either wild type uPAR or variant uPAR were subcultured onto poly-D￾lysine 96-well Biocoat Multiwell tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson
Labware, Bedford, MA) at an initial cell density of 1 3 105 and grown
for 1–2 days by which time they reached confluence. To measure the
binding of 125I-scuPA, the cells were pre-chilled for 30 min at 4 °C and
washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer composed of phosphate-buff￾ered saline (PBS) and 1% BSA. The cells were then incubated with
0.15–20 nM 125I-scuPA in the presence or absence of 100-fold molar
excess unlabeled ligand for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer, washed 4 times
with the same buffer, and the cell-bound ligand was eluted with glycine
buffer, pH 2.8. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspe￾cific binding from total binding. In some experiments cells were treated
with PI-PLC (1 unit/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h before binding was measured.
Production of Wild Type and Variant-soluble Urokinase Receptor
(suPAR)—cDNAs encoding soluble wild type uPAR (amino acids
1–277), soluble domain II 1 III (amino acids, 88–277), and variant
full-length uPA receptor sequences (designated m2A, m3A, and m5A,
see below) were generated by polymerase chain reaction using pTracer￾uPAR, pTracer-m2uPAR, pTracer-m3uPAR, or pTracer-m5uPAR as
templates. The fragments were digested with BglII and Xho and sub￾cloned into the expression vector (pMT/BiP/V5, Invitrogen). Wild type
and variant suPARs or soluble domains were expressed in Drosophila
Schneider S2 cells (DES system, Invitrogen) as described by the
manufacturer.
Purification of suPAR Expressed in S2 Cells—Small scale prepara￾tions of suPAR and variants were purified from the media using a
polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody affinity column. For large scale prepa￾ration, S2 cell culture supernatants were filtered and the media loaded
onto a 40 GM hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with 10 mM K2HPO4,
pH 7.0. The column was then eluted with a gradient of 10–200 mM
K2HPO4, pH 7.0, and the suPAR-containing fractions were identified by
Western blotting. Fractions containing monomeric suPAR eluted be￾tween 50 and 120 mM K2HPO4. Fractions containing monomeric suPAR
were pooled, concentrated, and further purified using C8 RP-HPLC.
Crude suPAR (20 mg of total protein) was loaded in a volume of 2 ml
onto a semi-preparative (10 3 25 cm) C8 column and eluted at a flow
rate of 4 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–70% solvent B where
solvent A was 100% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B was
100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. suPAR eluted as a single
broad peak under these conditions with a retention time of approxi￾mately 27 min. SDS-PAGE analysis of suPAR purified in this manner
demonstrated a single major peak at 35 kDa under non-reducing con￾ditions. Also observed was a slight laddering effect with 3–4 minor
higher molecular weight species. These were determined to be SDS
stable aggregates of suPAR, which disappeared when SDS-PAGE was
performed under reducing conditions. Matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry revealed a single broad peak
with an average mass of 34,797. The predicted mass based on the amino
acid sequence is 30,672 indicating the presence of about 4 kDa of
glycosylation. Expression levels of suPAR were typically 30 mg/liter
determined by ELISA. Purification yielded about 10–12 mg of pure
suPAR protein per liter of culture supernatant.
Generation of suPAR Fragments—suPAR was digested with chymo￾trypsin to generate sDI and sDII-DIII. Chymotrypsin was added to
suPAR (1 mg/ml in PBS) at a final molar ratio of suPAR:chymotrypsin
of 1000:1, and the digest was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room
temperature. The digest was quenched by addition of Pefablock (100 mM
final concentration). sDI and sDII-DIII were separated using C8 RP￾HPLC. sDI and sDII-DIII eluted with retention times of approximately
27 and 25 min, respectively. Purified sD1 was sequenced and a single
amino terminus was observed beginning with RS (representing the two
extra amino acids present in this construct) followed by KR, amino acids
1 and 2 in the mature suPAR sequence. Sequencing of sDII-DIII re￾vealed a single amino terminus as well, beginning with amino acids
SRS corresponding to amino acids 88–90 in the mature suPAR se￾quence. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass
spectral analysis revealed a single peak for sD1 (mass 5 11,041 Da) and
several peaks for sDII-DIII (mass 5 23,846, 23,691, 22,936, and
22,800). These were presumed to be glycosylation isoforms, although
additional digestion of sDII-DIII from the carboxyl terminus could not
be excluded. However, no consensus chymotryptic cleavage site that
could result in the observed mass differences is present at the carboxyl
terminus of sDII-DIII.
suPAR Binding to CHO-scuPA Cells—The capacity of wild type and
variant suPAR to compete with the binding of wt-suPAR to scuPA was
measured as described (24). Briefly, binding of 125I-wild type suPAR (10
nM) to a stably transfected CHO cell line expressing GPI-anchored
scuPA was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of un￾labeled wild type and variant full-length suPAR (24). In other experi￾ments, binding of 125I-sDI (50 nM) to scuPA-CHO cells was measured in
the presence of varying concentrations of wild type sDII-DIII (100–400
nM) for 1 h at 4 °C.
Binding of scuPA to Soluble uPAR (suPAR) Measured as Surface
Domain II of uPAR Is Required for Urokinase Binding 28533
 at BRUNEL UNIV on March 25, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Plasmon Resonance—Binding of scuPA to suPAR was measured using
a BIA 3000 optical Biosensor (Biacore, AB, Sweden) (25). This method
detects binding interactions in real time by measuring changes in the
refractive index at a biospecific surface, enabling the association and
dissociation rate constants to be calculated. For these studies, wild type
or variant suPAR was coupled to a CM5-research grade sensor chip flow
cell (Biacore, AB, Sweden) via standard amine coupling procedures (26)
using N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N9-[3-(dimethylamino) propyl-
]carbodiimine hydrochloride (Pierce) at a level of 500 response units.
The sensor surface was coated with suPAR (10 mg/ml) in 10 mM NaAc
buffer, pH 5.0. After immobilization, non-reactive groups were blocked
with 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.5. A second flow cell, similarly activated
and blocked without immobilization of protein, served as a control. All
binding reactions were performed in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.005%
Tween 20. Binding of scuPA was measured at 25 °C at a flow rate of 60
ml/min for 2 min, followed by 2 min of dissociation. The bulk shift due
to changes in refractive index measured using a blank surface was
subtracted from the binding signal at each condition to correct for
nonspecific signals. Surfaces were regenerated with 1 3 18-s pulse of 1
M NaCl/HCl, pH 3.5, followed by an injection of binding buffer for 1 min
to remove this high salt solution. All injections were performed using
the RANDOM command in the automated method. Binding of scuPA
was measured using 2-fold dilutions over a range of concentrations
(12.5 to 0.2 nM for WT-scuPA, 50 to 0.4 nM for m2A-suPAR, 200 to 12.5
nM for m3A-suPAR, and 400 to 25 nM for m5A-suPAR). Data, collected
at 2.5 Hz, were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir reaction mechanism using global
analysis in the BIA evaluation 3.0 software (Biacore, AB, Sweden).
Secondary plots of the data (ln(udR/dtu) versus t) were also performed to
unmask any contribution of mass transport to the kinetic data.
Activation of scuPA by suPAR Variants—The capacity of suPAR
variants to promote scuPA-mediated plasminogen activation was meas￾ured using a chromogenic assay, as described (27). Briefly, scuPA (5 nM)
was incubated with various concentrations of wild type suPAR, m2A￾suPAR, and m5A-suPAR in the presence of 10 nM plasminogen and 500
mM chromogenic substrate (Spectrozyme-PL) and the absorbance (405
nm) was measured over time in a Thermomax microplate reader (Mo￾lecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA).
Binding of Soluble uPAR Domain I to Cells Expressing uPAR Do￾mains II 1 III—cDNA encoding GPI-linked uPAR DII-III was gener￾ated by two-step PCR using pBluSK/uPAR as template and subcloned
into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at EcoRI and HindIII sites. Stable lines in
293 cells were developed under G418 selection as described above.
Expression of uPAR DII–DIII was confirmed by flow cytometry using
affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-uPAR IgG in the presence and
absence of PI-PLC. 293 cells expressing wild type or variant GPI￾anchored uPAR domains II–III or mock-transfected cells were incu￾bated with 125I-sDI (50 nM) in the absence or presence of scuPA (0–500
nM) for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS, 1% BSA. The cells were washed three times
with ice-cold binding buffer, and the cell-associated radioactivity was
measured as above.
Cross-linking Experiments—The method of Ploug (20) was followed
with minor modifications. Briefly, SLN-Bpa-SQYLWS (AE-81) and SL￾NFSQYL-Bpa-S (AE-83) were synthesized in a stepwise manner by the
Fmoc solid-phase method. Fmoc amino acids and Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-Wang
resin were obtained from AnaSpec (San Jose, CA), and other reagents
for peptide synthesis were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).
The synthesis was in a 0.1-mmol scale on a Applied Biosystems model
431A peptide synthesizer using 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetra￾methyluronium/1-hydroxybenzotriazole for activation. The peptides
were cleaved from the resin, and the side chains were deprotected with
trifluoroacetic acid containing 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol and 2.5% H2O.
The resin was removed from the reaction mixture by filtration, and the
peptides were precipitated with ether. The peptides were then purified
by preparative reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (10 mm,
300 Angstrom, 10 3 25 cm) using a linear gradient from buffer A (0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid in water) to buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in
acetonitrile). The electrospray ion traps mass spectrometer (LCQ, Fin￾ingan, CA) was used to check the integrity of the peptides. Each peptide
was iodinated using Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech), as described (20). To perform cross-linking, 5 mM WT- or
m5AsuPAR was incubated with a mixture containing labeled and un￾labeled peptide (100 mM final concentration) on ice for 90 min in the
dark. Wells containing each mixture were uniformly positioned 1–2 cm
from the light source (Philips TL/09 actinic lamp, 20-watt lmax 5 365
nm). The reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample
buffer. The receptor concentrations were equalized based on protein
staining on 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the extent
of cross-linking was assessed by autoradiography.
RESULTS
Binding of scuPA to uPAR Requires Interdomain Cooperat￾ivity—There is considerable indirect evidence to suggest that
each domain of uPAR contributes to the development of the
high affinity binding site for scuPA. The purpose of our studies
was to study the specific contribution of DII to this process. To
begin to address this question, we measured the specific bind￾ing of 125I-scuPA to COS cells expressing WT-uPAR and com￾parable levels of GPI-anchored uPAR variants in which the
position of domain II within the receptor was moved to the
amino terminus (DII-DI-DIII) or carboxyl terminus (DI-DIII￾DII) of the molecule. scuPA (10 nM and 100 nM) bound specifi￾cally to cells expressing WT-uPAR as expected, whereas no
specific binding to cells expressing comparable levels of either
variant was seen (Fig. 1), indicating that DII must be present
between DI and DIII for the receptor to function normally. In
accordance with this, deletion of DII from either entity or from
wild type uPAR, leaving DI-DIII, did not restore binding (Fig.
1). No specific, receptor-dependent binding was detected to
cells expressing GPI-linked uPAR-domain I at either ligand
concentration (data not shown). These experiments indicate
that DII must be present and must be present in its natural
location for scuPA to bind to cell surface uPAR.
Localization of a Potentially Important Continuous Amino
Acid Sequence in DII—Previous studies suggest that Arg53,
Leu55, Trp57, and Leu66 in DI and His251 in DIII interface with
scuPA. Computer-based analysis of the individual domains of
uPAR revealed a single region in DII that had the highest
likelihood of being expressed on the surface of the protein and
might thereby contribute to the binding of scuPA (Fig. 2). Of
interest, this region in DII (Arg137–Arg145) occupies a similar
position with respect to the cysteine residues to the regions in
domains I and III that also have a high probability of surface
expression and have previously been implicated in scuPA bind￾ing (13, 17, 19, 20). Therefore, we targeted this region to ex￾amine the role of DII in scuPA binding and interdomain
cooperativity.
Mutations in Domain II of suPAR (Arg137–Arg145) Regulate
the Binding of scuPA—To examine the role of this region in DII,
we generated wild type suPAR in S2 cells as well as a suPAR
variant, designated m5A, in which five charged amino acids
within this region (Arg137, Lys139, Arg142, His143, and Arg145)
were mutated collectively to alanine. To characterize the bind￾ing affinity of m5A-suPAR, we first examined the capacity of
the purified protein to inhibit the binding of 125I-wild type
FIG. 1. Binding of scuPA (10 and 100 nM) to cells expressing
wild type uPAR and uPAR variants. COS cells were transfected
with cDNA encoding the indicated GPI-anchored uPAR variants. Cells
were chilled to 4 °C and incubated with 10 or 100 nM 125I-scuPA for 1 h
at 4 °C, washed 4 times, and cell-bound ligand was eluted with glycine,
pH 2.8. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific bind￾ing in the presence of 100-fold molar excess unlabeled ligand from total
binding. The data shown represent the mean of triplicate determina￾tions from one experiment, representative of three that were performed.
28534 Domain II of uPAR Is Required for Urokinase Binding
 at BRUNEL UNIV on March 25, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from suPAR (10 nM) to a previously characterized CHO cell line that
expresses high levels of GPI-anchored scuPA (Fig. 3 and Table
I). m5A-suPAR inhibited the binding of 125I-WT suPAR to
CHO-scuPA with an IC50 ;16 mM, whereas unlabeled WT￾suPAR inhibited binding with an IC50 of ;10 nM.
Residues within Arg137–Arg145 Required for scuPA Binding
to uPAR—Mutation of the five residues in the sequence Arg137–
Arg145 thus leads to a greater than 1000-fold increase in the
IC50 of suPAR for scuPA. To identify the contribution of the
individual amino acids in this region in greater detail, we
posited that the three arginines might constitute a functional
group. Therefore, we restored either the three arginine resi￾dues (uPAR-K139A/H143A; designated m2A-uPAR) or the ly￾sine and histidine residues (uPAR-R137A/R142A/R145A; des￾ignated m3A-uPAR). The affinity of m2A-suPAR for scuPA was
moderately reduced (IC50 ;70 nM) compared with wild type
suPAR (Fig. 3 and Table I). In contrast, m3A-suPAR (IC50 ;2.6
mM) and m5A suPAR (IC50 ;16 mM) were comparatively much
weaker competitors.
To confirm these results and to obtain a more precise esti￾mate of their Kd values, we measured the binding of scuPA to
immobilized WT- and each variant suPAR in real time as
surface plasmon resonance (Table II). Binding of scuPA to
immobilized WT-suPAR from S2 cells was essentially identical
to the Kd value measured using suPAR expressed in mamma￾lian cells (not shown) and comparable to its affinity for GPI￾anchored uPAR. m2A-suPAR bound scuPA with a 4–5-fold
lower affinity, attributable primarily to an increase in “off
rate.” In contrast, the affinity of scuPA for m3A-suPAR was
;100-fold lower than was seen with WT-suPAR due to a ;10-
fold reduction in the apparent “on rate” and a 6-fold increase in
the off rate (Table II). The decrease in the affinity of m5A￾uPAR was even greater (;160-fold), suggesting a contribution
from all five charged residues. Interestingly, the apparent off
rate of scuPA from m5A-suPAR was similar to that of WT￾suPAR, whereas the apparent on rate was even slower than to
m3A-suPAR. These data suggest a complex interaction among
these 5 residues and/or with other regions of uPAR.
Binding of scuPA to GPI-linked suPAR Mutants—To re-eval￾uate these observations in a more physiologic setting, we ex￾amined the effect of these mutations in DII on the function of
cellular, GPI-anchored receptors. To do this, we generated sta￾ble cell lines expressing wild type receptor and each of the three
DII variants. As mentioned above, 125I-scuPA bound specifi￾cally to WT-uPAR with a Kd 5 0.91 6 0.51 nM (mean 6 S.D.,
n 5 4). scuPA bound to cells expressing m2A-uPAR with a
comparable affinity (Kd 5 1.96 6 0.97), whereas binding to
m3A-uPAR and m5A-uPAR were each greatly reduced (.40
nM) (Fig. 4 and Table III). The loss of uPAR-dependent binding
was not due to the absence of proper folding resulting in re￾duced surface expression of the variant receptors. Binding of a
polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody to 293 cells expressing WT￾uPAR and each variant uPAR was comparable in intensity as
assessed by ELISA and FACS and .90% of antibody binding to
each cell line was sensitive to PI-PLC (not shown).

Probability was calculated for each residue in uPAR domains I (Arg1

module of the Laser Gene analysis package (version 1.6). Each domain
was analyzed separately.
FIG. 3. Inhibition of WT-suPAR binding to scuPA by suPAR
variants. Binding of 125I-WT suPAR to a stable CHO cell line express￾ing GPI-anchored scuPA was measured in the absence and presence of
suPAR variants. CHO-scuPA cells were pre-chilled for 30 min and
washed twice with binding buffer (PBS, 1% BSA). Cells were then
incubated with 125I-WT suPAR (10 nM) in the presence of the indicated
concentrations of unlabeled WT-suPAR (f) and suPAR variants m2A￾suPAR (*), m3A-suPAR (M), m5A-suPAR (‚) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were
washed 4 times with binding buffer, and the cell bound ligand was
eluted with glycine buffer, pH 2.8, and counted. The data shown are
from a single experiment representative of three experiments that were
performed.

Domain II of uPAR Is Required for Urokinase Binding 28535
 at BRUNEL UNIV on March 25, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from To identify the sequence requirements further, binding of 125I-scuPA was measured to variants in which each of the five
amino acids was mutated individually to alanine. Restoration
of any four of these five charge residues to their wild type
counterparts fully restored binding of scuPA, with Kd values
statistically indistinguishable from native receptor (Table III).
Activity of suPAR Variants—Binding of scuPA to its receptor
promotes its enzymatic activity (27–29). We therefore exam￾ined the capacity of each suPAR variant to promote the plas￾minogen activator activity of scuPA. A fixed concentration of
scuPA (5 nM) was incubated with each variant over a wide
range of receptor concentrations, including concentrations well
in excess of their respective Kd values as determined by surface
plasmon resonance. Plasminogen activation was determined 60
min after the incubation was started. WT-suPAR generated in
S2 cells stimulated scuPA activity in a dose-dependent and
saturable manner, consistent with our findings using mamma￾lian suPAR (24). m2A-suPAR stimulated scuPA enzymatic ac￾tivity less effectively than did WT-suPAR (EC50 ;100 nM ver￾sus 20 nM for WT-suPAR). The decrease in m2A-suPAR
activation was proportional to the reduction in its affinity for
scuPA (Fig. 5). In contrast, neither m5A- nor m3A-suPAR pro￾moted significant scuPA-mediated plasminogen activation
even when the receptor was present at 500 nM final concentra￾tion, i.e. ;10 times greater than its Kd measured by surface
plasmon resonance (Fig. 5).
Effect of Mutations in Domain II on Inter-domain Cooperat￾ivity—The observation that m5A-suPAR binds scuPA with a Kd
of 55 nM, a value comparable to the affinity of isolated sDI (14),
may indicate that these mutations interrupt a binding epitope
in DII-DIII and/or disrupt the ability of the three domains to
interact in a productive conformation. To begin to examine the
mechanism by which these mutations in DII disrupt binding,
we studied the interaction of m5A-suPAR with a decamer pep￾tide antagonist of uPA (AE-68) tagged by specific-site photoaf￾finity activable groups on Phe4 (AE-81) or Trp9 (AE-83) (20).
Upon photoactivation, these groups cross-link to domain I or to
domain III, respectively. AE-68 tagged on either end of the
peptide showed comparable incorporation into WT-suPAR and
m5A-suPAR, excluding a direct effect of the mutations on
scuPA-binding sites in DI and indicating that the proximity of
these regions in DI and DIII to each other was retained in the
mutant.
sDI can interact with sDII-DIII, and this interaction en￾hances the affinity of scuPA binding (14, 30). Therefore, we
next asked whether the mutations introduced into the second
domain of uPAR affects its interaction with domain I. To do so,
we first generated stable cell lines expressing WT- and m5A￾DII-DIII as GPI-anchored proteins. Again, clones were chosen
for comparable levels of cell surface receptor expression by
FACS and ELISA. sDI increased the binding of 125I-scuPA to
cell-associated wild type DII-DIII in a dose-dependent, satura￾ble, and PI-PLC-sensitive manner but had no effect on binding
to m5A-DII-DIII even at concentrations as high as 400 nM (Fig.
6A). Similarly, scuPA (10 and 50 nM) increased the binding of 125I-sDI to cell-associated wild type-DII-DIII, but did not in￾crease binding of sDI to m5A-DII-DIII (Fig. 6B). The same
results were obtained when DI and DII-DIII were co-incubated
in solution. 125I-sDI was also added to CHO cells expressing
GPI-linked scuPA alone or in the presence of various concen￾trations of a soluble suPAR fragment containing the wild type
sequence of domains II and III (sDII-DIII; amino acids 88–281)
or m5A-sDII-DIII. 125I-sDI (50 nM) binds minimally, if at all, to
cell-associated scuPA at concentrations as high as 400 nM.
Binding of 125I-sD1 to scuPA was increased in a dose-depend￾ent and saturable manner by WT-sDII-DIII, consistent with
our previously published data (14), but not by addition of m5A￾sDII-DIII (data not shown).

 at BRUNEL UNIV on March 25, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from The same outcome was observed when plasminogen activa￾tion by sDII-DIII was examined in the presence of sDI. sDI (50
nM) stimulated scuPA activity to a limited extent, as expected
(14). Wild type sDII-DIII (100 nM) promoted the enzymatic
activity of scuPA directly (Fig. 7A, line e versus a), as described
previously (14). This activity increased markedly in the pres￾ence of sDI (50 nM) (Fig. 7A, line f). In contrast, m5A-sDII-DIII
induced significantly less activity than wild type DII-DIII (Fig.
7A, line d). Further addition of sDI had no stimulatory effect
(Fig. 7A, line b), consistent with the apparent absence of inter￾domain cooperativity indicated by the results shown in Fig. 6.
The data from the 120-min point for each combination of frag￾ments is shown in Fig. 7B (mean 6 S.D., n 5 3).
DISCUSSION
It is generally accepted that all three domains of uPAR are
required for scuPA to bind with high affinity. This conclusion is
based on the finding that deleting any domain from uPAR
reduces its affinity for scuPA. For example, scuPA binds with
low affinity to either isolated soluble domain I, to soluble do￾main III, or fragments composed of domains I and II or II and
III (14–16). Co-incubation of scuPA with the receptor frag￾ments only partially restores its affinity when compared with
full-length receptor.
The solution structure of the scuPAzuPAR complex has not
been reported, and the contribution of domain II to binding is
unresolved. Previous findings that neither soluble uPAR-DI￾DII nor soluble DII-DIII binds uPA efficiently could be inter￾preted as indicating that DII is unimportant, as might the
finding that a small peptide that inhibits the binding of scuPA
to its receptor can be cross-linked to DI and DIII (20). However,
the present study shows that deleting domain II or changing its
position within the full-length receptor profoundly inhibits the
capacity of uPAR to bind scuPA. The fact that we observed no
binding of scuPA to cells expressing GPI-DI or GPI-DI-DII
excludes the possibility that the reduced affinity is the result of
steric masking of the DI site caused by reordering the position
of DII and/or DIII. Furthermore, the absence of specific binding
to GPI-DI receptor compared with soluble DI suggests that the
cellular receptor fragment may partner aberrantly with other
cell surface proteins, becoming less available for a low affinity
interaction with uPA. Similar changes in the pairing of uPAR
with other cell surface constituents that occur only when the
receptor is expressed at high concentrations may reduce its
apparent affinity for scuPA, a finding we observed on COS
cells, uPAR-expressing 293 cell lines, and cultured endothelial
cells.
We identified a small region within loop 2 (13) of domain II
that is critical for scuPA binding. Mutation of Lys139 and His143
to alanine decreased the affinity of suPAR for scuPA ;5-fold.
On the other hand, similar mutations of the neighboring
Arg137, Arg142, and Arg145 residues decreased the affinity
.100-fold. These results were obtained with soluble uPAR in
surface plasmon resonance studies, and the relative impact of
the mutations on affinity was confirmed by competition-inhibi￾tion experiments and by measuring scuPA binding to whole
cells expressing their GPI-anchored counterparts. The Kd val￾ues of scuPA for WT-suPAR determined by surface plasmon
resonance and by binding to cellular uPAR were essentially
identical; the same was true for m2A-suPAR. The Kd values for
binding of scuPA to cellular m3A- and m5A-uPAR could not be

Domain II of uPAR Is Required for Urokinase Binding 28537
 at BRUNEL UNIV on March 25, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from calculated because of the presence on cells of abundant low
affinity non-uPAR-binding sites (31). Similarly, estimations of
the Kd values from the competition-inhibition experiments and
surface plasmon resonance for wild type suPAR and m2A were
similar (32). However, the estimated Kd values from the com￾petition-inhibition experiments were lower in the case of m3A
and m5A. It is likely that these lower estimated affinities also
result from competition between low affinity suPAR variants
with more abundant cell surface components that bind uPA
independent of uPAR (31). These cellular components have the
added advantage of high local concentration when competing
with the suPAR variants for GPI-scuPA.
Our data suggest that all 5 amino acids that we mutated in
the loop 2 region of domain II of uPAR participate in the
binding process. Furthermore, the competition-inhibition and
surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrate that the im￾pact of the two sets of mutations is coordinate and interactive.
This conclusion is based on the finding that the mutation of
Lys139 and His143 primarily affects the off rate, whereas mu￾tation of the three arginines perturbs the on rate as well. The
fact that mutation of each of the 5 amino acids individually has
no discernible effect suggests that the function of certain of
these charged residues can compensate for the others. The
reduced capacity of the Lys139/His143 variant m2A-suPAR to
stimulate the activity of scuPA was proportional to its lowered
binding affinity. In contrast, m3A-suPAR in which Arg137/
Arg142/Arg145 were altered caused little or no activation of
scuPA even under conditions where binding was demonstrable,
suggesting these three arginine residues participate in the
activation process as well.
It has been suggested that when scuPA binds to uPAR, both
components of the complex undergo conformational changes
that are involved in cell adhesion, signal transduction, and the
induction of enzymatic activity (2, 27, 33). The Arg137–Arg145
sequence might participate in this re-arrangement process to
stabilize high affinity binding. This possibility is supported by
the finding that the mutation m2A and m3A affects the off rate
of the interaction. The fact that the three arginines in DII that
are mutated in m3A also appear to be essential for activation
suggests that additional re-arrangements in the components of
the complex are required for the post-receptor binding event to
occur. Clearly, more extensive structural and biophysical (e.g.
calorimetric) analyses will be required to elucidate the nature
of this complex process.
We have previously shown that uPAR is composed of two
major functional units consisting of DI and DII-DIII, which
exert a synergistic effect on scuPA binding and activation (14).
These data has since been confirmed (15). The interaction
between DI and DII-DIII in uPAR may also regulate signal
transduction independent of uPA (21). Our data strongly sup￾port the notion that Arg137–Arg145 participates in the interdo￾main cooperation between DI and DII-DIII with respect to
scuPA binding and activation. sDI bound directly to wild type
cell-associated DII-DIII but not to the m5A-DII-DIII mutant in
the presence of scuPA. The same result was obtained when
scuPA was GPI-anchored to the cell surface, and the uPAR
fragments were in solution. Furthermore, wild type soluble
DII-DIII promoted the activation of scuPA in the presence of
sDI, whereas m5A-DII-DIII did not. Finally, these functional
changes occurred notwithstanding the preservation of the bind￾ing epitopes in domain I and domain III, as demonstrated by
photoaffinity labeling using a decameric uPA peptide antago￾nist. These data, taken together, suggest that scuPA, isolated
DI, and the DII-DIII portion of the receptor form a ternary
complex. scuPA may promote the formation of this complex
either by binding to each fragment independently, thereby
bringing them in close proximity, or by binding to one of the
fragments and changing its conformation to allow interaction
with the other receptor fragment. Although this study did not
distinguish between these two possibilities, Arg137–Arg145 is
clearly required for the formation of the ternary complex. Ad￾ditional studies will also be required to establish the pattern
and sequence by which the ternary complex is formed.
The Arg137–Arg145 sequence may also represent a new target
for uPAR-based peptide antagonists. Inhibitors directed at this
or other critical regions involved in interdomain cooperativity
may have the advantage of antagonizing both uPA-dependent
and uPA-independent receptor functions. uPAR may not be
expressed at high levels in most tissues in vivo under physio￾logical conditions, but its expression is clearly up-regulated in
various patho-physiological conditions that involve cell adhe￾sion, proteolysis, and migration through basement membranes.
This expression profile would be expected to increase the spec￾ificity of uPAR-based antagonists to such sites of disease. Stud￾ies are in progress to address this possibility.
