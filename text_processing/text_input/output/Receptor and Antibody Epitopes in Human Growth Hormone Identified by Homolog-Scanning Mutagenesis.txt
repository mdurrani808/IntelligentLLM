Receptor and Antibody Epitopes in Human
Growth Hormone Identified by Homolog￾la0 Scanning Mutagenesis
BRLAN C. CUNNINGHAM, PARKASH JHURANI, PETER NG, JAMES A. WELLS*
A strategy, termed homolog-scanning mutagenesis, was
used to identify the epitopes on human growth hormone
(hGH) for binding to its cloned liver receptor and eight
different monoclonal antibodies (Mab's). Segments of
sequences (7 to 30 residues long) that were derived from
homologous hormones known not to bind to the hGH
receptor or Mab's, were systematically substituted
throughout the hGH gene to produce a set of 17 chimeric
hormones. Each Mab or receptor was categorized by a
particular subset of mutant hormones that disrupted
binding. Each subset of the disruptive mutations mapped
within dose proximity on a three-dimensional model of
hGH, even though the residues changed within each

This 22-kilodalton pituitary hormone has a multitude of
biological effects, including linear growth (somatogenesis), lacta￾tion, activation of macrophages, and insulin-like and diabetogenic
effects (1). Growth hormone deficiency in children leads to dwarf￾ism, which has been successfully treated by injection of hGH. In
addition to its biological properties, the antigenicity of hGH is
useful for distinguishing genetic and post-translationally modified

mapping analysis correctly predicted those Mab's which
could or could not block binding of the receptor to hGH
and further suggested (along with other data) that the
folding of these chimeric hormones is like that of hGH.
By this analysis, three disoontinuous polypeptide determi￾nants in hGHthe loop between residues 54 and 74, the
central portion ofhelix 4 to the carboxyl terminus, and to
a lesser extent the amino-terminal region of helix 1-

sequences that cause functional variation among homolo￾gous proteins.

SCIENCE, VOL. 243
 on February 1, 2015 www.sciencemag.org Downloaded from hormones that includes placental lactogens, prolactins, and other
genetic and species variants of growth hormone (3). Among these,
hGH alone exhibits broad species specificity and binds monomeri￾cally to either the cloned somatogenic liver (4) or prolactin receptor
(5). The gene for hGH has been expressed in a secreted form in
Escherichia coli (6), and the three-dimensional folding pattern for
porcine growth hormone (pGH) has been solved at moderate
resolution and refinement (7). However, little is known of the
structural features that modulate binding to these receptors or that
define the antigenic sites on the hormone.
Using a stategy we term homolog-scanning mutagenesis, we have
mapped regions of the hormone involved in binding to the cloned
liver receptor and eight different anti-hGH monoclonal antibodies
(Mab's to hGH). Segments of hGH were systematically replaced
with analogous sequences from homologs of hGH that have greatly
reduced affinity for the receptor and the Mab's. We substituted
homologous sequences because genetically related proteins (despite
large sequence divergence) have similar three-dimensional structures
(8). Thus, it seemed likely that homologous sequence substitutions
may be more readily accommodated without gross disruption in the
native conformation of the molecule. Moreover, mutations that
disrupt the native folding of the protein are likely to lead to its
degradation by proteases in vivo (9). Thus, by homolog-scanning
mutagenesis, we expressed stably a set of 17 chimeric hormones that
collectively altered 85 out of 191 residues in hGH. Such a small set
of mutant hormones was readily analyzed by binding assays, thus
obviating the need to presort a library of random mutants by a
genetic screen or selection. The antibody and receptor binding site
data suggest that these mutations did not cause global changes in the
folding of the hormone.
Homolog-scannig mutagenesis. Human placental lactogen
(hPL), porcine growth hormone (pGH), and human prolactin
(hPRL) were used to make chimeric hormones with hGH because
homologs of these hormones have reduced binding affinities (more
than 1000 times less) for the human liver hGH receptor (10). These
hormones differed in sequence from hGH by 15, 32, and 77
percent, respectively (Fig. 1), and therefore provided a wide range
of homologous sequences to sample.
Six regions in the hGH sequence were targeted for homolog￾scanning mutagenesis (Fig. 1, regions A to F). These segments were
separated either by disulfide bonds, by borders of secondary struc￾ture, by areas ofsequence identity among the hormone family, or by
regions that previous experiments suggested were not involved in
receptor binding. For example, deletion of the NH2-terminal 13

amino acids by mutagenesis (11) or a natural variant of hGH that
deletes residues 32 to 46 (12) have been reported to cause relatively
small reductions in affinity for the somatogenic receptor. In addi￾tion, two-chain derivatives of hGH that were produced by limited
proteolysis of hGH and which delete some or all of the residues
between 134 and 149 do not significantly affect binding to the liver
receptor (13).
Initially, a random hybrid library containing various NH2-termi￾nal lengths of hGH linked to the remaining COOH-terminal
portion of pGH was constructed by random recombination of
tandemly linked genes (14). However, of seven hGH-pGH hybrids
whose crossover points were distributed evenly over the hGH gene,
only the extreme COOH-terminal hybrid [hGH(1-163) followed
by pGH(164-191)] was secreted from E. coli in amounts sufficient
for purification and analysis.
Helix wheel projections (Fig. 2) derived from the pGH folding
model (7) show that three ofthe four helices (helices 1, 3, and 4) are
amphipathic with strong hydrophobic moments (15), while helix 2
is very hydrophobic. The hydrophobic core in proteins is tightly
packed (16) and mutations in such buried positions are generally
destabilizing (17). In fact, the COOH-terminal hGH-pGH hybrid
that was weakly expressed introduced four substitutions (Ml70L,
V173A, F176Y, and V180M) that are located on the hydrophobic
face of helix four. To circumvent problems with expression, we
designed most of the homologous sequence exchange in the helical
regions of A, D, E, and F to avoid mutations of residues on the
hydrophobic face of the helices. Thus, the mutant of hGH with the
pGH sequence from 167 to 181 was designed to retain M170,
V173, F176, and V180 (Table 1), which are inside or bordering the
hydrophobic face of helix 4. Complete sequence exchanges were
constructed in the loop structures in regions B, C, D, E, and F. In
several cases an additional charged substitution was either intro￾duced or eliminated to more stringently probe a region. For
instance, hPL(46-52) contained an additional Q49E mutation, and
hPRL(12-33) contained an additional E30Q mutation.
To facilitate efficient mutagenesis, we assembled a synthetic hGH
gene that had 18 different unique restriction sites evenly distributed
without altering the hGH coding sequence (18-20). This gene
allowed insertion of mutagenic cassettes (21) or permitted restric￾tion-selection against one of the singly occurring restriction sites
after site-specific mutagenesis in a single-stranded vector (22).
Transcription of the mutant or wild-type genes was controlled by
the alkaline phosphatase promoter, and secretion of mature hGH
into the periplasm was directed by the heat-stable enterotoxin signal

hGH produced from the synthetic gene were indistinguishable from
hGH produced by the natural cDNA (19). Seventeen mutants of
hGH containing homologous sequences were constructed (Table
1). Secretion of these chimeric hormones into the periplasmic space
ofE. coli was comparable to that ofthe wild type and far greater than
that of the hGH-pGH hybrids.
Binding of receptor and monoclonal antibodies to chimeric
hormones. Competitive binding of '251-labeled hGH to the extra￾cellular portion of the cloned liver hGH receptor (4) was used to
quantify the relative affinities of the purified segment substituted
growth hormones to the extracellular domain of the liver receptor
(Table 1). This receptor fragment (translated molecular size, -28
kD) was highly purified (23), thus avoiding potential artifacts
associated with binding to receptors on whole cells. Furthermore,
the truncated receptor is highly soluble, exhibits the same selectivity
for hGH as the full-length membrane-spanning form (4, 23), and
retains high binding affinity for hGH (KD = 0.3 nM).
All of the variant hormones having mutations within regions C
and F and some within region A caused reductions (tenfold or
greater) in binding affinity, whereas those within regions B, D, and
E caused relatively small or no changes (Fig. 3). The mutations most
disruptive to binding within regions A, C, and F were further
localized. Dissection of the hPRL(12-33) into NH2- and COOH￾terminal segments, hPRL(12-19) and hPRL(22-33), respectively,
showed that the mutations in the NH2-terminal portion of region A
caused the reduction in binding. The slightly greater reduction
Table 1. Binding ofhGH mutants to the soluble hGH receptor. Some ofthe
mutants were produced by cassette mutagenesis (indicated by cassette),
where synthetic DNA duplexes coding for the indicated mutations were
ligated into the gap between the closest flanking restriction sites (21) in the
synthetic gene (18). Other mutants were constructed by restriction selection
(RS) in which single-stranded synthetic oligonudeotides coded for the
desired mutation and inactivated a particular restriction site (22). The
pGH(164-190) mutant was isolated from a library constructed by random
recombination (14) of tandemly linked growth hormone genes (hybrid). All
sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (20). Cultures of E. coli
strain W3110 harboring the mutated hGH plasmids were grown in low
phosphate media either in 10-liter fermentors or shake flasks (6), and the
processed hormone that was secreted into the periplasmic space was purified
(41). All mutant hormones were purified to more than 95 percent homoge￾neity. Laser densitometric scanning of Coomassie stained gels after SDS￾caused by the hPRL(12-19) compared to hPRL(12-33) is within
the maximal errors (+20 percent) inherent in these measurements
(Table 1). Similarly, the NH2-terminal portion of region F
[pGH(167-181)] accounted for a large proportion ofthe reduction
in binding free energy caused by the pGH(164-190) mutant (24).
One of the most dramatic effects was the 30-fold reduction in
binding free energy caused by hPL(56-64), which introduced only
two substitutions, E56D and R64M (24). Even though the mutants
that caused the greatest reductions in binding affinity are in regions
widely separated in primary sequence, together these define a patch
on the folded hormone that includes the NH2-terminus of helix 1,
the loop from Cys53 to the start ofhelix 2, and the central portion of
helix 4 (Fig. 4).
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to
assess the binding of eight different monoclonal antibodies (Mab's)
to the 17 chimeras plus some additional variants of hGH (Table 2).
With the possible exception ofthe pGH(164-190) mutant, disrup￾tion of binding to each monoclonal antibody was highly selective
and dramatic. For example, the hPRL(88-95), hPRL(97-104),
hPL(109-112), and hPRL(111-129) variants did not bind to Mab
1, yet the other mutant hormones outside of these regions bound as
efficiently as hGH (Fig. 4). Binding of Mab's 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 was
disrupted by mutations distant in the primary sequence, but in close
proximity in the folded hormone. Mab's 1, 7, and 8 were disrupted
by mutations defined by a continuous sequence, and one or more of
these Mab's may belong to the discontinuous class upon more fine
structure mapping.
PAGE was used to quantify the concentration of the purified hormones;
these values were in close agreement with concentrations determined from
the absorbance at 280 nm (eD47 = 0.92) (42). The dissociation constants
(KD) were calculated from Scatchard analysis of competitive binding of '"'I￾labeled hGH to the doned and purified soluble hGH receptor at 250C (23).
Standard errors in these measurements were generally at or below ±20
percent. Mutants are named on the basis ofthe first and last residue mutated
in the region. The specific mutations introduced are described by a nomen￾dature where the wild-type hGH residue is given first followed by its
sequence position and then the mutant residue. The single letter code

been mutated to His, and i184F indicates a Phe was inserted between
residues 184 and 185.

1332 SCIENCE, VOL. 243The set ofmutations that disrupted binding to a given Mab could
be narrowed either by dissection ofa nonbinding chimeric hormone
into subdomains (as described for the receptor above) or by
eliminating mutations in nonbinding chimeric hormones that were
in common with variants that still bound to the Mab. For example,
pGH(11-33) retained tight binding to Mab 4, yet hPRL(12-33)
disrupted binding. Thus, the disruptive mutations in the hPRL(12-
33) variant could be confined to residues not mutated in pGH(1 1-
33)-namely, N12, L15, R16, D26, and E30. This set could be
further restricted to N12, L15, and R16 because the hPRL(12-19)
disrupted binding, but the hPRL(22-33) did not (Fig. 4). In fact,
the N12H mutation in hPL(12-25) could entirely account for the
disruption in binding to Mab 4 because this was the only mutation
not in common with pGH(11-33). We further tested this hypothe￾sis by mutating Asn'2 to Ala. Indeed, binding ofMab 4 to the N12A
mutant was reduced (100 times less binding), whereas binding to
the other Mab's (except Mab 3) was unaffected (Table 2). Thus, it
was possible to resolve the epitopes for all eight Mab's even though
some of the epitopes partially overlap.
Although the set of eight Mab's covered most of the hormone,
there are still regions where these Mab's did not bind. For example,
4 of the 20 variants did not significantly disrupt binding to any of
the Mab's tested [hPRL(22-33), pGH(48-52), hPRL(126-136),
and pGH(167-181)]. The sequence of these nonblocking sites may
be less antigenic in mice; however, it is more likely that we have not
yet tested enough Mab's to isolate ones that are specific for these
sites.
Our data show two significant differences between the binding
sites for the Mab's and the receptor. (i) The patch defined by
disruptive mutations is larger for the receptor than for any of the
Mab's. This cannot result from vastly differing affinities because all
of these Mab's have binding affinities that are comparable to the
receptor [KD -0.1 to 1 nM (19)], except for Mab 1 (KD -100 ntM).
(ii) The receptor appears more tolerant ofdisruptive substitutions in
the hormone than are the Mab's. The maximum reduction in
binding to the receptor for any of the mutants is about 100 times,
whereas almost every antibody has at least one chimera that causes
more than a 1000-fold reduction in binding. For some Mab's, much
ofthe reduction can result from a single substitution such as N12A.
X-ray crystallographic studies (25) have shown that point mutations
in hen egg white lysozyme that cause similarly large reductions in
binding are in direct contact with the antibody.
Many of the chimeras that caused disruption of receptor binding
also disrupted binding to one or more of the Mab's. We therefore
evaluated the ability of each of the eight Mab's (normalized to their
relative affinities for hGH) to block the binding ofthe hGH receptor
to hGH (Table 3). Mab's 5 and 6 have antigenic determinants
located in the loop from 54 to 74 as well as helix 4 that most closely
overlap determinants for the receptor (Fig. 4). Accordingly, these
Mab's are the most efficient at blocking binding of the hGH
receptor. Mab 2 competes almost as well as Mab's 5 and 6 and it too
shares a moderately disruptive hGH variant with the receptor
[hPRL(12-19)]. Mab 7 competes relatively strongly with the
receptor for hGH (Table 3) and it is disrupted by a mutant hormone

Table 3. Competitive displacement of hGH receptor from hGH by mono￾clonal antibodies to hGH. Assays were carried out by immobilization of
wild-type hGH i microtiter plates coated with rabbit polydonal antibodies
to hGH as described in Table 2. Receptor (fixed at 10 nM) and a given Mab
(diluted over a range of 150 to 0.002 nM) were added to the hGH-coated
microtiter plates for 16 to 20 hours at 25C, and unbound components were
washed away. The amount of bound receptor was quantified by adding a
Mab (conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) that bound to the receptor but
did not interfere with the binding between hGH and the receptor. The
determination of the concentration of each Mab fbr 50 percent binding to
hGH was performed as in Table 2, except that the Mab's were incubated
with hGH for 16 to 20 hours instead of 2 hours. The normalizd
displacement value is calculated from the ratio of the concentration of Mab
necessary to displace 50 percent ofthe receptor to the concentration of Mab
necessary to bind 50 percent of the hGH on the plate. This value is used to
compare the relative ability of each Mab to displace the receptor.

that causes a minor disruption of receptor binding [hPL(46-52)].
Thus, it appears that Mab's 2 and 7 sit on the border of the receptor
binding site. Mab's 1 and 8 are unable to give detectable displace￾ment of the receptor, and as expected these contain no overlapping
antigenic determinants with the receptor. In contrast, Mab's 3 and 4
are about 1000 times less competitive than Mab 2, yet they also
share overlapping disruptive mutations with the receptor and Mab 2
in helix 1 (Fig. 4). This apparent discrepancy may be easily
reconciled if the mutations in helix 1 that disrupt Mab's 3 and 4
differ from those residues that disrupt binding to Mab 2 or the
receptor. In fact, one such mutant (N12A) disrupts binding of
either Mab 3 or 4 without affecting binding to Mab 2 (Table 2) or
the receptor (19). Thus, it is likely that Mab's 3 and 4 bind to the
face of helix 1 (containing N12) that is opposite from the receptor
and Mab 2. These competitive binding data taken together with the
direct epitope mapping and receptor binding data support the
proposed location of the receptor binding site (Fig. 4).
Potential uses and limitaions ofhomolog-scaning mutagene￾sis. By comparison to antibody competition, homolog-scanning
mutagenesis provides a higher resolution map of epitopes in pro￾teins. Antibody competition is of lower resolution because for two
Mab's to compete it is only necessary that their epitopes be close or
partially overlap, but not superimpose. For example, epitope map￾ping by competitive binding of 27 different Mab's to hGH resolved
a total of only four different antigenic sites on the hormone (26).
Our data show that the binding sites on hGH for all eight Mab's
and the receptor are different although they sometimes overlap.
Furthermore, the competitive binding strategy does not locate the
epitopes on the sequence. A higher resolution strategy for defining
antigenic sites is to test binding to short linear peptides (27), or
expressed gene fragments (28), from the protein of interest. Howev￾er, for these approaches to work requires that the linear sequence be
capable of adopting the conformation found in the intact antigen so
that it may be recognized by the Mab. For antibodies to native
globular proteins, stricdy linear epitopes are predicted on the basis
of modeling studies to be rare (29).

by more than a factor of 10 to the extracellular domain of the hGH liver
receptor (center) or Mab's 1 to 8 (outside panels arranged in a dockwisc

the approximate extent and location of the respective contact regions (as
defined by the disruptive mutations). The Mab's that block receptor binding
are shaded the same as the receptor. This view of hGH was constructed by
tracing the back side of the hormone from Fig. 2. The locations of residues
along the polypeptide chain were based on information on the known

structure of pGH, which is 70 percent identical to hGH and should have
virtually the same chain folding as hGH (8). Residues in helices were fixed by
the interpolating between the indicated start and end points in the projec￾tion. Residues in the loop regions were dearly marked by kinks in the pGH
structure (7). Three smal sections of the loops that were not visible in the
front view (34 to 36, 97 to 101, 188 to 189) were drawn so as to provide the
most direct connection to the next visible structure. The structure from 96 to
106 has been independently determined by nudear magnetic resonance
spectoscopy to be an omega loop structurc (40).

Ureceptors. It is also desirable to have at least low-resolution structur￾al information so as to avoid destabilizing mutations in buried
positions. In the absence ofsuch a structure it may be best to mutate
only hydrophilic residues, as was recently done for the interleukin-2
receptor (32). In contrast, numerous hybrid proteins have been
successfully produced that ignore these structural contraints, includ￾ing a-amylases (14), interferons (33), and recently CD4 (34) and
adrenergic receptors (35).
It is possible in any mutagenesis experiment that binding can be
disrupted because of a global effect on the protein conformation
instead of a direct effect on the binding interaction. There are
numerous lines of evidence that indicate the homologous substitu￾tions described here do not disrupt the overall folding of the
molecule. Receptor and Mab binding is sensitive to the tertiary as
well as primary structure of hGH. The direct mapping data indicate
that the receptor and at least five ofthe Mab's recognize discontinu￾ous epitopes. Furthermore, in control experiments (36), binding of
an isolated fragment of hGH containing residues 1 to 141 with any
of the Mab's (except Mab 8) and the receptor is at least 40 times
lower, even though all of the sequence determinants are present in
the 1 to 141 fragment for five of these binding proteins (Mab's 1 to
4 and 7). Despite this, each hGH mutant is highly selective in
disrupting binding to only one or a small subset of these binding
proteins. In one case, the pHG(167-181) mutant causes a 27-fold
reduction in receptor binding yet does not affect the binding to any
ofthe eight Mab's. Even the least selective mutant, pGH(164-190),
retains tight binding to four of the Mab's. Paterson and co-workers
(37) have concluded that monoclonal antibodies can be more
sensitive probes of conformational integrity than CD (circular
dichroism) spectroscopy. Nonetheless, the far ultraviolet circular
dichroic spectra of all of the purified hormones tested so far are
virtually identical to wild-type hGH (36). Finally, all the mutants,
with the exception ofthe pGH(164-190), are expressed in essential￾ly wild-type amounts. Resistance to proteolysis in vivo (during
expression) has been used as a screen for conformational integrity
(9). High resolution structural analysis is still necessary, but together
our data indicate that the mutants retain the overall folding pattern
of wild-type hGH.
Although mutations do not disrupt the overall folding of the
molecule, the fact they disrupt binding does not necessarily impli￾cate those residues as making direct contacts. A disruptive mutation
may not only remove a favorable interaction but may introduce an
unfavorable one. For example, the N12R mutation in the
hPRL(12-19) chimera not only changes the hydrogen bonding
amide function of Asn'2, but the Arg substitution also introduces a
bulkier side chain that is positively charged. Furthermore, a number
of the binding contacts may be conserved between the homologs so
that not all contacts, or even regions, may be necessarily probed by
homolog-scanning mutagenesis. In this regard, a two-chain hybrid
containing residues 1 to 134 of hGH and 141 to 191 of hPL
(reconstituted from reduced and carboxymethylated peptide frag￾ments) bound as well to rabbit liver membranes as did its homolo￾gous hGH derivative (38). However, the reverse hybrid was greatly
reduced in binding. These data suggested that the receptor contact
differences between hPL and hGH were in the 1 to 134 fragment;
however, the analysis was insufficient to conclude that all the
binding determinants were located in the NH2-terminal fragment.
This is because the 141 to 191 fragment of hPL retains the helix 4
receptor binding determinants, and is nearly identical to hGH in this
region (Fig. 1).
The homolog-scanning technique generates a systematic set of
multiply mutated proteins that are practical to analyze by quantita￾tive binding analysis. Further fine structural mapping should pin￾point the precise side chains that modulate binding.
