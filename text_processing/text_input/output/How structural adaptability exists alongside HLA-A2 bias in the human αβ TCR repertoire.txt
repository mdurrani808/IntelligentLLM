How T-cell receptors (TCRs) can be intrinsically biased toward MHC
proteins while simultaneously display the structural adaptability re￾quired to engage diverse ligands remains a controversial puzzle. We
addressed this by examining αβ TCR sequences and structures for ev￾idence of physicochemical compatibility with MHC proteins. We found
that human TCRs are enriched in the capacity to engage a polymorphic,
positively charged “hot-spot” region that is almost exclusive to the
α1-helix of the common human class I MHC protein, HLA-A*0201
(HLA-A2). TCR binding necessitates hot-spot burial, yielding high
energetic penalties that must be offset via complementary elec￾trostatic interactions. Enrichment of negative charges in TCR binding
loops, particularly the germ-line loops encoded by the TCR Vα and Vβ
genes, provides this capacity and is correlated with restricted posi￾tioning of TCRs over HLA-A2. Notably, this enrichment is absent from
antibody genes. The data suggest a built-in TCR compatibility with
HLA-A2 that biases receptors toward, but does not compel, particular
binding modes. Our findings provide an instructional example for
how structurally pliant MHC biases can be encoded within TCRs.
T-cell receptor | peptide/MHC | structure | binding | MHC bias
MHC restriction is a hallmark of T-cell recognition (1). The
first crystallographic structures of T-cell receptors (TCRs) in
complex with antigen revealed the structural basis for MHC re￾striction, illustrating how TCRs bind a composite ligand consisting
of the MHC protein and its presented peptide (pMHC) (2, 3).
Around the same time, evidence began to mount that T cells, and
by extension their TCRs, maintain a physical bias toward MHC
proteins (4). The mechanism underlying this bias, and indeed its
very existence, has remained controversial. On one hand, structural
evidence has been presented that germ-line complementarity-de￾termining region (CDR) loops incorporate evolved regions with
intrinsic affinities toward MHC proteins (5). On the other hand, the
requirement for coreceptor during thymic selection provides a
mechanism for selecting TCRs that bind MHC (6–9).
Efforts to reconcile these positions have emphasized that
they are not mutually exclusive (9–11). However, it is clear that
any intrinsic bias TCRs have toward MHC proteins must exist
alongside the need for TCRs to structurally adapt to different
ligands or alterations in the TCR–pMHC interface (12). For
example, changes to a peptide alone are sufficient to alter how
the same TCR sits over the same MHC protein, altering TCR–
MHC atomic contacts (13, 14). Similar results are seen with
changes to TCR variable domains or hypervariable loops, or even
MHC mutations (15–18). Perhaps not surprisingly then, there are
no germ-line–based TCR–MHC contacts that are fully conserved
at the atomic level when structures with TCRs sharing the same
variable domain are compared. For example, TCRs sharing Vβ 8.2
make similar contacts with the helices of the class II MHC protein
I-A, but actual contacts are modulated by different peptides,
hypervariable loops, and Vα domains (15, 19–21). Although such
variances have been noted and even predicted (5, 22), they
nonetheless make it difficult to clearly identify interactions encoding
a TCR–MHC bias (12).
Furthermore, in addition to class I and class II MHC proteins,
TCRs can bind a variety of nonclassical MHC molecules, non￾MHC ligands (6, 23, 24), and as demonstrated very recently can
even bind MHC molecules in orientations reverse from the
“canonical” diagonal binding mode (25). Thus, whatever MHC
biases actually do exist do not exempt a receptor from identifying
alternate binding solutions or targets.
A possibility often overlooked in discussions of TCR binding is
that an evolutionarily encoded MHC bias does not need to specify
attractive (i.e., energetically favorable) interactions. A more fun￾damental feature is structural or physicochemical complementarity,
or simply “compatibility.” A set of structurally/chemically compat￾ible interactions whose formation is energetically weak, neutral, or
even slightly unfavorable is better than a set of noncomplementary,
unfavorable interactions. A well-understood example in protein
chemistry is interactions between opposing charges in protein
structures. Formation of such interactions require removal of the
charges from bulk water, which comes with a substantial, un￾favorable “desolvation” penalty (26, 27). The coulombic energy
from the interaction between the charges is often insufficient to
offset the desolvation penalty (28). However, a weak (or even
unfavorable) charge–charge interaction is still energetically better
than two uncompensated charges buried in a protein. In this way,
charges can influence structural specificity even if they do not
drive binding. Similar arguments can be made for shape comple￾mentarity: an energetically neutral but complementary set of in￾teractions is better than a forced set of interactions that
might result in steric hindrance or require costly conformational
changes. This concept of compatibility is well understood in an￾tibody–antigen interactions (29).
Significance
T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of antigenic peptides presented by
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins defines specificity
in cellular immunity. Evidence suggests that TCRs are intrinsically
biased toward MHC proteins, yet how this bias coexists alongside
the considerable structural variability that is necessary for TCRs to
engage different ligands has been a longstanding puzzle. By ex￾amining structural and sequence data, we found evidence that
human αβ TCRs have an inherent compatibility with structural and
chemical properties of MHC proteins. This compatibility leads TCRs
to an intrinsic MHC bias but does not compel the formation of
particular modes of binding, providing a solution to how TCRs can
be MHC-biased but still structurally adaptable.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
PNAS PLUSConsidering the above arguments, evolution could have specified
a TCR bias toward MHC by facilitating structural/chemical com￾patibility. Because they need not be energetic drivers, regions of
compatibility might be expected to be adaptable and even over￾ridden when sufficient “glue” can be found elsewhere in an in￾terface. To examine this possibility, we studied human αβ TCRs
that recognize the highly prevalent human class I MHC protein,
HLA-A*0201 (HLA-A2 or simply A2). Given the high occurrence
of A2 in human populations (30), we reasoned that, should it exist,
a signature of evolutionarily encoded compatibility should be pre￾sent within the large amount of structural data available for A2-
binding TCRs. We quantified sequence variability and used this
to guide queries of electrostatic compatibility. In doing so, we
identified a set of interactions between TCRs and a polymorphic
region on A2 that are strongly conserved in TCR–A2 structures.
These interactions, which involve a positively charged polymorphic
“hot-spot” region that is almost exclusive to the A2 α1-helix (31–
33), are correlated not only with A2 binding but also restricted
positioning over the MHC. Different TCRs engage this hot spot
differently, in some cases using hypervariable rather than (or in
addition to) germ-line loops. Nonetheless, we show that TCR germ￾line loops are enriched in the negatively charged amino acids
needed to engage the hot spot and that this enrichment is absent
from the corresponding loops in antibodies. Thus, the capacity for
achieving structural and chemical complementarity with A2 is not
only built-in to the human TCR repertoire but present in a way
that facilitates the structural adaptability needed to engage diverse
pMHC ligands. Although examples of other forms of evolved
compatibility remain to be identified, our findings support the
conclusion that TCRs have an evolutionarily encoded, inherent
compatibility with MHC proteins that facilitates recognition
but does not compel particular binding solutions. This can ex￾plain how TCRs can show MHC bias in functional experiments,
while still displaying considerable structural adaptability, and
sometimes violate expectations.
Results
TCR Germ-Line Loops Are Diverse. We began examining TCR germ￾line loops by generating sequence logos for each CDR1 and CDR2
loop, focusing on those Vα/Vβ segments encoding the most common
loop lengths (Fig. 1A; see Table S1 for loop statistics). Loop defini￾tions and sequences were taken from the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT)
database, except that we used an extended definition for CDR2β that
better accounts for loop structure in structures of TCRs bound to
pMHC (Fig. S1A). We also separately calculated the Shannon en￾tropy values for each position in each loop. Shannon entropies
quantify diversity, with a value of zero indicating conservation of 1 aa
and the maximum value of 4.32 indicating equal representation of all
20 aa. A previous analysis of TCR variable genes identified three
general Shannon entropy categories: H0 (0 ≤ H ≤ 1), H1 (1 < H ≤ 2),
and H2 (H > 2) (34). H0 sites are highly conserved and associated
with sites essential for fold or function. H1 sites are semiconserved,
and H2 sites are highly variable with no obvious conservation pattern.
Only a single H0 site in the TCR germ-line loops was identi￾fied, the histidine at position 29 in CDR1β, whose presence
has been noted previously and is thought to be involved in loop
organization (35). Five H1 sites were identified, one each in
CDR1α, CDR2α, and CDR1β, and two in CDR2β. The re￾maining sites are all H2. This indicates that the majority of TCR
germ-line loop positions are highly variable, with only a small
fraction demonstrating sequence and presumably functional
conservation.
There Is No Obvious Signal for Engaging HLA-A2 in Sequences of TCR
Germ-Line Loops. We next asked whether binding a particular
MHC protein dictates preferences in TCR germ-line loops. We
assembled a set of structurally or biophysically characterized, natural
human TCRs known to recognize peptides presented by the most
common human class I MHC protein, HLA-A*0201 (A2) (Table S2,
Complexes with HLA-A2). After accounting for duplicate genes, we
used this set to compute CDR1/2 sequence logos and entropies (Fig.
1B). In all loops, diversity is reduced compared with the larger
analysis of all sequences. To ask whether this result is attributable to

2 of 10 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1522069113 Blevins et al.restriction toward A2 or just reflective of a smaller sample size, we
randomly generated 10 identically sized datasets of germ-line loop
sequences from the larger set of all human germ-line loop se￾quences. The average entropies of the loops of the A2-binding TCRs
were all within one SD of the averages of the randomly generated
datasets, indicating that reduced diversity in the data in Fig. 1B is not
likely a function of engaging A2 (Table S3).
Examining the entropy data for the A2-binding TCRs in more
detail, there are at least two sites per CDR loop that are H0 or H1
(highly conserved or semiconserved; Shannon entropy values high￾lighted in red in Fig. 1B). For comparison, we computed sequence
logos and entropies for a set of structurally characterized, natural
human TCRs shown to bind human class I MHC proteins other
than A2 (Fig. 1C; TCRs in Table S2, Complexes with other class I
HLA proteins). Although there are notable similarities and differ￾ences, in every case, the most common amino acids in the A2-
binding H0 or H1 sites are also present in the equivalent position in
the non–A2-binding sequences. χ2 tests for independence indicated
that the two sets of sequences are not statistically distinct. Thus, the
available data indicate that there are no germ-line amino acids or
amino acid sequences exclusively required for engaging A2.
TCRs That Bind HLA-A2 Show No Conserved Pairwise Amino Acid Contacts
with A2 but a Propensity for Engaging a Key Molecular Contact on the
MHC α1-Helix. We next asked whether TCRs use H0 or H1 sites
to form preferred contacts with particular MHC proteins. Within
the set of A2-binding TCRs, excluding redundant structures with
altered peptides or mutants, there are 13 high-resolution crystal
structures of naturally occurring human TCRs bound to peptide/
A2 complexes (Table S2, Complexes with HLA-A2). We asked
whether the most common amino acid in each H0/H1 position forms
common interactions with A2. For example, does the strongly
conserved serine at position 27 in CDR1α (H = 0.9) commonly
contact a certain residue on A2?
Of a total of 249 pairwise amino acid interactions between the
germ-line loops and A2 in the entire dataset, 44 are made using
amino acids in the H0/H1 positions. Of these 44, 26 are made using
the most frequently occurring residues. Of these 26, although some
contacts are repeated within different complexes, there are none that
were common to every complex (Table 1). In some instances, the
most conserved residues at the H0/H1 sites do not contact A2 at all.
The only pattern observed in the contact analysis was between
the conserved N-terminal tyrosine of CDR2β (Tyr48β) and Arg65
on the A2 α1-helix: these two residues contact each other in 6 of
13 complexes, although the numbers of contacts, their distances,
and the relative positioning of the two side chains differ (Fig. 2A).
This observation is consistent with earlier studies indicating a
potential role for this tyrosine (22, 36). None of the interactions
between Tyr48β and Arg65 involves a hydrogen bond or other
electrostatic interaction, and the interaction is not restricted to a
certain Vβ gene use. When in contact, the shape complementarity
between Arg65 and Tyr48β ranged from moderate to high. This
was quantified using the Sc statistic (37), yielding values from 0.64
for Mel5 to 0.86 for 1G4 (a value of 1.0 would indicate perfect
complementarity between interacting residues).
A Correlation Between TCR Binding Position and Engagement of HLA-A2.
The observation demonstrating a propensity for TCRs contacting
Arg65 on A2 with a conserved tyrosine is notable, as position 65 is
a polymorphic site that in part distinguishes HLA-A from HLA-B:
position 65 is arginine in 85% of HLA-A alleles, whereas it is
glutamine in 95% of HLA-B alleles and 100% of HLA-C alleles.
To follow up, we examined the relationships between positions
48β and 65 in structures of TCRs bound to human class I MHC
proteins other than A2, using the dataset in Table S2 (Complexes
with other class I HLA proteins). Eleven of the TCRs in these 16
complexes have a tyrosine at position 48 in CDR2β, and only one
of the MHC proteins has an arginine at position 65. Of the 11
non–A2-binding TCRs with a tyrosine at 48β, only one used it
to contact position 65. This analysis revealed a stark difference
between the A2 and the non-A2 complexes: in the non-A2 com￾plexes, position 48β is positioned across a broad stretch of the
α1-helix (Fig. 2B). This differs from the complexes with A2, in
which Tyr48β is restricted to a much tighter region, even for those
cases in which Tyr48β and Arg65 are not in contact. The difference
in positioning is not due to TCR crossing (docking) angles: the
average and SDs of the crossing angles of the A2-binding TCRs is
46 ± 14°, whereas for the non–A2-binding TCRs it is 49 ± 13°
(Table S2). The variation also cannot be attributed to different
loop conformations, as the CDR2β loops for all of the TCRs in
Fig. 2 adopt similar conformations (Fig. S1B).
However, in examining the structures, we observed a greater vari￾ation in the global positioning of the TCRs over the MHC in the non￾A2 complexes than the A2 complexes. To quantify this, we computed
the center of mass of the Vα/Vβ domains over the MHC. In the non￾A2 complexes, the center of mass is broadly distributed over the
pMHC (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the center of mass of the A2-binding
TCRs is restricted to a tighter cluster. To quantify this difference, we
computed the position of the average center of mass for the A2 and
non-A2 datasets and tabulated its distance from each individual
TCR’s center of mass. For the A2 complexes, the average distance
was 3.5 ± 1.3 Å. For the non-A2 complexes, the average distance was
6.3 ± 4.4 Å. A two-tailed Mann–Whitney test indicated these differ￾ences were significant at P ≤ 0.05. [We note that the values for the
non-A2 structures include the SB47, SB27, and CA5 TCRs, which
engage a “superbulged” 13-mer presented by HLA-B*3508 (38). If
these are excluded from the non-A2 data, the non-A2 average dis￾tance drops to a less significant 4.9 ± 2.5 Å, highlighting the need for
more structural work on recognition of long peptides (39).]
The Interaction Between Tyr48β and Arg65 Does Not Drive TCR Binding
to Peptide/HLA-A2 Complexes. To assess the importance of the in￾teraction between Tyr48β and Arg65 in TCR recognition of peptide/
A2 complexes, we examined the impact of mutations at these posi￾tions. These were made in the interface between the TCR DMF5
and the MART126(2L)-35 peptide presented by A2, a TCR–pMHC

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
PNAS PLUSinteraction we have previously studied in detail (13, 40). The shape
complementarity between Tyr48β and Arg65 in the DMF5 interface
is high, with an interresidue Sc statistic of 0.8. Mutation of Tyr48β to
alanine reduced binding 40-fold (ΔΔG° = 2.1 kcal/mol) (Fig. 3A).
Mutation of Arg65 to alanine had a smaller but still significant effect,
reducing binding eightfold (ΔΔG° = 1.2 kcal/mol). Tyr48β and
Arg65 are thus clearly important for DMF5 recognition. These re￾sults are consistent with alanine mutations at these positions in other
TCR–pMHC interfaces (31, 40), as well as the impact of mutations
to Tyr48β on T-cell development (36).
However, the two alanine measurements do not report on the
strength of the Tyr48β–Arg65 interaction. To assess this, we
measured the interaction between the two alanine mutants, which
when combined with the measurements for the wild type and two
single mutants allowed us to construct a double-mutant cycle
targeting the Tyr48β–Arg65 interaction. In a double-mutant cycle,
the interaction free energy between two side chains (ΔGint) is
equal to the difference between the ΔΔG° of the double mutant
and the sum of the ΔΔG° values of the two single mutants (40, 41).
For the interaction between Tyr48 in DMF5 and Arg65 in A2, we
measured a negligible ΔGint of 0.3 kcal/mol (Fig. 3A). This indi￾cates that, in the interface between DMF5 and A2, although both
Tyr48β and Arg65 are important, the interaction between them
does not provide a driving force for binding. This result is con￾sistent with structure, as despite their high shape complementarity
in the DMF5 complex, Tyr48β and Arg65 form only three van der
Waals interactions. As Tyr48β and Arg65 interact similarly in all
other TCR complexes with A2 (Fig. 2A; average number of con￾tacts is 3 ± 1), this result is likely to be generally applicable.
TCRs That Bind HLA-A2 Form Electrostatic Interactions with Arg65.
We next asked whether other conservations exist between TCRs and
A2 that could account for the more restricted positioning of TCRs
over A2. For example, residues on the α1- or α2-helices may interact
with different residues in TCR loops that nonetheless provide
similar chemical complementarity. Using the set of TCR–peptide/
A2 structures, we examined pairwise TCR–A2 interactions from
the perspective of the MHC protein, asking which TCR amino acids

4 of 10 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1522069113 Blevins et al.interacted with each MHC amino acid on the α1- and α2-helices.
We chose to focus on electrostatic interactions as these are more
directional and of longer range than van der Waals interactions.
The strongest pattern that emerged from this analysis again
involved Arg65 on the A2 α1-helix (Fig. 4). Arg65 forms a
charge–charge interaction with a Glu or Asp near the end of
CDR2β in 4 of the 13 complexes, as well as a fifth crystallized
with an engineered TCR (42). Three other TCRs use a Glu or
Asp at the start of CDR1α to interact with Arg65. Overall, 8 of
13 TCRs interact with Arg65 using a germ-line–encoded, nega￾tively charged amino acid (Fig. S2 A and B).
Is this propensity for an electrostatic interaction with Arg65
reflected in germ-line loop sequences? An enrichment in nega￾tive charges in TCR CDR2β loops has been noted (22). Indeed,
in the sequence logos for the A2-binding TCRs, position 56 in
CDR2β and position 26 in CDR1α are low-diversity, H1 sites for
which Asp and Glu are the most common amino acids (Fig. 1B).
These charges are also present in the non–A2-binding TCRs,
although the frequencies are lower and the positions more di￾verse, with H > 2 (Fig. 1C). The pattern of interacting with
Arg65 is not associated with variable gene use: only two of five
Vβ 6-5 TCRs use an Asp in CDR2β to interact with Arg65, and
two of three Vα 12-2 TCRs use an Asp in CDR1α (Table S2,
Complexes with HLA-A2). Thus, the capacity to engage Arg65
electrostatically is represented in TCRs that bind A2 and, to a
lesser extent, non-A2, and it is not restricted to nor is it obligated
by particular gene segments.
Expanding the search to include hypervariable loops, we ob￾served that, in addition to germ-line loops, some TCRs use
hypervariable loops to interact with Arg65. Two use only an Asp
or Glu in CDR3α, and two use only noncharged CDR3α loop
residues to form hydrogen bonds with Arg65 (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2
C and D). Several receptors use both germ-line and hyper￾variable residues. Overall, 11 of 13 TCRs directly engage Arg65
using a germ-line CDR1α/CDR2β loop or a hypervariable
CDR3α loop. In the two complexes where Arg65 is not engaged
directly, Arg65 interacts indirectly with a TCR polar or charged
side chain via a bridging water or ion (Fig. S2E). Thus, in every
structure examined, Arg65 is involved in a direct or indirect
electrostatic interaction with the TCR.
Burial of Arg65 and the Adjacent Lys66 on the HLA-A2 α1-Helix Requires
Overcoming a Large Desolvation Penalty. Position 65 is among the
three most commonly contacted MHC residues in TCR interfaces
with class I MHC proteins (18). This is attributable to its location
near the center of the MHC α1-helix, which makes TCR burial
of position 65 a near necessity (Fig. S1C). Indeed, for the A2- and
non–A2-binding TCRs studied here, the average solvent accessi￾bility of the position 65 side chain in the TCR–pMHC complex is
30%, compared with 82% in the free pMHC (Table S2, Complexes
with HLA-A2). Notably, in A2, Arg65 is adjacent to another posi￾tively charged polymorphic amino acid, Lys66. In A2, the solvent
accessibility of Lys66 is reduced upon TCR binding from an average
of 23% to 6%. Only HLA-A alleles have the Arg65/Lys66 com￾bination, with A2 and its suballeles accounting for 93% of the
sequences. The combination of these two amino acids results in a
significant and distinctive positive charge density on the surface
of A2 that is absent from other MHC proteins. This is shown in
Fig. 5A, which compares the electrostatic surface potentials of
A2 (Arg65/Lys66) and HLA-B51 (Gln65/Ile66).
Burial of charged amino acids in a protein interface is always
associated with a penalty resulting from the removal of water
molecules interacting with the charge (26, 27). We computed this
desolvation penalty for Arg65 and Lys66 in each TCR interface
with A2, using a continuum electrostatics approach that yields
the desolvation and coulombic energies associated with charge
burial (27, 43). We used this approach previously in studying
TCR recognition of pMHC, validating it with mutational and
binding studies (32). Across the 13 TCR–A2 interfaces, the aver￾age desolvation penalty for Arg65 was an unfavorable +2.0 kcal/mol,
ranging from +0.5 to +3.8 kcal/mol (Fig. 5B). The desolvation
penalty was equally compensated by favorable coulombic inter￾actions, which averaged −2.0 kcal/mol. We performed the same
calculation for Lys66, which showed an average desolvation pen￾alty of +1.7 kcal/mol (Fig. 5B).
These computed results are in good agreement with experi￾mental measurements. For electrostatic interactions, the ΔGint
from a double-mutant cycle reflects the interresidue coulombic
interactions (28). With the A6 TCR binding Tax/A2, we pre￾viously used double-mutant cycles to measure the strength of the
interaction between Arg65 and Asp99 of CDR3α (40). The ex￾perimental ΔGint was a highly favorable value of −2.8 kcal/mol.
For comparison, in the A6-Tax/A2 interface, the continuum
electrostatic calculations yielded a value of −3.2 kcal/mol for the
intermolecular coulombic interactions with Arg65. As a second
check, we performed a double-mutant cycle in the interface
between Arg65 and Asp26 of CDR1α in the DMF5–MART1/A2
interface. Here, the ΔGint was −0.4 kcal/mol (Fig. 3B). For com￾parison, the computed intermolecular coulombic interactions of
Arg65 with DMF5 amounted to 0.5 kcal/mol.
The Xenoreactive TCR AHIII Demonstrates Electrostatic Interactions
with Arg65 and Lys66 Are Not Strictly Encoded. Our analysis so far
indicates that the need to interact with and counteract a region of
positive charge on the A2 α1-helix is reflected in the composition
of TCR germ-line sequences, and doing so is correlated with more
restricted TCR positioning over pMHC. However, the utilization of
both hypervariable and germ-line loops in this capacity, even with
TCRs sharing variable gene segments, indicates that the germ-line
sequences do not obligate particular interactions with Arg65. In
other words, although TCR germ-line loops are enriched in the
capacity to interact with Arg65/Lys66, inherent structural adapt￾ability and sequence variations allow charge complementarity to
occur opportunistically via a variety of means.
As a test of this hypothesis, we examined the structure of the
xenoreactive mouse TCR AHIII bound to the p1049 peptide

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
PNAS PLUSpresented by A2 (44), reasoning that strict genetic programming
between germ-line loops and A2 would have diverged between
mice and humans, altering how Arg65 is accommodated. In this
structure, however, Arg65 interacts with Glu56 in CDR2β (Fig. 4).
Tyr48 of the AHIII CDR2β loop also contacts Arg65, and the
TCR binds with a center of mass that falls within the range seen
for other A2-binding TCRs (Fig. 2C). The “cognate” syngeneic
ligand for AHIII is a peptide presented by the mouse class I MHC
protein H-2Db
, which notably has glutamine rather than arginine
at position 65 on the α1-helix. Although efforts to crystallize the
AHIII-peptide/Db complex failed, in the complex between the
mouse 6218 TCR and an unrelated viral peptide presented by Db
(45), the 6218 TCR does not contact position 65, and the Vα/Vβ
center of mass is skewed away from the cluster associated with
TCR recognition of A2 (Fig. 2C). We conclude from this analysis
that neutralization of the charges on the A2 α1-helix and the
impact on TCR binding modes results from opportunistic rather
than “hardwired” interactions, but the opportunistic interactions
are facilitated by negative charges present in TCR germ-line loops.
Evolution Has Enhanced the Ability of TCR Germ-Line Loops to Engage
HLA-A2. Although our analysis shows that TCRs are not hard￾wired to engage Arg65/Lys66 in predetermined ways, the ability to
counteract these charges is nonetheless reflected in germ-line loop
sequences. Has evolution imparted this as a way to promote—if not
compel—MHC binding? We addressed this by comparing the se￾quences of human TCR and antibody germ-line CDR loops, using
data for all functional genes from the IMGT database. Antibody
and TCR genes share a common ancestral history, diverging
∼500 Mya (46). Unlike TCRs, antibodies are unrestricted in the
ligands they bind, and we presumed that an imprint of evolution
would be visible in the extent that TCR and antibody germ-line
sequences differ, particularly in the CDR1/CDR2 germ-line loops
that in TCRs complement positive charges on the A2 α1-helix.
We first looked at the overall frequency of amino acids that
comprise all four TCR and antibody germ-line loops. As shown in
Fig. 6A, the top five amino acids for antibodies are serine, glycine,
tyrosine, threonine, and asparagine. The physicochemical basis for
antibody enrichment in these amino acids is well understood (47,
48). The distribution in TCR germ-line loops resembles that in
antibodies, but with some distinctions. The top five amino acids are
serine, tyrosine, asparagine, glycine, and notably, glutamate. In￾deed, TCR germ-line loops are twice as negatively charged than
those of antibodies (14% Asp/Glu in TCRs, compared with 7% in
antibodies). The negative charge difference between TCRs and
antibodies is statistically significant as indicated by a χ2 test (29).

6 of 10 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1522069113 Blevins et al.Studies have shown that differences between TCR and antibody
gene sequences are not due to genetic drift (34).
As we have found, when using germ-line loops, TCRs that
bind A2 use negative charges in CDR2β and CDR1α, in that
order of preference, to offset the charge on the A2 α1-helix. We
thus compared TCR and antibody germ-line CDR loops. Previous
antibody/TCR sequence comparisons indicate a VH = Vβ/VL =
Vα equivalence (49). The antibody equivalents to CDR2β and
CDR1α are accordingly CDR2-H and CDR1-L. The amino acid
distributions for these TCR and antibody loops are noticeably
different, particularly in their incorporation of negative charges
(Fig. 6 B and C). Negative charges account for 19% and 8% of
the composition of TCR CDR2β and CDR1α loops, respectively,
compared with 8% and 5% in antibody CDR2-H and CDR1-L
loops. These differences remain if the domain equivalencies are
switched (i.e., VH = Vα and VL = Vβ), if alternative definitions
are chosen for antibody CDR loops, or whether we use the
classical IMGT definition of TCR CDR2β. The strategic en￾richment in negative charges in TCR CDR loops compared
with antibodies suggests evolution has imprinted A2 compatibility
onto TCR germ-line loops.
Discussion
TCRs have long been hypothesized to be biased toward MHC
proteins, but how such a bias can exist alongside TCR structural
adaptability has remained a controversial puzzle. From a struc￾tural and energetic perspective, one challenge is that atomic
contacts between germ-line regions of TCRs and MHC proteins
are not conserved even when the same TCR variable regions and
MHC proteins are compared (22). We expanded on this here by
demonstrating that, in the structural database of TCRs that bind
HLA-A2, not only are there no conserved TCR–MHC contacts,
even those amino acids in TCR germ-line loops that are the least
variable make different contacts or do not contact A2 at all.
These results are consistent with findings that diversified TCRs
can still bind MHC (35), and prompted us to search for a more
fundamental basis for MHC bias based upon compatibility rather
than simply contacts.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
PNAS PLUSThrough a combination of sequence, structural, and biophysical
analyses, we demonstrated that TCR germ-line loops are enriched
in the means to complement a polymorphic hot-spot region on the
α1-helix of the class I MHC protein HLA-A2, consisting of posi￾tively charged residues that are absent from most other HLA-A
alleles, as well as those of HLA-B and HLA-C. Burial of these
charges is required for TCRs to sample peptides effectively, and
without the ability to complement them, their burial would be
highly unfavorable due to the energetic cost of desolvation (26, 27).
Given the high frequency of A2 in human populations (30) and
the recognized role of evolution in shaping TCR genes (34, 50), it is
perhaps not surprising that evolution has enriched for charge
complementarity with A2. Importantly, however, evolution has not
selected for an exact structural solution in how to complement
charges on A2. Negatively charged amino acids are found in ap￾propriate locations in both the germ-line CDR1α and CDR2β
loops, and structures show utilization of both, with some bias toward
CDR2β. Moreover, hypervariable CDR3α loops can also perform
this role. We suggest this reflects a built-in “permissiveness” in TCR
binding. From the perspective of the TCR, the different solutions
that are possible permit structural adjustments when optimizing
binding with a particular peptide/A2 complex. From the perspective
of the MHC, a large array of receptors will be available to engage
A2, including those that lack the necessary structure and chemistry
in the hypervariable CDR3α loop. Thus, evolution seems to not
only have imparted MHC compatibility into the TCR repertoire, it
has done so in a manner that allows structural adaptability and
facilitates the cross-reactivity needed for immune function.
Does charge complementarity reflect an inherent MHC bias
within TCRs? Interactions between charges in proteins are not
always favorable, and indeed, our results show a range of free
energies for complementing the positively charged Arg65/Lys66
pair on A2. Thus, charge complementarity will not always drive
binding. However, because uncompensated buried charges will
always be energetically worse than even an unfavorable charge–
charge interaction, charge complementarity will influence what
structures are adopted, i.e., the structural specificity of a TCR–
pMHC complex. This is apparent when the structures for TCRs in
complex with A2 are compared with TCRs in complex with other
human class I MHC proteins: although there is structural variation
in how TCRs bind A2, it is less than seen with TCRs that bind
other human class I MHCs. However, does this imply a bias?
Consider the outcome if negative charges in CDR2β and CDR1α
were absent from the TCR repertoire: due to increased reliance
on CDR3α, fewer TCRs would be compatible with A2. The
greater restriction on the sequence and structure of the CDR3α
loop would in turn have a negative impact on the number and type
of peptides that could be recognized when presented by A2. The
presence of charge complementarity between TCR germ-line
loops and the A2 α1-helix therefore increases the number of TCRs
available to bind, translating into an intrinsic bias.
As noted above, the distinctive charged surface of A2 and its high
prevalence in human populations make it an ideal candidate for
identifying contributors to MHC bias. Other features likely exist in
the TCR genes that promote compatibility with MHC proteins (our
analysis of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges hints at this; for ex￾ample, interactions with Lys146 and Glu166 on the A2 α2-helix may
deserve closer scrutiny). As demonstrated here, however, these
other features need not drive binding, and each one alone need not
strictly specify a binding orientation. We suggest, however, that they
do allow structural and chemical complementarity to occur when
thermodynamic drivers exist elsewhere in the interface, and acting
together they could strongly influence binding modes. An example
may be the interaction of the strongly conserved Tyr48 in CDR2β
with Arg65 on A2. This interaction is energetically neutral, and
indeed is not present in all structures with A2. However, in cases
where it is present, it may act as a “check” on the TCR binding
mode. The removal of such checks or other sites encoding com￾patibility from the repertoire would be expected to impact TCR
recognition, explaining the negative impact on T-cell development
seen with mutation of Tyr48β in mice (36).
Because our findings suggest a bias in the true sense of the
word, they are broadly compatible with other results. For example,
they do not exclude the possibility of TCRs binding structurally/
chemically compatible non-MHC ligands, or instances in which an
evolved bias is “overruled” due to unique features in a ligand or
TCR. They do not rule out a role for coreceptor or thymic se￾lection in shaping the repertoire to help select for TCR–MHC
compatibility. Following this logic, it remains possible that the
more restricted positioning of TCRs over A2 that emerges from
charge complementarity may be functionally significant.
Materials and Methods
TCR and Antibody Sequence Analysis. The sequences of all functional, naturally
occurring, nonredundant human TCR and antibody genes were taken from the
IMGT database (51). Germ-line CDR loops were selected based on the IMGT
CDR definitions. For TCRs, TCR–pMHC crystallographic structures were used
ensure CDR loop definitions adequately matched structural observations. For
the TCR CDR2β loop, one N-terminal residue and three C-terminal residues
were added to the loop definition to better fit structural observations as
shown in Fig. S1A. Due to variations in the numbering of TCR residues, a
uniform numbering was assigned to all HLA-A2–binding TCRs, using the B7
TCR [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1BD2] as a template (52). The numbering
scheme also applies to CDR loops of the most common length. The CDR1α loop
is comprised of residues 26–31, CDR2α loop is residues 49–55, CDR1β is residues
27–31, and CDR2β is residues 48–57. TCRs recognizing human class I MHC
proteins were identified via PDB and the IMGT database. For sequence logos,
unique sequences matching the most commonly used loop length were used
as shown in Table S1. Sequence logos were created using the online WebLogo
server at weblogo.berkeley.edu (53). Loop compositions in Fig. 6 used IMGT
sequences for all functional TCR and antibody genes.

8 of 10 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1522069113 Blevins et al.TCR–pMHC Structure Analysis. Structures of human αβ TCRs in complex with
human class I MHC proteins were identified and downloaded from PDB.
Contacts between TCR and MHC were identified using ContPro (54), the
PyMOL script DistancesRH, and Accelrys Discovery Studio 4.1, using a 4.5-Å
distance cutoff. We used this more liberal cutoff distance (compared with
the more common 4 Å) to better account for coordinate error and the
nonstatic nature of the protein interfaces (55, 56). TCR–pMHC complexes
were superimposed by the PyMOL pair fit function, fitting the α carbon of
residues 1–180 of the MHC protein. The two orientations of the DMF4 TCR
over the nonamer and decamer MART-1 peptides bound to HLA-A2 were
analyzed separately (referred to as DMF4[9] and DMF4[10]). Hydrogen bonds
were identified using Discovery Studio, using a 3.4-Å cutoff and a DHA angle
range of 90–180°. Charge–charge interactions were identified using Discovery
Studio with a maximum distance of 5.6 Å. This distance is greater than the
4.0 Å sometimes used for formal salt bridges, but allows for a better ac￾counting of long-distance interactions and helps account for coordinate
error and protein dynamics. In the TCR contact analysis, the structure with
the C7 TCR (53) was omitted as electron density for many of the key side
chains was missing. Center of mass calculations were performed for the
TCR variable domains and MHC peptide-binding domains using the PyMOL
center of mass script. Shape complementarity values (Sc statistic) were
computed with the Sc program (37). Solvent-accessible surface areas were
calculated using Discovery Studio with a 1.4-Å radius probe. Percent acces￾sible surface areas in Table S2 are relative to the surface area of an argi￾nine or lysine in an extended Ala-X-Ala tripeptide. TCR crossing and
incident angles were calculated as described (58, 59). Literature references
for each TCR–pMHC complex analyzed are listed in Table S4.
Continuum Electrostatics Calculations. Desolvation and electrostatic in￾teraction energies for Arg65 and Lys66 of HLA-A2 were performed using
finite-difference Poisson–Boltzmann methods as previously described (32),
with minor modifications as listed below. Methods of computing energies
followed those of Sheinerman and Honig (43). Briefly, TCR structures were
imported into Accelrys Discovery Studio. Hydrogen atoms were added and
the structure’s energy minimized to optimize hydrogen placement, using
1,000 steps of steepest descent followed by 300 steps of conjugate gradient
minimization using the CHARMM22 force field. Electrostatic potentials were
calculated using Delphi 4.11 (26) as implemented in Discovery Studio. Sol￾vent dielectric was set to 80 and the interior dielectric set to 10. The value of
10 for an interior dielectric was chosen based on our previous work (32) and
is consistent with values used to reproduce experimental observations in
other systems (60). We note, however, that although absolute values will
change, our overall conclusions will be unaffected by the use of other in￾terior dielectrics (see ref. 32, table 4). Ionic strength was set at 0.15 M. Grid
spacing was 0.5 Å per point. Focusing was used, moving from 50% to 90%
grid occupancy in two steps. Calculations performed on TCR–pMHC com￾plexes and free pMHC molecules used the same grid mapping.
Desolvation penalties, intermolecular coulombic interactions, and intra￾molecular coulombic interactions were calculated from electrostatic potentials
computed with partial charges present only on the atoms of Arg65 or Lys66 (Fig.
5B). Desolvation penalties were computed as the difference between the charg￾ing free energies of the TCR–pMHC complexes and the unbound pMHC. In￾termolecular coulombic interaction energies were calculated as the interaction of
the TCR–pMHC potentials with the full set of TCR partial charges. Intramolecular
coulombic interaction energies were calculated similarly, except the calculation
involved the full set of pMHC partial charges except those for Arg65 or Lys66, and
is reported as the difference between calculations with pMHC potentials calcu￾lated for the free and TCR-bound states (43). Coulombic interaction energies
reported in Fig. 5B are the sum of the intermolecular and intramolecular terms.
Energies of kT reported by Delphi were converted to free energy values at 298 K.
Structures for the pMHC molecules in Fig. 5A were of the Tax peptide bound to
HLA-A2 (61) and an HIV 8-mer bound to HLA-B*5101 (62), and electrostatic sur￾face potentials in this figure were calculated using all formal charges.
Protein Expression and Double-Mutant Cycles. Soluble constructs for the A6 and
DMF5 TCRs and HLA-A2 were generated from bacterially expressed inclusion
bodies as previously described (63). TCRs used an engineered disulfide bridge
connecting the constant domains to improve stability (64). DMF5 mutants
were produced by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing.
Peptides were purchased from Chi Scientific. Steady-state binding was mea￾sured with a Biacore 3000 instrument as previously described (63). Experiments
were performed at 25 °C in 10 mM Hepes, 3 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and
0.005% surfactant P20 at pH 7.4. Refolded and purified TCR were coupled to
the surface of a CM5 sensor chip via amine linkage to a density of ∼1,500 RU.
Double-mutant cycles were performed and analyzed as described pre￾viously (40). Briefly, soluble wild-type followed by mutant pMHC complexes
were injected over wild-type or mutant TCR surfaces in a series of increasing
concentration points until steady-state binding was attained. Each injection
series was repeated twice. In any one experiment, three flow cells were used:
a blank, wild-type TCR, and mutant TCR. The output of one single experi￾ment thus consisted of two sets of all four measurements that comprise a
double-mutant cycle as shown in Fig. 3. Data were processed in BiaEvalua￾tion 4.1, and all eight datasets were simultaneously analyzed in OriginPro 7
with a custom global fitting function. The wild-type and mutant TCR surface
densities and the three ΔΔG values that make up the cycle were global fit￾ting parameters. Errors were propagated using standard statistical error prop￾agation methods (63). High-affinity variants of the DMF5 TCR were used to
facilitate the analysis (65). For analysis of Tyr48β–Arg65 pair, the D26αY/L98βW
double mutant was used. For analysis of D26α–Arg65 pair, the L98βW single
mutant was used. We note that, excluding the sites of the two mutations, the
structures of the high-affinity and wild-type DMF5 TCR complexes are essentially
identical (13, 65). The utilization of affinity-enhancing mutations is unlikely
to impact the double-mutant cycle experiments, owing to the structural
similarities and the robust nature of double-mutant cycle analysis (40, 41).
