The extracellular interferon g receptor a-chain comprises two immunoglo￾bulin-like domains, each with ®bronectin type-III topology, which are
responsible for binding interferon g at the cell surface. The epitopes on
the human receptor recognized by three neutralizing antibodies, A6,
gR38 and gR99, have been mapped by homolog scanning mutagenesis. In
this way, a loop connecting b-strands C and C0 in the N-terminal domain
was identi®ed as a key component of the epitopes bound by A6 and
gR38, whereas gR99 binds to the C-terminal domain in a region including
strands A and B and part of the large C0
E loop. The epitope for A6 was
con®rmed in a crystal structure of a complex between a recombinant
N-terminal receptor domain and the Fab fragment from A6, determined
by X-ray diffraction to 2.8 AÊ resolution. The antibody ±antigen interface
buries 1662 AÊ 2 of protein surface, including 22 antibody residues from
®ve complementarity determining regions, primarily through interactions
with the CC0 surface loop of the receptor. The ¯oor of the antigen bind￾ing cavity is formed mainly by residues from CDR L3 and CDR H3
while a surrounding ridge is formed by residues from all other CDRs
except L2. Many potential polar interactions, as well as 13 aromatic side￾chains, four in VL, six in VH and three in the receptor, are situated at the
interface. The surface of the receptor contacted by A6 overlaps to a large
extent with that contacted by interferon-g, in the ligand ± receptor com￾plex. However, the conformation of this epitope is very different in the
two complexes, demonstrating that conformational mobility in a surface
loop on this cytokine receptor permits steric and electrostatic complemen￾tarity to two quite differently shaped binding sites.

229 residues, a single transmembrane region of 22
residues, and a cytoplasmic domain of 221 resi￾dues. The crystal structure, recently reported
(Walter et al., 1995), of recombinant extracellular
human IFNgR in a 2:1, receptor:ligand complex
with IFNg revealed in atomic detail how the extra￾cellular portions of two IFNgR chains bind the
homodimeric (2  17 kDa) IFNg at the cell surface.
Other cytokine receptor superfamily members
whose crystal structure in a complex with a recep￾tor ligand have also been reported include the
receptors for GRH (De Vos et al., 1992), PRL
(Somers et al., 1994), EPO (Livnah et al., 1996), IL-1
(Schreuder et al., 1997; Vigers et al., 1997) and TF
(Banner et al., 1996). An additional transmembrane
IFNgR b-chain (or accessory factor), however, is
necessary for species speci®c signal transduction
by IFNg (Marsters et al., 1995), and it is not yet
clear from a structural viewpoint how this b-chain
interacts with the IFNg± (IFNgR)2 complex.
There is currently great interest in the mechan￾isms of ligand recognition by members of the cyto￾kine receptor superfamily. The cytokine binding
sites are, in several cases, formed by a small set of
closely spaced surface loops that extend from a
b-sheet core, much like the antigen binding sites on
antibodies. Crystallographic studies on GRHR,
PRLR, IFNgR and EPOR have indicated that the
ability of these receptors to speci®cally recognize
different ligands may arise through sequence
diversity in the surface loops, as well as through
local and global conformational diversity
(Kossiakoff et al., 1994). In the work described
here, recognition of the extracellular IFNgR by
three surrogate ligands, in the form of neutralizing
mAbs (denoted A6 (Aguet & Merlin, 1987), gR38
and gR99 (Garotta et al., 1990)) has been studied.
These three mAbs inhibit binding of human IFNg
to native and recombinant human IFNgR. It was,
therefore, of interest to enquire how the structural
epitopes bound by these neutralizing mAbs, and
the mechanisms of their recognition by the recep￾tor, are related to those involved in IFNg binding.
The extracellular IFNgR monomer comprises
two domains (domain D1 from residue 14-102, and
domain D2 from residue 114-221){, each resem￾bling an Ig fold with FBN-III topology. In each
domain, the chain forms two antiparallel b-sheets
composed of b-strands A, B, E and G, F, C and C0
(Figure 1). The interdomain angle between D1 and
D2 is approximately 120 in the IFNgR, which is
similar to that seen in TF, but greater than the
90 angle observed between the corresponding
domains in the GRHR, the PRLR and the EPOR.
The domain linker in the IFNgR chain (residues
103 to 113) includes a helical turn, similar to that
seen in GRHR, PRLR, TF and EPOR, but contains
a cysteine residue (Cys105) that forms a disul®de
bridge with Cys150 located in the BC loop in D2.
This disul®de is buried in the extensive interdo￾main interface.
Equivalent residues on each extracellular IFNgR
chain bind identical 2-fold related surfaces on the
IFNg homodimer in the 1:2, ligand:receptor com￾plex. These include residues in the CC0 and EF
loops, and the F and G b-strands of D1, the helical
turn in the linker, and the BC and FG loops from
D2. As noted earlier (Walter et al., 1995), aromatic
receptor residues (Tyr49, Trp207 and Trp82) con￾tribute almost one-third of the total buried surface
area (total 960 AÊ 2
) in each binding interface.
Here, the epitopes on the extracellular human
IFNgR recognized by A6, gR38 and gR99 have
been characterized by homolog scanning mutagen￾Figure 1. Ribbon representation of the extracellular

fragment derived from A6 and a recombinant D1
of the IFNgR (residues 1 to 108 with a Cys105Ser
mutation, and an additional two residues (Val-Pro)
at the N terminus, denoted here IFNgR1-108). A6
and gR38 were shown earlier to bind overlapping
epitopes located in IFNgR1-108
, whereas gR99 recog￾nizes an epitope within D2 between residues 100
and 229 (Williams et al., 1995). In the A6 Fab￾IFNgR1-108 complex reported here, the CDRs of the
antibody interact primarily with the CC0 surface
loop of the receptor. The antibody epitope thus
overlaps to a large extent the site contacted by
IFNg, in the ligand ± receptor complex. However,
the conformation of this surface loop is quite differ￾ent in the two complexes, providing an example of
how local conformational mobility in a cytokine
receptor permits steric and electrostatic comple￾mentarity to two quite differently shaped binding
sites.
Results and Discussion
Production and mutagenesis of IFNgR
The human extracellular IFNgR residues 1 to 229
(IFNgR1-229
), with a c-myc peptide tag (Evan et al.,
1985) fused to its C terminus, was produced by a
secretion expression system in Escherichia coli. The
af®nities of this protein to the mAbs A6, gR38 and
gR99, as well as to the ligand IFNg10 (DoÈbeli
et al., 1988), were compared with those for wt
extracellular IFNgR produced in a baculovirus
expression system (Gentz et al., 1992) using a SPR
biosensor (Pharmacia BIAcore2) (data not shown).
The E. coli-derived IFNgR1-229 has a slightly lower
apparent af®nity for mAbs A6 and gR99; however,
in all cases the differences between E. coli and
insect cell-derived receptor are less than twofold.
The absence of glycosylation in the E. coli-derived
protein is one possible reason for the small differ￾ences observed.
The mAbs A6, gR38 and gR99 recognize confor￾mational epitopes on the human IFNgR, but do not
bind mouse IFNgR signi®cantly or the reduced
and denatured human IFNgR (Aguet & Merlin,
1987; Garotta et al., 1990). Homolog scanning
mutagenesis was therefore used to map the epi￾topes recognized by A6, gR38 and gR99 on the
receptor surface. For this purpose, the panel of
mutants shown in Table 1 were prepared using the
E. coli secretion expression system. A comparison
of the human and mouse extracellular receptor
sequences is given in Figure 2.
The CD spectra of all mutants had shapes simi￾lar to that of wt receptor, with a small positive
maximum at 235 nm and a large negative maxi￾mum at 195 nm, essentially as described earlier for
the wt receptor (Fountoulakis & Genz, 1992). This
indicates that the mutants and wt have similar
folds. This conclusion is also supported by the
observation that all N-terminal domain mutants
were bound normally by gR99, whereas all recep￾tors with mutations in the C-terminal domain were
recognized normally by A6, as assayed using the
BIAcore instrument.
The effects of the mutations on binding to A6,
gR38 and gR99 are summarised in Table 1.
Mutants 6 and 8 show a greatly reduced af®nity
for A6 and gR38, mainly due to a decrease in
apparent kon on the biosensor surface (data not
shown). The region altered in mutant 6 corre￾sponds to the CC0 loop seen at the interface in the
crystal structure of the A6 ± IFNgR1-108 complex,
described below. This CC0 loop is, therefore, cor￾rectly identi®ed by mutagenesis as an important
part of the A6 conformational epitope.
Beneath the CC0 loop in the A6 ± IFNgR1-108 crys￾tal structure is a second loop (the EF loop) formed
by residues that are altered in mutant 8. As dis￾cussed below, the A6 Fab makes only a few con￾tacts with this EF loop and their disruption may
not be suf®cient to account for the observed loss of
af®nity of mutant 8 with A6. Alternatively, the EF
loop may exert an in¯uence on the conformations
accessible to the CC0 loop when bound to A6,
which may be critically altered in mutant 8. The
mutagenesis results con®rm that the gR38 and A6
epitopes overlap (Williams et al., 1995), and show
that both are located in the region of the CC0 loop.
However, small differences in apparent koff values
between the binding of individual mutants by
these antibodies were observed, although the mag￾nitude of the effects were small (4factor of 2; data
not shown). Thus the receptor epitopes bound by
A6 and gR38 are very closely related, but not iden￾tical.
Mutants 13, 14 and 21 are severely disabled in
their af®nity for gR99 (Table 1), whereas, with the
exception of mutants 18 and 20, where the KD
values are reduced by a factor of 5 to 6 in this
assay, the other mutants show close to wt af®nity.
The residues altered in mutants 13, 14 and 21 are
spatially adjacent on one face of the receptor,
de®ned by strands A and B and part of the large
C0
E loop of the C-terminal Ig-like domain. As
shown in Figure 3, this region of the receptor does
not appear to overlap the surface buried in the
IFNg-IFNgR complex. Nevertheless, the intact
mAb (Garotta et al., 1990) and single-chain Fv frag￾ment derived from gR99 (Bridges et al., 1996) were
shown by radioimmunoassay to inhibit IFNg bind￾ing to native receptor on human Raji cells. From a
structural viewpoint, the mechanism of inhibition
by gR99 is unclear. We note, however, that model￾ing studies (Walter et al., 1995) have suggested that
acidic residues near the C0
E loop (altered in
mutant-21) may be important in binding basic resi￾dues in the C-terminal tail of IFNg. The C-terminal
IFNg residues beyond 122 extend into the solvent
and from the crystal structure do not appear to be
important for receptor binding. However, bio￾chemical assays have shown that Arg129 is an
essential part of a functionally important C-term￾884 Epitopes on the Interferon  Receptorinal IFNg sequence that is required for full receptor
binding af®nity (Haelewyn et al., 1997).
Crystal structure of the A6-IFNgR1-108 complex
The structure of the complex was solved by mol￾ecular replacement techniques using search models
for the Fv and Fchl parts of the Fab as described in
Materials and Methods. A summary of the re®ne￾ment results is given in Table 2. Interpretation of
the density of the receptor domain was greatly
aided by the availability of a model for this
domain (CheÂne et al., 1995; le Du et al., unpub￾lished data). The ®nal distribution of the main￾chain dihedral angles is presented in a Ramachan￾dran plot in Figure 4. Over 97% of the non-glycine
and non-proline residues lie inside favored or
additional allowed regions as de®ned in PRO￾CHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), which is slightly
better than the distribution expected for a structure
re®ned to 2.8 AÊ resolution.
The re®ned model comprises 442 of the 540 resi￾dues present in the complex and 30 well-deter￾mined water molecules (see Table 2). The structure
is well de®ned for the Fv part of the Fab fragment,
for most of the receptor domain and particularly
for the antibody ± antigen interface, which is the
area of prime interest in this study. However, a
large fraction of the residues in the Fchl part (85 of
203) are very poorly de®ned in the electron density
and have been removed from the model. The Fchl
chain segments that have been retained in the
model still have much higher average B-factors
than the other three domains (Table 2). Neither
domain in Fchl is involved in any crystal contacts
and, given their small interface with the Fv
domains, considerable positional disorder is indi￾cated. As apparent from omit maps (see Materials

Response curves consistent with a 1:1 interaction model were only obtained when the mAbs were immobilized (O'Shannessy &
Winzor, 1996). The standard deviation in the kinetic parameters was <25% between repeated analyses with different preparations of
the same protein. The changes introduced into each mutant are indicated. For example, in mutant 1, T14V indicates that residue T14
has been changed to V14. In mutant 6, (G50V51K52), indicates that residues G50V51K52 have been deleted. In mutant 13 i117R
indicates that Arg was inserted after residue 117, and in mutant 19 i164G indicates that Gly was inserted after residue 164 (see
Figure 2). Mutants 1 to 11 bound with wt af®nity to gR99, whereas mutants 12 to 26 bound with wt af®nity to A6 and gR38.
Epitopes on the Interferon  Receptor 885and Methods), the density resulting from aver￾aging over all populated states of these disordered
domains still makes a signi®cant contribution to
Bragg scattering. A single structural model with
isotropic B-factors is inadequate to model this den￾sity and the somewhat high R-factor is likely to
result from not modeling this residual density. The
average B-factors of the Fv domains (47 AÊ 2
) and of
the receptor antigen (59 AÊ 2
) are consistent with an
intrinsic B-factor of 58 AÊ 2 of these crystals.
The antigen±antibody interface
As illustrated in Figure 5, the CC0 loop of the
receptor domain reaches into the shallow antigen
binding site formed by the CDRs of the A6 Fab
fragment. The total surface area buried on complex
formation is 1662 AÊ 2 (Figure 6), which is similar to
that reported for other antibody ±protein antigen
complexes (Davies & Cohen, 1996). The HyHEL5±
HEL complex constitutes a comparable example
with a buried surface area of 1761 AÊ 2 (calculated as
described in Figure 6). Examination of the crystal
contacts shows that the receptor domain also
makes quite an extensive crystal contact with
another symmetry-related VH domain. Compared
to the recognition interface formed by the CDRs as
described below, the buried surface area in this
crystal contact is about 30% smaller (1200 AÊ 2
) and
only a few CDR residues on the outside face of VH
contribute.
The spatial arrangement of the many residues
contributing to the extensive antigen ±antibody
interface is shown in Figures 7 and 8 and the resi￾due ± residue interactions are schematically rep￾resented in Figure 6. The contact surface of the
mAb A6 comprises 22 residues from ®ve CDRs, 13
and 9 residues from VH and VL, respectively. The
¯oor of the binding cavity is formed mainly by
residues from CDR L3 and CDR H3 while the sur￾rounding ridge is formed by residues from all
CDRs except L2. The many potential hydrogen

green, the IFNgR in white (N-terminal domain D1) and yellow (C-terminal domain D2) (see Figure 1). The red and
blue regions are those where changes are introduced in mutant 6 (CC0 loop) and 8 (EF loop) (red), and 13 (strand A),
14 (strand B) and 21 (C0
E loop) (blue) (see Table 1).
886 Epitopes on the Interferon  Receptor bonding interactions observed in the interface
(Table 3) indicate that polar interactions are
important for speci®c antigen recognition (open
bars in Figure 6). In addition, many aromatic resi￾dues located in the interface contribute to van der
Waals contacts between the antigen and the anti￾body (®lled bars in Figure 6). Indeed, 13 aromatic
side-chains are situated at the interface, four in VL
(TyrL30, TyrL91, TrpL92, TrpL96), six in VH
(TyrH32, TrpH52, TrpH53, TyrH58, TyrH99,
HisH100B) and three in the receptor (TyrI49,
TrpI56, TrpI82). The frequent occurrence of aro￾matic residues, particularly Tyr and Trp, in anti￾body combining sites has been noted (Padlan,
1990; Davies & Cohen, 1996).
The epitope of the receptor fragment is discon￾tinuous but 80% of the contact surface occurs with
residues of its CC0 surface loop (I47 to I56). Resi￾dues from the adjacent loop I76 to I84 contribute
only 13%, and only 7% is contributed by residues
I98 and I99, which make a rather loose contact.
The side-chains of TyrI49 and AsnI53 lie adjacent
on one face of the CC0 loop and constitute the part
of the epitope that reaches deepest into the binding
cavity. The hydroxyl group of the buried tyrosine
makes two hydrogen bonds with residues of CDR
H3 and one face of its phenyl group becomes bur￾ied through non-polar contacts with the side-chains
of ArgL32 and TrpL92. One NH bond from the Nd2
atom of the buried AsnI53 is directed towards two
backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues from
CDR L3 (Table 3). The other points to the center of
the six-membered ring of TrpL96 located at the
bottom of the antigen binding site (3.8 AÊ from N to
center of ring) and suggests an NH aromatic ring
hydrogen bond (Levitt & Perutz, 1988). Similarly,
the Nz atom of LysI47 is 3.9 AÊ from the center of
the six-membered ring of TrpL92. Together with
two hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl
groups of TrpL96 and AsnI48 a stereochemically
almost optimal hydrogen bonding pattern results
for this (presumably) ammonium nitrogen. Tight
interactions, which include six hydrogen bonds
(Table 3), are also observed between residues
GlyI50, ValI51 and LysI52 and the CDRs of the
heavy chain. In the whole interface there is no
residual electron density, indicating the absence of
ordered solvent molecules, and this is consistent

The epitope on the IFNgR1-108 domain recog￾nized by A6 largely overlaps the contiguous sur￾face that is recognized by IFNg (Walter et al., 1995).
The overall backbone structures of IFNgR1-108 as
observed in the complexes with mAb A6 and IFNg
are very similar, with the exception of surface loop
(I48 to I54), as illustrated in Figure 9(a). For both
complexes the CC0 loop plays an important role in
recognition fully consistent with the neutralizing
activity of mAb A6. In addition, a signi®cant dis￾placement towards the adjacent CC0 loop is seen

Epitopes on the Interferon  Receptor 887for the EF loop (residues I76 to I79) in the A6
complex.
In the CC0 loop conformation observed here
(Figure 9(b)), the sheet interaction between strands
C and F is extended by one residue, equivalent to
one additional main-chain hydrogen bond com￾pared to the situation seen in the complex with
IFNg. Additional hydrogen bonding interactions
are also indicated between the carboxamide oxy￾gen of AsnI79 (EF loop) and the main-chain NH
groups of ValI51 and LysI52 of the CC0 loop as
well as between the carboxamide groups of AsnI79
and AsnI48. Finally, four intraloop hydrogen
bonds are seen in the CC0 loop conformation
observed in the A6 complex as compared to only
one in the more open conformation observed in
the complex with IFNg. The more-closed confor￾mation observed here may thus be the preferred
conformation of this loop in the unliganded recep￾tor and the conformation seen in the complex with
IFNg may only be induced upon ligand binding.
However, the conformational change of the CC0
loop correlates with a displacement of the adjacent
EF loop (Figure 9(a)) which, in the intact receptor,
also interacts with residues of the C-terminal recep￾tor domain. For the CC0 loop to occur in the closed
conformation in the unliganded receptor would
thus need some adjustment in these interdomain
interactions to accommodate such a 2 to 3 AÊ shift
in the position of the EF loop.
The mAb A6 binds the human IFNgR with high
af®nity, but shows essentially no af®nity to the
rather homologous mouse IFNgR (54% identity).
The three-residue deletion in the CC0 loop of the
mouse receptor (Figure 2) leads to a truncated CC0
loop of the same length and most likely a similar
conformation as observed in TF (Muller et al., 1994;
Harlos et al., 1994). The deleted residues corre￾spond to G50 to K52 and, as seen in Figure 6, this
would inevitably give rise to a signi®cantly
reduced contact area in the epitope. It thus appears
that the much reduced af®nity of the mAb A6 for
Figure 4. Ramachandran plot of the f/c torsion angles of the A6 ± IFNgR1-108 complex produced by PROCHECK
(Laskowski et al., 1993). The glycine residues are indicated by triangles and all other residues by squares. The non￾glycine residues in disallowed regions are labeled.
888 Epitopes on the Interferon  Receptorthe mouse receptor, and mutant 6 of the homolog
scanning mutants (Table 1), results primarily from
the deletion of a signi®cant part of the CC0 loop.
Homology modeling suggests that mutant 8
should have a similar conformation in the EF loop
region to the wild type. The large reduction in af®-
nity of mutant 8 is dif®cult to rationalize in terms
of a perturbation of its direct contacts with A6. An
alternative explanation is an indirect effect of the
mutated residues on the conformation of the CC0
loop. For example, as seen in Figure 9(b), the side￾chain of AsnI79 hydrogen bonds to two backbone
NH groups and possibly to AsnI53. Its replacement
by valine would disrupt these interactions and
thereby destabilize the optimal conformation for
binding A6.
Several examples of the binding of a common
set of amino acid residues by different binding
sites with no or little similarity have been reported.
The structure of the complex between the mono￾meric human growth hormone and its dimeric
receptor showed that the same set of residues on
the two receptor monomers binds to different parts
of the hormone (De Vos et al., 1992). Lescar et al.
(1995) found that two antibodies with low hom￾ology in the variable regions bind to almost the
same epitope of lysozyme. And the anti-hen egg
white lysozyme mAb D1.3 forms complexes with
lysozyme and the anti-D1.3 mAb E5.2 through
essentially the same combining site residues (Fields
et al., 1995). The relevance of these observations
has been discussed by Colman (1997) in the context
of viral antigenic variation. In all the above cases,
the structure of the region recognized by two
different `ligands' is essentially identical apart from
local conformational adjustments. In our case,
however, a rather dramatic conformational change
is observed, in which the tip of the receptor loop
(I51 and I52) is displaced over a distance of 8 AÊ ,
and the two `ligands' (mAb A6 and IFNg) therefore
recognize quite different structures formed by the
same receptor residues (Figure 9).
Comparisons with other Fab structures
The analysis of antibody fragments of known
structure has revealed that, with the exception of
CDR H3, the other ®ve CDRs adopt preferred
main-chain conformations, or canonical structures
(Chothia et al., 1992, 1989). CDR H1 (canonical
structure H1:3) and H2 (canonical structure H2:1)
of A6 have similar sequences and backbone confor￾mations to those in the HIV-1 neutralizing mAb
50.1 (Rini et al., 1993). The backbones (N, Ca
, C0
) of
CDR H1 (H26 to H35) and H2 (H50 to H65) of A6
and 50.1 can be superimposed with an r.m.s. devi￾ation of 0.4 AÊ . CDR H3 of A6 is, however, seven
residues longer than that in Fab 50.1, and these
additional residues largely account for the quite
differently shaped combining sites of these two
mAbs.
Similarly, the backbone atoms of CDRs L1 (L24
to L34; canonical form L1:2) and L2 (L50 to L56) of
A6 can be superimposed together onto L1 and L2
of the anti-lysozyme mAb D1.3 (Fischmann et al.,
1991) with an r.m.s. deviation in the backbone
atoms of 0.35 AÊ . CDR L3 of A6, however, does
not correspond to the canonical forms 1, 2 or 3
identi®ed for L3 loops by Chothia (1989). The
cause is the lack of Pro95 in this k L-chain. The
crystal structure of the Fab from mAb CRIS-1,
reported recently (Guarne et al., 1996), also lacks a
ProL95, and has the same CDR-L3 backbone con￾formation as that seen in A6 (r.m.s. deviation over
L89 to L98 AÊ 0.23 AÊ ), which therefore appears to
constitute a new canonical structure for CDR L3
loops that lack ProL95.
Outlook
The results reported above raise several interest￾ing questions concerning the mechanisms of cyto￾kine and antibody recognition by the IFNgR.
Firstly, the quite different conformations of the CC0
loop seen in the complexes with IFNg and A6
suggest a considerable degree of local backbone
mobility in this region on the IFNgR surface. This
has implications also for those interested in the
homology modeling of cytokine receptors of unde￾termined 3D structure. Another important issue is
the extent to which this local mobility plays a role
in the mechanism of ligand recognition. Unfortu￾nately, no data on the structure or mobility of the
free IFNgR are available. From a structural view￾point, the conformation observed in the complex
with A6 appears more stable in the absence of a
ligand than the open conformation seen in the
complex with IFNg. A simple rigid-body docking
of receptor to ligand, in a lock-and-key-like process
appears unlikely. Secondly, the high concentration
of aromatic residues (Tyr, Trp and His) observed

NH ±aromatic hydrogen bonds, as well as other
effects, in stabilizing the complex. Since the extra￾cellular IFNgR, IFNg and the antibody fragments
can be prepared conveniently, this system should
be amenable to a more detailed structure ± function
analysis, which may shed light on the mechanisms
of ligand± recognition by this receptor.
Materials and Methods
Secretion of the human IFNgR1-229 and mutants
in E. coli.
The extracellular portion of the wt human IFNgR (resi￾dues 1 to 229) was produced by secretion into the peri￾plasm in E. coli HB2151. cDNA encoding the receptor
(Aguet et al., 1988) was ampli®ed by PCR using primers
that include NcoI and NotI sites. The PCR product was
cloned after digestion with NcoI and NotI into the phage￾mid pHEN1 (Hoogenboom et al., 1991) to afford
pOCI656. The receptor is thereby fused via a short -Ala3-
linker at its C terminus to a 14-residue peptide including
an epitope recognized by the anti-c-myc tag mAb 9E10
(Evan et al., 1985).
E. coli HB2151 transformed with phagemid encoding
wt IFNgR1-229 (or mutant) was selected on 2TY agar con￾taining 1% glucose and 100 mg/ml ampicillin at 30C.
Colonies were transferred into 2TY (15 ml) containing
1% glucose and 100 mg/ml ampicillin and grown over￾night at 30C. This medium (5 ml) was added to fresh
2TY medium (500 ml) again with glucose and ampicillin.
After growth at 30C to A550  0.5 to 1, the cells were
pelleted, resuspended in fresh 2TY medium with
100 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.01 mM IPTG. After growth
for 16 hours at 30C and centrifugation, the cells were
resuspended in Tris-HCl (100 mM, pH 8.0), 0.5 M
sucrose and 0.5 mM EDTA (1 ml). The same buffer sol￾ution (9 ml) containing lysozyme (2 mg/ml) was then
added, diluted with a further 20 ml buffer, and then
20 ml water was added together with PMSF (1 mM),
benzamidine (1 mM) and NaN3 (0.04%). After 20 min￾utes, cells and debris were removed by centrifugation
and the supernatant was applied to an immunoaf®nity
column prepared by crosslinking mAb 9E10 to CNBr￾activated Sepharose (Pharmacia). The column was
washed with sodium phosphate (50 mM, pH 7.0, 0.04%
NaN3), and bound protein was eluted with glycine-HCl
(50 mM, pH 2.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.04% NaN3) and
immediately neutralized with sodium phosphate (4 M,
pH 7.0). The eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer
A (Tris-HCl, 25 mM, pH 8.0) and then chromatographed
on a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) with a gradi￾ent from 0 to 65% buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M
NaCl, pH 8). The product was >95% homogeneous on
SDS-PAGE, and wt as well as all mutants gave the cor￾rect N-terminal amino acid sequence. The wt receptor

Epitopes on the Interferon  Receptor 891and mutants 6 and 13 (Table 1) were analyzed by elec￾trospray mass spectrometry, and gave peaks consistent
with the expected masses. The concentration of wt recep￾tor was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis,
from which a molar extinction coef®cient was deter￾mined (e  48,000 Mÿ1 cmÿ1
) at 280 nm (A280). Sedimen￾tation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation using a
20 mM solution of wt IFNgR1-229 in sodium phosphate
buffer (50 mM, pH 7.2) and NaCl (150 mM) gave a mol￾ecular mass of 26.9 kDa (calculated mass  27.587 kDa),
and sedimentation data were consistent with a mono￾meric native form. CD spectra of the wt and mutant
IFNgR proteins were recorded on a Jasco J720 instrument
at a protein concentration of 10 mM in sodium phos￾phate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.2).
Mutagenesis of the IFNgR1-229
General cloning methods were as described by
Sambrook et al. (1989). A total of 24 of the 26 homolog
scanning mutants (Table 1) were prepared by mutagen￾esis of IFNgR1-229 cDNA using PCR methods (Li &
Shapiro, 1993; Chen & Przybyla, 1994). This involved
using mutagenic primers encoding the changes required,
pOCI656 (vide supra) as template, and two invariant
¯anking primers that contain an NcoI site in the 50 pri￾mer and a NotI site in the 30 primer. The ®nal PCR pro￾ducts were digested with NcoI and NotI and ligated
between the corresponding cloning sites in pHEN1. The
remaining two mutants (11 and 26) were also prepared
by PCR methods, using a mutagenic oligonucleotide as
the 30 primer in a standard PCR. Prior to expression,
each mutant (in the expression vector pHEN1) was
sequenced throughout the entire open reading frame, on
both DNA strands, using dye terminator chemistry (Per￾kin Elmer), to con®rm that only the desired nt changes
had been introduced.
BIAcore measurements
Measurements were carried out on a BIAcore instru￾ment (Pharmacia Biosensor) at 25C, with PBS (50 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl) con￾taining 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant-p20 as running buffer.
Protein was immobilized on CM5 sensor chips by ran￾dom amine coupling, as described in the BIAcore
methods manual. Coupling was performed in sodium
acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 4.0) at a protein concentration
of 100 mg/ml (for mAbs) or 24 mg/ml (for receptor). The
level of immobilization corresponded typically to 500 to
1,000 resonance units (RU), which gave rise to Rmax
values on ligand binding of 70 to 200 RU. Around 10,000
RUs of gR99 were immobilized for determination of
active free receptor concentrations from initial binding
rates (mass transport-limited conditions) (Karlsson et al.,
1993). IFNg lacking the ten C-terminal residues
(IFNg10) (DoÈbeli et al., 1988) was used for binding
assays. Protein concentrations in stock solutions in PBS
(phosphate-buffered saline) were determined from A280
measurements after calibration by quantitative amino
acid analysis (1 mg/ml corresponds to: A280  1.7 for
IFNgR1-229; A280  1.35 for mAb; A280  1.0 for IFNg10),
and also for receptor from mass transport-limited initial
binding rates. A ¯ow rate of 10 ml/min and an injection
volume of 30 ml were used routinely. The ¯ow rate and
injection volume for protein determinations under mass
transport-limited conditions were 2 ml/min and 10 ml,
respectively. gR99 and IFNgR surfaces were regenerated
by injection of glycine buffer (10 ml, 0.1 M, pH 2.5). These
conditions were not suitable for regeneration of A6 or
gR38 surfaces. However, the relatively high koff for
receptor from these mAb surfaces enabled repeated use
without injection of complex-destabilizing solutions for
regeneration. The response returned fully to baseline
level within 5 to 15 minutes after the end of sample injec￾tion. Analyte concentrations used for kinetic analyses
were: IFNg10 binding to immobilized IFNgR, 13 assays
in the range 10 to 500 nM; IFNgR binding to immobi￾lized A6, 7 assays in the range 10 to 150 nM; IFNgR
binding to immobilized gR38, 7 assays in the range 20 to
300 nM; and IFNgR binding to immobilized gR99, seven
assays in range 10 to 100 nM. IFNgR mutants 6, 8, 13, 14
and 21 (see Table 1) with reduced af®nity for mAbs were
analyzed at concentrations in the range 0.25 to 28 mM.
Mass transport-limiting gR99 surfaces were calibrated
using 5 to 50 nM wt receptor. The speci®city of the mAb
surfaces was checked by injection of individual domains
of the IFNgR as fusion proteins with thioredoxin (Trx),
prepared as described (Williams et al., 1995). Trx-IFNgR1-
108 bound only to A6 and gR38 mAb surfaces, whereas
Trx-IFNgR100-229 recognised only the gR99 mAb surface.
Speci®city in binding to the IFNgR surface was veri®ed
by injection of IFNg10 in admixture with IFNgR1-229,
Trx-IFNg1-108 or Trx-IFNgR100-229. As expected, only in
the latter two cases was binding observed. No back￾ground binding was observed on injecting receptor or
IFNg10 over a blank CM5 sensor surface.
BIAcore data analysis
Binding curves were analyzed using BIAevaluation
software (version 2.1). KD values were calculated from
the ratio of dissociation (koff) to association (kon) rate con￾stants. The baselines of sensorgrams were set to zero.
The koff values were derived by ®tting a one-minute
period of the dissociation phase to the equation
(O'Shannessy et al., 1993):
R  R1eÿkoff tÿt1
R, response in RUs, t, time in seconds; t1, start time for
dissociation; R1, response at t1. The kon values were cal￾culated by ®tting the response during sample injection to
the equation:

BIAcore analyses of wt IFNgR, in which levels of
immobilized protein and analyte ¯ow rates were varied,
showed that mass transport limitation had insigni®cant
effects on the calculated kinetic parameters. Several
mutants showed koff values >0.02 sÿ1
, and for these
cases a second method of determining KD was used. The
steady state binding response (Req) was measured and
KA (1/KD) was derived from ®tting a plot of Req against
analyte concentration, according to the equation
(Karlsson et al., 1991):

koff could then be calculated by dividing kon by KA.
The use of high levels of immobilized gR99 resulted in
linear initial binding rates (ro) for the receptor in the con￾centration range 5 to 50 nM. The concentrations of active
mutant proteins could then be determined using a cali￾bration curve of ro against concentration for wt receptor
(Karlsson et al., 1993). The active concentration of most
mutants was similar to the concentration determined
spectrophotometrically. The active concentration of
mutants with decreased af®nity for gR99 could not be
determined in this manner.
Formation and purification of the A6
Fab-IFNggR1-108 complex
The mAb A6 was digested with pepsin in sodium
acetate buffer (100 mM, pH 4.0). Upon complete diges￾tion, the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with Tris, and cysteine
(20 mM) was added. After 30 minutes, iodoacetamide
was added (30 mM), and the Fab was puri®ed by Protein
G af®nity chromatography, by elution through a Mono￾Q HR 5/5 column (gradient with buffer A (ethanola￾mine-HCl (25 mM, pH 9.3)), and buffer A plus NaCl (0.5
M)), and ®nally using a Mono-P 5/20 column (gradient
with buffer A, and buffer A with polybufferHCl (Phar￾macia), pH 7.0). The IFNgR1-108 was prepared as
described (Williams et al., 1995), and mixed in 50%

®ltration (Superose-12) eluting with Tris (0.1 M, pH 8),
NaCl (100 mM, EDTA (2 mM), IFNgR1-108 (50 nM) and
NaN3 (0.08% w/v), and concentrated to 20 mg/ml in
Tris (25 mM, pH 8.0), NaCl (25 mM) and EDTA

Crystallization and data collection
Crystals of the complex were grown by the hanging￾drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature and
reached a maximum size of 0.4 mm  0.3 mm  0.3 mm.
Droplets (3 ml) of protein solution mixed with 0.5 ml
reservoir solution were equilibrated against a reservoir
containing 10% (w/v) PEG ME 5000, NaCl (0.5 M) buf￾fered with Bis/Tris (50 mM, pH 5.5). The diffraction data
were collected using an imaging plate detector (MarRe￾search) mounted on a FR591 rotating anode X-ray gen￾erator (Enraf) equipped with focusing mirror optics
(Supper). For data collection, a crystal was soaked for a
few minutes in a buffer containing 30% glycerol in
addition to the components of the reservoir, picked up in
a small loop, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and trans￾ferred into a nitrogen gas stream (120 K; Oxford Cryo￾system) on the Mar goniostat. Indexing and integration
of the diffraction data (400 frames of 0.25, 600 s/frame)
were performed by the MARXDS program package
(Kabsch, 1988). The rather dramatic fall off in the dif￾fracted X-ray intensity beyond 3.2 AÊ resolution made
long exposure times necessary to obtain acceptable stat￾istics in the highest resolution ranges (Table 4). A Wilson
(1949) plot with data between 6.0 and 2.82 AÊ yields an
intrinsic temperature factor of 58 AÊ 2 for these crystals.

unit corresponding to a VM of 3.1 AÊ 3
/Da (Matthews,
1968).
Structure solution and refinement
The structure of the complex was solved by the mol￾ecular replacement method using AMoRe (Navaza,
1994). In order to ®nd the best search models, a sequence
homology search was done comparing the VH, VL, CH1
and CL domain sequences of mAb A6 (Bridges et al.,
1995) with the corresponding domain sequences of Fab
structures available from the Brookhaven Protein Data
Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). For the Fv part the highest
sequence identities were found with VH of Fab 50.1 (80%
identity; entry code 1GGB; Rini et al., 1993) and VL of
Fab B72.3 (65% identity; entry code 1BBJ; Brady et al.,
1992). The search model of this part was constructed
using the in-house modeling program Moloc having its
own force ®eld for energy minimization (Gerber &
MuÈller, 1995). First, the Fv of 50.1 was superimposed
onto the Fv of B72.3 and one domain of each was then
chosen so as to make the chimeric Fv with the highest
homology to A6. Subsequently, all side-chains different
from the mAb A6 sequence were corrected and residual
strain removed through energy minimization using
Moloc. CDR H3 was not present in Fab 50.1 and the cor￾responding residues H95 to H102 of mAb A6 were thus
omitted from the search model. The Fchl part was
assumed to be identical in sequence to that present in
Fab HyHEL-5, entry code 2HFL (Sheriff et al., 1987) and
was thus taken unchanged from this structure. A pre￾liminary model for IFNgR1-108 (missing residues I1 to I10
and I89 to I93) was available from the structure determi￾nation of the IFNg±IFNgR complex (CheÂne et al., 1995;
le Du et al., unpublished data).
Rotation and translation searches were ®rst carried
out separately for the Fv and Fchl models with diffrac￾tion data in the range 10 to 3.5 AÊ . The search with Fv
yielded one clearly best solution. The top rotation func￾tion peak had a signal of 15.9 s (8.9 s for the second
peak) and yielded a correlation coef®cient of 0.32 and
R-factor of 0.51 in the translation function search (0.22
and 0.54 for the second peak). Similar searches with
Fchl alone were inconclusive. However, including the
Fv solution in Fchl translation searches with the top ten
Fchl rotation peaks yielded the best translation function
solution for the top rotation function peak (8.2 s). After
rigid body re®nement in AMoRe the correlation coef®-
cient was 0.37 and the R-factor 0.49. Although the
improvement in the R-factor appeared marginal the cor￾rectness of this solution was strongly supported by the
fact that the Fv and Fchl fragments joined up in pre￾cisely the way expected for a Fab fragment. Attempts to
determine the position of IFNgR1-108 by molecular repla￾cement methods using the known Fv and Fchl positions
in the translation search were unsuccessful.
Subsequent structure re®nement was carried out with
X-Plor (BruÈ nger, 1992b) and model building using Moloc
and O (Jones et al., 1991). Rigid-body optimization of the
four Fab domains (VH, VL, CL and CH1) using diffraction
data between 10 and 3.5 AÊ resolution followed by pos￾itional re®nement and some minor model corrections
reduced the R-factor to 0.40. A subsequent sigma￾weighted electron density map (Read, 1986) revealed

894 Epitopes on the Interferon  Receptor  extra density into which the available IFNgR1-108
model could be positioned unambiguously. Rigid-body
re®nement of the now ®ve domains (VH, VL, CL, CH and
IFNgR1-108) was then followed by a number of cycles
comprising model (re)building, positional re®nement
(using the parameters of Engh & Huber (1991)) and
re®nement of individual B-factors. The free R-factor (5%
of the data) was used to monitor and verify improve￾ments during re®nement of the model. In the course of
this procedure two regions missing in the search model
could be unambiguously built and were added to the
model (CDR H3 and I89 to I93). Major model rebuilding
was indicated in loop I47-I56 of IFNgR1-108 and a simu￾lated annealing omit electron density (BruÈ nger, 1992a)
for this region is shown in Figure 10. Consistent with
the poor signal of the Fchl part observed in the molecu￾lar replacement searches, the B-factors of the atoms of
the CL and CH1 domains re®ned to rather high values.
The electron density for the whole Fchl part was weak,
fragmented in many areas and completely missing for
most residues of surface loops. Therefore, only the best
determined chain segments with continuous electron
density were retained from these two domains (see
Table 2). Another three disordered residues were
removed from the C terminus of the receptor domain.
Finally, a small number of water molecules were
assigned to the strongest difference Fourier peaks on the
surface of the three well-de®ned domains taking hydro￾gen bonding criteria into consideration. A bulk solvent
correction as available in X-Plor was used throughout
re®nement using values of 0.25 AÊ , 0.35 e/AÊ 3 and 50 AÊ 2
for the parameters solrad, solden and the smoothing B￾factor respectively as described in detail by Kostrewa
et al. (1997). The re®ned coordinates have been depos￾ited with the Brookhaven Data Bank, accession code
