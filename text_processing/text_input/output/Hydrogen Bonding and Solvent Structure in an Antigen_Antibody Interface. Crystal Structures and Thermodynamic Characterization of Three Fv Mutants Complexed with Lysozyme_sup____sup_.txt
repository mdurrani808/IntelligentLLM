ABSTRACT: Using site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, and titration calorimetry, we have
examined the structural and thermodynamic consequences of removing specific hydrogen bonds in an
antigen-antibody interface. Crystal structures of three antibody FvD1.3 mutants, VLTyr50Ser (VLY50S),
VHTyr32Ala (VHY32A), and VHTyr101Phe (VHY101F), bound to hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) have
been determined at resolutions ranging from 1.85 to 2.10 Å. In the wild-type (WT) FvD1.3-HEL complex,
the hydroxyl groups of VLTyr50, VHTyr32, and VHTyr101 each form at least one hydrogen bond with the
lysozyme antigen. Thermodynamic parameters for antibody-antigen association have been measured
using isothermal titration calorimetry, giving equilibrium binding constants Kb (M-1) of 2.6 × 107 (VLY50S),
7.0 × 107 (VHY32A), and 4.0 × 106 (VHY101F). For the WT complex, Kb is 2.7 × 108 M-1; thus, the
affinities of the mutant Fv fragments for HEL are 10-, 4-, and 70-fold lower than that of the original
antibody, respectively. In all three cases entropy compensation results in an affinity loss that would
otherwise be larger. Comparison of the three mutant crystal structures with the WT structure demonstrates
that the removal of direct antigen-antibody hydrogen bonds results in minimal shifts in the positions of
the remaining protein atoms. These observations show that this complex is considerably tolerant, both
structurally and thermodynamically, to the truncation of antibody side chains that form hydrogen bonds
with the antigen. Alterations in interface solvent structure for two of the mutant complexes (VLY50S
and VHY32A) appear to compensate for the unfavorable enthalpy changes when protein-protein interactions
are removed. These changes in solvent structure, along with the increased mobility of side chains near
the mutation site, probably contribute to the observed entropy compensation. For the VHY101F complex,
the nature of the large entropy compensation is not evident from a structural comparison of the WT and
mutant complexes. Differences in the local structure and dynamics of the uncomplexed Fv molecules
may account for the entropic discrepancy in this case.
Protein-protein recognition is essential to many biochemi￾cal processes. Factors that contribute to the structure and
energetics of protein-protein interactions include hydrogen
bonds, salt bridges (Chacko et al., 1995), van der Waals
contacts (Ysern et al., 1994; Clackson & Wells, 1995;
Chilkoti et al., 1995; Schreiber & Fersht, 1995), interface
solvent networks (McPhalen & James, 1988; Bhat et al.,
1994), solvent exclusion (the hydrophobic effect), and
conformational changes associated with the binding reaction
(Colman et al., 1987; Bhat et al., 1990, 1994). In addition
to their intrinsic interest, antigen-antibody complexes
represent excellent model systems for studying the structure
and thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions in
general. Crystallographic structures of several complexes
of antibodies, or antibody fragments, bound to protein
antigens are available, and the kinetic and thermodynamic
binding parameters have been determined for some of these
complexes. The crystal structure of the anti-hen egg white
lysozyme (HEL)1 antibody, FabD1.3, bound to HEL, shows
that ∼700 Å2 of surface area is buried on both the antibody
and antigen upon complex formation. As well as van der
Waals contacts, hydrogen bonds that bridge antibody and
antigen contribute to the binding energy and structural
specificity of the complex (Amit et al., 1986; Fischman et
al., 1991). Similar observations have been made for other
antibody-antigen complexes including those with the fol-

(Sheriff et al., 1987; Padlan et al., 1989; Chitarra et al., 1993;
Braden et al., 1994, 1996; Lescar et al., 1995). Since both
the number and the local environment of antigen-antibody
hydrogen bonds vary from complex to complex, the contri￾bution of individual hydrogen bonds to antigen-antibody
complex formation is a matter of great interest. It is still
not clear how the strength of hydrogen bonds in a protein￾protein interface varies with the relative geometry of the
interacting groups, the local chemical environment, and how
these hydrogen bonds can influence the dynamic behavior
of neighboring groups.
With the aim of increasing our structural understanding
of antigen-antibody energetics, we have determined the
crystal structures of three mutants of the Fv fragment (a
heterodimer consisting of only the light and heavy chain
variable domains, VL and VH) of D1.3 bound to its protein
antigen HEL. These mutants were designed to disrupt
hydrogen bonds between the antigen and antibody. The
structure of the WT FvD1.3-HEL complex is shown in
Figure 1. In the present study, we have mutated three
FvD1.3 tyrosine residues that form hydrogen bonds with
HEL. These hydrogen bonds are shown in Figure 2. The
WT FvD1.3 fragment binds HEL with an affinity (Kb ) 2.7
× 108 M-1
) equal to that of the Fab and the intact
immunoglobulin (Bhat et al., 1994). This reaction has been
shown to be enthalpically driven (∆H ) -90 kJ‚mol-1
) with
an opposing entropic term (T∆S ) -42 kJ‚mol-1
). The
crystal structure of FvD1.3 bound to HEL, determined at
1.8 Å resolution (Bhat et al., 1994), reveals a large number
of water molecules in the Fv-HEL interface that probably
contribute significantly to the enthalpy of complex formation
(Figure 1). Calorimetric measurements of FvD1.3-HEL
binding at reduced water concentration support this hypoth￾esis (Goldbaum et al., 1996). These experiments involved
addition of cosolutes such as glycerol, ethanol, dioxane, and
methanol in order to reduce the effective water activity. In
accord with the concept that the interface water molecules
are important for complex stability, it was found that the
enthalpies of reaction as well as the association constants
decreased with decreasing water activity. The fact that many
water molecules reside in the protein-protein interface also
aids rationalization of the opposing entropic term. Interface
water molecules that are not ejected into the bulk solvent
upon binding cannot contribute to the hydrophobic effect.
Moreover, interface water molecules that are “recruited” from
the bulk solvent during the binding reaction provide a
negative contribution to the hydrophobic effect. Thus, in
addition to protein-protein hydrogen bonds, we were also
interested in observing how this network of interface water
molecules responds to the substitution of interface amino
acids. The thermodynamic consequences of the mutations
were analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry which
enabled determination of Kb, ∆H°, and T∆S. We will
address how alterations in the following factors induced by
site-directed mutagenesis affect the structure and energetics
of protein-protein complex formation in this system: (i)
hydrogen bonding, (ii) van der Waals contacts, (iii) confor￾mation of antigen and antibody, (iv) mobility of antigen and
antibody, and (v) solvent structure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents. All chemicals were of analytical grade. Re￾striction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were pur￾chased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA).
Radiolabeled [35S]dATP was obtained from Amersham Corp.
Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 380B DNA synthe￾sizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Site-Directed Mutagenesis. For mutagenesis of the D1.3
VL region, a 441 bp EcoRI fragment was transferred from
the pUC19-based bacterial expression vector pSW1-VHD1.3-
FIGURE 1: Space-filling model of the FvD1.3-HEL complex. The
interface between FvD1.3 VL (yellow), VH (blue), and lysozyme
(white) is highly solvated (water oxygen atoms drawn as green
spheres). VHTyr32 and VLTyr50, in red, are partially visible on
the left and right side of the interface, respectively. VHTyr101 is
buried in the interface and is obscured by other atoms. Drawn with

mutagenesis of the VH region, a 477 bp HindIII fragment
from pSW1-VHD1.3-VKD1.3 was subcloned in M13mp19.
Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was carried out
as described (Kunkel et al., 1987) with a MutaGene M13 in
vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) to introduce
the VLY50S, VHY32A, and VHY101F mutations. All muta￾tions were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing
method (Sanger et al., 1977) using a Sequenase version 2.0
kit (USB, Cleveland, OH). For religation into the FvD1.3
expression vector, the mutated VL gene was restricted with
EcoRI and the VH gene with HindIII.
Expression and Purification of FV fragments. All three
mutants were prepared from the culture supernatants of
transformed Escherichia coli BMH 71-18 cells as described
(Ward et al., 1989; Ysern et al., 1994). Briefly, recombinant
clones were resuspended in 10 mL of Terrific broth (Tartof
& Hobbs, 1987) containing 100 µg‚mL-1 ampicillin and 1%
(w/v) glucose to repress FvD1.3 expression. The cultures
were incubated at 37 °C under agitation to an absorbance of
1.0 at 600 nm. The cells were then pelleted by centrifuga￾tion, washed twice with medium, and resuspended in 500
mL of Terrific broth containing 100 µg‚mL-1 ampicillin and
0.1% (w/v) glucose. This glucose concentration is high
enough for cells to grow normally, yet low enough to permit
efficient induction following its depletion from the medium
as a result of bacterial metabolism. The cultures were grown
at 37 °C to an absorbance of 1.0, and isopropyl â-thioga￾lactoside (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) was added
to a final concentration of 1.0 mM. After further incubation
at 37 °C for 4 h, the bacteria were pelleted and the FvD1.3
mutants were affinity purified from the supernatants using
the anti-D1.3 monoclonal antibody E5.2 (Ysern et al., 1994;
Fields et al., 1995) coupled to Sepharose 4B (about 7.5 mL/L
of culture). Columns were washed with 100 volumes of
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and eluted with
50 mM diethylamine, pH 12. Fractions were immediately
neutralized with 1.0 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and concentrated
using Centricon 3000 spin columns (Amicon, Beverly, MA).
Further purification of FvD1.3 mutants was carried out by
size exclusion chromatography on a ZORBAX GF-250
column (DuPont) in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4
(Boulot et al., 1990). Final yields were typically 0.5-1.0
mg/L of culture.
Crystallography. A small molar excess of HEL (Boeh￾ringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) was added to purified
FvD1.3 mutants, and the complexes were crystallized in
hanging drops by vapor diffusion. Crystallization conditions
were similar to those used for the WT Fv-HEL complex
(Boulot et al., 1990): 15-18% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol)
8000 (Sigma) and 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.0-6.5.
Macroseeding (Thaller et al., 1981) in hanging drops was
used to obtain crystals with dimensions up to 0.4 mm × 0.2
mm × 0.1 mm. X-ray diffraction data were recorded on a
Siemens area detector mounted on either a Siemens or a
Rigaku rotating-anode X-ray generator. Data were indexed,
integrated, and reduced using XENGEN version 2.0 (Howard
et al., 1987). All complexes crystallized isomorphously with
the WT complex in space group C2. Unit cell dimensions
are shown in Table 1. Each structure was refined using
X-PLOR (Bru¨nger, 1992) starting from the WT complex
(PDB accession code 1VFB) with all water molecules
deleted. The first step in each refinement consisted of rigid￾body refinement, treating each of the three polypeptide chains
as an independent rigid unit. Next, an Fo(mutant) - Fc(WT)
difference electron density map was calculated and inspected
in order to confirm the mutation. Refinement then consisted
of (i) modeling the mutation into the electron density, (ii)
an additional stage of rigid-body refinement, (iii) one stage
of simulated annealing starting at a temperature of 3000 K,
and (iv) iterative cycles of positional refinement, temperature
factor refinement, and inspection of electron density maps
(with coefficients 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc) including location
of ordered solvent molecules. An electron density difference
peak was modeled as a water molecule if it was higher than
3.5σ, made contact with at least one potential hydrogen bond
donor or acceptor in the range 2.4-3.4 Å, and remained in
electron density (1σ, 2Fo - Fc) after subsequent refinement.
The solvent structure in the WT FvD1.3-HEL structure was
not used to assist location of water molecules in the mutant
complexes.
Titration Calorimetry. Affinity-purified FvD1.3 mutants
were dialyzed against PBS prior to calorimetry. A phosphate
buffer was used to minimize effects due to any exchange of
protons upon binding to HEL. In a typical experiment, 5
µL aliquots of a 1.00 mM HEL solution were titrated into a
0.05 mM Fv solution at 25 °C, and the evolved heats were
measured with a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter as
described (Wiseman et al., 1989; Schwarz et al., 1993, 1995;
Bhat et al., 1994). The titrations were continued beyond
saturation of the antibody-combining sites to determine any
heat contributions from dilution of the HEL solution upon
its addition to the antibody solution. The heats below the
saturation point were accordingly corrected for any heat of
dilution of the HEL solution. Protein concentrations were
calculated using 1% extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 1.50

exchanged during the titration as described by Wiseman et

experimental error, indicating the absence of significant
proton exchange in the Fv-HEL reactions.
RESULTS
Crystallographic data for the mutant complexes are shown
in Table 1. The maximum resolution of the X-ray data used
in the refinements ranges from 1.85 to 2.10 Å, and the
R-factors of the refined structures range from 0.162 to 0.181.
As shown in Figure 3 and Table 2, the positions of CR atoms
in the mutant structures are very similar to those of the WT
complex, indicating that the substitutions in the complemen￾tarity determining regions (CDRs) do not significantly affect
the conformations of these loops or the relative orientations
of VL, VH, and HEL in the complex. This observation is
consistent with previous crystallographic studies of antibody￾antigen complexes with interface mutations (Tulip et al.,
1992b; Ysern et al., 1994; Chacko et al., 1995). Electron
density difference maps calculated at the start of refinement
are consistent with the amino acid substitutions in each
mutant complex (Figure 4). The calorimetric data for the
mutant complexes are shown in Table 3. Binding constants
for FvD1.3-HEL association (Kb) range from 4.0 × 106 to
7.0 × 107 M-1
.
Structure and Calorimetry of the VLY50S Complex. The
binding constant of VLY50S-HEL is 2.6 × 107 M-1, which
is 10-fold less than that of the WT complex. This affinity
loss corresponds to a ∆∆Gb° of 6.1 kJ‚mol-1 in which an
unfavorable ∆∆H of 8.8 kJ‚mol-1 is partially compensated
by a favorable ∆(T∆S) of 2.7 kJ‚mol-1 (Table 3). Tyr50 of
the antibody VL domain makes one direct hydrogen bond to
an Asp side chain of the lysozyme antigen (FvD1.3 Tyr50
Oη‚‚‚Oδ2 Asp18HEL, 2.7 Å) and also participates in the
interface water network. When VLTyr50 is mutated to Ser,
this direct hydrogen bond is replaced by solvent-mediated
interactions to the HEL side chain (VLSer50 Oγ‚‚‚H2O‚‚‚
H2O‚‚‚Oδ1 Asp18HEL). These two bridging water molecules
occupy some of the volume that was taken up by the
VLTyr50 side chain in the WT structure (Figure 5A). Several
neighboring water molecules are in positions that correspond
closely to those of the WT structure while others are not
observed in the crystal structure probably because of the
lower resolution of this structure compared to the WT crystal
structure. Conformational changes in the vicinity of the
mutation are largest at HEL side chains Asp18 and Asn19sthe
residues that are in closest contact to VLTyr50 of FvD1.3 in
the WT structure (Figure 5A). The largest difference in
atomic positions (1.1 Å) occurs at Asp18 Oδ2. In addition,
the temperature factors of these side chains increase when
VLTyr50 is replaced with Ser (Table 4). As well as losing
a direct hydrogen bond to the lysozyme antigen, several van
der Waals contacts are also lost, which should contribute to
the observed unfavorable enthalpy change (Table 5).
Structure and Calorimetry of the VHY32A Complex. The
side chain of VHTyr32 makes a long potential hydrogen bond
(3.5 Å) with the side chain of lysozyme residue Lys116 and,
like VLTyr50, is involved in a solvent network that bridges
antigen and antibody. Mutation to Ala disrupts the solvent
network but does not affect the conformation or temperature
factors of Lys116HEL (Figure 5B, Table 4). The VHY32A
mutant binds lysozyme with only about 4-fold lower affinity
than that of the WT Fv. In this case the large ∆∆H (17.9
kJ‚mol-1) is almost fully compensated by the entropic term
resulting in the small decrease in affinity (Table 3). As for
FIGURE 3: Superposition of four FvD1.3-HEL structures: WT, VLTyr50Ser, VHTyr32Ala, and VHTyr101Phe. CR atoms plus the side
chains of the relevant interacting residues are shown in stereo. Note the large variation in the position of the HEL C-terminus which has
high temperature factors and weak electron density. See also Table 2.

structure is clear. However, in contrast with VLY50S, only
one van der Waals contact is lost along with the long
hydrogen bond (Table 5). There are two side chains in the
vicinity of the mutation whose mobilities are affected by the
VHY32A mutation. When VHTyr32 is truncated to Ala,
VHArg99 loses stabilizing contacts with VHTyr32 and
becomes more mobile, as indicated by an increase in the
mean temperature factor of side chain atoms from 28 to 40
Å2 (Table 4). A conformational change in VHArg99,
resulting in a maximum atomic displacement of 1.1 Å from
the WT structure, accompanies the temperature factor
increase. In contrast, the mean temperature factor of a
neighboring side chain, VHPhe27, decreases (from 16 to 9
Å2) while the shifts in atomic positions for this side chain
are smaller (<0.5 Å).
Structure and Calorimetry of the VHY101F Complex.
Tyr101 of D1.3 VH is situated near the center of the Fv￾HEL interface and makes two hydrogen bonds with HEL:
VHTyr101 Oη‚‚‚Oδ1 Asp119HEL (2.7 Å) and VHTyr101 Oη‚‚‚N
Gln121HEL (3.0 Å). The effective substitution of the Tyr
hydroxyl group by a hydrogen atom to give the Phe mutant
results in small local atomic shifts. The largest atomic
displacement (0.5 Å) in the interface compared to WT occurs

there are no increases in temperature factors for atoms in
the vicinity of the mutation (Table 4). The calorimetric data
indicate that the unfavorable enthalpy change resulting from
the loss of two interface hydrogen bonds is strongly
compensated by a favorable entropy change (Table 3). This

It is important to note that there is no space for a water
molecule to insert into the interface when the OH group of
Tyr101 is replaced by H. Significantly, the structure shows
that the side chain of Asp119HEL is not left with its hydrogen￾bonding potential unsatisfied in the mutant. Instead,
Asp119HEL forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with
Gln121HEL N (3.2 Å). In the WT structure, the corresponding
distance is 3.8 Å, which is too long to be a hydrogen bond.
DISCUSSION
The FvD1.3 system is particularly suitable for the study
of protein-protein complex energetics and structure. High￾resolution (1.8 Å) crystal structures are known for FvD1.3
both in the free state and bound to its specific antigen HEL
(Bhat et al., 1994). Also, the thermodynamics of the Fv￾HEL association reaction have been analyzed using isother￾mal titration calorimetry (Bhat et al., 1994). The availability
of high-resolution crystal structures of mutant Fv-HEL
complexes enables the quantitation of small, as well as large,
structural changes induced by the mutation. An analysis of
the precision of the crystal structures, as presented below,
sets limits for significance levels pertaining to changes in
atomic positions.

and 0.22 Å (VHY101F). These values agree closely with
the rms deviations in CR positions after superposition of the
mutant and WT complexes (Table 2). Global estimates of
precision, such as the Luzzati analysis, do not provide
information about the precision of specific interactions.
Individual errors may differ greatly from the overall estimate
depending on, for example, the local order and dynamics,
as indicated by temperature factors. In this study, the
availability of refined crystal structures of several single￾site mutants permits an analysis of the precision of specific
interactions. Ignoring localized structural differences due
to the effects of the mutations, we will assume, for statistical
purposes, that each mutant structure represents an indepen￾dent determination of the WT structure. It is then possible,
for example, to calculate standard deviations of individual
hydrogen bond lengths and van der Waals contact distances
in the antibody-antigen interface and thus evaluate whether
a particular structural change is significant. The seven
structures used to obtain the values for the 14 interface
hydrogen bonds shown in Table 6 are the WT complex (Bhat
et al., 1994), the VLTrp92Asp complex (Ysern et al., 1994),
the three complexes presented here, and two unpublished
mutant complexes (VLPhe91Leu, 1.85 Å resolution, R )
0.17, and VHAsn56Ala, 1.83 Å resolution, R ) 0.16). Nine
of these hydrogen bonds have standard deviations e0.10 Å
(Table 6). The smallest standard deviation for an interface
hydrogen bond length, 0.05 Å, occurs at residues with below￾average temperature factors, namely, VHAsp100 (Bmean ) 12
Å2) and Ser24HEL (Bmean ) 14 Å2). In striking contrast, an
interaction with the C-terminus of HEL that was defined as
a hydrogen bond in the WT structure, VLHis30 Nδ1‚‚‚OT
Leu129HEL, varies dramatically in the refined mutant struc￾tures. It is evident from the high temperature factors of
Leu129HEL (Bmean ) 55 Å2
), its poor electron density in all
structures, and its variability in conformation (see Figure 3)
that any stabilizing interaction with D1.3 is transient at best.
With regard to the variation of hydrogen bond lengths in
the interface, this analysis indicates that the VHTyr32 Oη‚‚‚Nú
Lys116HEL interaction is relatively long while the VHTyr101
Oη‚‚‚Oδ1 Asp119HEL interaction is relatively short (Table 6).
In view of the standard deviations and ranges shown in Table
6, analogous statements for the remaining intermediate
hydrogen bonds cannot be made with confidence.

+ +that solvent associated with the protein-protein interface
contributes to the stability of the complex (Bhat et al., 1994;
Goldbaum et al., 1996). The high-resolution crystal structure
of FvD1.3-HEL shows a large number of water molecules
in the interface that provide bridging hydrogen bonds and
occupy what could otherwise be destabilizing voids in the
interface (Figure 1). The plasticity of part of this network
was illustrated in the crystal structure of an FvD1.3-HEL
complex with VLTrp92 substituted for Asp (Ysern et al.,
1994). In that study, truncation of the VLTrp92 side chain
left space which was filled by two water molecules. Other
water molecules in the vicinity of the mutation adjusted
positions slightly, presumably to optimize hydrogen bonds
and van der Waals contacts with the void-filling water
molecules.
Two of the structures presented here, VLY50S and
VHY32A, bound to HEL, also exhibit alterations in local
solvent structure compared to WT. In both cases the solvent
rearrangements are localized, and their effects do not extend
far beyond the vicinity of the mutation. In VLY50S, the
direct hydrogen bond to HEL in the WT structure is lost
and replaced by solvent-mediated interactions (Figure 5A).
A bridging water molecule substituting for a direct hydrogen
bond was observed in an antibody-trisaccharide system
(Bundle et al., 1994; Zdanov et al., 1994). Based on
geometry criteria, namely, the hydrogen bond donor￾acceptor distance and the relative orientation of the interact￾ing groups, the VLY50S hydrogen bond with HEL would
be classified as “strong”. However, ∆∆H for VLY50S
compared to WT is only 9 kJ‚mol-1
. Furthermore, as shown
in Table 5, several van der Waals contacts are lost along
with the hydrogen bond when VLTyr50 is substituted for
Ser. Based on our analysis of the contribution of van der
Waals contacts by VLTrp92 (Ysern et al., 1994), the lost
contacts of Tyr50 could provide an additional ∼8 kJ‚mol-1.
As noted previously, Tyr50 is also involved in hydrogen￾bonding interactions with the interface water network. Thus,
Tyr50 interacts with HEL through a direct hydrogen bond,
several van der Waals contacts, and a solvent network and
would therefore appear to be energetically important. There
are several ways to explain the apparently small difference
in enthalpy between WT and VLY50S: (i) the new bridging
solvent in the Y50S complex provides most of the stabilizing
enthalpy, (ii) the Tyr50 hydrogen bond and/or van der Waals
contacts contribute much less to the enthalpy of the WT
complex than estimated, (iii) the energetics of the unbound
Fv molecules differ substantially, or (iv) a combination of
these. The following discussion of the VHY32A and
VHY101F complexes supports the view that localized bridg￾ing solvent can make a significant enthalpic contribution.
The VHTyr32 Oη‚‚‚Nú Lys116HEL separation of 3.5 Å
would classify this interaction as a relatively weaker
hydrogen bond compared to the above-mentioned VLTyr50
interaction (Table 6). In contrast to the situation for VLY50S,
the ∆∆H for VHY32A compared to WT is large (18
kJ‚mol-1
)sa value which may be expected to correspond
to a strong hydrogen bond. In this case, however, Tyr32 is
also involved in a bridging solvent network which is
completely lost when Tyr is replaced by Ala and is not
compensated by new bridging water interactions. A new
water molecule that occupies some of the space taken up by
the Tyr ring in the WT structure is too distant from HEL to
act as a bridge. Thus, a possible explanation for the large
∆∆H despite the apparently weak hydrogen bond is that the
existing solvent network in the WT complex makes a sizable
contribution to ∆H. This hypothesis could be tested by
substitution of a residue other than Ala in place of Tyr which
might preserve certain elements of the WT solvent network.
Compared to the previous two mutants, an analysis of
VHY101F appears straightforward since there is no solvent
network directly associated with the hydroxyl group of
VHTyr101 in the complex interface. Truncation to Phe
results in an unfavorable ∆∆H of 31 kJ‚mol-1
. In this case
it is clear that two hydrogen bonds are lost, other structural
differences compared to WT are small, and Asp119HEL is
not left with its hydrogen-bonding potential unsatisfied (see
below and Figure 5C). Thus, it is probably valid to assume
that most of the ∆∆H component arises from the loss of the
two hydrogen bonds. The resulting estimate of the contribu￾tion of each hydrogen bond is therefore ∼16 kJ‚mol-1
. Since
hydrogen bonds are essentially electrostatic interactions
between atoms of opposite partial charge, the strength of a
hydrogen bond depends most critically on the hydrogen bond
donor-acceptor distance, the magnitudes of the partial
charges on the donor and acceptor atoms, and the local
dielectric constant. With regard to the dielectric constant,
it is pertinent that the hydrogen bonds between VHTyr101
and HEL are buried in the interface of the complex while
those from VLTyr50 and VHTyr32 are on the periphery
(Figure 1). Thus, it is possible that the hydrogen bonds from
VHTyr101 are elevated in strength compared to those from
VLTyr50 and VHTyr32 due to a lower dielectric constant in
the protein-protein interface compared to the periphery.
However, such an effect is likely to be small since the
FvD1.3-HEL interface is predominantly made up of polar
residues, is highly solvated, and, therefore, should have a
dielectric constant much closer to that of the solvent-exposed
surface. It is unlikely that this protein-protein interface has
electrostatic properties similar to that of a hydrophobic
interior of a folded globular protein where the low dielectric
constant would magnify the strength of hydrogen bonds.
It has been noted that the discrepancy between the apparent
contribution to ∆G of an interaction (∆Gapp) and the intrinsic
∆Gsthe actual energetic contribution of a particular interac￾tion (∆Gint)smay be large when a mutation leaves a charged
hydrogen bond donor or acceptor with its hydrogen-bonding
potential unsatisfied (Fersht, 1988). This point may be
relevant here since three of the hydrogen bonds analyzed in
this study involve one charged residue from HEL. As such,
it is possible that mutation of the corresponding D1.3 partner
in the hydrogen-bonding interaction could have an anoma￾lously large destabilizing effect. Examining each mutant
structure with this possibility in mind, it is apparent that in
no case is the hydrogen-bonding potential of the charged
HEL side chains left unsatisfied. For the VLY50S-HEL
complex, both carboxylate Oδ atoms of Asp18HEL are
hydrogen bonded to interface solvent molecules (Figure 5A).
Likewise, Lys116HEL in the VHY32A complex is within
hydrogen-bonding distance of two water molecules (Figure
5B). Finally, as stated before, Asp119HEL in the VHY101F
complex is involved in an intramolecular hydrogen bond with
the backbone nitrogen of Gln121HEL (Figure 5C). Therefore,
in all three cases ∆Gapp and ∆Gint should be similar in
magnitude. The validity of this reasoning could be tested
by double mutant cycles (Serrano et al., 1990, 1991;
Schreiber & Fersht, 1995).
Hydrogen Bonds in an Antigen-Antibody Interface Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 48, 1996 15501

+ +The importance of hydrogen bonds in contributing to the
affinity and specificity of protein-ligand complex formation
has been investigated in several systems. For example,
truncation of a side chain in a tRNA synthetase-substrate
complex to leave an uncharged, unpaired hydrogen bond
donor or acceptor weakened binding by 2-6 kJ‚mol-1
(Fersht et al., 1985). Truncation of a side chain to leave an
unpaired and charged donor or acceptor weakened binding
by an additional ∼12 kJ‚mol-1 (Fersht et al., 1985). In
another study, comparison of two thermolysin-inhibitor
complexes that were essentially identical except for the
presence or absence of a specific hydrogen bond differed in
binding energy by 17 kJ‚mol-1 (Tronrud et al., 1987).
Entropy compensation effects cannot be addressed in these
studies since only changes in ∆G were measured. However,
the decrease in binding affinity (17 kJ‚mol-1
) observed in
the thermolysin-inhibitor system is in close agreement with
the estimate of the contribution of a hydrogen bond (31.3/2
≈ 16 kJ‚mol-1
) obtained from the analysis of the VHY101F￾HEL complex.
A recent study, comparing the crystal structure of an
antibody-HEL mutant complex with the WT structure,
concluded that the HEL mutation Arg68Lys results in the
net loss of about one interface hydrogen bond (Chacko et
al., 1995). The hydrogen-bonding analysis was complicated
by the fact that Lys68 in the mutant complex appears to exist
in two conformations. This antibody, HyHEL-5, forms a
complex with HEL with a Kb of 1011 M-1 (Padlan et al.,
1989). The Arg68Lys lysozyme mutant binds with an
∼1000-fold lower affinity, which corresponds to a ∆∆G of
17 kJ‚mol-1 (Lavoie et al., 1990). Once again, only values
for ∆G were obtained in these experiments; however, if the
entropy compensation is small, then the resulting enthalpic
contribution of a hydrogen bond is similar to the value we
obtained in the VHY101F system.
The crystal structure of FvD1.3 complexed with turkey
egg white lysozyme (TEL) has also been elucidated and
shows the same mode of binding as HEL (Braden et al.,
1996). However, HEL and TEL differ by one amino acid
in the interface (Gln121HEL f His121TEL), and Kb for the
FvD1.3-TEL reaction is 7.0 × 105 M-1
, that is, about 400-
fold lower than the FvD1.3-HEL reaction. Differences in
∆G, ∆H, and T∆S, compared to FvD1.3-HEL are 16
kJ‚mol-1
, 36 kJ‚mol-1
, and 22 kJ‚mol-1, respectively. The
large ∆∆H is not surprising since, in the FvD1.3-HEL
complex, the side chain of Gln121HEL forms two hydrogen
bonds to the backbone of FvD1.3 plus one hydrogen bond
to the aromatic ring of VLTyr32. Moreover, Gln121 shows
good shape complementarity to a pocket formed by the
aromatic side chains of VLTyr32, VLTrp92, and VHTyr101
and makes van der Waals contacts with these residues.
When Gln121 is effectively substituted by His in the
FvD1.3-TEL complex, a conformational change in D1.3
takes place in order to accommodate the His side chain. This
conformational changesa peptide flip at VL residues 92 and
93senables His121 to form one hydrogen bond with D1.3.
Thus, a total of two interface hydrogen bonds are lost.
However, the contribution of the hydrogen bond from Gln121
to the aromatic ring of VLTyr32 in the WT complex is
difficult to estimate (Levitt & Perutz, 1988; Jamison et al.,
1995).
Entropy Compensation. The previous section was limited
to a discussion of interactions that may affect the enthalpy
of the system, namely, electrostatic (hydrogen bonds in this
case) and van der Waals interactions. As noted before, the
loss in affinity for all three mutant Fv molecules is smaller
than would be expected on the basis of enthalpy consider￾ations alone; that is, entropy compensation is in effect.
Entropy compensation is a phenomenon that has been
observed in many systems including the D1.3-HEL (Ito et
al., 1993) and HyHEL10-HEL binding reactions (Tsumoto
et al., 1994). Since all of the crystal structures presented
here are isomorphous to the wild-type crystal structure, local
B-factor differences are attributed to the effects of the
interface mutations and not to any differences in crystal
packing. Of the mutants investigated in this study, entropy
compensation is greatest for VHY101F. Increases in solvent
and protein motion, as indicated by the crystallographic
B-factors (Table 4), must contribute to the entropy compen￾sation observed for the other two mutants. However, for
the VHY101F complex there are no changes in solvent
structure or B-factors. Here, the most plausible explanation
lies in the differing entropy of the unbound WT and
VHY101F Fv molecules. Of relevance to this point is the
observation that the mean B-factor of VHTyr101 in the
unbound WT Fv is 80% larger than in the complex. As
argued by Bhat et al. (1994), this quenching of side chain
mobility upon complex formation is entropically unfavorable
for binding. Using similar reasoning, an explanation for the
observed entropy compensation for the VHY101F-HEL
reaction is that the mobility of VHPhe101 in the unbound
Fv is much closer to its mobility in the complex. This
hypothesis may be tested by determining the crystal structure
of the unbound mutant Fv. An alternative explanation is
that the solvent structure around VHTyr101 in the unbound
state differs substantially from that in the Phe mutant, giving
rise to a perturbed hydrophobic effect. This is a reasonable
possibility considering the contrasting hydrophobicity and
hydrogen-bonding potential of tyrosine and phenylalanine.
In the unbound WT Fv structure, the VHTyr101 side chain
is hydrogen bonded to one water molecule with a high
temperature factor (B ) 45 Å2
). However, VHTyr101 also
makes contacts with a neighboring FvD1.3 molecule in the
crystal, thus complicating any analysis of its structure and
energetics in the unbound state.
The above arguments emphasize the potential importance
of the unbound structures when attempting to understand the
thermodynamic consequences of interface mutations. Al￾though B-factor increases and small conformational changes
may contribute to entropy compensation in the VLY50S and
VHY32A systems, exactly the same arguments regarding the
structure and energetics of the unbound state also apply in
those cases.
Conclusions. Several conclusions may be drawn from this
study. The calorimetric and structural data provide strong
support for the concept that solvent interactions can make
large contributions to the enthalpy of binding and, therefore,
to the affinity of protein-protein complexes. Although
solvent rearrangements are localized and their effects do not
extend beyond the vicinity of the mutation, they are important
in two ways. First, water molecules may act as “adaptors”
to correct imperfections introduced into the interface by the
mutation. Indeed, losses of complementarity in solvent￾accessible regions of the interface tend to be compensated
by the stable inclusion of additional water molecules rather
than by adjustments in protein structure although we do
15502 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 48, 1996 Fields et al.
+ +
+ +observe small but significant adjustments in all three
structures analyzed here. In another antigen-antibody
system, crystallographically defined structural adjustments
were suggested as a means of compensating for the effects
of mutations (Tulip et al., 1992b). Small structural adjust￾ments predominantly result when mutations are introduced
into protein cores (Buckle et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1993;
Matthews, 1995), although incorporation of solvent has also
been observed (Buckle et al., 1996). Second, the disruption
of ordered solvent networks bridging antigen and antibody
may contribute significantly to entropy compensation. In￾creases in the mobility of side chains of residues in proximity
to the mutation provide a supplementary mechanism for
entropy compensation. Finally, the potential importance of
knowing the high-resolution crystal structures of unbound
mutants, in addition to crystal structures of the mutants in
complexed form, should not be overlooked when attempting
to understand the thermodynamic consequences of interface
mutations in structural terms.
