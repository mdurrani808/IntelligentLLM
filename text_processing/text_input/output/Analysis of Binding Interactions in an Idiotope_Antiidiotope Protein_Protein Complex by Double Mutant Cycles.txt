ABSTRACT: The idiotope-antiidiotope complex between the anti-hen egg white lysozyme antibody D1.3
and the anti-D1.3 antibody E5.2 provides a useful model for studying protein-protein interactions. A
high-resolution crystal structure of the complex is available [Fields, B. A., Goldbaum, F. A., Ysern, X.,
Poljak, R. J., & Mariuzza, R. A. (1995) Nature 374, 739-742], and both components are easily produced
and manipulated in Escherichia coli. We previously analyzed the relative contributions of individual
residues of D1.3 to complex stabilization by site-directed mutagenesis [Dall’Acqua, W., Goldman, E. R.,
Eisenstein, E., & Mariuzza, R. A. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 9667-9676]. In the current work, we introduced
single alanine substitutions in 9 out of 21 positions in the combining site of E5.2 involved in contacts
with D1.3 and found that 8 of them play a significant role in ligand binding (∆Gmutant - ∆Gwild type > 1.5
kcal/mol). Furthermore, energetically important E5.2 and D1.3 residues tend to be juxtaposed in the
crystal structure of the complex. In order to further dissect the energetics of specific interactions in the
D1.3-E5.2 interface, double mutant cycles were carried out to measure the coupling of 13 amino acid
pairs, 9 of which are in direct contact in the crystal structure. The highest coupling energy (4.3 kcal/mol)
was measured for a charged-neutral pair which forms a buried hydrogen bond, while side chains which
interact through solvated hydrogen bonds have lower coupling energies (1.3-1.7 kcal/mol), irrespective
of whether they involve charged-neutral or neutral-neutral pairs. Interaction energies of similar magnitude
(1.3-1.6 kcal/mol) were measured for residues forming only van der Waals contacts. Cycles between
distant residues not involved in direct contacts in the crystal structure also showed significant coupling
(0.5-1.0 kcal/mol). These weak long-range interactions could be due to rearrangements in solvent or
protein structure or to secondary interactions involving other residues.
The ability of proteins to form specific, stable complexes
with other proteins is fundamental to many biological
processes. Understanding the molecular basis of protein￾protein recognition requires detailed characterization of
individual interactions at the interface between the proteins.
In general, the strength of an inter- or intramolecular
interaction between two amino acid residues cannot be
measured by simply mutating one of them because of the
highly cooperative nature of protein structures. Interactions
other than the interaction of interest are often disrupted, each
of which contributes to the energetics of association (Ackers
& Smiths, 1985; Serrano et al., 1990). These secondary
effects include possible conformational changes in the
proteins ranging from repositioning of side chains to move￾ments in the backbone, as well as reorganizations in solvent
structure in the vicinity of the mutation. Thus, comparing
the binding of a wild-type protein with that of a mutant in
which a side chain has been truncated gives an apparent
binding energy which is generally greater than the incre￾mental binding energy attributable to that side chain (Fersht,
1988). A more sophisticated approach to dissecting the
energetics of pairwise interactions which overcomes most
of the limitations of single mutant experiments makes use
of so-called “double mutant cycles” (Carter et al., 1984;
Ackers & Smith, 1985; Horovitz, 1987).
We have applied this method to study the energetics of
binding of the anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL)1 antibody
D1.3 to the anti-D1.3 antibody E5.2. The crystal structure
of this idiotope-antiidiotope complex is known to 1.9 Å
resolution (Fields et al., 1995); furthermore, the Fv fragments
(heterodimers consisting of only the light and heavy chain
variable domains, VL and VH) of both D1.3 and E5.2 are
readily produced in Escherichia coli and can be subjected
to site-directed mutagenesis. Thus, this system constitutes
an excellent model for providing detailed information on
protein-protein interactions.
Specifically, FvD1.3(A) and FvE5.2(B) can be mutated
(i.e., A f A′, B f B′) separately and together to construct
the cycle:
If the effects of the mutations are independent, the change
in free energy for the double mutant is the sum of those for
the two single mutations. But if there is an interaction
between the mutated residues, the change in free energy for
the double mutant is different from the sum of the two single

this nonadditivity is the main obstacle to predicting the effect
of a substitution on the association between two proteins.
Assuming that the mutations do not introduce major struc￾tural changes in the complex, the differences in free energy
on association can provide a quantitative estimate of the
energy of interaction of the two side chains (A and B) based
on the premise that the interactions of A and B with the rest
of the interface will cancel out. The coupling, or interaction,
energy between A and B (∆∆Gint) is given by
or when all the free energies are taken with reference to the
wild-type complex:
where each of the ∆∆G terms is determined by measuring
the difference in the free energy of binding of the Fvs in the
initial and final states of the corresponding transition.
To measure interaction energies, we systematically trun￾cated the side chains of contact residues on both FvD1.3
and FvE5.2 by mutating them to alanine. We assumed that
we did not introduce major changes in the framework of
either antibody in the complex, as the mutations were
introduced in the complementarity-determining regions
(CDRs), whose conformations are less important for the
conservation of the overall three-dimensional structure of the
individual Fvs. To assure the accuracy of our results,
affinities were measured using two independent techniques:
surface plasmon resonance detection and analytical ultra￾centrifugation. We find that a large subset of contact residues
on E5.2 contributes to the D1.3-E5.2 interaction, confirming
previous results that the free energy of binding between
two proteins may arise from many productive interactions
distributed over the entire protein-protein interface
(Dall’Acqua et al., 1996). Coupling energies were measured
for 13 pairs of residues in the D1.3-E5.2 interface, 9 of
which are in direct contact in the crystal structure. We show
that these energies range from over 4 kcal/mol for the
disruption of a buried hydrogen bond to approximately 1
kcal/mol for the disruption of van der Waals contacts. The
importance of indirect coupling between residues is dem￾onstrated by the determination of significant coupling ener￾gies for side chains which do not interact directly in the
crystal structure. Thus, while the relative strengths of
coupling energies in the FvD1.3-FvE5.2 interface were, in
most cases, broadly consistent with expectations based on
the three-dimensional structure, significant exceptions were
also encountered, indicating that structural information alone
is not always sufficient to predict binding energies in
protein-protein complexes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents. All chemicals were of analytical grade. Re￾striction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were pur￾chased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA).
Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 308B DNA synthe￾sizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Radiolabeled
[35S]dATP was obtained from Amersham Corp.
Protein Expression and Purification. The single chain
versions of FvD1.3 (scFvD1.3; McCafferty et al., 1990) and
of the mutants were expressed using the pUC19-based vector
pSW1 (Ward et al., 1989) and isolated from the supernatants
of recombinant E. coli BMH 71-18 cells (Dall’Acqua et al.,
1996). The Fv fragments were purified by affinity chroma￾tography using either monoclonal antibody E5.2- (Gold￾baum et al., 1994) or HEL- (Boulot et al., 1990) Sepharose
4B columns. Production of FvE5.2 and its mutants was
carried out as described (Dall’Acqua et al., 1996). A His6
tail was grafted onto the 3′ of the VL gene to permit
purification using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity
column (QIAGEN).
Prior to BIAcore analysis, all Fv fragments were further
purified by size exclusion chromatography on a ZORBAX
GF-250 column (Dupont) in 0.2 M sodium phosphate, pH
7.4, in order to eliminate aggregated material which could
interfere with affinity measurements (van der Merwe et al.,
1994).
Site-Directed Mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis of
FvE5.2 and scFvD1.3 was performed using a Muta-Gene
M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) after
subcloning the corresponding genes as EcoRI/HindIII frag￾ments into M13mp18 (Kunkel et al., 1987). Mutagenic
oligonucleotides were designed to replace the wild-type
codon with the GCT codon for alanine. Mutations were
confirmed by DNA sequencing (Sanger, 1977) using a
Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (USB, Cleveland, OH).
Affinity Measurements. The interaction of soluble FvE5.2
with immobilized scFvD1.3 was measured by surface plas￾mon resonance detection using a BIAcore instrument (Phar￾macia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden) essentially as described
(Dall’Acqua et al., 1996), except that scFvD1.3 was coupled
directly to the sensor chip, rather than first biotinylated to
permit capture on a streptavidin-derivatized chip. Briefly,
wild-type and mutant scFvD1.3 fragments were dialyzed
against 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and coupled to the
dextran matrix of a CM5 sensor chip (Pharmacia Biosensor)
using an amine coupling kit as described (Johnsson et al.,
1991) at concentrations ranging from 25 to 100 µg/mL.
Activation and immobilization periods were set between 3
and 7 min with a flow rate of 5 µL/min, and excess reactive
esters were quenched by injecting 35 µL of 1.0 M ethano￾lamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. Between 300 and 2000
resonance units (RU) of scFvD1.3 were typically im￾mobilized under these conditions. Mutant FvE5.2 fragments
were dialyzed against Hepes-buffered saline containing 150
mM NaCl, 0.005% Surfactant P-20 (Pharmacia), 3.4 mM
EDTA, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. Dilutions of FvE5.2
ranging from 20 nM to 80 µM, depending on affinity, were
made in the same buffer. Pulses of 10 mM HCl were used
to regenerate the surfaces. To estimate the increase in RU
resulting from the nonspecific effect of protein on the bulk
refractive index, binding of FvE5.2 to a control surface with
no immobilized ligand was also measured (data not shown).
This nonspecific signal was generally not significant for
analyte concentrations up to 1 µM. Following the last
injection of FvE5.2, the analyte was reinjected at one of the
initial concentrations to determine whether ScFvD1.3 had
undergone significant denaturation as the result of repeated
regenerations of the surface with 10 mM HCl. Very similar
signals were obtained even following 15 regenerations,

its original binding activity.
The data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 2.1
software package (Pharmacia). The concentration of com￾plex can be assessed directly as the steady-state response
when performing equilibrium binding experiments with
BIAcore (Karlsson et al., 1991; van der Merwe et al., 1993,
1994; Malchiodi et al., 1995; Dall’Acqua et al., 1996), while
the concentration of free analyte can be considered equal to
the bulk analyte concentration since it is continuously
replenished during sample injection. The concentration of
free ligand on the surface of the sensor chip is then derived
from the concentration of the complex and the total binding
capacity of the surface. Association constants (KAs) were
determined from Scatchard analysis, after correction for
nonspecific binding, by measuring the concentration of free
reactants and complex at equilibrium. Standard deviations
for two or more independent KA determinations were
typically <30%.
Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed
using a Beckman XL-A Optima analytical ultracentrifuge
with a four-hole An-55 rotor. Experiments were carried out
at 25 °C with a rotor speed of 25 000-28 000 rpm; samples
were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline. Data were
acquired as an average of 25 measurements of absorbance
at each radial position with a nominal spacing of 0.001 cm
between radial positions. For both scFvD1.3 and FvE5.2, a
molar extinction coefficient of 36 000 M-1 cm-1 was used.
Partial specific volumes were assumed to be 0.73 mL/mg,
and solvent densities were determined pychnometrically. The
data were analyzed as previously described (Malchiodi et
al., 1995; Dall’Acqua et al., 1996) to yield association
constants. Errors on KAs were about 20% of parameter
values.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Measurement of Association Constants for the Binding of
FVE5.2 to scFVD1.3. Surface plasmon resonance profiles
for equilibrium binding of the FvE5.2 mutant VHI97A to
immobilized wild-type scFvD1.3 and of FvE5.2VHQ100A
to scFvD1.3VHW52A are shown in Figure 1 (panels A and
B, respectively). To estimate apparent KAs, analyte con￾centrations ranging from 400 nM to 80 µM were used; higher
concentrations were required to approach saturation for the
FIGURE 1: (A) Binding of FvE5.2VHI97A to immobilized wild-type scFvD1.3. The E5.2 mutant was injected at concentrations ranging
from 400 nM to 5 µM over a surface on which 480 RU of scFvD1.3 had been immobilized as described in Materials and Methods. (B)
Binding of FvE5.2VHQ100A to immobilized scFvD1.3VHW52A. The E5.2 mutant was injected at concentrations ranging from 4 to 80

from the data in (A) after correction for nonspecific binding. The plot is linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. The apparent KA is
1.0 × 106 M-1. The predicted maximum binding capacity (315 RU) indicates that about 70% of the immobilized scFvD1.3 molecules are
available for binding. (D) Scatchard plot derived from the data in (B) after correction for nonspecific binding. The plot is linear with a
correlation coefficient of 0.99, and the apparent KA is 8.2 × 104 M-1. Over 70% of the immobilized scFvD1.3 is available for binding as
calculated from the predicted maximum binding capacity (380 RU).

The corresponding Scatchard plots, after correction for
nonspecific binding, are shown in Figure 1 (panels C and
D). The plots were linear, and apparent KAs were calculated
as the slopes of the straight lines. The predicted maximum
specific binding, calculated from the x-intercept assuming a
linear relationship between the mass of bound protein and
the measured RU (Granzow et al., 1992), indicated that
approximately 70% of the immobilized scFvD1.3 molecules
were available for binding in both cases. Similar results were
obtained for the other mutants in this study.
Affinity constants for the interaction of wild-type FvE5.2
with mutants of scFvD1.3 have been determined previously
(Dall’Acqua et al., 1996). In these experiments, BIAcore
measurements were confirmed by fluorescence quenching
and sedimentation equilibrium, methods which do not require
immobilization of either of the interacting species. Thus,
the KAs determined by fluorescence quenching for the
binding of wild-type scFvD1.3 and of a mutant, D1.3VH￾D58A, to FvE5.2 (2.7 × 108 M-1 and 1.7 × 107 M-1
) were
found to agree to within a factor of 3 with the BIAcore values
(9.3 × 107 M-1 and 6.2 × 106 M-1
, respectively). Similarly,
the KA for the interaction of scFvD1.3VHW52A with FvE5.2
measured by sedimentation equilibrium (9.1 × 104 M-1
) was
close to that measured by BIAcore (8.6 × 104 M-1
). We
therefore concluded that the BIAcore method is appropriate
for affinity measurements in the scFvD1.3-FvE5.2 system
over a KA range of 104
-108 M-1
.
In the current set of experiments, we carried out additional
equilibrium sedimentation measurements to independently
check our BIAcore results (Table 1). The KA values for the
interactions scFvD1.3-FvE5.2VHQ100A, scFvD1.3VHD54A￾FvE5.2VLY49A, scFvD1.3VHN56A-FvE5.2VHQ100A, and
scFvD1.3VHW52A-FvE5.2VHQ100A obtained by sedimen￾tation equilibrium (1.8 × 106 M-1
, 1.1 × 105 M-1
, 5.4 ×
106 M-1
, and 4.0 × 104 M-1
, respectively) are in reasonable
agreement with those from BIAcore (5.9 × 106 M-1
, 4.7 ×
104 M-1
, 7.5 × 106 M-1
, and 8.2 × 104 M-1
, respectively).
The observed differences could be due to subtle effects on
scFvD1.3 conformation and/or accessibility as a result of the
immobilization procedure. Errors in the analysis of the
sedimentation measurements could also lead to significant
differences in calculated association constants if, for example,
an Fv mutant had a higher tendency to form aggregates over
the course of the ultracentrifugation run.
Although the BIAcore and sedimentation equilibrium
techniques gave association constants which differed by a
factor of 2-3, it is important to emphasize that the BIAcore
measurements were extremely reproducible. On repeat
measurements of affinity, we found that the errors on KA
from BIAcore were consistently less than 30%. Using the
worst case of 30% error on KA translates into an error on
∆∆G of (0.2 kcal/mol and a ∆∆Gint error of (0.3 kcal/
mol. Therefore, the BIAcore method may be used to
compare the binding of a series of closely related mutant
proteins with a relatively high degree of precision.
Mapping the Energetics of the FVE5.2-scFVD1.3 Inter￾face. Residues in the interface between D1.3 and E5.2 were
subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Wells, 1991) in
order to determine their relative contribution to the free
energy of association. Substitution of D1.3 residues in
contact with E5.2 in the crystal structure had previously
shown that, although a number of “hot spots” (∆Gmutant -
∆Gwild type > 4.5 kcal/mol) are clearly present, most of the
contact residues (11 of 15) contribute significantly to ligand
binding (∆∆G > 1.5 kcal/mol; Dall’Acqua et al., 1996). In
the present work, we focused on a set of D1.3 residues with
an apparent free energy contribution to binding of 1.2 kcal/
mol or greater (Table 1, section A). We first determined
which E5.2 residues they interacted with by examining the
high-resolution crystal structure of the FvD1.3-FvE5.2
complex (Fields et al., 1995). We then individually mutated
these 9 residues (out of 19 total non-glycine E5.2 residues
in contact with D1.3) to alanine and measured the affinity
of the mutants for wild-type D1.3 (Table 1, section B). The
most destabilizing alanine substitutions are located at posi￾Table 1: Association Constants and Relative Free Energy Changes

respectively. Section C shows values for the double mutants.
52 Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 1, 1997 Goldman et al.tions VHY98 and VHR100b (∆∆G > 4.0 kcal/mol). Sub￾stitutions at the other seven positions tested (VLY49, VHK30,
VHH33, VHD52, VHN54, VHI97, and VHQ100) also resulted
in significant effects on binding (1.0-2.8 kcal/mol). These
results support the conclusion of Dall’Acqua et al. (1996)
that stabilization of the D1.3-E5.2 complex is achieved by
the accumulation of many productive interactions of varying
strength over the entire interface between the two proteins.
This is in contrast to the binding of D1.3 to HEL (Dall’Acqua
et al., 1996) or of human growth hormone to its receptor
(Cunningham & Wells, 1993; Clackson & Wells, 1995),
where only a few interactions were found to dominate the
energetics of the association reaction.
Figure 2 shows the residues of D1.3 and E5.2 important
in complex stabilization mapped onto the three-dimensional
structure of each Fv fragment. A comparison of the two
functional epitopes reveals that hot spot positions on the E5.2
side of the interface generally correspond to hot spots on
the D1.3 side. For example, E5.2 hot spot residues VHY98
and VHR100b make contact with D1.3 hot spot residues VH￾E98 and VHY101, respectively. Similarly, functionally less
important residues of D1.3 and E5.2 tend to be juxtaposed
in the interface between the two Fvs. For example, D1.3
residue VLY49 (∆∆G ) 1.7 kcal/mol) interacts with the E5.2
residue VHN54 (1.6 kcal/mol) in the crystal structure. This
complementarity is in agreement with the observation of
Clackson and Wells (1995) that energetically critical regions
on human growth hormone match those on its corresponding
receptor. These workers also noted that the functional
epitopes pack together to form a hydrophobic core sur￾rounded by hydrophilic residues, with substantial reductions
in affinity occurring only on substitution of the hydrophobic
ones. In contrast, our analysis of the D1.3-E5.2 system
shows that both hydrophobic and hydrophilic, including
charged, residues play a prominent role in complex stabiliza￾tion and that there is not a clear segregation of hydrophilic
residues at the periphery of the interface and of hydrophobic
ones at the core (Figure 2). This may reflect the special
character of antigen-antibody interactions in the sense that
an antibody must recognize an antigenic surface regardless
of the distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues.
Further, the high frequency of tyrosines in antibody com￾bining sites may be attributed to the amphipathic property
of this residue, which permits tyrosines to engage in both
hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions (Mian et al.,
1991). Thus, one may define two broad categories of
protein-protein interfaces: (i) ones which resemble cross
sections through folded proteins in which hydrophobic
residues are in the interior and hydrophilic ones at the
periphery and in which productive binding is mediated
largely by the former and (ii) ones in which polar and
nonpolar residues are interspersed throughout the interface
and in which both residue types make comparable contribu￾tions to complex stabilization.
Analysis of the Idiotope-Antiidiotope Interface Using
Double Mutant Cycles. Double mutant cycles were con￾structed for 13 amino acid pairs in the FvD1.3-FvE5.2
interface in order to map the interaction energies at the
contact surfaces between the two proteins (Table 1, section
C). Of these 13 pairs, 9 had interacting side chains as judged
from the crystal structure, whereas 4 were not expected to
show coupling. We did not perform cycles in cases where
a side chain of D1.3 or E5.2 contacts only the main chain of
its partner (e.g., D1.3VHR99 interacts with the main chain
only of E5.2VHK30 and E5.2VHI97 contacts the main chain
only of D1.3VHT30).
Coupling energies were calculated according to eq 2. The
interaction between D1.3VHE98 and E5.2VHY98 has the
largest ∆∆Gint, 4.3 kcal/mol (Table 2). These two residues
form a buried hydrogen bond (D1.3VHE98 O1
‚‚‚Oη E5.2VH￾Y98) with good geometry in the crystal structure (Figure
3a). Our ∆∆Gint value for this residue pair is consistent with
the energies measured for deletion of a hydrogen bond within
a neutral-charged pair in other systems (about 4 kcal/mol;
Fersht et al., 1985; Street et al., 1986; Fersht & Serrano,
1993). However, it is important to note that only part of
the 4.3 kcal/mol is likely to be attributable to the hydrogen
bond alone, since five van der Waals contacts should also
be lost in the double mutant. In addition, a significant
hydrophobic contribution can be expected from the burial
of E5.2 residue VHY98 upon complex formation. Thus, the
measured coupling energy reflects the combination of a
number of different atomic interactions. It is also worth
noting that the values for hydrogen bond energies reported
in the literature (Fersht et al., 1985; Street et al., 1986; Alber
et al., 1987; Shirley et al., 1992; Serrano et al., 1992) were
not obtained using double mutant cycles. Hence, they may

Protein-Protein Binding by Double Mutant Cycles Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 1, 1997 53significantly overestimate the intrinsic strength of these
interactions.
Residues interacting through more solvent-exposed hy￾drogen bonds (D1.3VHD54 Oδ2
‚‚‚Oη E5.2VLY49, D1.3VH￾D58 Oδ1
‚‚‚N2 E5.2VHQ100, and D1.3VLY49 Oη‚‚‚Nδ2
E5.2VHN54) have significantly lower coupling energies (1.7,
1.7, and 1.6 kcal/mol, respectively; Table 2). In addition to
the solvated hydrogen bonds, residues D1.3VHD54 and
E5.2VLY49 (Figure 3b) make three van der Waals contacts,
while the D1.3VHD58-E5.2VHQ100 and D1.3VLY49-
E5.2VHN54 interactions include one additional van der Waals
contact each. The ∆∆Gint values for these residue pairs are
consistent with those found for deleting hydrogen bonds
within neutral-neutral pairs (about 1.5 kcal/mol; Fersht et
al., 1985; Street et al., 1986; Alber et al., 1987; Shirley et
al., 1992; Serrano et al., 1992). However, the interactions
between D1.3VHD54 and E5.2VLY49 and between D1.3VH￾D58 and E5.2VHQ100 involve charged-neutral pairs, for
which coupling energies of about 4 kcal/mol might be
expected. Since hydrogen bonds are essentially electrostatic
interactions between atoms of opposite partial charge, this
discrepancy may reflect, in part, a higher dielectric constant
in the more peripheral regions of the FvD1.3-FvE5.2
interface which would tend to weaken the strength of such
interactions. These results illustrate the importance of local
environment, in addition to bond geometry and the magni￾tudes of the partial charges on the donor and acceptor atoms,
in determining the relative strengths of different types of
hydrogen bonds.
Residues which interact only through van der Waals
contacts tend to show slightly lower coupling energies. The
three pairs tested (D1.3VHW52-E5.2VHQ100, D1.3VLY32-
E5.2VHR100b, and D1.3VHN56-E5.2VHQ100) make two
or three van der Waals contacts between their side chains
that are expected to be lost upon alanine substitution (Table
2). The highest coupling energy (1.6 kcal/mol) is observed
between D1.3 residue VHW52 and E5.2 residue VHQ100.
Alanine substitution should result in the loss of three side
chain-side chain contacts, while a number of main chain￾main chain interactions should be preserved (Figure 3c). A
coupling energy of 1.3 kcal/mol was measured between
D1.3VHN56 and E5.2VHQ100, in which three side chain￾side chain van der Waals contacts should again be lost in
the double mutant, and of 1.5 kcal/mol between D1.3VL￾Y32 and E5.2VHR100b, in which only two such contacts
should be lost. On this basis, we can calculate that each
van der Waals contact contributes from 0.4 to 0.7 kcal/mol
to complex stabilization. This is consistent with our previous
estimate of 0.5 kcal/mol for contacts between carbon atoms
derived from a calorimetric study of the binding of a mutant
of FvD1.3, VLW92D, to HEL (Ysern et al., 1994). However,
these values should only be considered upper limits for the
energies of van der Waals interactions in protein-protein
interfaces since they almost certainly include significant
contributions from the hydrophobic effect. These contribu￾tions may be particularly large for the D1.3VHW52-E5.2VH￾Q100 and D1.3VLW92-HEL interactions as they involve
tryptophan residues.
Two of the cycles, corresponding to residue pairs D1.3VH￾D100-E5.2VHH33 and D1.3VHD100-E5.2VHD52, yielded
unexpectedly low coupling energies, 0.6 and 0.2 kcal/mol,
respectively (Table 2); these values are as low as, or lower
than, for certain quite distant residues (see below). In the
crystal structure, these residues are linked through two polar
interactions mediated by a Zn2+ ion from the crystallization

Although zinc was not present in the buffer used for affinity
measurements (which also includes EDTA), residues D1.3VH￾D100 and E5.2VHH33 (but probably not D1.3VHD100 and
E5.2VHD52, which are both negatively charged) might be
expected to form direct or solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds
in its absence. There are examples from studying the
interaction of D1.3 with HEL in which hydrogen bonds
mediated by peripheral water molecules are effectively
neutral in energetic terms. The D1.3VHD54A substitution
decreases the KA of the D1.3-E5.2 interaction by ap￾proximately 1000-fold but has little effect on the affinity of
D1.3 for HEL (Dall’Acqua et al., 1996). This D1.3 residue
makes direct hydrogen bonds to E5.2 but interacts with HEL
through a bound water molecule. Likewise, the D1.3VH￾E98A mutant has a much lower affinity for E5.2, with which
it interacts through a direct hydrogen bond, than for HEL,
where the hydrogen bond is solvent-mediated. In contrast,
Perona et al. (1993) found that direct enzyme-substrate
hydrogen bonds in the S1 site of trypsin do not significantly
improve substrate binding relative to indirect water-mediated
interactions.
Double mutant cycles were also constructed for four
residue pairs not involved in direct interactions in the crystal
structure: D1.3VLY49-E5.2VHH33, D1.3VHD100-E5.2VH￾N54 (Figure 3e), D1.3VHN56-E5.2VHN54, and D1.3VH￾N56-E5.2VHH33. The first two pairs are in proximity in
the interface but do not form any direct contacts, while the
second two are physically far apart (20-30 Å). The coupling
energies for these interactions vary from 0.5 to 1.0 kcal/mol
(Table 2). These values are significantly different from zero
based on the experimental error of our measurements, (0.3
kcal/mol (see above). Indeed, only one residue pair among
the 13 examined (D1.3VHD100-E5.2VHD52; see above) has
a coupling energy (0.2 kcal/mol) which is zero within
experimental error. It is very likely, however, that a more
extensive survey of noncontacting residues would reveal
additional cases of zero (or negative) coupling. Small
magnitude (e1 kcal/mol) energetic coupling between amino
acid residues separated by large distances has been observed
in several systems, including barnase-barstar (Schreiber &
Fersht, 1995), staphylococcal nuclease (Green & Shortle,
1993), and human hemoglobin (Speros et al., 1991). These
couplings tend to be unidirectional, either positive (as in the
present case) or negative (LiCata & Ackers, 1995). The
reason for this unidirectionality is unknown, but systematic
errors in the data do not, for the most part, appear to be the
explanation. As for the physical basis for the observed
coupling between residues that are not in direct contact, there
are several possible explanations (LiCata & Ackers, 1995).
The assumption that the mutations do not have significant
effects on protein conformation may not be valid. In
addition, the mutations may introduce solvent rearrangements
in the protein-protein interface, as described for a complex
between a mutant of FvD1.3 and HEL (Ysern et al., 1994).
Such changes, though localized, may result in long-range
perturbations in electrostatic fields or vibrational modes
within the interface.
Conclusions. We have shown that energetically important
E5.2 and D1.3 residues are juxtaposed in the interface
between the two proteins, with both hydrophobic and charged
residues playing a prominent role in complex stabilization.
The use of double mutant cycles has enabled us to quantitate
the interaction between specific amino acid pairs in the
complex. The highest coupling energy (4.3 kcal/mol) was
measured for a charged-neutral pair forming a buried
hydrogen bond. For residues interacting through solvent￾exposed hydrogen bonds, coupling energies were approxi￾mately 1.7 kcal/mol, regardless of whether a neutral-neutral
or charged-neutral pair was involved. Interactions formed
by solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds were energetically
neutral, at least in cases involving peripheral water molecules.
Coupling energies of about 1.5 kcal/mol were measured for
residues engaged only in van der Waals contacts. Ignoring
the contribution of the hydrophobic effect to these interac￾tions, we find that each van der Waals contact contributes
approximately 0.5 kcal/mol to complex stabilization. How￾ever, dissociating the hydrophobic contribution to stabiliza￾tion from that of other types of interactions will require
characterizing a series of site-directed mutants in terms of
both their thermodynamic properties (reaction enthalpies and
entropies) and their three-dimensional structures (changes
in buried surface area, packing density, and solvent structure).
In this way, a comprehensive understanding of binding
interactions in this protein-protein interface should emerge.
