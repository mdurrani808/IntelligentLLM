The HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) makes an essential interaction with the
human peptidyl prolyl isomerase, cyclophilin A (CypA), that results in
packaging of CypA into the virion at a CA to CypA stoichiometry of
10:1. The 231 amino acid residue capsid protein is composed of an
amino-terminal CypA binding domain (1 to 151; CA151) and a carboxyl￾terminal dimerization domain (151 to 231). We ®nd that CypA binds
dimeric CA and monomeric CA151 with identical intrinsic af®nities
(Kd  16(4) mM). This result demonstrates that capsid dimerization and
cyclophilin A binding are not thermodynamically coupled and suggests
that the substoichiometric ratio of CypA in the HIV-1 virion results from
the intrinsic stability of the CA/CypA complex. In the known co-crystal
structure of the CA151/CypA complex, CypA binding is mediated exclu￾sively by an exposed capsid loop that spans residues Pro85 to Pro93. The
energetic contributions to CypA binding were quanti®ed for each residue
in this loop, and the results demonstrate that the Gly89-Pro90 dipeptide
is the primary cyclophilin A recognition motif, with Pro85, Val86, His87,
Ala88, and Pro93 also making energetically favorable contacts. These stu￾dies reveal that the active site of CypA, which can catalyze the isomeriza￾tion of proline residues in vitro, also functions as a sequence-speci®c,
protein-binding motif in HIV-1 replication.

Introduction
The HIV-1 Gag polyprotein dictates both viral
assembly and the packaging of essential factors
into the virion (for reviews, see Wills &
Craven, 1991; Gelderblom et al., 1992; Hunter,
1994; KraÈusslich, 1996). It is now known that at
least one of these essential packaged factors is a
cellular protein, the abundant cytoplasmic pro￾line isomerase, cyclophilin A (CypA: Luban et al.,
1993; Franke et al., 1994b; Thali et al., 1994).
CypA binds to the central ``capsid'' domain of
Gag and is thereby packaged at a virion stoi￾chiometry of 2000 CA:  200 CypA (Franke
et al., 1994b; Thali et al., 1994; Franke & Luban,
1995; Ott et al., 1995). As the immature virion
buds, the 55 kDa Gag polyprotein (residues 1 to
499) is cleaved by the viral protease to produce
three new proteins, matrix (MA, residues 1 to
132), capsid (CA, 133 to 363) and nucleocapsid
(NC, 378 to 432), as well as three smaller poly￾peptides (p6, p2 and p1: Di Marzo Veronese
et al., 1988; Henderson et al., 1992). Following
cleavage, the capsid protein rearranges into the
characteristic cone-shaped core structure that
surrounds the RNA genome at the center of the
virion. CypA then appears to exert its essential
function on capsid immediately following the
infection of a new cell, possibly helping to dis￾assemble the capsid core structure (Braaten et al.,
1996a,c; Gamble et al., 1996).
Cyclophilin A is the founding member of what
is now a large family of proteins that are ubiqui￾tous in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
(Handschumacher et al., 1984; Fischer et al., 1989;

Hall, 1993). CypA is an abundant cytoplasmic pro￾tein, but other cyclophilin family members exhibit
tissue-speci®c and organelle-speci®c expression
patterns, and function as subdomains of larger pro￾teins. Various cyclophilin family members have
been reported to play roles in such diverse and im￾portant cellular functions as the heat-shock re￾sponse (Sykes et al., 1993), cell-surface recognition
(Anderson et al., 1993; Friedman et al., 1993), pro￾tein folding and traf®cking (Colley et al., 1991;
Lodish & Kong, 1991; Helekar et al., 1994; Ferreira
et al., 1996), lactate metabolism (Davis et al., 1992),
and various intracellular signaling pathways (Xu
et al., 1992; Ratajczak et al., 1993; Bram & Crabtree,
1994; Cardenas et al., 1994; Chang & Lindquist,
1994; Duina et al., 1996; Freeman et al., 1996;
Weisman et al., 1996).
Despite extensive study, it is not yet clear pre￾cisely what cyclophilins do in the cell. The broad
spectrum of biological pathways in which they
appear suggests a role for cyclophilins in protein
folding and, indeed, two distinct roles for cyclophi￾lins in the folding process have been proposed.
First, the rotamase activity of cyclophilins may
allow them to play a general role in accelerating
protein folding. Proline isomerization is the rate￾limiting step for the folding of many proteins
in vitro (e.g. see Brandts et al., 1975; Schmid &
Baldwin, 1978; Jackson & Ferscht, 1991; Schmid,
1993) and CypA accelerates the overall folding
rates of a number of such proteins (reviewed by
Schmid, 1993). A second role for cyclophilins in
protein folding is suggested by the fact that CypA
can act as a molecular chaperone in vitro, increas￾ing the yield of correctly folded protein by sup￾pressing off-pathway folding reactions and
preventing the aggregation of proteins in their un￾folded states (FreskgaÊrd et al., 1992; Lilie et al.,
1993; Freeman et al., 1996). Intriguingly, this cha￾perone activity appears independent of the enzy￾me's rotamase activity. Although the rotamase and
chaperone activities of cyclophilins have been well
documented in vitro, the roles of these two activi￾ties in vivo are not fully understood.
A second major unanswered question in cyclo￾philin biology is whether or not cyclophilins typi￾cally bind speci®cally to their target proteins. On
the one hand, if cyclophilins normally function as
general prolyl isomerases, they might be expected
to exhibit little sequence speci®city. This model is
consistent with the reported lack of CypA sub￾strate discrimination across a series of different
proline-containing model peptide sequences
(Harrison & Stein, 1990). However, at least a subset
of cyclophilins seem to bind speci®cally to target
proteins in order to perform their essential func￾tions. The best-characterized example of this is
NinaA, a cyclophilin of the Drosophila eye, which
forms a speci®c complex with rhodopsin 1 (Rh1:
Schneuwly et al., 1989; Shieh et al., 1989; Baker et al.,
1994). NinaA is essential for translocation of Rh1
from the endoplasmic reticulum, through the
secretory pathway, and into the rhabdomere where
phototransduction occurs (Colley et al., 1991).
Although the Rh1/NinaA interaction is not under￾stood in detail, loss of function mutations cluster
about the ninaA active site, suggesting that the
active site mediates Rh1 binding (Ondek et al.,
1992). Other examples in which cyclophilins ap￾pear to form speci®c complexes with their target
proteins include CypB binding to the calcium-sig￾naling protein CAML (Bram & Crabtree, 1994),
and CypC binding to the cell-surface protein
CyCAP (Friedman et al., 1993). It therefore appears
that sequence-speci®c protein binding may prove a
recurring theme in cyclophilin function.
In addition to its importance in HIV-1 replica￾tion, the HIV-1 CA/CypA interaction may serve as
a paradigm for understanding how cyclophilins
achieve sequence-speci®c protein binding. Like
NinaA, the CypA active site appears to participate
in capsid binding, since CA/CypA complex for￾mation is competitively inhibited by the rotamase
inhibitor cyclosporine and its analogues (Luban
et al., 1993; Franke et al., 1994b; Thali et al., 1994;
Billich et al., 1995). Moreover, mutation of a single
capsid proline residue, Pro90, abolishes CypA
binding, packaging, and viral replication (Franke
et al., 1994 b). In principle, however, binding speci-
®city in the CA/CypA complex could either be
achieved entirely within the CypA binding site or
through additional protein-protein interactions that
extend beyond the active site. The latter model is
supported by the report that high-af®nity cyclophi￾lin A binding requires dimerization of the target
Gag (or capsid) protein (Colgan et al., 1996). This
observation suggests either that capsid dimeriza￾tion creates a high-af®nity cyclophilin A binding
surface or that distal CypA-CypA interactions
allow CypA to bind cooperatively to the capsid
dimer.
Several recent experiments suggest an alternative
model, however, in which the CypA active site it￾self discriminates between proline residues em￾bedded in different local sequence contexts. For
example, Luban and co-workers have shown that
HIV-1 CA residue Gly89, as well as Pro90, is essen￾tial for CypA binding and viral packaging (Braaten
et al., 1996b). Similarly, our recent CA151/CypA
co-crystal structure revealed that capsid residues
85 to 93 make a series of favorable contacts in the
CypA active site, with no other signi®cant CypA￾CA or CypA-CypA interaction (Gamble et al.,
1996).
In order to determine precisely how cyclophilin
A recognizes the HIV-1 capsid protein, we have
examined various aspects of CA/CypA complex
formation in solution. These experiments reveal the
thermodynamics and energetic determinants of cy￾clophilin A binding, and demonstrate that the cy￾clophilin A active site itself acts as a sequence￾speci®c, protein-binding motif.
HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 781Results
Recombinant capsid proteins
Primary sequences and labeling schemes for the
HIV-1 capsid and human cyclophilin A proteins
are shown in Figure 1(a) and (b), respectively. The
crystallographically de®ned interaction between
cyclophilin A and the amino-terminal domain of
the capsid is shown in Figure 1(c) (Gamble et al.,
1996). As shown in Figure 2, ef®cient systems have
been developed for expressing and purifying large
quantities of the full-length HIV-1 capsid protein
(CA; Figure 2(a)), the amino-terminal capsid do￾main (CA151; Figure 2(b)), and human cyclophilin
A (CypA; Figure 2(c)). Both capsid proteins are
ideally suited for biophysical and structural stu￾dies, since they are highly soluble (>50 mg/ml)
and can be ef®ciently isolated in high yields
(>30 mg/l Escherichia coli culture).
Self-association of capsid proteins
Several groups have reported that HIV-1 capsid
proteins dimerize in vitro (Ehrlich et al., 1992, 1994;

782 HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interactionrecombinant capsid protein (25.6 kDa) is also pre￾dominantly dimeric at a concentration of 200 mM
as analyzed by dynamic light-scattering
(Mest  51(2) kDa). The CA monomer-dimer equi￾librium was quanti®ed by analytical ultracentrifu￾gation, yielding an estimated dissociation constant
of 18(1) mM (Figure 3(a)). This value agrees well
with previous measurements of the capsid Kd,
which ranged between 10 and 30 mM (RoseÂ et al.,
1992; Brooks et al., 1994).
In order to test the in¯uence of capsid dimeriza￾tion on cyclophilin A binding, it was necessary to
create a monomeric capsid protein. Partial proteol￾ysis and NMR structural studies have indicated
that capsid residues 1 to 151 (CA151) form an inde￾pendently folded domain that is monomeric at low
millimolar concentrations (Gitti et al., 1996). This
observation was con®rmed by equilibrium sedi￾mentation and dynamic light-scattering analyses of
CA151. Sedimentation distributions of three differ￾ent CA151 concentrations were globally ®t to a
simple monomer model (Figure 3(b)), yielding a
shape-independent estimated particle mass of
16.4(0.3) kDa, in agreement with the calculated
mass of the CA151 monomer (16.7 kDa). Similarly,
CA151 appeared monomeric as measured by dy￾namic light-scattering (Mest  18.1(0.1) kDa;
158 mM).
Calorimetric quantification of the capsid/
cyclophilin A interaction
Isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) was
used to measure dissociation constants for the CA/
CypA and CA151/CypA complexes. This method
has the advantage of allowing rigorous quanti®-
cation of the stoichiometry, energy and enthalpy of
complex formation in solution, but requires multi￾milligram quantities of pure proteins (Brandts et al.,
1990; Bundle & Sigurskjold, 1994; Fisher & Singh,
1995). The titration of CA151 into cyclophilin A is
shown in Figure 4(a). Raw calorimetric data were
corrected by subtraction of the appropriate blank
titrations (negligible), and the integrated binding
isotherm (Figure 4(b)) was successfully ®t to a
single-site binding model, yielding a CA151 to
CypA binding ratio of 1.13(0.05), Kd  16(4)
mM, and H  ÿ 9.5(0.6) kcal/mol.
The analogous titration of cyclophilin A into
full-length capsid protein (CA) is shown in
Figure 4(c). Raw titration data were again cor￾rected by subtracting the appropriate blank
titrations. In this case the blank titration of
buffer into capsid resulted in signi®cant heat ab￾sorbance, presumably owing to dissociation of
dimeric CA upon dilution. Nevertheless, the cor￾rected binding isotherm (Figure 4(d)) again ®t a
single-site binding model, yielding a CypA to CA
stoichiometry of 1.01(0.04), Kd  16(3) mM, and
H  ÿ 9.5(0.6) kcal/mol. These experiments de￾Figure 3. Equilibrium sedimentation analyses of the oli￾gomeric states of HIV-1 CA and CA151. (a) CA exhibits

constant, Kd  1.8(0.1)  10ÿ5 M. The reported error is

the mass of the CA151 monomer (16.7 kDa). The global
®t was performed using equilibrium sedimentation data
from initial protein concentrations of 7.2, 14.9 and
34.3 mM. The GOF is 1.46 and the ®t exhibited small,
random residuals.

HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 783   monstrate that capsid dimerization and CypA
binding are not coupled equilibria, since the
measured stoichiometry, equilibrium binding con￾stants and enthalpies for CypA binding to CA151
and CA are indistinguishable, even though the
CA/CypA titration was performed at an initial
capsid concentration of 59 mM, where >50% of the
CA molecules were dimeric.
Surface plasmon resonance measurement of
the CA/CypA affinity
The large quantities of pure proteins required for
ITC measurements made this method impractical
for a comprehensive mutational analysis of the
CA/CypA interaction. Surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) spectroscopic methods were therefore also
used to quantify the interaction. SPR has distinct
advantages over ITC in speed, sensitivity and
scale, but requires independent validation to en￾sure that binding equilibria are not altered by sur￾face effects (JoÈnsson et al., 1991; Malmqvist, 1993;
Morton et al., 1995; O'Shannessy & Winzor, 1996).
Initial experiments examined the binding of pure,
monomeric CA151 to a pure, immobilized gluta￾thione-S-transferase-CypA fusion protein (GST￾CypA). GST-CypA was captured on the sensor sur￾face by an anti-GST antibody covalently linked to
the carboxymethyl dextran layer (JoÈnsson et al.,
1991), providing a homogeneous surface of unper￾turbed CypA binding sites. CA151 binding was
then quanti®ed by changes in the surface refractive
index. A correction for refractive index changes
due to bulk solvent and non-speci®c background
binding was performed simultaneously in a separ￾ate ¯ow-cell derivatized with the anti-GST anti￾body binding to GST alone.
As shown in Figure 5(a), binding responses were
highly reproducible in repeated measurements
across a concentration range of 0 to 57 mM CA151.
The sensorgrams revealed that equilibrium was
achieved rapidly. Furthermore, the binding re￾sponses returned to baseline levels very quickly
after washing with buffer, indicating that the com￾plex has a very high dissociation rate. The magni￾tudes of equilibrium binding responses at different
CA151 concentrations were used to determine the
dissociation constant for CA151/CypA complex by
non-linear least-squares ®tting to a simple one-to￾one interaction model. Equivalent dissociation con￾stants were obtained for measurements made at
two different CypA surface derivatization levels
and the data from the two surfaces were averaged
to give the normalized binding data shown in
Figure 5(c). The ®t provides an estimated dis￾sociation constant of 18(2) mM, in good agree￾ment with the CA151/CypA dissociation constant
measured under the same conditions by isothermal
titration microcalorimetry (see Table 1).
Subsequent experiments measured CypA bind￾ing to the intact capsid protein. In this case, the
GST-CA fusion protein was captured directly from
the soluble fraction of crude E. coli extracts follow￾ing induction of protein expression. Capture of
GST-CA directly onto the sensor surface was
highly speci®c, since non-speci®c protein binding
in control extracts lacking GST-CA was negligible
(not shown). CypA dissociation constants were
again obtained by ®tting binding data (Figure 5(b))
from two different CA surface derivatization levels
to a single-site binding model (Figure 5(c)). Nine
independent repetitions of this experiment yielded
a mean dissociation constant of 15 mM, with a stan￾dard deviation of 5 mM (Table 1). The excellent
agreement between all of the ITC and SPR
measurements validates the SPR method, and
further supports the conclusion that the carboxyl￾terminal dimerization domain of HIV-1 CA does
not in¯uence the af®nity of CypA binding.

bars are drawn at the 90% con®dence interval for clarity.
784 HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A InteractionImportance of other Gag domains for
CypA binding
Since cyclophilin A is initially packaged by the
HIV-1 Gag polyprotein, we considered the possi￾bility that the amino-terminal matrix or the car￾boxyl-terminal nucleocapsid domains of Gag might
participate in CypA binding. CypA binding to im￾mobilized GST-MA-CA (Gag residues 1 to 363)
and to GST-CA-NC-p6 (Gag residues 133 to 432)
was therefore examined. As shown in Table 1,
measured dissociation constants for CypA bind￾ing were 12(1) mM (MA-CA) and 14(2) mM (CA￾NC). In a parallel control experiment, the
measured dissociation constant for the CA/CypA
complex was 12.0(0.4) mM. We therefore conclude
that the CypA binding af®nity is not signi®cantly
affected by Gag residues outside the central capsid
domain.
Mutational analysis of the cyclophilin A
binding site on HIV-1 CA
The biochemical experiments described above,
together with the CA151/CypA co-crystal structure
(Gamble et al., 1996), indicate that CA/CypA com￾plex formation is mediated entirely by the contigu￾ous capsid loop sequence Pro85 to Pro93 binding
in the active site of cyclophilin A (see Figures 1(c)
and 6(a)). To determine the relative importance of
individual capsid residues in sequence-speci®c cy￾clophilin A binding, each CA binding loop residue
was mutated and the effect of the mutation on
CypA binding energy was measured (Table 2 and
Figure 6(b)). Mutations were made in the context
of the full-length capsid protein, and af®nity bind￾ing measurements were performed by SPR spec￾troscopy as described above. To keep the
mutagenesis as unbiased as possible, each CA loop
residue was initially mutated to alanine, except for
Ala88 and Ala92, which were mutated to both Gly
and Val. Additional point mutations were sub￾sequently used to test speci®c aspects of CypA rec￾ognition. Overall, the mutational analysis revealed
that capsid residues Gly89 and Pro90 are the key
determinants for cyclophilin A recognition, while
the ¯anking residues Pro85, Val86, His87, Ala88,
Ala92 and Pro93 also make favorable contributions
to the af®nity of the CA/CypA complex. As de￾scribed below in detail, these results are in excel￾lent agreement with the CA151/CypA co-crystal
structure.
The CA151/CypA co-crystal structure indicated
that CA Pro90 should be a major determinant of
CypA binding, because the proline ring is buried
in a deep hydrophobic pocket formed by CypA re￾sidues Phe60, Met61, Phe113 and Leu122. Analo￾gous binding of proline residues has been
observed in a number of cyclophilin A peptide
complexes (Kallen & Walkinshaw, 1992; Ke et al.,
1993; Zhao & Ke, 1996a,b). Detailed examination of
the structure suggested that an Ala90 side-chain
could be accommodated in the CypA binding
pocket, albeit with the loss of favorable binding
interactions at the Pro90 Cg and Cd positions,
whereas any larger side-chain should clash with
the sides of the proline binding pocket. For
example, a b-branched side-chain at CA residue 90
is predicted to clash with the CypA Leu122 side￾chain. Consistent with this analysis, mutation of
CA Pro90 to Ala reduced the CypA binding af®-
nity by 2.1 kcal/mol, while mutation of Pro90 to
Val resulted in immeasurably low (>3 kcal/mol re￾duced) CypA binding af®nity.
The mutational analyses further revealed that
CA Gly89 is also a major determinant of CypA rec￾ognition, since mutation of Gly89 to Ala or Val re￾duced the CypA binding by 2.0 and 2.9 kcal/mol,
respectively. The CA151/CypA co-crystal structure
shows that Gly89 contributes to CypA binding af®-
nity in two different ways. First, Gly89 adopts
phi/psi angles (148/155) that are less favored for
non-glycine residues. Moreover, the lack of a side￾chain at Gly89 allows this residue to ®t snugly
against the CypA active site, whereas a b-carbon
atom at this position would exhibit steric clash
with CypA Arg55 NZ2 and Gln63 Od1
. The unusual
torsion angles and tight ®t of Gly89 in the CypA
active site appear critically important, because they
allow the Gly89-Pro90 peptide bond to adopt an
unprecedented trans conformation. This is in con￾trast to all previously characterized model peptide
complexes with CypA, in which the peptide pro￾Table 1. Measured dissociation constants for capsid/

HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 785line residue was always in the cis conformation
(Kallen & Walkinshaw, 1992; Ke et al., 1993;
Kakalis & Armitage, 1994; Zhao & Ke, 1996a,b).
The trans-Pro90 conformation, in turn, orients the
preceding capsid residues down into the CypA ac￾tive site groove, where they make a series of favor￾able contacts (Figure 6(a)). The structure therefore
clearly rationalizes why adding steric bulk to the
Gly89 side-chain is energetically unfavorable.
A third determinant of CypA binding speci®city
is His87, which contributes to CypA binding by
forming a van der Waals interaction (CA His87 Ce

) and an intermolecular hydro￾gen bond (CA His87 Nd to CypA Asn71 O) across
the CA/CypA interface. Mutation of His87 to Ala
removes these interactions and decreases the bind￾ing af®nity by 0.9 kcal/mol. The pH-dependence
of the CA/CypA dissociation constant was tested,
since the observed intermolecular hydrogen bond￾ing of His87 Nd suggested that the complex should
be less stable at higher pH. As shown in Table 1,
we ®nd that the complex stability does exhibit a
measurable pH-dependence and is approximately
twofold more stable at pH 6.5 than at either pH 8.5
or 5.5.
Unlike Pro90 and Gly89, CA His87 is not excep￾tionally conserved in different HIV-1 strains
(Myers et al., 1995). Although the majority (77) of
95 collected HIV-1 sequences have His at capsid
position 87, Gln (17) and Arg (1) are also rep￾resented at this position (this analysis excludes the
group O viruses, discussed below). It seemed poss￾ible that these rather conservative changes might
retain some of the favorable interactions of His87.
We found, however, that mutation of His87 to Gln
or Arg diminished CypA binding by 0.9 and
1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. This observation
suggests that that the virus may not be under
strong selective pressure to maximize CypA packa￾ging levels (although residue 87 may, of course,
perform additional role(s) in HIV-1 replication that
in¯uence its mutational spectrum).
The CA151/CypA structure exhibits other van
der Waals interactions between CypA and CA
side-chains that could contribute to binding speci-
®city. For example, the CA Ala88 methyl group
makes van der Waals interactions with CypA
Gln111, Ala101, Asn102 and Ala103. The CA Ala88
to Gly mutation removes these interactions and de￾creases the CypA binding af®nity by 2.2 kcal/mol.
In contrast, the favorable van der Waals inter￾actions at the Cb position are presumably main￾tained in an Ala88 to Val mutation, since this
mutation reduces CypA binding by only 0.6 kcal/
mol. A similar, but less dramatic effect is seen at
position 92, where the Ala92 methyl group inter￾acts with CypA Phe60 and the CA Ala92 to Gly
and Val mutations reduce CypA binding af®nity
by 0.5 and 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Finally, the
energetic contributions of other side-chain pos￾itions that make van der Waals interactions with
CypA, Pro85 Cd
, Val86 Cg
, and Pro93 Cg
, were
tested with alanine mutations. These mutations re￾duced the CypA binding af®nity by 0.6, 0.6 and
0.3 kcal/mol, respectively. In summary, every
single intermolecular interaction made by a CA
side-chain in the crystal structure of the CA151/
CypA complex was removed by mutagenesis and
found to contribute to CypA binding af®nity in
solution.
Uniquely, mutations at the CA Ile91 residue had
no measurable effect on the energy of CypA bind￾ing. Consistent with this observation, Ile91 is the
only capsid residue in the CypA binding loop
whose side-chain projects directly out of the CypA
active site and makes no intermolecular contact
(see Figure 6(a)). An initial measurement suggested
that the Ile91 to Ala mutation mutation might actu￾ally increase the CypA binding energy slightly, but
this observation proved statistically insigni®cant
(see Table 2). Similarly, a CA Ile91 to Val mutation
had no effect on CypA binding.
Cyclophilin A binding to type O HIV-1
capsid proteins
The group O viruses are apparently unique
amongst HIV-1 strains, in that they package cyclo￾philin A, but do not require the protein to replicate
(Braaten et al., 1996b). Moreover, the CypA binding
loop sequences of the group O viruses, while re￾taining the central GlyPro binding dipeptide se￾quence, are otherwise signi®cantly diverged from
the far more prevalent group M viruses. For
example, the residues surrounding the CypA bind￾ing loop in the group O, HIV-1MVP5180 capsid pro￾tein (83THPPAMGPLPPGQI96) differs from the
group M consensus sequence (83LHPVHAG￾PIAPGQM96) at seven different positions, ®ve of
which occur within the CypA binding loop itself. It
was therefore of interest to quantify how tightly
CypA binds to the HIV-1MVP5180 loop sequence.

All measurements were made by surface plasmon resonance

from soluble expression extracts onto anti-GST mAb-deriva￾tized sensor chips. Binding experiments were subsequently per￾formed with pure CypA in the mobile phase. a Fold decrease is the decrease in CypA binding af®nity rela￾tive to a control wild-type GST-CA/CypA binding experi￾ment(s) performed in parallel.

HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 787This was done by creating and expressing a
chimeric GST-CA protein that contained the
HIV-1MVP5180 binding loop sequence in the context
of an otherwise wild-type GST-CANL4-3 capsid
protein. The chimeric capsid protein was immobi￾lized and cyclophilin A binding was quanti®ed by
SPR spectroscopy as described above.
Although CypA bound somewhat less tightly to
the chimeric capsid protein (Kd  42(1) mM,
Table 2) as compared to the wild-type CANL4-3 pro￾tein, the increase in dissociation constant was mod￾est (2.5-fold). This result demonstrates that
although sequences surrounding the central Gly￾Pro sequence can and do modulate CypA binding,
the cyclophilin A active site can tolerate signi®cant
sequence variability without dramatic loss of bind￾ing af®nity. Indeed, it is even possible that while
some of the changes in the HIV-1MVP5180 binding
loop sequence presumably reduce CypA binding
af®nity (e.g. His87 in HIV-1NL4-3 to Ala87 in HIV￾1MVP5180 capsid), other changes in the loop se￾quence may compensate by actually increasing the
binding energy.
Discussion
Capsid dimerization
Equilibrium sedimentation analyses demonstrate
that the carboxyl-terminal 80 amino acid residues
of the HIV-1 capsid protein (residues 152 to 231)
are essential for full af®nity dimerization. Together
with previous proteolytic mapping and NMR stu￾dies (Gitti et al., 1996), these experiments demon￾strate that the HIV-1 capsid protein is composed of
two domains, an amino-terminal core domain that
binds cyclophilin A, and a carboxyl-terminal as￾sembly domain that mediates the highest af®nity
capsid-capsid interaction. Division of capsid into
two distinct functional domains is supported by
genetic studies that reveal that deleterious mu￾tations in the carboxyl-terminal third of the protein
generally prevent Gag assembly and particle re￾lease (Jowett et al., 1992; Hong & Boulanger, 1993;
von Poblotzki et al., 1993; Chazal et al., 1994;
Dorfman et al., 1994; Franke et al., 1994a;
Mammano et al., 1994; Zhao et al., 1994; CarrieÁre
et al., 1995; Reicin et al., 1995; Srinivasakumar et al.,
1995; Zhang et al., 1996). In contrast, deleterious
mutations in the amino-terminal two-thirds of cap￾sid typically give rise to assembled, but non-infec￾tious virions that frequently fail to form the mature
capsid core structure (Wang & Barklis, 1993;
Dorfman et al., 1994; Reicin et al., 1995).
Two different co-crystal structures of HIV-1 cap￾sid proteins bound to other proteins have recently
been reported (Gamble et al., 1996; Momany et al.,
1996). In the structure of CA151 bound to CypA
(Gamble et al., 1996), the capsid fragment is miss￾ing residues 152 to 231 and therefore cannot recon￾stitute the entire dimer interface formed by the
intact capsid protein. Consistent with this model,
we have recently crystallized and determined the
structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of capsid
(CA151-231; unpublished results). As expected,
CA151-231 forms a dimer.
The crystal structure of full-length HIV-1 CA in
complex with an anti-CA Fab fragment has been
reported (Momany et al., 1996). In this structure,
the carboxyl-terminal domains of adjacent CA mol￾ecules are distant from one another and lack de-
®ned electron density. We therefore conclude that
antibody binding has disrupted the high-af®nity
CA-CA interface formed between the carboxyl￾terminal domains, and that this crystal lattice is
dominated by Fab packing interactions. This in￾terpretation is consistent with the fact that identical
crystalline lattices form in both the presence and
absence of the capsid protein.
Viral packaging of cyclophilin A
Our binding measurements have revealed the
stoichiometry and thermodynamics of the cyclo￾philin A/capsid interaction. Formation of the CA/
CypA complex is enthalpically driven, with a dis￾sociation constant, Kd, of 16 mM. Although cyclo￾philin A is initially packaged by the intact Gag
polyprotein, fusing the capsid domain to either the
amino-terminal matrix domain or the carboxyl￾terminal NC and p6 domains has no effect on
CypA binding af®nity. The simplest interpretation
of these data is that the capsid domain alone med￾iates CypA binding (although the experiments do
not formally rule out the possibility that CypA
binding could somehow be modulated by contacts
created in the assembled Gag particle that are not
mimicked in our fusion proteins).
The micromolar dissociation constant observed
for the CA/CypA complex suggests that simple
mass action may determine the substoichiometric
level of viral CypA packaging. Given a Kd for the
CA/CypA complex of 16 mM, the 10:1 ratio of
capsid to cyclophilin A in the HIV-1 virion would
be achieved at a free cytoplasmic cyclophilin A
protein concentration of 1.6 mM. Although intra￾cellular levels of cyclophilin A have not been quan￾ti®ed precisely, a micromolar CypA concentration
appears reasonable, since the protein is highly
abundant (Koletsky et al., 1986) and approximately
3 mM concentrations of cyclosporine or its ana￾logues are required to achieve full stoichiometric
inhibition (Franke et al., 1994a; Thali et al., 1994).
Our experiments demonstrate that capsid dimer￾ization and cyclophilin A binding are thermodyna￾mically independent. This conclusion contradicts a
recent report that Gag (or capsid) dimerization is
required for CypA binding (Colgan et al., 1996). A
possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the
previous investigations examined capsid binding
to immobilized GST-CypA. In this con®guration,
dimerization of Gag (or capsid) molecules would
increase the apparent cyclophilin binding af®nity if
the capsid dimers bound bivalently to immobilized
CypA (the chelate effect). In contrast, our microca￾lorimetry experiments were performed in solution
788 HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interactionand are therefore not subject to the chelate effect.
Importantly, our experiments are likely to re¯ect
the biological situation in which soluble, mono￾meric CypA molecules bind to the assembling Gag
molecules.
The observation that CA dimerization and cyclo￾philin A binding are independent agrees well with
the CA151/CypA co-crystal structure. CypA binds
CA151 30 AÊ away from the C-terminal dimeriza￾tion domain and it is therefore dif®cult to rational￾ize how cyclophilin A binding could directly affect
formation of the primary capsid dimer interface.
Moreover, there is no signi®cant CypA-CypA
interaction in the co-crystal structure that would
account for cooperative binding of CypA to the
CA dimer. (Gamble et al., 1996). Taken together, all
of these data indicate that cyclophilin A packaging
is mediated entirely by contacts between the CypA
active site and the exposed capsid loop sequence
spanning residues Pro85 to Pro93.
Molecular recognition in the CA/CypA complex
Our mutational analyses reveal that the cyclo￾philin A active site can strongly discriminate be￾tween proline residues in different sequence
contexts. The key to sequence-speci®c binding in
the CA/CypA complex is the presence of a glycine
residue (Gly89) preceding the target proline resi￾due (Pro90). Glycine apparently allows the CypA
active site to accommodate the CA Pro90 peptide
bond in a trans conformation, thereby directing the
capsid target sequence to form a series of favorable
interactions along the CypA active site cleft. Hence
it appears that the Gly-Pro dipeptide, rather than
proline alone, forms the fundamental recognition
site for cyclophilin A. The importance of this recog￾nition motif for HIV-1 replication has been demon￾strated by Luban and co-workers, who have
shown that mutation of either Gly89 or Pro90 to
Ala blocks both cyclophilin A packaging and viral
replication (Franke et al., 1994b; Braaten et al.,
1996a). Our mutational analyses demonstrate that
sequences ¯anking the Gly-Pro binding motif can
also contribute signi®cantly to CypA recognition.
For example, we ®nd that the CA Ala88 to Gly
mutation decreases the CypA binding af®nity
more than 44-fold, and might also be expected to
inhibit viral packaging of cyclophilin A and block
HIV-1 replication.
Cyclophilin A and HIV-1 replication
Although the precise role of cyclophilin A in
HIV-1 replication remains uncertain, the protein
appears to perform its essential function early in
the viral life-cycle (Steinkasserer et al., 1995;
Braaten et al., 1996a). Luban and co-workers have
reported that CypA-de®cient virions assemble, ma￾ture and fuse with their target cells normally, but
that the virus fails to initiate reverse transcription
(Braaten et al., 1996a). This does not seem to re¯ect
a direct effect of CypA on reverse transcriptase,
since the endogenous reverse transcription activity
in detergent-permeabilized, CypA-de®cient virions
is normal (Braaten et al., 1996a). Instead, genetic
analyses indicate that the capsid is both the CypA
binding partner and the functional target of CypA
(Aberham et al., 1996; Braaten et al., 1996a;
Dorfman & GoÈttlinger, 1996). These observations
lead to the hypothesis that cyclophilin A may act
to facilitate rearrangement or uncoating of the cap￾sid core structure upon infection.
Although cyclophilin A binding does not affect
formation of the highest af®nity CA dimer inter￾face, CypA could still affect higher order capsid as￾sembly or disassembly by altering one of the other,
lower af®nity CA-CA interfaces involving the
amino-terminal capsid domain. In the CA151/
CypA co-crystal structure, CA151 molecules associ￾ate via two distinct interfaces to form long planar
strips. We envision that the surface of the viral cap￾sid core could assemble by side to side packing of
these capsid strips. In the crystal, close packing of
the capsid strips is prevented by stoichiometric
binding of cyclophilin A molecules along the outer
edges of the strips. In the virion, however, the sub￾stoichiometric levels of CypA could simply serve
to destabilize the cooperative interactions between
associated capsid strips. Thus, we hypothesize that
the function of cyclophilin A in HIV-1 replication
may be to weaken the capsid core and thereby pro￾mote its dissociation upon infection.
Other cyclophilins
Our studies demonstrate that the CypA active
site binds speci®cally to the HIV-1 capsid protein,
providing the ®rst well-characterized biological
function for a cyclophilin active site. This obser￾vation again raises the possibility, ®rst suggested
by Schreiber & Crabtree (1992), that proline iso￾merization may not be the primary function of cy￾clophilins in vivo. As has been pointed out by
Harrison & Stein (1990), the modest kc/KM for cy￾clophilin A binding to small model peptides
suggests that rate enhancements for non-speci®c
proline isomerization will be quite modest at
physiological CypA concentrations. Instead, it ap￾pears that other cyclophilins may function in ana￾logy to the model that we propose for CypA in
HIV-1, i.e. by binding target proteins with some
level of sequence discrimination and functioning
by modulating or preventing protein-protein inter￾actions. This model does not, of course rule out the
possibility that proline isomerase activity may also
be important in vivo.
Since the cyclophilin active site is largely con￾served in eukaryotic cyclophilins (Stamnes et al.,
1992), we speculate that Gly-Pro dipeptides will
form the basic recognition motif for other cyclophi￾lins. We envisage that different cyclophilins may
discriminate between their target proteins by mak￾HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 789ing complementary interactions with sequences
¯anking the Gly-Pro recognition element. The Gly￾Pro motif forms a convenient binding ``handle'',
since this particular dipeptide is very likely to re￾side in an exposed loop in a folded target protein.
Indeed, since Gly-Pro sequences are likely to end
up in exposed loops and not in integral secondary
structures, it even seems possible that some cyclo￾philins may act as chaperones by transiently as￾sociating with the Gly-Pro sequences of folding
proteins and promoting their intramolecular fold￾ing by shielding one face of the unfolded protein
against intermolecular aggregation.
In summary, we have demonstrated that the cy￾clophilin A active site mediates sequence-speci®c
binding of the HIV-1 capsid protein, recognizing
an exposed capsid loop sequence that spans resi￾dues Pro85 to Pro93. The capsid dipeptide, Gly89-
Pro90, forms the core recognition motif, with adja￾cent residues making a series of additional energe￾tically signi®cant interactions along the CypA
active site groove. We speculate that the HIV-1
CA/CypA interaction may serve as a paradigm for
sequence-speci®c protein recognition within the cy￾clophilin family, with Gly-Pro forming a general
cyclophilin recognition motif.
Materials and Methods
HIV-1 capsid protein expression and purification
Procedures used to express and purify the intact (CA)
and truncated (CA151) capsid proteins were similar and
are therefore described in detail only for the full-length
protein. The HIV-1NL4-3 capsid gene was ampli®ed from
proviral pNL4-3 DNA (Adachi et al., 1986; Myers et al.,
1995) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR
primers were designed to introduce NdeI and BamHI
cloning sites, a stop codon, and optimized E. coli codons
for the ®rst three amino acid residues (Sambrook et al.,
1989). The ampli®ed gene was subcloned into the phage
T7 RNA polymerase-based expression vector, pET3a
(Studier et al., 1990) and the resulting plasmid (WISP93-
73) was con®rmed by DNA sequencing. The expression
vector for the truncated CA151 protein (WISP95-69) was
constructed by introducing oligonuclotides encoding a
stop codon immediately following CA amino acid codon
151 and subcloning the coding region into pET11a.
Protein expression levels and fully puri®ed samples of
the HIV-1 capsid and CA151 proteins are shown in
Figure 2(a) and (b), respectively. BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells
harboring the expression plasmids were grown in LB
medium and capsid protein expression was induced late
in log-phase growth (A600 0.8; lane 1) by the addition
of isoproyl-b,D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a ®nal
concentration of 0.4 mM (1 mM for the pET11a ex￾pression constructs). Soluble capsid protein accumulated
to very high levels during the four hour incubation
period (Figure 2(a), lane 2). All steps in the protein puri-
®cation were performed at 4C. The cells were lysed in a
French press and the supernatant sonicated to reduce
viscosity. Insoluble material was removed by centrifu￾gation at 40,000 g for one hour and the CA protein was
concentrated by precipitation from 20% saturated am￾monium sulfate. CA was redissolved in a buffer of
25 mM KMops (pH 6.9)/5 mM b-mercaptoethanol and
puri®ed by cation-exchange chromatography on S￾Sepharose (Pharmacia). The protein eluted at 300 mM
NaCl during a 250 ml 0 to 1 M linear salt gradient. This
procedure typically yielded >30 mg of pure capsid pro￾tein per liter of E. coli culture. The recombinant protein
was characterized by N-terminal amino acid sequencing
(NH3-P-I-V), amino acid analysis, and electrospray mass
spectrometry (Mcalc25,603 g/mol, Mobs25,602(2) g/
mol). A non-native N-terminal methionine residue was
quantitatively (>97%) removed during protein ex￾pression and the primary sequence of the puri®ed re￾combinant protein was therefore identical with the
authentic HIV-1 capsid protein. The protein exhibits a
single major isoform in isoelectric focusing experiments
(pI  7.05). CA151 was also processed during expression
to produce a native N terminus, as analyzed by N-term￾inal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry
(Mcalc  16,701 g/mol, Mobs  16,700(4) g/mol).
DNA encoding HIV-1NL4-3 CA (encoding Gag resi￾dues 133 to 363), MA-CA (1 to 363), and CA-NC (133
to 499) was also subcloned into a pGEX2T (Pharmacia)
vector that was modi®ed to contain an in-frame NdeI
restriction site immediately downstream of the gluta￾thione-S-transferase gene (WISP94-18). The CA con￾struct was subsequently used as a template for PCR￾based or Muta-Gene Phagemid (Biorad) mutagenesis
(Kunkel et al., 1987), to produce the 17 mutant capsid
proteins used to examine the determinants of CypA
binding speci®city.
Human cyclophilin A expression and purification
The human CypA gene was ampli®ed in a PCR from
a HeLa cDNA pool (Stratagene). The ampli®ed DNA
fragment was subcloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of
pET3a (Studier et al., 1990) to create WISP94-1 (encoding
native CypA) and into the same sites in WISP94-18 to
create WISP94-57 (encoding GST-CypA). The cloned
human CypA genes were sequenced and corresponded
exactly to the published cDNA sequence of human T-cell
CypA (Haendler et al., 1987).
The induction and puri®cation of recombinant CypA
is shown in Figure 2(c). CypA expression was induced
late in log phase (lane 1) and the protein was allowed to
accumulate for four hours (lane 2). Soluble human CypA
was puri®ed to homogeneity by sequential ammonium
sulfate fractionation, cation-exchange and hydrophobic
chromatographies following a published procedure (Liu
et al., 1990). The puri®ed protein was isolated in reason￾able yields (typically 25 mg/l cells) and was character￾ized by N-terminal amino acid sequencing (NH3-
(M)VNP), amino acid analysis, and mass spectrometry
(Mcalc  18,013 g/mol; Mobs  18,012(1) g/mol). Ap￾proximately 15% of the protein molecules were missing
their N-terminal methionine residue (M  17,881(1) g/
mol), in good agreement with a previous report (Liu
et al., 1990).
The GST-CypA fusion protein produced from the ex￾pression vector WISP94-57 was puri®ed by glutathione
af®nity chromatography on G-Sepharose (Pharmacia).
The protein eluted at a glutathione concentration of
6 mM from a linear gradient of 0 to 10 mM glutathione
in 100 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The protein was
subsequently dialyzed extensively to remove bound glu￾tathione and puri®ed to homogeneity by cation-exchange
chromatography on S-Sepharose (Pharmacia). The pro￾tein eluted at 400 mM NaCl from a linear gradient of 0
790 HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interactionto 1 M NaCl in 250 ml of 25 mM KMops (pH 6.9), 5 mM
b-mercaptoethanol).
Dynamic light-scattering spectroscopy
Dynamic light-scattering was performed to determine
the oligomeric states of the CA and CA151 proteins using
a Dynapro-801 light-scattering instrument (Protein Sol￾utions Inc.). Proteins were dissolved in 10 mM potassium
phosphate (pH 6.5), 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol at concen￾trations of 200 mM CA and 158 mM CA151. At least eight
measurements were made and averaged for each sample.
Protein molecular masses were estimated by assuming
globular protein structures and errors are reported as the
standard deviation between the independent measure￾ments.
Equilibrium sedimentation
Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to quantify
the oligomerization of CA and CA151. Centrifugation ex￾periments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-A
ultracentrifuge operating at rotor speeds of 20,000 (CA)
or 25,000 (CA151) rpm. The proteins were centrifuged at
20C in 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 100 mM
NaCl, 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Absorbance pro®les
were measured at 280 nm and were collected every four
hours until protein distributions had reached equili￾brium. After 24 hours, eight scans along the cell radius
were collected with a step size of 0.003 cm, averaged,
and corrected for background absorbance against a buf￾fer blank.
Equilibrium distributions were ®t to the single homo￾geneous species model or to a monomer-dimer model as
described (McRorie & Voelker, 1993), using the Microca￾lorigin non-linear least-squares ®tting algorithm pro￾vided within the XL-A data analysis software. A solvent
density of 1.0052 g mlÿ1 was used and partial speci®c vo￾lume estimates of 0.737 ml gÿ1 (CA) and 0.740 ml gÿ1
(CA151) were derived from the amino acid compositions
of the two proteins (Laue et al., 1992).
Titration calorimetry
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed
at 20.0C using a MicroCal Omega titration calorimeter.
Two different titrations were performed: (1) 632 mM
CA151 was titrated into 59 mM CypA; and (2) 661 mM
CypA was titrated into 59 mM CA. Each titration con￾sisted of 15 injections of 20 ml, made every ®ve minutes,
into a reaction cell volume of 1.296 ml. All proteins were
dissolved in buffered solutions of 100 mM KCl, 25 mM
KPO4 (pH 6.5), 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Reaction heats
were baseline-corrected manually using the Origin TC
software, corrected by subtraction of the appropriate
blank titrations, and integrated. Thermodynamic par￾ameters for the binding reactions were derived by ®tting
the corrected binding isotherms to single-site binding
models as described (Wiseman et al., 1989), with stoichi￾ometries (n), enthalpies (H), and equilibrium dis￾sociation constants (Kd) allowed to ¯oat during non￾linear least-squares ®ts of the data. Titrations were per￾formed under conditions where the product of the bind￾ing constant and the reservoir macromolecule
concentration (c) was approximately 4, and can therefore
be expected to provide reasonable estimates of the bind￾ing equilibria.
Surface plasmon resonance measurements
SPR measurements were performed on a BIACORE
2000 biosensor, with CM5 research-grade chips, NHS/
EDC coupling reagents, ethanolamine, anti-GST mono￾clonal antibody and P20 from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Swe￾den). The binding assays were performed by capturing
either GST-CypA or GST-CA onto the chip surfaces and
measuring the interaction with either CA151 or CypA in
solution. A monoclonal antibody against GST (anti-GST)
was immobilized on the sensor surface using a standard
amine coupling procedure (LoÈfaÊ s & Johnsson, 1990). The
carboxymethyl dextran surface was activated with a
seven minute injection of a mixture of NHS/EDC (each
at 0.1 M in water). The antibody was immobilized at the
same level (5000 RU) on different ¯ow-cells by expos￾ing the activated surfaces to a 10 mg/ml sample in
10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) for 300 seconds. After
the coupling step, the remaining activated groups were
blocked with a seven minute wash of 1 M ethanolamine
(pH 8.2), followed by several ten second washes with
glycine (pH 2.0) to remove non-covalently bound
protein.
All subsequent binding experiments were performed
in buffer containing 100 mM sodium chloride, 25 mM
potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol,
and 0.005% (v/v) P20 at pH 6.5, unless otherwise indi￾cated. Puri®ed GST-CypA was captured onto anti-GST
surfaces at two different densities by injecting super￾natant containing GST-CypA for varying lengths of time
at a ¯ow-rate of 5 ml/minute. Equal quantities of recom￾binant GST alone were captured onto control surfaces.
To perform the kinetic measurements for CA151 binding,
the ¯ow-path was changed to include all four ¯ow-cells
and the ¯ow-rate was increased to 50 ml/minute: 22 ml of
CA151 at concentrations of 57, 19, 6.3 and 2.1 mM along
with a buffer blank were injected over all four ¯ow-cells
in series. Since the response returned rapidly to baseline,
no regeneration step was required between CA151 injec￾tions. Each binding experiment was repeated two or
three times in random order. Analogous experiments
were performed at pH 5.5, 7.5 and 8.5.
Similar binding experiments were performed for the
GST-CA constructs by capturing these proteins onto the
sensor surface and monitoring the interaction with CypA
in solution. In this case, native and mutant GST-CA pro￾teins were captured directly from crude E. coli super￾natants. To examine CypA binding, 30 ml of CypA
solution was injected at concentrations of 114, 38, 12 and
4.2 mM, along with a buffer blank. Each CypA injection
was repeated three times in random order over two
different densities of GST-CA. Control experiments were
performed using a recombinant GST to ensure that
CypA did not interact with this protein or the anti-GST
antibody on the sensor surface.
To analyze the interactions recorded on the biosen￾sor, the raw response data collected from the individ￾ual ¯ow-cells were baseline-corrected by subtracting
the average of the response over 60 seconds prior to
sample injection. To correct for refractive index
change and non-speci®c binding, the response col￾lected over a blank surface was subtracted from the
¯ow-cell containing the GST-fusion protein. The re￾sponse at equilibrium, which represents the level of
CA/CypA complex formation, was determined by
averaging the signal obtained over ®ve to ten seconds
after the start of the injection. Equilibrium dissociation
constants (Kd) for each interaction were determined
from non-linear least-squares curve ®tting of the data
HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 791to a single-site binding model as described in the
BIACORE manual.
