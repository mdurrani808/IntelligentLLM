Abstract
The interaction between the Staphylococcal Protein A (SpA) domain B (the basis of the Affibody)
molecule and the Fc of IgG is key to the use of Affibodies in affinity chromatography and in
potential therapies against certain inflammatory diseases. Despite its importance and four￾decade history, to our knowledge this interaction has never been affinity matured. We elucidate
reasons why single-substitutions in the SpA which improve affinity to Fc may be very rare, and
also discover substitutions which potentially serve several engineering purposes. We used a vari￾ation of FoldX to predict changes in protein–protein-binding affinity, and produce a list of 41
single-amino acid substitutions on the SpA molecule, of which four are near wild type (wt) and
five are at most a factor of four from wt affinity. The nine substitutions include one which
removes lysine, and several others which change charge. Subtle modulations in affinity may be
useful for modifying column elution conditions. The method is applicable to other protein–pro￾tein systems, providing molecular insights with lower workload than existing experimental
techniques.

Introduction
Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (SpA) is a virulence factor
which counters the host immune system in multiple ways. SpA com￾prises five homologous domains joined by flexible linkers. The
domains are small, easy to express and bind IgG1 with high affinity
at the CH2/CH3 cleft. Of these, domain B has attracted particular
interest because it is closest to the consensus sequence of all such
domains, lacks methionine residues which would be susceptible to
cyanogen bromide cleavage (Nilsson et al., 1987) and has been
crystallized with Fc (Deisenhofer, 1981). It is the basis of domain Z,
an antibody mimetic scaffold marketed as the Affibody molecule
(Löfblom et al., 2010). The Affibody scaffold has A1V and G29A
mutations with respect to domain B. This molecule without further
modifications will be referred to here as wild type (wt). The purpose
of G29A is to modify the N-G (asparagine-glycine) dipeptide
sequence which is susceptible to hydroxylamine cleavage, turning it
to N-A. G29A (Nilsson et al., 1987) also destroys binding against
the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) of VH3 antibodies, which occurs

an AccI DNA restriction site, originally used to polymerize domain
Z, and does not affect binding (Nilsson et al., 1987). Domain Z (or
Affibody molecule) and domain B are thus very similar.
There are several reasons to engineer the interaction between
SpA and Fc. SpA circulating in patient bloodstream has an anti￾inflammatory effect (MacLellan et al., 2011). Five-domain SpA is
the basis of the proposed PRTX-100 drug (Bernton et al., 2014)
against autoimmune inflammatory diseases. The smaller Affibody
molecule also has potential as a therapy against autoimmune dis￾eases. Like SpA itself, it binds the Fc of IgG1, 2 and 4 (but not 3)
with high affinity (Table I) (Goding, 1978; Bottomley et al., 1994),
on a epitope that is overlapping with the binding site of the neonatal
Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn regulates levels of IgG in serum, by rescu￾ing IgGs from lysosomal degradation (Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007).
This mechanism maintains a high level of autoantibodies in auto￾immune diseases. Knocking out FcRn decreases levels of autoimmune
IgGs, and decreases symptoms of autoimmune disease in mice
(Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007). One potential therapeutic strategy to
ameliorate the symptoms associated with these debilitating diseases
could be blockage of FcRn with an inhibitor, be it an antibody (Liu
et al., 2007) or possibly an anti-FcRn Affibody (Seijsing et al., 2014).
Antibodies are large and hard to express, while the anti-FcRn
Affibodies have relatively low affinity, no better than 12 nM (Seijsing
et al., 2014). Alternatively, one could block the FcRn-binding site on
the antibody, using domain Z, the approach we consider here.
Increasing the affinity of this domain could mean increased efficacy
and lower dosage requirements. The Affibody molecule is also used in
MabSelect affinity columns; here modified affinity could lead to
advantages in purification and ease of elution.

2 M.Nosrati et al.Since the Affibody has many applications, there is occasionally a
need to attach prosthetic groups such as PEG. Cysteines are often
used as targets for such chemical modifications; lysines are inconveni￾ent because there are two lysines which should not be modified
because they are in the Fc-binding site. It would be good to have two
orthogonal functionalization sites, e.g. cysteines and lysines. With the
current technique, we can remove lysines from the binding site, and
then introduce them in more convenient locations for that purpose.
Despite the tremendous economic incentive, the interaction
between SpA domains and IgG Fc has not been engineered to
improve affinity in the literature (Cedergren et al., 1993). In this
work we discuss the possible reasons the affinity of this interaction
may be difficult to increase.
Protein mutations which result in measured affinity comparable
to wt are referred to as neutral. Such mutations are potentially use￾ful for many goals in biotechnology and basic research. They appear
to lie on the evolutionary trajectory connecting related proteins of
different function (Wagner, 2008). Direct effects can be obtained by
introduction of a certain residue at a specific site, e.g. tryptophan,
which can be used for monitoring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence.
A broader repertoire of effects can be achieved by functionalization,
involving chemical modification of side chains through site specific
reagents. Functionalization may require the introduction of desired
side chains in specific regions of the protein and their removal from
others. Reagents selective for the amino acid of interest can then be
used to introduce desired features at the specific sites. For example,
to extend the plasma stability of Pegvisomant via PEGylation
(Abuchowski et al., 1977) at lysine residues, a lysine had to be
removed from the high-affinity receptor-binding site and replaced by
a alternative side chain that was expected not to influence the affin￾ity for the receptor (although the effect was never rigorously pre￾dicted or measured) (Pradhananga et al., 2002). The freedom to
introduce functionalization sites at or near the interface can also be
useful, e.g. to attach a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer
donor or acceptor which detects binding at the interface.
Many other characteristics can also be influenced by engineering.
Proteins often need to be thermodynamically stable, soluble, not
immunogenic, and/or specific. Stability can be modified by changes in
the amino acid sequence, as methionines and certain dipeptide
sequences are susceptible to chemical cleavage, and often need to be
removed (Nilsson et al., 1987). Sometimes the mutations have to be
introduced in (Pradhananga et al., 2002) or near (Nilsson et al., 1987)
protein-binding sites without loss of binding. Lastly, a subtle and con￾trolled reduction of binding affinity can sometimes be useful, for
instance to enable milder elution conditions in affinity purification.
FoldX predicts the change in free energy of protein–protein bind￾ing (Li et al., 2015) (ΔΔG) upon mutation. Binding energy com￾prises non-bonded (including electrostatic, van der Waals, and
related), bonded (related to quantum mechanical interactions
between chemically connected atoms), entropy change and poten￾tially changes in protein protonation state upon binding (Li et al.,
2015). When two bound proteins separate, the interactions between
the two can be replaced by interactions between protein and water.
Modeling this adequately is crucial, but using explicit water is often
less effective (and almost always more computationally expensive)
than using implicit representations (Li et al., 2015), as is done in the
FoldX (Guerois et al., 2002) and other (Petukh et al., 2015) poten￾tials. Using a variation of FoldX, we predicted ΔΔG for all possible
single-substitution mutations in SpA at the Fc-binding interface, a
process we call MultiScanning. We expressed single-substitution
mutants with low ΔΔGZEMu and experimentally measured the
affinities against Fc. None of these increased affinity, suggesting that
affinity-improving substitutions are rare for this system. We found
several neutral mutations which alter interface properties such as
charge and hydrophobicity. The results are applicable for engineer￾ing other protein–protein interactions for many purposes.
Results
To predict possible substitutions in the Affibody molecule which
maintain affinity for Fc, we performed MultiScanning. Figure 2
shows the ΔΔGZEMu of Fc binding resulting from all possible single￾residue substitutions in the Fc-binding site of the Affibody molecule.
Coordinates for the Affibody molecule/IgG1 complex were taken
from Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure 1FC2 (Deisenhofer, 1981).
Among the interface residues, we can observe that Positions 5, 6, 7,
9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 28, 31, 32, 34 and 35 have substitutions that sat￾isfy ΔΔGZEMu ≤ −1.0 kcal/mol (Fig. 2).
We used ΔΔGZEMu and qualitative criteria (see Criteria for manual
selection of putative tight-binding variants) to select variants to express
and evaluate using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) in
Round 0. We used the same manual criteria to select variants to express
and evaluate by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensor technol￾ogy in Round 1. Lastly, we used only the criterion that ΔΔGZEMu ≤
−1.0 kcal/mol, to select mutants to evaluate by SPR in Round 2.
Round 0: Affinity estimation of manually selected
variants using FACS
In Round 0 we selected six variants (I31F, N28L, L17Y, K35Y,
Q10L and Q9K) for evaluation by FACS (Löfblom et al., 2005).
The selection was based on ZEMu energy and visual inspection as
described in the section Criteria for manual selection of putative
tight-binding variants. We also selected Q10K as a negative control,
based on higher ΔΔGZEMu. ΔΔGZEMu and visual inspection obser￾vations for Round 0 variants are given in Supplementary Table S1.
Two of the variants, L17Y and Q9K, appeared to bind well by
FACS, possibly better than wt. I31F appeared to bind with affinity
only slightly lower than wt (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, the
variability of the measurement did not support a definitive conclu￾sion. This motivated retesting of L17Y and Q9K by SPR in Round
1, at which point these two were found to be poor binders (Fig. 3A).
I31F, N28L, K35Y and Q10L were eventually retested by SPR
in Round 2, and also found to be poor binders. Q10K was never
tested by SPR because it was a putative negative control, whereas in
Round 1 we chose the already-characterized L17D (Cedergren et al.,
1993) as our negative control.
The discrepancy between FACS and subsequent SPR measure￾ments was most remarkable for I31F, L17Y and Q9K. It should
however be noted that the affibodies are expressed as fusion proteins
on the bacterial surface and that the flow-cytometry experiment
results in avidity effects from the bivalent IgG binding to the cells.
This may explain some of the discrepancy.
Round 1: Affinity measurement of manually selected
variants using SPR
In Round 1 we expressed the wt, L17D negative control, L17Y and
Q9K (from Round 0), and five new Affibody variants (Q9D, Q10D,
Q10N, Q10H and N28Y). As in Round 0, the five new variants
were selected according to Criteria for manual selection of putative
tight-binding variants. ΔΔGZEMu and visual inspection observations
for Round 1 variants are given in Supplementary Table S2. We
Insights into the Affibody-Fc interaction 3measured the Affibody variants’ affinities against human IgG1 using
SPR (see Methods). A dilution series of the proteins (6.25–100 nM)
was injected over immobilized IgG1, without regenerating the sur￾face between injections (Fig. 3A). Based on a qualitative analysis of
their SPR signal levels at steady state and apparent dissociation
rates, the Round 1 variants showed low (Q9D, Q9K, Q10N, Q10H,
L17Y and N28Y) or undetectable (Q10D and L17D) affinity for
IgG1 relative to wt Affibody molecule. Thus all Round 1 substitu￾tions reduced the affinity of the Affibody molecule for Fc. We were
not able to quantify the KD (equilibrium dissociation constants) of
these mutants because they are higher (>50 nM) than half the max￾imal SpA concentration (100 nM) used in the experiments.
Round 2: SPR affinity measurement of variants
selected on the basis of ZEMu energy only
As all the substitutions tested in Round 1 reduced the affinity between
the Affibody and Fc, a new selection strategy was used. In Round 2
we expressed all the Affibody variants that satisfied ΔΔGZEMu ≤
−1.0 kcal/mol, and which were not tested in Round 1. In the SPR
analysis (see Methods) we injected the proteins as analytes at 100 nM
over a sensor surface with immobilized human IgG1 (Fig. 3B). In this
experiment the surface was regenerated between each injection to
make sure that no protein stuck to the surface, potentially resulting in
a heterogeneous surface. The Affibody molecule variants were classi￾fied according to their interaction characteristics relative wt Affibody,
here based on a qualitative analysis of their signal levels at steady
state, and apparent dissociation rates (Fig. 3B,C). Most variants
exhibited qualitatively low affinities and rapid dissociation rates
(Fig. 3B). However, nine variants had higher affinities and slower dis￾sociation rates (Fig. 3C). This class was further evaluated quantita￾tively relative to wt Affibody, by injecting the proteins over
immobilized IgG1 in a serial dilution experiment using 3.15–50 nM
proteins, without regeneration between injections (Fig. 3D,E). By
qualitatively comparing the observed binding levels and the apparent
dissociation rates of the sensorgrams, we found five variants (F5M,
N6Q, K7D, Y14F, N28F) that appeared to form a subset (of the
nine) with somewhat lower affinity than the wt Affibody (Fig. 3D).
The other four variants (N6F, N11F, Q32K and Q32L) were qualita￾tively estimated to have an affinity similar to that of wt Affibody
(Fig. 3E). To quantify the affinity (defined as KD), we performed non￾linear regression analysis of the sensorgrams. We estimated the associ￾ation and dissociation rate constants (ka and kd) by fitting the SPR
sensorgrams to a 1:1 interaction model (Table I). Comparing the dis￾sociation constants (KD), the Affibody variants N6F, N11F, Q32K
and N6Q had low nanomolar affinity against IgG1, near that of the
wt protein. Note the final quantitative differs from the initial qualita￾tive grouping.

Fig. 2 Scanning possible substitutions in the Fc-binding site on Domain B with ZEMu to predict the ΔΔG of Fc binding. Positions scanned were those that were
within 6 Å of Fc. Lower axis: wt residue type + residue number of positions that were substituted. Residue numbers are in domain B numbering, add 119 to
obtain numbering used in PDB structure 1FC2. Left axis: Substituted residue type, grouped by physicochemical class. Each residue is substituted to each of 19
alternatives (the 20th is the wt). Small filled diamonds: vertical displacement indicates ΔΔGZEMu. Upper dashed line, each substituted residue type, ΔΔG = 0
kcal/mol. Lower dashed line, each substituted residue type, ΔΔG = −1.5 kcal/mol. Open circles: ΔΔGZEMu < −1.5 kcal/mol. Open squares: −1.0 kcal/mol >
ΔΔGZEMu ≥ −1.5 kcal/mol. Note that some of the 425 variants did not converge. In most cases this was due to difficulty in resolving steric clashes, hence this
occurred more often for bulky substitutions such as R, K and W. Note also the large number of low-energy substitutions at Position 10, discussed in the text.

Insights into the Affibody-Fc interaction 5Discussion
Protein Engineering is a central topic in Biotechnology. There are
many properties to be optimized in therapeutic, diagnostic, or indus￾trial proteins. On top of such engineering goals, affinity against a spe￾cified binding partner must often be conserved or modulated. In this
work we scanned an entire interface computationally and produced a
short list of substitutions with low predicted binding energy.
In this demonstration, we confirmed experimentally that 9 ZEMu￾predicted Affibody variants were able to bind with strong affinity to
human IgG1, including K7D which removed lysine, Q32K which
introduced lysine elsewhere, and several that changed other properties
including size, aromaticity and hydrophobicity. Four of the 9 variants
were confirmed to bind with near wt affinity, however none of them
had affinity significantly stronger than wt. wt Affibody molecule dis￾plays an affinity already in the low nanomolar to subnanomolar
range, and the interface is dominated by the hydrophobic effect, with
no direct way to create new salt bridges. The already-high affinity
(Goding, 1978; Bottomley et al., 1994) and interface characteristics
likely explain why further affinity improvements are difficult to attain.
In protein–protein systems, substitutions which reduce typically
greatly outnumber those that increase affinity. Validation datasets of
experimental ΔΔG values compiled from the literature (Moal and
Fernández-Recio, 2012) may be enriched in affinity-increasing muta￾tions (compared to random mutagenesis), as many investigators
actively seek such mutations. Since any ΔΔG prediction method has
error bars, the large number of affinity-reducing mutations means many
opportunities for false positives. In a system with scarce possibilities
for improving affinity, all of the predicted affinity-improving muta￾tions could in fact be affinity-reducing or neutral. This appears to
have happened in the present work.
We note that in Round 0 (comprising six putative affinity￾improving single-substituted variants) and Round 1 (including two
variants from Round 0, plus five new ones), we used human judg￾ment in addition to ZEMu energy as a filter to choose mutants to
express, whereas in Round 2 (comprising the four variants from
Round 0 which were not tested in Round 1, plus 30 new variants)
the selection was based only on a ZEMu energy cutoff (ΔΔGZEMu ≤
−1.0 kcal/mol). All nine of the better binders (Fig. 3C), however,
were among the 30 new, systematically selected variants in Round
2. To be clear, a total of 11 variants were manually selected, of
which none appear among the better binders shown in (Fig. 3C).
The nine higher-affinity substitutions were all on the outer rim (solv￾ent-exposed portion) (Bogan and Thorn, 1998) of the interface
(Fig. 4), whereas the manually selected substitutions were all closer
to the core (buried portion) of the interface (with the exception of
N28L). This suggests that the reason the manually selected substitu￾tions were unsuccessful was related to a selection bias for residue
positions which were in the core, where there are more intermolecu￾lar contacts. In an optimized system with a well-packed interface
core, neutral mutations may be easier to find on the rim. However
though it has been shown that rim positions can be modified with a
lesser energetic effect than the core positions (Bogan and Thorn,
1998), it does not follow that all rim mutations will be neutral. For
example, the substitutions N11F and Q32K have high but N11P
and Q32L have low and medium affinities, respectively. Similarly
N6F and N6Q have high, but N6T has low affinity. N28F has
medium but N28C, L, P and Y all have low affinity. F5M has
medium, but F5Q has low affinity.
We investigated the possibility of non-perturbative effects of the
mutations on SpA monomer stability with Molecular Dynamics
(MD), however secondary structure changes (data not shown) did
not correlate with experimentally observed affinity changes. MD
was not used by any of the competitors in the CAPRI Round 26
scoring competition (Moretti et al., 2013), and in our hands deterio￾rates the results of a subsequent FoldX calculation (Dourado and
Flores, 2014). Other non-perturbative effects, for example related to
the interaction with Fc, may be at play.
The rarity of neutral compared with affinity-reducing substitu￾tions, combined with the known error range of ZEMu, means that
reduced-affinity variants appearing on the low side of their
ΔΔGZEMu error bars are likely to outnumber neutral or increased￾affinity variants. This explains why several substitutions have pre￾dicted affinity higher than wt (Fig. 2) when experimentally none
were significantly higher than wt.
ZEMu found that Position 10 had an unusually large number of
predicted low-energy variants; we expressed 11 of them and found
none were good binders. This many false positives at a single pos￾ition has statistical significance (P-value of 0.04 by the cumulative
hypergeometric function). The explanation could be that the wt
Affibody molecule stability was overestimated by ZEMu, making
many of the variants appear comparatively more favorable.
However not all cases in which many substitutions at a single pos￾ition are predicted to be favorable, will be artifacts. There are docu￾mented cases in which the wt residue type at a certain position
appears to disfavor binding, compared to Alanine (Cunningham and
Wells, 1989) or potentially many possible substitutions.
Our findings related to Position 10 underscore the merit of limiting
the number of substitutions that are expressed at a single position; in
any case only one will likely be used in the end. Conversely one may
consider testing at least one substitution at each position, even if all sub￾stitutions at that position have high energy, because the wt energy could
be underestimated. We suggest expressing only single-substitution var￾iants initially, as one affinity-destroying, expressed together with an
affinity-improving substitution, may mask the latter. Expressing a suffi￾cient number is important; the seven substitutions we expressed in
Round 1 were all poor binders whereas the more numerous variants
evaluated in Round 2 included several neutral substitutions. An object￾ive selection criterion is important, as again no neutral substitutions
were found in the manually selected Rounds 0 and 1, whereas Round
2, based on ZEMu energy alone, was profitable.
Residue conservation was not useful for choosing mutations in
this case. As mentioned Domain Z is based on the consensus
sequence. The nine mutations with high and medium affinity were at
Positions 5, 6, 7, 11, 14, 28 and 32 (Table I), which are absolutely
conserved according to the alignment of (Santos-Júnior et al., 2016).
However all positions in this sequence region are highly or abso￾lutely conserved, since all the sequences are aligned across strains of
Staphylococcus aureus (Santos-Júnior et al., 2016). Aligning across
structural domains in a single strain also shows high conservation.
Here positions 5, 6, 7, 11 are highly conserved, but the best mutants
do not correspond to an observed amino acid polymorphism; 14,
28, 32 are absolutely conserved (Nilsson et al., 1987).
Our results suggest there are few single-substitution mutations to
be made in SpA that would increase affinity against Fc, due to an
already-high affinity (reported here and elsewhere) (Santos-Júnior
et al., 2016) and a mostly hydrophobic interface spanned by only
four hydrogen bonds (Goding, 1978; Bottomley et al., 1994) with
no clear potential to form new salt bridges (Fig. 5). We did find nine
SpA mutations which keep Fc binding in the range of 1-4X of wt
affinity but which change other interface properties. Some of the
mutants which made reductions in affinity (some very subtle, others
6 M.Nosrati et al.greater) may be useful to enable gentler (e.g. pH closer to neutral)
elution conditions in SpA affinity chromatography. Since we used
ZEMu screening, the number of proteins expressed and evaluated
was relatively small, making this an inexpensive method. We pro￾posed rules for productively selecting mutants to test.
Materials and methods
Prediction of binding energy
ZEMu is a model building method, that is it can generate an energy￾minimized mutant structure given coordinates of the correspond￾ing wt structure (Deisenhofer, 1981). In ZEMu, we specified a flexi￾bility zone of five residues, consecutive in sequence, centered about
the residue to be substituted. Residues in this zone had torsional
freedom, while the remainder of the protein was rigid and fixed. We
also specified a physics zone inside of which PARM99 electrostatic
and van der Waals forces were active. The physics zone included all
residues within 14Å of the flexibility zone. We then energy￾minimized by computing the dynamics of this system for 20 ps. In
prior work we found this was enough to ensure convergence; fluctua￾tions in individual results can be expected with slight variation of run
time and other conditions, though average values (RMSE) are not
noticeably affected (Dourado and Flores, 2014). The protein–protein
interaction energy of the thus-equilibrated complex was then evalu￾ated with FoldX3 (Dourado and Flores, 2014). We conducted the
equilibration and FoldX calculation for the wt and the mutant com￾plex to obtain ΔGwt and ΔGmutant, respectively. The difference pro￾vided an estimate of ΔΔGexperiment (Guerois et al., 2002):
ΔΔ ≡ Δ – Δ ≈ ΔΔ G G GG ZEMu mutant wt experiment.
ZEMu gave an improvement in the RMSE of a subsequent
FoldX3 calculation (Dourado and Flores, 2014). Performance of
FoldX4 (the current release) differs somewhat from that of FoldX3
(Xiong et al., 2017), and does not appear to benefit from ZEMu.
MultiScanning
We define MultiScanning as in silico saturation (i.e. to all 19 alter￾nate amino acid types) mutagenesis (and ΔΔG prediction) using
ZEMu, over the entire protein-binding site of one of the interacting
proteins. The binding site is defined as all residues within 6 Å of
their interaction partner. In the case of the Affibody molecule this
means 25 residue positions, for a total of 425 mutations.
MultiScanning is implemented in our breeder job management soft￾ware, which uses MMB not only as an executable but also as an
Application Programming Interface. We used PDB structure 1FC2
(Xiong et al., 2017) as input for the ΔΔG prediction.

Affibody: gray cartoon. High-, medium- and low-affinity Affibody substitutions: thick transparent red, medium transparent orange and thin opaque blue licorice,
respectively; residue substitution labels also correspondingly red, orange and blue. Note high- and medium-affinity substitutions are on the solvent-exposed
rim of the interface, whereas most low-affinity substitutions are in the interface core. Manually selected substitutions: balls colored by atom type. Note all manu￾ally selected substitutions are low affinity, though medium-affinity N28F shares she same position as manually selected N28Y. Note also that manually selected
substitutions are in the interface core, except for N28Y. Near-neutral substitutions are harder to find in the interface core.
Insights into the Affibody-Fc interaction 7Criteria for manual selection of putative tight-binding
variants
In Rounds 0 and 1 we selected single mutants of 1FC2 based on the
following quantitative and qualitative criteria:
• ΔΔGZEMu ≤ −1.0 kcal/mol.
• Do not mutate to methionine, proline, or glycine.
• Do not mutate from proline or glycine.
• Rationalizable by visual inspection, in terms of arguable physical
interactions.
• Include as many different residue positions as possible (avoid
multiple substitutions at a single site).
We avoided prolines and glycines to preserve backbone structure,
and methionines to prevent unwanted oxidation to methionine sulf￾oxide (MetO). Rationalization by visual inspection refers to examin￾ing the equilibrated structure and seeking to explain the obtained
ΔΔGZEMu. We identified possible favorable electrostatic, van der
Waals, electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interac￾tions (or lack of interactions) between the substituted residue and
neighboring residues on Fc. By applying these selection criteria we
obtained lists of selected single mutants. These are given, along with
the qualitative results of our visual inspection, in Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2, for Rounds 0 and 1, respectively.
Protein expression and purification
Wild type and variants of Affibody molecule sequence were gener￾ated by gene synthesis and cloned into the pET-19b plasmid (con￾taining ampicillin resistance and a lacI promoter) by Genscript. The
genes were transformed into BL21-DE3. The cells were grown in TB
(Terrific broth) supplemented with 2 mM MgCl2, 100 μg/ml ampicil￾lin and a trace-element mixture (50 μM FeCl3, 20 μM CaCl2, 10 μM
MnCl2, 10 μM ZnCl2, 2 μM CoCl2, 2 μM CuCl2, 2 μM NiCl2, 2 μM
Na2MoO4, 2 μM Na2SeO3 and 2 μM H3BO3). At OD600 ~0.6 we
induced the cells by adding 1 mM IPTG and incubated for 4 h at
room temperature. The cells where harvested by centrifugation and
frozen at −80°C until purification.
The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL extraction buffer
(20 mM Sodium phosphate, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imid￾azole, 0.9 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.14 mg/ml DNase I, 1 mM EDTA and
0.5% w/v Triton X-100). The cell suspension was incubated at
room temperature with constant agitation for 1 h followed by centri￾fugation at 4200 g at 4°C for 20 min. The clarified lysate was added
to 0.5 ml Ni sepharose HP slurry (GE Healthcare) and allowed to
bind for 1 h with constant agitation. We followed with two washing
steps with 20 column volumes of wash buffer buffer (20 mM
Sodium phosphate, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). We
then eluted the column with wash buffer supplemented with
500 mM imidazole, 0.5 ml fractions were collected and stored at
−80°C.
Buffer exchanges of the proteins were performed using Pierce
centrifuge columns from Thermo Fischer. Buffer exchanges of the
proteins were performed using Zeba™ desalting centrifuge columns
from Thermo Fischer. Proteins were transferred to SPR running buf￾fer (0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA pH 7.4)
and IgG1 to 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH7.4. Concentration measure￾ment of proteins was done by Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) assay.
Fluorescence activated cell Sorting
On-cell affinity determination was analyzed using Gallios flow cyt￾ometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, US) and has been previ￾ously described (Fleetwood et al. 2014). Briefly, 20 μl of cells from
induced culture were spun down and labeled with 4.3 nM biotiny￾lated human IgG and incubated on rotamixer for 45 min. The excess
IgG was subsequently washed away. Detection of IgG binding and
cell expression was done by labeling cells with 10 μg/ml Strepavidin
R-phycoerythrin (Invitrogen, Göteborg, Sweden) and 10 μg/ml
human serum albumin-alexa488, this was incubated on ice for
25 min. The cells were transferred to 5 ml round bottomed falcon
tube and analyzed using a Gallios flow cytometer.
SPR measurements
SPR measurements were carried out at 25°C using a Biacore T200
instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). IgG1 purchased from
Sigma Aldrich (Human IgG1, Kappa, product number I 5154) was
immobilized to a CM5 chip by standard amine coupling to 6730
RU (Round 1) or 6900 RU (Round 2) using 10 mM sodium
acetate buffer pH 5 as immobilization buffer. Affibody variants
were injected either as one single concentration (100 nM) or in sin￾gle cycle kinetic experiments, where five concentrations of the ana￾lyte run in HBS-EP running buffer (0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M
NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v Tween 20 pH 7.4) using a flow
rate of 30 μl/min. Instead of using regeneration to clean the surface
(observed as returning to baseline between sample runs), long stabil￾izing periods of 1800 s and 3 buffer injections were performed
between sample runs. The sensorgrams were corrected for buffer
bulk effects and unspecific binding of the samples to the chip matrix
by blank and reference surface subtraction (subtraction of inacti￾vated and deactivated flow cell channel). The data were analyzed
using Biacore T200 evaluation software version 1.0. Simple 1:1
binding models were used for curve-fitting depending on the
analysis.
