ABSTRACT: The immunity protein Im2 can bind and inhibit the noncognate endonuclease domain of the
bacterial toxin colicin E9 with a Kd of 19 nM, 6 orders of magnitude weaker than that of the cognate
immunity protein Im9 with which it shares 68% sequence identity. Previous work from our laboratory
has shown that the specificity differences of these four-helix immunity proteins is due almost entirely to
helix II which is largely variable in sequence in the immunity protein family. From alanine scanning
mutagenesis of Im9 in conjunction with high-field NMR data, a dual recognition model for colicin￾immunity protein specificity has been proposed whereby the conserved residues of helix III of the immunity
protein act as the anchor of the endonuclease binding site while the variable residues of helix II control
the specificity of the protein-protein interaction. In this work, we identify three residues (at positions
33, 34, and 38) in helix II which define the specificity differences of Im2 and Im9 for colicin E9 and,
using alanine mutagenesis of the putative endonuclease binding surface of Im2, compare the distribution
of binding energies for conserved and nonconserved sites in both immunity proteins. This comparison
highlights the conserved residues of both Im2 and Im9 as the major determinants of E9 DNase binding
energy. Conversely, the nonconserved, specificity-determining residues only contribute to the E9 DNase
binding energy in the cognate Im9 protein, while in the noncognate immunity protein Im2, they either
destabilize the complex or do not contribute to the binding energy. This comparative alanine scan of two
immunity proteins therefore supports the dual recognition mechanism of selectivity in colicin-immunity
protein interactions and provides a basis for understanding specificity in other protein-protein interaction
systems involving structurally conserved protein families.
Specific macromolecular association involves the interplay
of conserved and nonconserved structural elements which
together define the specificity of the interaction. In protein￾DNA recognition, for example, the conserved structure is
the DNA duplex itself while the bases are the nonconserved
element which offer the potential for sequence-specific
interactions with protein. Unlike the major groove of DNA,
the interfaces of protein-protein complexes are relatively
flat undulating surfaces with little regular topology (1),
making it difficult to ascertain how a protein might distin￾guish the appropriate binding partner from numerous alterna￾tives which may be conserved in both sequence and structure.
Such discrimination lies at the heart of signal transduction,
hormone-receptor interactions, and the immune system, and
it is this question of discrimination we have been addressing
using bacterial toxin-inhibitor protein complexes from the
colicin family of protein toxins.
Colicins are a diverse family of plasmid-encoded protein
toxins synthesized by bacteria at times of nutrient or
environmental stress as a means of reducing competition
from other microbial populations (2, 3). We have been
studying the E group colicins which first bind the vitamin
B12 transporter, BtuB, in combination with the porin OmpF
(4, 5) and then translocate across the outer membrane with
the aid of the periplasmic proteins Tol Q, R, A, and B (6).
Several cytotoxic activities have been ascribed to colicins,
the most common being pore-forming ionophores that
depolarize the cell by forming voltage-gated channels in the
inner membrane (7). E colicins can also traverse the inner
membrane and kill the cell through nuclease activity,
targetted toward either 16S ribosomal RNA (ColE3; 8, 9)
or the DNA of the bacterial chromosome (ColE2,1 ColE7,
ColE8, and ColE9; 10-13). It is on this latter group that
our work has been focused.

Published on Web 08/07/1998Colicin-producing bacteria are immune to the action of
their toxin because the cells also synthesize an immunity
protein (∼10 kDa) which binds to the cytotoxic domain and
neutralizes its activity (14, 15). In the case of the enzymatic
colicins (∼60 kDa), this complex is then released into the
surrounding medium and it is as a complex that cell killing
begins. An attractive feature of this system in terms of
studying specificity in protein-protein interactions is that
within the E group of colicins are four endonuclease-type
toxins each requiring a specific immunity protein (Im2, Im7,
Im8, and Im9). The 15 kDa endonuclease domains of the
toxins (which can be overexpressed and purified separately;
16) are ∼65% identical in sequence, while the immunity
protein family shares an overall sequence identity of ∼50%.
Since immunity proteins are inhibitors of both toxin and
endonuclease activity, in vivo and in vitro assays of
specificity are possible. Using such a combined approach,
we have shown that immunity proteins exhibit both high
affinity (17) and specificity (18) for their cognate colicins.
The affinity of the colicin E9-Im9 complex, for example,
is 0.1 fM in buffers with low ionic strengths, increasing to
18 fM in 200 mM salt. Nevertheless, other immunity
proteins can provide protection for colicin E9 in biological
plate assays, most often when overexpressed in bacterial
cells, and the strength of this cross-reactivity is related
directly to the in vitro binding affinity for that complex which
can have values between nanomolar and millimolar (18).
Therefore, the endonuclease colicins represent a unique
system with which to address questions of specificity in
protein-protein recognition since the affinities of these
complexes span a range of almost 12 orders of magnitude.
Structural information in combination with protein engi￾neering experiments is beginning to shed light on the
molecular mechanism of immunity protein specificity. Dif￾fracting crystals of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex have been
obtained (19), and the crystal structure of Im7 and solution
structure of Im9 have been published (20, 21). Both
immunity protein studies show the overall fold to be that of
a distorted four-helix bundle (Figure 1), and subsequent high￾field NMR data on Im9 binding to the 15 kDa E9 DNase
identified helices II and III as the putative DNase binding
surface (22). This was confirmed by alanine scanning
mutagenesis across the two helices of Im9 which also
quantitated their relative contribution to the binding energy
(23). The highly conserved residues of helix III are the major
determinants of complex stability, while the variable residues
of helix II play a significant but lesser role. This was an
intriguing observation since previous homologue scanning
experiments had shown that helix II was almost entirely
responsible for the colicin specificity of immunity proteins
(24). We formulated a model based on these data to explain
specificity in colicin-immunity protein interactions which
we have called dual recognition (23, 25). In this mechanism,
the conserved elements of the colicin binding surface of an
immunity protein act as the focus of the binding site while
the variable specificity residues make both favorable and
unfavorable interactions, the balance of which defines the
specificity of the protein-protein interaction.
In this work, we set out to test the dual recognition
model: first, by identifying individual residues in helix II
which govern the specificity differences of Im2 and Im9 for
the E9 DNase and, second, by investigating the contribution
to the DNase binding energy of conserved and variable
residues in the noncognate immunity protein Im2 and
comparing these to those previously published for the cognate
interaction of Im9. Our data fully support the dual recogni￾tion model and suggest that such a mechanism may underpin
specificity in protein-protein recognition in other biological
contexts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials, Bacterial Strains, and Plasmids. All chemicals
and reagents were analytical grade, and were purchased from
either Sigma or BDH. Restriction enzymes were purchased
from Boehringer Mannheim. Colicin-sensitive Escherichia
coli strain, JM83 hsdR, a restriction-deficient derivative of
JM83 (Ara+, Lac+, Pro, Thi, rpsL, φ80∆lacZM15), was
used as the host strain. The expression vector pTrc99A was
purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, and pCD01, with the
imm2 gene inserted between NcoI and HindIII sites of the
vector, was used as the template for the site-directed
mutagenesis.
PCR-Mediated Site-Directed Mutagenesis and Biological
Plate Assays. Mutants were engineered as described by Li
et al. (24). JM83 cells expressing wild-type and mutant
immunity proteins were tested for ColE2 or ColE9 in vivo
specificity using a biological plate assay as described
previously (24). The concentrations of the ColE2 and ColE9
toxins were determined by Bradford assay.
Protein Purifications and Protein Determinations. Each
mutant protein was purified from 1 L of JM83 cells
containing the appropriate construct after induction for 6 h
with 1 mM IPTG, as described previously for Im9 (15). Two
FIGURE 1: Residues targetted for mutagenesis. (a) The solution
structure of Im9 (21) showing 12-residue side chains from helix II
(residues 30-44) and helix III (residues 50-56), 10 of which form
the main stabilizing interactions with the E9 DNase (23) as well
as two other residues (Thr38 and Glu42) implicated in specificity.
Although the structure of Im9 is shown, this study has focused on
mutating these sites in the Im2 protein, for which a structure has
yet to be determined but is likely to be very similar. Residues in
helix III are identical between the two proteins. (b) Sequence
alignment of helix II residues in Im9 and Im2. Potential specificity￾determining residues (underlined) in Im2 were mutated to their
corresponding counterparts in Im9.
11772 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 34, 1998 Li et al.modifications were introduced. First, instead of using DNase
and RNase treatment, sonication was used to break the cells
to avoid DNase contamination. Second, after the final gel
filtration column was used, the pooled fractions were
dialyzed against dH2O, lyophilized, and stored as a dried
power at -20 °C. The E9 DNase was purified as described
by Garinot-Schneider et al. (26). Protein concentrations were
determined using a molar absorption coefficient of 17 550
M-1 cm-1 for E9 DNase and 11 400 M-1 cm-1 for Im9, Im2,
and the Im2 mutant proteins.
Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry. The masses
of all mutant proteins were verified by electrospray mass
spectrometry as described by Li et al. (24).
E9 DNase-Immunity Protein Dissociation Constants. The
kinetic mechanism for complex formation between the E9
DNase and immunity proteins has recently been re-evaluated
on the basis of high-field NMR data (27). The mechanism
is shown in eq 1
where N is the nuclease and I is the immunity protein. The
E9 DNase exists in two distinct conformations which
interconvert slowly in solution and which are present at
approximately equimolar amounts. Only one of these binds
the immunity protein. The equilibrium Kd for complex
formation can be calculated from the ratio of the individual
dissociation (koff) and association (kon) rate constants, as has
been previously reported by Wallis et al. (17, 18). All
experiments were conducted in 50 mM Mops buffer (pH 7.0)
containing 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol at 25 °C.
Association of immunity proteins was monitored by stopped￾flow fluorescence under pseudo-first-order conditions and
the bimolecular rate constant obtained from linear replots
of the rate of initial fluorescence enhancement versus the
immunity protein concentration. Dissociation kinetics for
E9 DNase-Im2 complexes were obtained either from
radioactive subunit exchange (in which complexes were
chased with [3
H]Im9) for slow dissociation rate constants
(<10-3 s-1) or from fluorescence chase stopped flow (in
which complexes were chased with an excess of Im9) for
fast dissociation rate constants (>10-3 s-1
).
Differences in binding energy for Im2 mutants and wild￾type Im2 binding to the E9 DNase were determined accord￾ing to eq 2
where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature.
RESULTS
Identification of Immunity Protein Residues That GoVern
Colicin E9 Specificity. Previously, we identified helix II as
the main determinant of colicin specificity in the immunity
protein family by constructing a chimera in which helix II
of Im9 was engineered into the Im2 framework. The
resulting mutant exhibited complete Im9-like biological
cross-reactivity when E. coli cells containing this construct
were challenged with ColE9 (24). The purified chimeric
protein was also analyzed for its ability to bind the E9 DNase
domain in vitro, from which we found that the helix
accounted for a 5 order of magnitude increase in binding
affinity out of a total of 6 orders of magnitude difference
between Im2 and Im9. Further chimeric constructs showed
that the remaining 10-fold difference in binding affinity was
due to internal packing interactions between helix II and helix
I of the immunity protein.
FIGURE 2: Biological phenotypes of Im2 specificity mutants. Agar plates (22 cm × 22 cm) were divided equally into eight lanes, and each
lane was overlaid with E. coli JM83 cells haboring a different immunity protein construct or the vector. A serial 5-fold dilution from 3
mg/mL to 1.6 ng/mL, going from left to right, of either ColE2 (top of each lane) or ColE9 (bottom of each lane) was dropped onto each
lawn of cells which had been grown either in the presence or in the absence of IPTG. The uppermost lane is the vector control and shows
the cells to be sensitive to the action of both toxins. The absence of zones of killing indicates biological cross-reactivity with respect to the
toxin by an immunity protein. The amino acid numbering corresponds to that in Figure 1 but refers to mutations in helix II of Im2 in which
residues were substituted for those found in equivalent positions in Im9.

Protein-Protein Interactions in Colicin-Immunity Protein Complexes Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 34, 1998 11773Using site-directed mutagenesis in combination with
biological plate assays of colicin immunity and kinetic and
thermodynamic analyses, we set out in this work to identify
the residues in helix II which are primarily responsible for
the colicin specificity differences of Im2 and Im9. Helix II
of Im9 contains 15 amino acids, eight of which are identical
in Im2 and Im9 (Figure 1b). Of the seven remaining amino
acid residues, two are similar (Glu and Asp, and Met and
Leu) and five are different. Our mutagenesis experiments
focused on the five variable residues, at positions 33, 34,
38, 39, and 42. A variety of single and multiple mutant
constructs were engineered and their in vivo colicin cross￾reactivities determined as described in Materials and Meth￾ods. A selection of biological plate assay results are
presented in Figure 2. The ColE2 and ColE9 biological
cross-reactivities of wild-type Im2- and Im9-containing E.
coli cells were compared to those of a vector control and
mutant proteins on the same agar plate under inducing (with
IPTG) and noninducing (without IPTG) conditions. Earlier
work in these systems (18, 24) had shown that the two
distinct induction regimes can detect a wide spectrum of
biological cross-reactivities; in the absence of induction, only
highly specific immunity proteins exhibit biological protec￾tion (due to “leakiness” in the repression of transcription in
the vector system), whereas weak biological protection can
be observed under inducing conditions where up to 40% of
the cell protein is expressed immunity protein. As shown
in Figure 2, the two parent immunity proteins Im2 and Im9
are both completely resistant to the action of their cognate
toxin under both sets of conditions, since no zones of clearing
(indicating cell death) are apparent, but are sensitive to the
noncognate toxin in each case. As reported previously, Im2
shows partial cross-reactivity toward ColE9 under inducing
conditions, a consequence of the nanomolar Kd exhibited by
this protein for the E9 DNase (18).
Each of the five variable amino acids in helix II of Im2
was mutated singly to the amino acid found in Im9 and the
mutant proteins assayed for biological activity toward ColE9
and ColE2. Only three mutants showed significant changes
in specificity using this in vivo assay (Im2 D33L, Im2 N34V,
and Im2 R38T) (Figure 2), while the remaining two mutants
(Im2 E39H and Im2 R42E) displayed wild-type Im2
phenotypes (data not shown). Position 34 has already been
identified by Wallis et al. (28) as a specificity determining
residue, but in the context of Im9 to Im8 specificity. Im2
D33L had the most profound effect of all the mutants. This
mutant behaved like Im9, displaying ColE9 but not ColE2
protection in the absence of IPTG, but unlike Im9 was still
resistant to ColE2 when it was induced with IPTG. The
mutations at positions 34 and 38 had less of an effect on
specificity and displayed similar phenotypes; they were
completely resistant to the action of both toxins when the
bacterial cells were induced with IPTG but were essentially
Im2-like in the absence of induction. When residues 34 and
38 were combined in a double mutant, however, they
displayed significant biological cross-reactivity toward ColE9
in the absence of IPTG but were still resistant to the parent
toxin, ColE2. It was only when all three mutants were
combined (Im2 D33L/N34V/R38T) that the resulting im￾munity protein behaves exactly like Im9 on the biological
plate assays under both inducing and noninducing conditions
(Figure 2, bottom lane). Hence, the biological specificity
differences of Im2 and Im9 for the ColE9 toxin are governed
by just three residues of helix II, at positions 33, 34, and 38,
with one (residue 33) playing the dominant role.
Kinetic Analysis of Im2 Specificity Mutants. Mutants were
purified and characterized as reported previously (24) and
summarized in Materials and Methods. The affinity of the
mutant Im2 protein for the E9 DNase was obtained by
determining the individual association and dissociation rate
constants from which the equilibrium Kd could be calculated.
Using this approach, Kds ranging from 10-5 to 10-14 M can
be obtained (24).
Immunity protein-E9 DNase association rate constants
(kon) were determined by stopped-flow fluorescence, as
described previously (17, 18, 23, 24). The association rate
constant for Im9 under conditions of low ionic strength is
essentially diffusion-controlled (kon ) 4 × 109 M-1 s-1
) and
shows a strong dependence on the salt concentration,
decreasing to 9 × 107 M-1 s-1 in the presence of 200 mM
salt, implying that electrostatic interactions play a major role
in pre-aligning the immunity protein and the E9 DNase prior
to collision (17). Consistent with this interpretation, the
NMR structure of Im9 shows that the region of the protein
predicted to make up the DNase binding site is negatively
charged (22). Another important aspect of stopped-flow
fluorescence-based, immunity protein-E9 DNase association
measurements is the fact that they display biphasic kinetics.

11774 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 34, 1998 Li et al.An initial enhancement in the intrinsic tryptophan fluores￾cence, corresponding to the bimolecular collision, is followed
by a first-order quench, thought to represent a conformational
change in the DNase (17). Until recently, this conforma￾tional change was presumed to be after immunity binding;
however, NMR data have now shown that free E9 DNase
exists in two conformational states which interconvert slowly
in solution (and are present at approximately equimolar
amounts), and Im9 binds to one of these (27; see Materials
and Methods). This more recent kinetic scheme is fully in
accordance with the stopped-flow traces; indeed, the rate
constant that is observed for the slow phase (4-5 s-1
) is
similar to that calculated for the isomerization reaction by
NMR.
Association kinetics for nine single and multiple site￾directed mutants were determined by stopped-flow fluores￾cence in the presence of 200 mM salt. In every case, the
first-order fluorescence quench, representing the isomeriza￾tion in the E9 DNase, fell between 3 and 5 s-1 (data not
shown). The bimolecular rate constants for these mutants
are presented in Table 1 alongside both cognate (Im9) and
noncognate (Im2) association rate constants, values for which
were also obtained in this study and found to be very similar
to those previously published (18, 24). The association rate
constant of Im9 is 2-fold faster than that of Im2, and it seems
from the five single mutants at each of the variable positions
in helix II that it is the loss of the positive charge at Arg38
which is primarily responsible for this difference (Table 1);
the Im2 R38T mutant has essentially the same rate of
association as Im9. Somewhat surprisingly, association rates
greater than that seen for Im9 were obtained when both
arginine mutations (R38T and R42E) were combined in Im2.
The dissociation rate constant (koff) for immunity protein￾E9 DNase complexes was obtained by one of two routes,
depending on the magnitude of the rate constant. For slow
dissociation rate constants (<10-3 s-1
), a radioactive ex￾change experiment was employed (17), whereas for fast
dissociation rate constants (>10-3 s-1
), a stopped-flow
exchange experiment was used (18). Stopped-flow-derived
koff data for three single and one double mutant are presented
in Figure 3. Im2 dissociates from its complex with the E9
DNase with a rate constant of 0.73 s-1
, consistent with our
previous estimate of 0.83 s-1 (18). koff decreases for Im2
N34V and Im2 R38T by 4.5- and 2.5-fold, respectively, and
this is readily observed from the slower stopped-flow
displacement curves for these mutants in complex with the
E9 DNase (Figure 3a). The double mutant of Im2 N34V/
R38T, however, dissociates significantly slower than either
mutant alone, showing a 40-fold reduction in koff relative to
that of Im2. Interestingly, when mutations at positions 39
and 42 are combined with this double mutant, there is no
further decrease in koff (Table 1), showing that these residues
have little influence on DNase binding.
The value for the dissociation rate constant for the Im2
D33L mutant was sufficiently slow to be determined by
radioactive exchange kinetics but fast enough to be estimated
by stopped-flow kinetics. Since the two methods overlapped
with this mutant and to eliminate the possibility of systematic
error with any one technique, we used both to obtain koff.
koff by stopped flow was (3.8 ( 0.1) × 10-3 s-1 (inset of
Figure 3b and Table 1), while koff by radioactive exchange
was (6.0 ( 2.3) × 10-3 s-1 (data not shown), demonstrating
that there is reasonable agreement between the two methods
and hence no systematic error. koff for this single-site mutant
is >190-fold slower than that for wild-type Im2. When this
mutation is combined with the Im2 N34V and Im2 R38T
mutations, koff decreases by more than 4 orders of magnitude
(Figure 3b) to 3.7 × 10-5 s-1
. The calculated equilibrium
Kd values for the mutants (Table 1) indicate that the affinity
of these protein-protein complexes is dominated by changes
in the dissociation rate constant, consistent with previous
work on colicin-immunity protein complexes (18, 23). The
most significant effect on Kd is seen in the Im2 D33L/N34V/
R38T triple mutant which binds to the E9 DNase ap￾proximately 5 orders of magnitude tighter than wild-type
Im2, close to that of Im9. Hence, three residues account
for the major differences in affinity shown by Im2 and Im9
for the E9 DNase, and half of this is associated with a single
mutation, Im2 D33L.
FIGURE 3: Dissociation rate constants for Im2 specificity mutants
determined by exchange kinetics. (a) koff determinations for Im2
specificity mutants at positions 34 and 38. Dissociation rate
constants were obtained by stopped-flow tryptophan fluorescence.
Conditions were as described in the footnote of Table 1 and
Materials and Methods. The experiments are possible because the
final fluorescence of the E9 DNase-Im2 complex is lower than
that of the Im9 complex. Wild-type and mutant Im2 proteins in
complex with the E9 DNase were chased with an excess of Im9
[see Wallis et al. (18) for further details] and the resulting traces
fitted to a single-exponential rate equation, and these have been
superimposed on the data. In each case, the residuals to the fits

Protein-Protein Interactions in Colicin-Immunity Protein Complexes Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 34, 1998 11775Alanine Mutagenesis of E9 DNase Binding Residues in
Im2. In our original alanine scan of Im9, more than 30
residues were mutated to alanine (23). Ten residues from
helices II and III dominated E9 DNase binding and when
mapped onto the surface of the unbound structure of Im9
were found to cluster together (Figure 1a), while the
remaining residues, many of which either did not affect E9
DNase binding or only had small effects, flanked these
important binding residues. The five conserved residues
from helix III form a “hot spot” (29) accounting for about
two-thirds of the binding energy. The other five residues
from helix II lie next to this region and, while only
contributing about one-third of the binding energy, define
the specificity of the protein-protein interaction. Having
identified the specificity-determining residues in Im2 and
recognizing the importance of conserved residues in binding
the E9 DNase, we mutated these residues in Im2 to alanine
to test their importance to binding energy in a noncognate
background.
The 10 residues from helices II and III were mutated singly
to alanine along with Arg38 and Arg42 from helix II because
they appear to play roles, albeit minor, in Im2 specificity.
Thus, a total of 12 residues from Im2 were mutated to alanine
(identified in Figure 1a), eight of which are conserved
between Im2 and Im9 (including two residues in helix II)
and four of which are variable residues. The mutants were
overexpressed and the proteins purified, and their affinity
for the E9 DNase was quantitated as described above. The
Kd values for all 12 alanine mutants and the ∆∆G values
for binding the E9 DNase are presented in Table 2. Binding
could be detected for nine out of the 12 Im2 alanine mutants.
Interestingly, the three Im2 mutants for which no E9 DNase
binding was observed were those at conserved residues
Asp51, Tyr54, and Tyr55, which contribute the bulk of the
E9 DNase binding energy in the cognate immunity protein
Im9 (24). These mutants could be produced in high yield
and were not destabilized with respect to wild-type Im2 (data
not shown). Even in biological plate assays, these mutants
failed to show biological cross-reactivity against colicin E9,
a situation which is reached when immunity proteins bind
colicin toxins with a Kd of e10-4 M (18). Hence, a
conservative estimate for the Kds of these mutants is ∼10-4
M.
To readily compare the effects on E9 DNase binding
energy of substituting conserved and variable residues for
alanine in both Im2 and Im9, ∆∆Gs for equivalent mutation
sites in the two proteins are presented together in Figure 4.
This is a particularly informative way to view the data since
it compares the effects of mutating conserved residues in
the two proteins (red in Figure 4) with the effects of mutating
nonconserved residues (blue in Figure 4). It is evident that
alanine mutants at conserved sites in both cognate (Im9) and
noncognate (Im2) protein backgrounds lie on the positive
side of the x-axis of the graph. Hence, in every case, these
immunity protein mutations significantly affect E9 DNase
binding (perturbing binding by 1-6 kcal/mol). In contrast,
mutations at each of the variable (specificity-determining)
residues lie on the negative side of the x-axis of the graph.
This indicates that these residues either do not contribute to
binding energy in the noncognate Im2 background or, as in
the case of Im2 Arg38, act as a destabilizing interaction
which when removed results in tighter binding of the E9
DNase.

FIGURE 4: Comparative alanine scan of E9 DNase binding residues
in Im2 and Im9. The figure shows ∆∆Gbinding data for Im9 alanine
mutants [taken from Wallis et al. (23)] plotted against ∆∆Gbinding
data for the equivalent alanine mutants in Im2 (data obtained in
this study and listed in Table 2). Both sets of data were collected
under identical conditions (see the footnote of Table 1). The inset
shows a space-filling model of Im9 with residues colored according
to the following scheme: red, mutated residues conserved in both
proteins; blue, mutated residues not conserved; and yellow, residues
not mutated. The data points on the graph are also colored according
to this scheme. The identities of the blue residues in the two
immunity proteins are as follows: Im9, Leu33, Val34, Thr38, and
Glu42; and Im2, Asp33, Asn34, Arg38, and Arg42. Data points
on the positive side of the x-axis identify mutations which perturb
DNase binding in both proteins, while data points on the negative
side of the x-axis identify mutations which only affect Im9 binding
and either do not affect Im2 binding or enhance its binding to the
E9 DNase.
11776 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 34, 1998 Li et al.DISCUSSION
Hierarchical Arrangement of Immunity Protein Specificity
Determinants. Using both in vivo biological assays and in
vitro binding affinities, we have demonstrated that the
specificity differences of immunity proteins for a single
colicin endonuclease are governed by only three residues at
positions 33, 34, and 38 in helix II. Their contributions to
specificity are not however equivalent. In both the in vivo
(Figure 2) and in vitro (Figure 3 and Table 1) experiments,
the relative importance of these residues is 33 > 34 ≈ 38.
Substituting Asp33 of Im2 for leucine essentially switches
the specificity of the protein from colicin E2 to colicin E9,
the result of an increase in the binding affinity for the
noncognate toxin of more than 250-fold. This mutant still
however retains some ColE2 cross-reactivity but only when
the cells are induced with IPTG, indicating that the affinity
for its cognate toxin has decreased significantly (but this has
yet to be analyzed in vitro). By contrast, the asparagine for
valine and arginine for threonine substitutions at positions
34 and 38, respectively, only increase the affinity for the E9
DNase by 6- and 7-fold in each case, and these substitutions
have small effects on biological cross-reactivity (Figure 2
and Table 1). The sum of the individual contributions of
the three mutations to the E9 DNase binding energy is 5.3
kcal/mol, but when all three mutations are introduced into
the same protein, the increase in the binding energy is 6.4
kcal/mol, which matches that obtained when the whole helix
II from Im9 is inserted into the Im2 framework (24). Hence,
these mutations show nonadditivity in binding energy (30),
presumably because of their close proximity in helix II.
While it is as yet unclear why position 33 is so important
for specificity compared to the other residues in helix II, it
seems reasonable to assume that it is due to its close
association with the conserved residue Tyr54 which is critical
for DNase binding. This highlights the interplay of con￾served and nonconserved residues in defining specificity in
this family of proteins. Furthermore, the fact that such
dramatic specificity changes can be induced by a single
substitution of a charged residue for a hydrophobic group
also shows the importance of both types of interactions in
protein-protein interaction specificity.
Comparison of the E9 DNase Binding Energetics of Im9
and Im2. Two important considerations stem from the dual
recognition model. First, conserved residues are the major
determinants of complex stability in all colicin-immunity
protein complexes, and second, variable residues control
specificity (and hence the final binding affinity) through a
combination of favorable and unfavorable interactions. In
the case of a cognate complex, where there are few
unfavorable interactions, the maximal binding energy is
obtained because the specificity sites dock into appropriate
binding sites on the DNase. In noncognate complexes,
however, while some binding energy is derived from
conserved residues, specificity-determining residues do not
contribute significantly to binding and might act as desta￾bilizing entities within the complex, thus explaining the very
much weaker affinities for these complexes.
The alanine scan of conserved and variable residues of
the noncognate immunity protein Im2 provides strong support
for the dual recognition model of protein-protein interaction
specificity in this family of proteins. The conserved residues
are clearly the focus of the binding interaction as they are
with the cognate immunity protein Im9, and the relative
importance of these interactions is also similar, although not
identical (Table 2 and Figure 4). Importantly, however, the
four specificity residues in Im2 do not contribute to the E9
DNase binding energy (particularly the critical specificity
site, Asp33) and even destabilize the complex by ∼1.5 kcal/
mol (N34A and R38A mutations). We can conclude
therefore that the specificity differences between Im9 and
Im2 for the E9 DNase involve the cooperation of conserved
and variable residues, as predicted by the model. The
conserved residues of Im2 provide the bulk of the binding
energy, but this is insufficient to match the tight binding of
Im9 because of two effects: (1) the additional binding energy
that is achieved in the Im9 protein by having the appropriate
residues at key specificity sites (predominantly residue 33
but including residues 34 and 38) and (2) the destabilization
energy which comes from having inappropriate specificity
residues in Im2 buried within the complex (particularly
Arg38; Figure 4).
Dual Recognition and Specificity Mechanisms in Other
Protein-Protein Interaction Systems. Specificity in protein￾protein recognition has been investigated in a number of
different biological contexts, such as antibody-antigen
interactions (31), hematopoietic receptor complexes (32, and
references therein), proteinase-inhibitor complexes (33), and
RNase-inhibitor complexes (34). These studies revolved
around crystal structures of the complexes coupled to a
detailed breakdown of the energetics of the surfaces involved.
It is of interest then to begin comparing such systems with
colicin-immunity protein interactions.
Analysis of interprotein complexes (1, 35) reveals that they
involve large surfaces of each partner (generally encompass￾ing >650 Å2) becoming buried in the complex. Alanine
scanning mutagenesis data on growth hormone binding to
its receptor (29, 36) and RNase inhibitor binding to RNase
(34) have shown that even though up to 30 amino acid side
chains of each protein may become buried at such interfaces
only a fraction of these constitute energetically important
interactions, and these tend to cluster together. However,
this is not a universal phenomenon; for example, Dall’Acqua
et al. (37) using an anti-hen egg white lysozyme antibody
system have shown that in some cases the distribution of
binding energies is not focused on a select few residues but
rather is distributed throughout the binding epitope. Since
the crystal structure of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex is not
known, we cannot be certain of the extent of binding of the
epitope on Im9, but the tightness of the complex (similar to
that of the RNase-inhibitor systems) suggests that a
significant amount of surface on Im9 will become buried in
the complex. NMR amide perturbation analysis is consistent
with this interpretation since it identified up to 26 residues
in Im9 which might become buried on complex formation
(22). The subsequent alanine scan of these and other residues
indicated that only a fraction of those perturbed in the NMR
experiments were energetically meaningful in complex
stabilization (23). It seems likely then that this is an example
of a complex for which the binding energetics are dominated
by just a few residues.
Do these similarities between growth hormone binding to
its receptor and RNase inhibitor binding to RNase with the
Protein-Protein Interactions in Colicin-Immunity Protein Complexes Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 34, 1998 11777E9 DNase-Im9 complex extend to how specificity is
encoded in these systems? Even with the present data, which
only reflect one-half of the binding partnership, this seems
unlikely to be the case. In each of the growth hormone and
RNase systems, overlapping but nonidentical binding epitopes
are employed to achieve specificity, with distinct hot spots
of binding energy stabilizing a particular complex (34, 38).
Comparing the distribution of DNase binding energies for
Im9 with Im2 (albeit on a limited number of residues) shows
that they seem to have similar hot spots of binding energy
since they are focused around the same conserved residues,
but this is insufficient for tight binding (Figure 4). To
achieve cognate binding (Kd < 10-14 M), additional binding
energy is needed which is supplied by the specificity￾determining residues, primarily residues 33, 34, and 38 in
helix II.
Dual recognition may be a common phenomenon in
complexes involving structurally homologous proteins (25).
T cell receptor interactions with self-peptide-bound major
histocompatibility complex, for example, have been described
as displaying “dual specificity” (39). This term was coined
to emphasize the dual nature of the T cell receptor combining
site which can recognize both the conserved helical jaws of
the MHC molecule and the variable residues from the
displayed peptide. The detailed energetics of these com￾plexes have yet to be dissected, so it will be of interest to
see whether they are comparable to those of colicin￾immunity protein complexes. Other protein complexes
which also seem to show dual recognition are signaling
complexes involving SH2 and SH3 domains. These con￾served domains recognize distinct peptide motifs, but speci￾ficity is mediated through neighboring variable residues (40).
In conclusion, dual recognition as a mechanism for
defining protein-protein interaction specificity may be more
widespread in biology than hitherto recognized. The basis
for this mechanism is the close cooperation between con￾served and variable residues at the interfacial regions of
protein complexes, and this can result in a wide range of
thermodynamic stabilities for the resulting complexes (18,
23, 25). As we have shown for colicin-immunity protein
interactions, selectivity can be engendered through a few
select residues which modulate the binding interactions from
the conserved protein scaffold. In this way, the specificity
of the protein-protein interaction can be fine-tuned without
making significant changes to the character of the combining
sites.
