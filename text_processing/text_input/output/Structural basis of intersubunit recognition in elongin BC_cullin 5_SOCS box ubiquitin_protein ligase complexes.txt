The cullin–RING ubiquitin ligases are multisubunit complexes
that ubiquitinate various proteins. Six different cullins
encoded by the human genome selectively pair with different
adaptors and substrate receptors. It is presently poorly
understood how cullin-2 (Cul2) and cullin-5 (Cul5) associate
specifically with their adaptor elongin BC and a SOCS-box￾containing substrate receptor. Here, crystallographic and
mutational analyses of a quaternary complex between the
N-terminal half of Cul5, elongin BC and SOCS2 are reported.
Cul5 interacts extensively with elongin BC via residues that
are highly conserved in Cul2 but not in other cullins. Cul5 also
interacts with SOCS2, but via only two residues, Pro184 and
Arg186, which are located in the C-terminal part of the SOCS
box called the Cul5 box. Pro184 makes a ring-to-ring
interaction with Trp53 of Cul5, which is substituted by alanine
in Cul2. This interaction is shown to contribute significantly to
the overall binding affinity between Cul5 and SOCS2–elongin
BC. This study provides structural bases underlying the
specificity of Cul5 and Cul2 for elongin BC and their
preferential association with Cul5 or Cul2 box-containing
substrate receptors.

1. Introduction
A wide variety of eukaryotic proteins are post-translationally
modified by conjugation of a single or multiple molecule(s) of
ubiquitin, a small protein composed of about 76 amino acids.
The consequences of ubiquitination vary widely and include
degradation, change in activity and change in cellular location
of the modified proteins (Hershko & Ciechanover, 1992). The
three enzymes E1, E2 and E3 catalyze cascade-like transfers
of ubiquitin to a substrate protein. E3 is the ubiquitin ligase,
which catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between
the C-terminal carboxylate of ubiquitin and a lysine residue of
a protein (Pickart, 2001). The cullin–RING ubiquitin ligases
comprise a superfamily of multi-subunit RING-class E3
enzymes that commonly contain an elongated arch-shaped
cullin scaffold and a RING-domain subunit, Rbx1 or Rbx2
(Kamura et al., 1999; Ohta et al., 1999; Tan et al., 1999). Six
different human cullins have been identified: cullin-1 (Cul1),
Cul2, Cul3, Cul4A, Cul4B and Cul5 (Bosu & Kipreos, 2008;
Villeneuve et al., 2010). In addition, an atypical cullin protein
Cul7 has been identified which binds to the F-box-containing
protein Fbxw8 (Dias et al., 2002; Ponyeam & Hagen, 2012).
They are sequentially folded to form an elongated scaffold
with two ends that are separated from each other by about
100 A˚ . The C-terminal end of the scaffold is the site forbinding Rbx1 or Rbx2, which interacts with the E2 enzyme
(Zheng et al., 2002). The other end of the scaffold consists of
the N-terminal residues and is the site for binding the adaptor
subunit. The adaptor interacts with the substrate receptor that
recognizes and binds to a substrate protein. Through these
interactions, a substrate protein is brought to a cullin scaffold,
on which the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the substrate is
catalyzed. Cul3 is exceptional in that it binds to the substrate
receptor directly (Zimmerman et al., 2010). Recently, using
molecular-dynamics simulations, it has been suggested that the
cullin scaffolds are flexible and that this flexibility is likely to
provide an allosteric regulatory mechanism to facilitate the
polyubiquitination of substrates (Liu & Nussinov, 2011).
Elongin B and elongin C form a tightly associated complex
and this heterodimer, referred to as elongin BC, serves as the
common adaptor subunit for both Cul2 and Cul5 (Duan et al.,
1995). Elongin C shares sequence and structural similarity
with S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1), which is the
adaptor protein interacting with Cul1 (Bai et al., 1996). The
interaction between Skp1 and Cul1 has been structurally
characterized (Zheng et al., 2002). Whereas structural infor￾mation on how elongin BC binds to Cul2 or Cul5 is unavail￾able, the elongin C subunit has been presumed to bind Cul2
and Cul5 similarly to the binding of Skp1 by Cul1 (Zheng et al.,
2002). Elongin BC recognizes cognate substrate receptors that
are characterized by having a conserved C-terminal sequence
known as the SOCS box (suppressor of cytokine signalling;
Kamura et al., 1998). The SOCS box is composed of about 40
amino acids and is responsible for intermolecular recognition
by forming three -helices that form the binding interface for
elongin BC (Stebbins et al., 1999; Bullock et al., 2007). The
N-terminal portion of the SOCS box, which forms the first
-helix, was designated the ‘BC box’ because it was shown to
be critical for interaction with elongin BC (Aso et al., 1996;
Kamura et al., 1998). While elongin BC is the common adaptor
for Cul2 and Cul5, it has been suggested that whether elongin
BC binds to Cul2 or Cul5 is determined by the substrate
receptors (Kamura et al., 2004). For example, elongin BC in
complex with von Hippel–Lindau tumour suppressor protein
(VHL) interacts with Cul2 but not with Cul5, whereas elongin
BC in complex with another SOCS-box protein, SOCS2,
showed the opposite binding specificity (Kile et al., 2002;
Kamura et al., 2004). Consistently, VHL-mediated degra￾dation of HIF-2 could be inhibited by RNAi-mediated
knockdown of the Cul2–Rbx1 complex but not by knockdown
of the Cul5–Rbx2 complex (Kamura et al., 2004). Based on an
experiment in which a peptide segment was swapped between
VHL and SOCS2, an 16-amino-acid segment C-terminal to
the common BC box was defined as the determinant of the
recognition specificity and this segment was consequently
named the Cul2 or Cul5 box. The Cul5 box has the consensus
sequence ’xxLP’Pxx’xx(Y/F)(L/I) (where ’ is a hydrophobic
residue and x is any residue; Hilton et al., 1998; Kamura et al.,
2004), in which the conserved LP’P motif was proposed to
be the major determinant of specificity (Kamura et al., 2004).
Recently, an extensive cell-based protein-binding study
identified 17 Cul2-interacting and 19 Cul5-interacting human
substrate receptors, allowing comparison of a large collection
of these proteins (Mahrour et al., 2008). According to this
study, a unique sequence motif distinguishing the two cullin
boxes is not present, suggesting that all of the cullin box
residues collectively contribute to the selective or preferential
recognition of Cul2 or Cul5.
Whereas the ECS complexes composed of elongin BC,
Cul2/Cul5 and a SOCS-box protein constitute a representative
subfamily of cullin-dependent ubiquitin ligases (Kamura et al.,
2004), structural information of the intersubunit interaction is
limited to elongin BC and a substrate receptor. In particular, it
is unknown how a substrate receptor bound to elongin BC
may direct this ternary complex to selectively or preferentially
recognize Cul2 or Cul5. Here, we provide an atomic view of
the intersubunit interactions between elongin BC, SOCS2 and
an N-terminal fragment of Cul5. The structure readily explains
why the elongin BC adaptor selectively pairs with Cul2 and
Cul5 but not with other cullins. We have identified a ring-to￾ring interaction which is important for tight interaction
between Cul5 and the Cul5 box.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Cloning and protein purification
The DNA fragments encoding mouse elongin B and elongin
C (residues 17–112) were ligated into the pRSFDuet plasmid
(Novagen). The DNA fragment encoding human SOCS2
(residues 32–198) was ligated into the pProEx HTa plasmid
(Invitrogen) and that encoding human Cul5 (residues 1–386)
was ligated into a pET22b-CPD 10H plasmid which was
designed to express a protein fused to a His10-tagged CPD
(cysteine protease domain) at the C-terminus. In this work,
elongin C (residues 17–112), SOCS2 (residues 32–198) and
Cul5 (residues 1–386) are referred to as elongin C, SOCS2
and Cul5N, respectively. A variant of Cul5N, referred to as
Cul5N(RD), which contains the substitutions V341R and
L345D, was generated by the overlapping PCR method.
SOCS2, elongin B and elongin C were coexpressed together
in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) and
Cul5N(RD) was expressed alone in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)
RIPL (Stratagene). Expression of the proteins was induced by
0.5 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 291 K. Cell
lysates were prepared by sonication in buffer A composed of
20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. The SOCS2–elongin
BC complex was purified using HisPur Cobalt Resin (Thermo
Scientific) and a HiTrap Q anion-exchange column (GE
Healthcare) operated with a linear NaCl gradient (0.0–1.0 M)
in buffer A. Cul5N(RD) was first purified using HisPur Cobalt
Resin, on which the CPD-His10 tag was cleaved by adding
100 mM phytate. Subsequently, the protein was bound to a
HiTrap Q column and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl
(0.0–1.0 M) in buffer A. Purified SOCS2–elongin BC and
Cul5N(RD) were mixed together in a 1:1 molar ratio and the
resulting quaternary complex was further purified in buffer A
using a HiLoad Superdex 200 gel-filtration column (GE
Healthcare). The final sample was concentrated to 40 mg ml1
research papers
1588 Kim et al.  SOCS2–elongin BC–Cul5 complexes Acta Cryst. (2013). D69, 1587–1597      in a buffer solution consisting of 25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5,
100 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol.
A variant of Cul5N(RD) containing a W53A mutation,
Cul5N(RD;W53A), was generated by the overlapping PCR
method and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
The variant was purified according to the same procedures as
used to purify Cul5N(RD). A DNA fragment encoding human
VHL (residues 54–213; referred to as VHL) was amplified by
PCR and cloned into the pProEx HTa vector. VHL, elongin B
and elongin C were coexpressed together in E. coli strain
BL21 (DE3) at 310 K and the purification steps for VHL–
elongin BC were identical to those for SOCS2–elongin BC.
2.2. Crystallization and structure determination of SOCS2–
elongin BC–Cul5N(RD)
Crystals of the quaternary complex were obtained by the
hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 295 K by mixing
and equilibrating 1.5 ml protein sample and 1.5 ml precipitant
solution consisting of 0.25 M sodium citrate, 18%(w/v) PEG
3350. For cryoprotection, the crystals were soaked in the
precipitant solution containing an additional 10% ethylene
glycol. An X-ray diffraction data set was collected on beam￾line 17A at the Photon Factory in Japan. The asymmetric unit
of the crystal contained one quaternary complex. The struc￾ture of the complex was determined by molecular replacement
using the structures of SOCS2–elongin BC (PDB entry 2c9w;
Bullock et al., 2006) and Cul5N(RD) (PDB entry 2wzk; J. R. C.

A. Bullock, unpublished work) as the search models using
MOLREP in the CCP4 suite (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010; Winn
et al., 2011). Structure refinement was carried out using the
CNS software package (Bru¨nger et al., 1998). The final refined
model does not include residues 105–118 of elongin B, resi￾dues 1–9 and 119–128 of Cul5N(RD) and residues 136–145
of SOCS2, for which electron density was missing. Crystallo￾graphic data statistics are summarized in Table 1.
2.3. Isothermal titration calorimetry
All measurements were carried out at 298 K on an iTC200
microcalorimetry system (GE Healthcare). Protein samples
were dialyzed against a solution consisting of 20 mM Tris–HCl
pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl and were centrifuged to remove any
insoluble material prior to the measurements. The experi￾ments were carried out by titrating 1 mM Cul5N(RD) or
Cul5N(RD;W53A) into 0.1 mM SOCS2–elongin BC or VHL–
elongin BC. Dilution enthalpies were determined in separate
experiments (titrant into buffer) and were subtracted from the
enthalpies of binding between the proteins. The data were
analyzed using the Origin software (OriginLab).
2.4. Simulation of the interaction between VHL, elongin BC
and Cul2
Three-dimensional structural models of the complex
between VHL–elongin BC and the N-terminal part of Cul2,
referred to as Cul2N, were generated based on a high-accuracy
template-based modelling method (Joo et al., 2007). The
template structures used for modelling VHL, elongin BC and
Cul2N were VHL–elongin BC (PDB entry 1vcb; Stebbins et
al., 1999), SOCS2–elongin BC–Cul5N(RD) and Cul5N(RD)
(PDB entry 2wzk). The method is based on global optimiza￾tion of various scoring functions (Lee et al., 2003) coupled with
successive screening of models by quality assessment. It
carries out multiple stages of optimization, including multiple
sequence alignment, three-dimensional chain building of
proteins and side-chain refinement. The final three-dimen￾sional model of each target sequence was selected by applying
a quality-assessment procedure which is based on a machine￾learning algorithm using scoring functions and structural
features such as the secondary structure and solvent accessi￾bility of protein structures. The VHL–elongin BC and Cul2N
models were initially oriented according to the structure of
SOCS2–elongin BC–Cul5N(RD). The intersubunit inter￾actions were optimized using the TINKER package (Ponder &
Richards, 1987), which carries out molecular modelling based
on potential energy functions using the CHARMM force field
(MacKerell et al., 1998) and the GBSA solvation model (Qiu
et al., 1997).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Overall structure of the quaternary SOCS2–elongin BC–
Cul5N(RD) complex
To obtain structural information on the intersubunit inter￾actions between a SOCS-box protein, elongin BC and Cul5,
various protein constructs were prepared and the resulting
complexes were subjected to crystallization. Finally, we
obtained crystals of the quaternary complex between elongin
BC, SOCS2 and Cul5N(RD). We employed an N-terminal
386-amino-acid fragment of Cul5 (Fig. 1a) because the

adaptor subunit, as demonstrated by various related structures
(Zimmerman et al., 2010). The two mutations in Cul5N(RD)
are located on the otherwise completely hydrophobic surface,
which is solvent-exposed owing to the truncation of the
C-terminal half of Cul5. These mutations, which were intro￾duced based on the available structure of this protein (PDB
entry 2wzk), improved the solution behaviour of the protein.
The four proteins were found to form a tight complex and the
crystal structure of this quaternary complex was determined
to 3.0 A˚ resolution (Table 1). The Cul5N(RD) structure is
composed exclusively of -helices and looks like a curved rod.
The adaptor subunit elongin BC sits at the N-terminal tip of
Cul5N(RD) and the substrate receptor subunit SOCS2 binds
to one side of elongin C (Fig. 1b). Elongin B, which forms a
complex with elongin C, does not interact with Cul5N(RD)
at all, whereas it interacts with SOCS2 only slightly via two
residues (Val102 and Met103; not shown). We note that
human elongin BC should interact with
human SOCS2 and Cul5 in an identical
manner to mouse elongin BC because
both elongin B and elongin C share
extremely high sequence homology
(>97% identity) between the two
species and the residues at the binding
interfaces are invariant.
3.2. Interface between elongin BC and
Cul5
The binding of elongin BC to Cul5
takes place exclusively through elongin
C. While 4 and 5 of Cul5 make minor
contacts with elongin C via Ile106 and
Lys109 on 4 and Gln113 on 5, 2 of
Cul5 is the primary binding motif; it
interacts with a shallow groove of
elongin C formed by 2, loop 2–3 and
4 (Fig. 2a). This intersubunit inter￾action is predominantly hydrophobic,
but involves several hydrophilic inter￾actions mediated by Ser47, Asn61 and
Arg63 of elongin C, and Lys109, Gln38,
Asp42 and Asp46 of Cul5. The mode
of interaction between elongin BC and
Cul5 is similar to that between Skp1
and Cul1 in the structure of the SCF
complex composed of Skp1, Cul1–Rbx1
and the F-box protein Skp2 (PDB entry
1ldk; Zheng et al., 2002). In this struc￾ture, Skp1 forms a binding interface
using 2, the following 20-residue
segment and 5, which interacts with 2
of Cul1 (Fig. 2b). However, the detailed
intermolecular interactions in the two
complexes are quite different, which can
be ascribed to the amino-acid differ￾ences at the binding interfaces. A total
of 12 residues of elongin C interact
directly with 2 of Cul5 and ten residues
of Skp1 interact directly with 2 of
Cul1. Among the 12 residues of elongin
C, only Met45 and Asn108 are identi￾cally conserved in Skp1 (Fig. 2c). Like￾wise, among the 11 residues of Cul5
which interact with elongin C, Lys37

residues of Cul1 (Fig. 2d). Owing to these differences, the two
binding interfaces are quite different from each other elec￾trostatically and geometrically. While the binding interface of
Skp1 is almost flat, that of elongin C has two protrusions that
are formed by Arg63 and by the Gly48-Pro49-Gly50 segment
(Fig. 2a). The guanidine group of Arg63 is involved in ionic
interactions with Asp42 and Asp46 of Cul5, while Pro49 of
elongin C is involved in hydrophobic interactions with Trp40
of Cul5 (Fig. 2a). Both Arg63 and Pro49 are not conserved in
Skp1 and corresponding hydrophilic or hydrophobic inter￾actions do not exist at the interface between Skp1 and Cul1.
These geometric and electrostatic differences explain the
selective binding of the two adaptors to Cul1 or Cul5.

only two residues, marked by dotted boxes, are conserved in the two proteins. (d) Sequence alignment of six different human cullins. The regions
corresponding to 2 of Cul5 are shown. The asterisks indicate the Cul5 residues that interact directly with elongin C. These interacting residues are
significantly more conserved in Cul2 (seven out of 11) than in any other cullins. Identically conserved residues in Cul5 and Cul2 are indicated by filled
arrowheads and similarly conserved residues are represented by empty arrowheads.  Elongin BC serves as the adaptor for both Cul2 and Cul5
(Kamura et al., 2004). The basis of this dual specificity can
be explained by sequence comparison of the cullin-family
proteins, which shows that the residues on the 2 helix of Cul5
which interact with elongin C are highly conserved in Cul2 but
not in the other cullins. Among the 11 elongin C-interacting
residues of Cul5, five residues (Trp40, Asp42, Phe44, Ser45
and Asp46) are identical in Cul2 and two further residues
(Lys37 and Leu52) are similar (Fig. 2d). In contrast, only one
residue (Lys37 or Leu52) is identical in Cul1, Cul3 and Cul4B

comparison, the overall interactions between the F box of Skp2, Skp1 and Cul1 (PDB entry 1ldk) are shown. The spatial position of the Skp2–Cul1
interface (circled) is similar to that of the SOCS2–Cul5 interface. (c) ITC analysis. Cul5N(RD) or Cul5N(RD;W53A) was titrated into the indicated
protein complexes. The Kd values were deduced from curve fittings of the integrated heat per mole of added protein (insets).  (Fig. 2d). We also note that the sequence conservation in the
2 helices of Cul2 and Cul5 (41% identity and 65% similarity)
is considerably higher than the overall sequence conservation
between the two proteins (26% identity and 47% similarity).
Therefore, local sequence conservation at the binding inter￾face appears to be the key basis underlying the dual specificity
of the elongin BC adaptor for Cul2 and Cul5.
Elongin C is structurally similar to the Cul3-interacting
BTB (bric-a`-brac, tramtrack, broad-complex) domain
(Petroski & Deshaies, 2005). Recently, it was shown that the
N-terminal tip of Cul3 interacts with the BTB domain of
SPOP (speckle-type POZ protein) and that helix 2 of Cul3
is the major interface for this intermolecular interaction
(Errington et al., 2012). The sequence alignment shown in
Fig. 2(d) explains the recognition specificity between the
structurally similar adaptor proteins and the cullin scaffolds.
3.3. Interface between SOCS2 and Cul5
The presented structure reveals that SOCS2 interacts with
Cul5 through only two residues, Pro184 and Arg186, which
belong to the Cul5 box (residues 178–192). Pro184 is in
hydrophobic contact with Trp53 and Leu52, whereas Arg186
of SOCS2 is hydrogen-bonded to Gln113 of Cul5 (Fig. 3a).
Arg186 is a variable residue in the Cul5 boxes and therefore
the observed hydrogen bond does not represent a conserved
interaction. In contrast, Pro184 is invariable and is the fourth
residue in the LP’P sequence motif of the Cul5 box, which has
been shown by mutational analyses to be the major determi￾nant specifying the assembly of the SOCS box-containing
proteins into Cul5 (Kamura et al., 2004). The fourth proline
residue in this motif appears to be particularly important
as a determinant of specificity. Whereas wild-type SOCS1
containing the sequence IPLN in the cullin box failed to
interact with Cul5–Rbx2, a mutant SOCS1 with an IPLP
sequence interacted with Cul5–Rbx2 (Kamura et al., 2004). In
the structure of the quaternary complex, Pro184 of SOCS2
is involved in a ring-to-ring stacking interaction with Trp53 of
Cul5 (Fig. 3a). Notably, both apolar residues interact with
Met105 of elongin C and thus the three residues together form
a three-way interaction point (Fig. 3a). At this position, the
ring-to-ring stacking interactions appear to augment the
hydrophobic interactions between elongin C and Cul5 as they
are part of the large hydrophobic core involving Pro182,
Leu183 and Leu187 of SOCS2, Leu101, Leu104 and Met105 of
elongin C and Leu52 of Cul5 (Fig. 3a). The observed inter￾action between the Cul5 box of SOCS2 and Cul5 is similar to
that between the F-box of Skp2 and Cul1 in the structure of
the Skp1–Cul1–Skp2 F-box complex (PDB entry 1ldk; Zheng
et al., 2002). The F-box also interacts with Cul1, but only
slightly: three residues of Skp2 (Pro113, Glu115, Glu146) are
in contact with Thr54, Tyr139, His143 and Arg147 of Cul1
(Fig. 3b). Furthermore, the binding interface is spatially
similar to that between SOCS2 and Cul5 (Figs. 3a and 3b).
Thus, the ECS and SCF ubiquitin ligases share a common
mode of interaction between their substrate receptor and the
cullin scaffold.
3.4. Contribution of the cullin box to the assembly of ECS
complexes
Pro184 in the Cul5 box of SOCS2 is substituted by a valine
in the Cul2 box of VHL, which also binds to elongin BC but is
known to interact with Cul2 instead of Cul5 (Kamura et al.,
1999, 2004). On the other hand, Trp53 of Cul5 is substituted by
an alanine in Cul2. These observations indicated that the ring￾to-ring interaction between Pro184 and Trp53 is important, if
not critical, for the recognition of Cul5 by Cul5 box-containing
proteins. To evaluate the importance of this interaction, we
generated a Cul5N(RD) variant containing a W53A mutation,
designated Cul5N(RD;W53A). Using isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC), we then quantified the interactions of
SOCS2–elongin BC with Cul5N(RD) or Cul5N(RD;W53A).
SOCS2–elongin BC interacted potently with Cul5N(RD), with
an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 28 nM (Fig. 3c).
In comparison, SOCS2–elongin BC interacted with the
Cul5N(RD;W53A) variant with a Kd of 893 nM (Fig. 3c).
Therefore, the ring-to-ring interaction significantly enhances
the binding affinity between SOCS2–elongin BC and Cul5.
3.5. Contribution of elongin BC to the assembly of ECS
complexes
Since elongin C interacts with Cul5N(RD) much more
extensively than does SOCS2 (Fig. 3a), elongin BC is likely
to bind Cul5 with high affinity and to contribute majorly to
the binding affinity between SOCS2–elongin BC and Cul5.
However, free elongin BC did not seem to interact tightly with
Cul5N(RD) on a native gel-based protein-binding assay (not
shown). Consistently, an ITC analysis confirmed that they
interact with each other with a Kd of 1.3 mM (not shown), as
similarly estimated by others (Babon et al., 2009; Wolfe et al.,
2010). On the other hand, it was shown that while SOCS3
bound to elongin BC interacts with Cul5N tightly (Kd of
90 nM), the interaction between isolated SOCS3 and Cul5N
was undetectably weak (>10 mM; Babon et al., 2008, 2009).
This observation is consistent with the minor interaction
between Cul5 and the Cul5 box found in the presented
structure and indicates that this intersubunit interaction by
itself is negligible in the formation of an ECS complex.
Therefore, elongin BC and the Cul5 box contribute to the
formation of an ECS complex synergistically rather than
additively. A structural comparison of Cul5N(RD) in the
complex with free Cul5N(RD) showed that the protein
undergoes a negligible conformational change: the r.m.s.d. of
the C atoms between the two states is only 0.64 A˚ . We also
note that the binding of SOCS2–elongin BC to Cul5N(RD) is
accompanied by almost no conformational change in elongin
C; only minor changes in the side-chain conformations of
three residues (Leu101, Met105 and Asn108) are observed in a
structural comparison between SOCS2–elongin BC–
Cul5N(RD) and SOCS2–elongin BC (Fig. 4). While the
structure of free elongin BC is unavailable, we presume that
elongin C is conformationally flexible in free elongin BC. In
this scenario, free elongin BC has to lose conformational
freedom to bind Cul5 and the accompanying entropic loss
research papers
Acta Cryst. (2013). D69, 1587–1597 Kim et al.  SOCS2–elongin BC–Cul5 complexes 1593   adversely affects the otherwise tight interaction between
elongin BC and Cul5N(RD). In contrast, when elongin BC in
complex with SOCS2 binds to Cul5, the loss of conformational
freedom of elongin C is negligible. As a result, elongin BC in
complex with a substrate receptor, but not free elongin BC, is
able to bind Cul5 tightly, making a greater contribution to the
overall binding affinity than the Cul5 box. If this proposition is
correct then VHL–elongin BC,
which contains a Cul2 box
instead of a Cul5 box, would
bind not only Cul2 but also
Cul5 with substantial binding
affinity. Indeed, interaction
between VHL–elongin BC and
Cul5N(RD) was clearly observed,
although it was less tight than
the interaction between SOCS2–
elongin BC and Cul5N(RD) on a
native gel (Fig. 5a, lanes 4 and 5)
and from the Kd value (327 versus
28 nM; Fig. 5b).
3.6. Simulation of the interaction
between the Cul2 box of VHL,
elongin C and Cul2
According to the published
data, VHL–elongin BC would be
presumed to bind Cul2 more
tightly than it binds Cul5. Inter￾estingly, a multiple sequence
alignment shows that the BC box
sequences in the SOCS boxes are
quite different from those in the VHL boxes, apart from the
conservation of a leucine residue which corresponds to
Leu163 in SOCS2 (Fig. 6a). We considered whether this
sequence difference might cause a conformational difference
in elongin C depending on its binding to VHL or to SOCS2. A
structural comparison between VHL–elongin BC and SOCS2–
elongin BC exhibited no noticeable conformational difference

onto a native gel and visualized by Coomassie staining. Note the presence of a residual VHL–elongin BC
band in lane 5 in comparison with the lack of a residual SOCS2–elongin BC band in lane 4. (b) ITC. VHL–
elongin BC was titrated into Cul5N(RD) and the Kd value was deduced.in elongin C (r.m.s.d. of 0.29 on C atoms), indicating that the
sequence difference in the BC box does not play a role in the
preferential binding of VHL–elongin BC to Cul2. The residues
that are conserved in the Cul2 box also do not appear to be a
determinant, as they are also conserved in the Cul5 box (Fig.
6a). To understand the basis of this preferential binding, we
attempted to crystallize a complex between VHL–elongin BC
and an N-terminal fragment of Cul2. However, a number of
the N-terminal fragments of Cul2 that we designed were only
produced in insoluble forms. We instead sought to obtain a
structural model of the VHL–elongin BC–Cul2N complex by a
high-accuracy template-based modelling method (Joo et al.,
2007) mainly based on the structure presented here.
Compared with the structure of VHL–elongin BC (Stebbins et
al., 1999), the simulated quaternary structure shows that the
loop containing the Leu178-Asp179-Ile180-Val181 sequence
of the Cul2 box, which corresponds to the LP’P motif in the
Cul5 box, undergoes a conformational shift towards Cul2 (Fig.
6b; left). As a result, Val181 and Ser183 of VHL interact with
Ala48 and Val47 of Cul2, respectively. Owing to this move￾research papers

Simulated interaction between VHL–elongin BC and Cul2. (a) Sequence alignment of 30 of a total of 37 SOCS boxes and 20 VHL boxes that have
recently been identified (Mahrour et al., 2008; Okumura et al., 2012). It is noted that the Cul2-box-containing SOCS-box proteins are called VHL-box
proteins (Kamura et al., 2004; Hilton et al., 1998). (b) Left: the loop segment of VHL becomes closer to 2 of Cul2 and forms a buried hydrogen bond.
VHL in the structure of VHL–elongin BC (PDB entry 1vcb) is superposed on the simulated structures. Right: superposition of the 2 helix of
Cul5N(RD) on the simulated structures. The circle highlights that Trp53 of Cul5 clashes sterically with Val181 of VHL, with a closest distance of 0.5 A˚ .   ment, the hydrophobic residues around Val181 of VHL
become more closely packed against each other. In addition, a
strong hydrogen bond appears to be formed between the
hydroxyl group of Ser183 and the carbonyl O atom of Val47,
which are completely buried in the hydrophobic milieu. These
interactions between the Cul2 box of VHL and Cul2 should
augment the interaction between elongin BC and Cul2. On
the other hand, the Cul2 box would interact with Cul5 less
preferably owing to the amino-acid dissimilarity between Cul2
and Cul5 near the three-way interface. In particular, Leu52
and Trp53 in Cul5, which are bulkier than the corresponding
Val47 and Ala48 in Cul2, appear to prevent the conforma￾tional shift of the Cul2 box and thus the formation of the
favourable Cul2–Cul2 box interactions observed in the simu￾lated structure (Fig. 6b; right).
The simulated interactions between VHL and Cul2 do
not provide a general explanation as to why the Cul2 box
preferentially interacts with Cul2 rather than Cul5. This is
because Val181 of VHL is mostly substituted by proline in
other VHL-box proteins and Ser183 is not a conserved residue
in other Cul2 boxes (Fig. 6a). Notably, the Cul2 box is far more
diverse in primary sequence than the Cul5 box (Fig. 6a). It
is possible that owing to the smaller residues in 2 of Cul2
(Val47 and Ala48 instead of leucine and tryptophan), this helix
is able to make favourable interactions with the loop segment
of different Cul2 boxes in different ways, such that uncon￾served interactions between each Cul2 box and Cul2 are
responsible for the preferential binding to Cul2 over Cul5.
4. Summary and concluding remarks
The structure presented in this study provides the first atomic
views of how elongin BC and a cullin box of a substrate
receptor interact with a cullin. The elongin BC adaptor
interacts selectively with Cul2 and Cul5 because the residues
at the binding interface are conserved in these two cullins but
not in other cullins. Elongin BC, which interacts with Cul5
much more extensively than the Cul5 box, is the major
contributor to the overall binding affinity for the interaction
between SOCS2–elongin BC and Cul5. The ring-to-ring
interaction between Cul5 and the Cul5 box appears to be
minor but contributes significantly to the overall binding
affinity. Such a single critical interaction does not appear to
exist in the interaction between Cul2 and the VHL-box
proteins. Finally, our analyses indicate that a complex between
substrate receptor and elongin BC is formed first and this
complex then interacts with the Cul2–Rbx1 or Cul5–Rbx2
scaffold to assemble an ECS E3 ligase complex.
