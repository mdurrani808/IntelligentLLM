ABSTRACT RNase inhibitor (RI) binds with extraordi￾nary affinity (Ki ' 10213–10216 M) to diverse proteins in the
pancreatic RNase superfamily. In the present study, the
structural basis for the recognition of two RI ligands, human
angiogenin (Ang) and bovine RNase A, has been investigated
by site-specific mutagenesis of human RI and Ang. The RI
residues examined were those that appear to form strong
contacts with RNase A in the crystal structure of the porcine
RIzRNase A complex [Kobe, B. & Deisenhofer, J. (1995) Nature
(London) 374, 183–186] that would not be replicated in the Ang
complex. Ala substitutions of five of these residues (Glu-287,
Lys-320, Glu-401, Cys-408, and Arg-457) were found to have
little or no effect on binding of RNase A. In contrast, replace￾ments of Tyr-434, Asp-435, and Tyr-437 and deletion of the
C-terminal residue Ser-460 substantially weakened affinity
for RNase A: the losses of binding energy associated with the
mutations were 5.9, 3.6, 2.6, and 3.5 kcalymol, respectively.
Thus these four residues, which are neighbors in the tertiary
structure, appear to constitute a ‘‘hot spot’’ for the RNase A
interaction. However, only one of them, Asp-435, was equally
important for binding of Ang; the Ki increases produced by
mutations of the others were 20- to 93-fold smaller for Ang
than for RNase A. Consequently, Tyr-434 plays a significant
but lesser role in the Ang complex, whereas Tyr-437 and
Ser-460 make only minor contributions. Ala mutations of four
Ang residues (His-8, Gln-12, Asn-68, and Glu-108) that cor￾respond to RI contacts on RNase A produced no major
changes in affinity for RI. These findings indicate that RI uses
largely different interactions to achieve its extremely tight
binding of RNase A and Ang.
The interactions of RNase inhibitor (RI), a 50-kDa protein,
with the various '14-kDa members of the pancreatic RNase
superfamily provide a particularly rich and intriguing system
for investigating the important problem of protein–protein
recognition. RI complexes are among the tightest on record:
dissociation constants for the seven ligands whose binding has
been kinetically characterized extend from 10213 to less than
10215 M (1–5). The high affinities of RI for all of its ligands is
remarkable in view of the modest degree of sequence identity
that these proteins share. Human angiogenin (Ang) and
bovine pancreatic RNase A have Ki values of 0.7 fM and 44 fM,
respectively (1), and are 33% identical in sequence (6). Ang
and human placental RNase have virtually indistinguishable Ki
values (3) and yet are only 26% identical (7). Elucidation of the
means by which RI achieves this versatility should shed
considerable light on the nature of protein–protein interac￾tions in general. It may also have implications for treatment of
human diseases because some RI ligands are biological effec￾tors that are thought to participate in various types of pathol￾ogy. One of these, Ang, is a potent inducer of new blood vessel
formation (8) that is critically involved in the establishment
and growth of human tumors in athymic mice (9). RI inhibits
the angiogenic activity of Ang (10), but is unlikely to have
therapeutic utility because of its broad specificity, large size,
and lability. Once the structural basis for RI action is known,
it may be possible to design RI derivatives or mimics that do
not suffer from these limitations.
The available functional and physical information on RI
interactions suggests that RI recognizes its diverse targets in at
least partially different ways (see ref. 11). Replacements of two
poorly conserved residues, Arg-5 of Ang and Lys-7 of RNase
A, greatly weaken RI binding (12, 13). Moreover, deletion of
human RI (hRI) residues 315–371 attenuates binding to Ang
100 times more than it does to RNase A (14). Most impor￾tantly, the binding interface observed in the recently deter￾mined crystal structure of the complex of porcine RI (pRI)
with RNase A (15) includes regions of RNase A that are highly
variable among the different ligands. RI adopts a fold in which
the 15 tandem homologous leucine-rich repeat units that
comprise almost the entire molecule are arranged symmetri￾cally in the shape of a horseshoe (ref. 16; see Fig. 1). When
RNase A binds, one of its lobes fits into the central cavity of
the horseshoe and another contacts the upper face. The
resultant binding surface is large: it includes 28 RI residues
contributed by 12 different repeat units and 24 RNase resi￾dues, also drawn from multiple segments of primary structure.
Only eight of the RNase side-chains or main-chain elements
that interact with RI are conserved in the other RI ligands
whose three-dimensional structures are known [Ang (17);
eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (18)].
In the present study, the structural basis for the tight binding
of hRI to two of its ligands, Ang and RNase A, has been
explored by site-specific mutagenesis. The primary guide for
selection of mutation sites was the structure of the pRIzRNase
A complex. hRI (19) and pRI (20) are 77% identical in
sequence and all but one of the pRI residues involved in RNase
A binding are conserved or conservatively replaced in hRI; Ki
values for the two RIzRNase complexes are nearly identical (1,
2). We find that four residues in the C-terminal region of RI
constitute a ‘‘hot spot’’ (21) for the RNase A interaction that
may account for much of the binding energy of the complex.
Three of these RI residues make lesser contributions to the
Ang complex. Moreover, several Ang residues were examined
that correspond to RI contacts on RNase A and they do not
appear to play important roles. These findings support the view
that RI utilizes a largely different set of interactions to achieve
its extraordinarily tight binding of multiple RNase family

1761MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. [
14C(U)]-D-Glucose was purchased from Du￾PontyNEN. Recombinant human Ang, hRI, and the Ang
mutant K40Q were produced as in earlier studies (22–24).
Angiogenins were quantitated by amino acid analysis; RI
concentrations were determined by inhibition of RNase A
activity (25). The sources of other materials have been de￾scribed (23, 25).
Mutagenesis and Production of Mutant Proteins. Frag￾ments of hRI or Ang genes containing the desired mutations
were generated by PCR and cloned into the expression plas￾mids [pTRP-PRI (24) for RI and pAng3 (12) for Ang] by
standard methods. DNA sequencing confirmed the presence
of the mutations and the absence of any spurious changes. RI
and Ang mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli strain
W3110 cells transformed with the mutant plasmids and were
purified as described (12, 14). SDSyPAGE analysis revealed
that all mutants were .95% homogeneous and had the same
size as the native proteins. The amino acid composition of each
protein was consistent with its proposed structure.
[14C]Ang. A synthetic gene for Ang (23) was cloned into the
plasmid pET11 and expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells
grown in M9 medium containing [14C]glucose as the sole
carbon source. [14C]Ang (2700 cpmymg) was purified to ho￾mogeneity as described (12, 23).
Kinetics. The enzymatic activity of RNase A was measured
spectrophotometrically with CpA, CpG, or C.p as substrate in
0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0) containing 0.1 M NaCl and 10 mgyml BSA
at 258C (14, 25). Dissociation rate constants for inhibitor–
ligand complexes were determined by incubating the ligand
with 1–1.5 molar equivalents of inhibitor for 10 min, then
adding a scavenger for free inhibitor, and measuring the
amount of free ligand present at various times (1). Incubations
were performed at 258C in 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0) containing 0.1
M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, dithiothreitol (5 mM with RNase A,
120 mM with Ang), and 100 mgyml BSA. Dissociation of
complexes was biphasic, with a relatively rapid release of up to
25% of the ligand followed by a slower dissociation of the
remainder. Similar biphasic dissociation has been noted pre￾viously for RI complexes (1, 3, 12, 22, 26). Rate constants were
calculated by treating the slower phase as a first-order process.
The kinetic parameters for association of RI mutants with Ang
were determined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry; associ￾ation of RI mutants with RNase A and wild-type RI (wtRI)
with Ang mutants was measured by examining the competition
between RNase A and Ang or Ang mutant for RI or RI mutant
(25). Most Ki values were calculated from the dissociation and
association rate constants (1). The Ki value for the complex of
the RI mutant Y434A with RNase A was obtained from the
2[I] intercept of a plot of 1yv0 vs. [I] performed at a substrate
(CpA) concentration well below Km; v0 is the initial rate of
cleavage and [I] is the concentration of free inhibitor. The Ki
for the D435A–RIzRNase A complex was calculated from the
Ki for the D435AzAng complex and the distribution of inhibitor
between RNase A and Ang measured at equilibrium (14).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Selection of Potential RI Contact Residues in Ang for
Mutation. The initial approach used for investigating the
structural basis for the tight binding of RI to both Ang and
RNase A was to examine the roles of Ang residues that are
structurally analogous to those in RNase that serve as contacts
in the pRIzRNase A complex (15). Presumably these amino
acids would provide a substantial portion of the binding energy
if RI recognizes the two ligands in similar ways. However, they
are relatively few in number (see ref. 11). Of the 24 contact
residues on RNase A, 4 are deleted in Ang and have no
structural equivalents, another 8 have nonconservative re￾placements, and 2 are main-chain elements that are fairly
distant from their Ang counterparts.
Ten contact residues on RNase A are retained or conser￾vatively replaced in Ang. The importance of three of them—
Arg-31, Lys-40, and His-114 of Ang—has already been as￾sessed by mutagenesis. Lys-40 is clearly a key contact: its
replacement by Gln decreases the binding energy by 4.2
kcalymol, suggesting that it forms a hydrogen bond with an
acidic residue on RI (27). Chemical modification data indicate
that the corresponding lysine in RNase A is also involved in RI
binding (28). In contrast, His-114 of Ang has a minor role (26)
and Arg-31 makes no contribution (12). Another of the Ang
residues under consideration, Ala-106, is also probably unim￾portant because its RNase A counterpart is involved only in
two van der Waals contacts with RI. Leu-35 and Ile-42 of Ang
correspond to Leu-35 and Val-43 of RNase A, which form
nonoptimal hydrogen bonds with RI through their main-chain
atoms. The contributions of such interactions to the AngzRI
complex cannot be assessed readily by Ang mutation.
The four remaining Ang residues—His-8, Gln-12, Asn-68,
and Glu-108—were considered to be suitable targets for
examination. His-8 occupies a position similar to that of Lys-7
in RNase A, which forms a hydrogen bond with RI. Replace￾ment of this lysine by methylcysteine decreases the pRI binding
energy by 2.4 kcalymol (13). Gln-12, Asn-68, and Glu-108 are
equivalent to Gln-11, Asn-71, and Glu-111 in RNase A, each
of which also hydrogen bonds to the inhibitor. The importance
of these residues for the RIzRNase A interaction has not yet
been determined.
Effects of Ang Mutations on RI Binding. We have examined
the inhibitor binding roles of His-8, Gln-12, Asn-68, and
Glu-108 in Ang by characterizing the interactions of the
corresponding Ala mutants (H8A, Q12A, N68A, and E108A)
with hRI. As in previous studies with Ang derivatives (1, 12,
26, 27), Ki values could not be determined directly due to the
extreme tightness of binding and were instead calculated from
the dissociation and association rate constants (Table 1).
Mutation of His-8 produced a 4.6-fold increase in Ki that
reflects primarily a change in the dissociation rate constant.
Substitutions of Gln-12 and Asn-68 increased the Ki value by
only 60% and 20%, respectively, and replacement of Glu-108
improved it slightly. Association of the last derivative was twice
as rapid as for unmodified Ang. The minor effects of these four
mutations, together with the earlier results detailed above,
suggest that interactions of Ang residues that are structurally
equivalent to RI contact residues in RNase A make only a
small contribution to the overall binding energy and, therefore,
that Ang and RNase A bind to RI in largely different ways.
Selection of RI Residues for Mutation. The specific nature
of the differences in the modes of interaction of Ang and
RNase A with RI was investigated by mutating hRI, focusing

1762 Biochemistry: Chen and Shapiro Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997)particularly on residues that appear to form strong contacts
with RNase A that would not be duplicated in the Ang
complex. Twenty-eight RI residues are seen to interact with
RNase A in the crystal structure of the pRI–ligand complex.
Four lie within the segment 1–93 that has been shown to
provide only 3% of the binding energy (29), and it is therefore
unlikely that any of these is important. No biochemical evi￾dence pertinent to the roles of other individual residues has
been reported, although the results of a deletion mutagenesis
study on hRI (14) indicate that interactions with the C￾terminal segment 372–460 may be crucial for both RNase A
and Ang binding. Seven residues within this region and two
from other parts of hRI were selected for mutation (Table 2;
Fig. 1). The pRI equivalents of four of these (Glu-287, Lys-320,
Glu-401, and Arg-457) bind oppositely charged amino acids in
RNase A that are not conserved in Ang. The porcine coun￾terparts of Tyr-434 and Tyr-437 interact extensively with
regions of RNase A that are only partially maintained in Ang;
moreover, the Ang residues that correspond to the RNase
contacts with Tyr-437 are known (Asn-68, Glu-108, His-114)
or suspected (Ala-106) to have little functional importance.
Cys-408 is analogous to Cys-404 in pRI, which makes a 2.8-Å
hydrogen bond with a loop of RNase A that is not present in
Ang. The C-terminal serine (460 in hRI) forms hydrogen
bonds with Lys-7 and Gln-11 of RNase A. As shown above, the
Ang counterpart of Lys-7, His-8, contributes much less to
binding strength than does the lysine, and Gln-12 of Ang does
not appear to form any significant interactions (Table 1).
In contrast to the other RI residues mutated, Asp-435 was
considered to be a likely major contact for Ang. This expec￾tation was not based directly on the structure of the RIzRNase
A complex, but rather on a model (not shown) of the Ang
complex obtained by superposition of the atomic coordinates
of Ang (1ANG-PDB) onto those of RNase A in its RI complex
(Quanta; Molecular Simulations, Waltham, MA). In this
model, the carboxylate of Asp-435 is close to the «-amino
group of the Ang residue Lys-40, which, as already noted, is
thought to form a strong hydrogen bond with RI. Moreover,
no other potential hydrogen-bonding partner on RI lies in the
vicinity of Lys-40. Although this Asp–Lys hydrogen bond is not
observed in the RIzRNase complex (where the corresponding
lysine makes only van der Waals contacts with RI), the
orientation of these residues may well have been altered by the
presence of a sulfate ion that contacts both of them.§
Expression and Purification of RI Mutants. All RI residues
selected were mutated to Ala, with the exception of the
C-terminal residue Ser-460, which was deleted to eliminate any
potential contacts by its a-carboxylate group. Mutant proteins
were expressed in E. coli and purified by RNase A-Sepharose
chromatography. The yields were similar to that obtained for
wtRI (1–1.8 mg per 8 liters of bacterial culture) in all cases
except for Y434A. Only 80 mg of this mutant were recovered,
suggesting that replacement of Tyr-434 greatly weakens bind￾ing to the RNase affinity ligand. Since wtRI binds much more
tightly to Ang than to RNase A, Ang-Sepharose was used for
isolating a second preparation of Y434A, with a resultant
12-fold increase in yield.
Kinetics of Dissociation of RNase A Complexes with RI
Mutants. Earlier studies showed that when single-site muta￾tions produced large decreases in protein–protein binding
affinity they were mainly due to effects on the dissociation rate
constant (kd) (12, 27, 31, 32). Therefore, RI mutants were
screened initially by measuring this parameter. The ligand used
was RNase A because the residues mutated were for the most
part selected on the basis of their predicted importance for
binding this protein. Dissociation was followed by assaying the
enzymatic activity of RNase A released from the complex at
various times after the addition of excess Ang as a scavenger
for free RI mutant. The kd value for the complex of RNase A
with wtRI obtained by this method was 1.2 3 1025zs21,
corresponding to a t1y2 of 16 h. Eight of the nine mutants
dissociated more quickly (Fig. 2). The most dramatic change
was observed with Y434A, which was fully released during the
mixing time of the assay (,30 s). Dissociation of the D435A
complex was also too rapid to allow determination of a value
for kd by this method. Y437A and the Ser-460 deletion mutant
[des(460)] dissociated less quickly, but still much faster than
wtRI (t1y2 5 15 min and 5 min, respectively). E287A, K320A,
E401A, and R457A were released 3- to 5-fold more rapidly
than RI (t1y2 5 4.6, 4.9, 3.6, and 3.3 h, respectively), and C408A
dissociated at about the same rate as RI (t1y2 5 22 h).
Additional kinetic studies were performed with the four
mutants—Y434A, D435A, Y437A, and des(460)—that had
substantially increased dissociation rates.
Kinetics of Dissociation of Ang Complexes with RI Mu￾tants. The standard method for examining dissociation of
complexes of native RI with Ang and Ang mutants has been
to use HPLC to follow the release of free Ang after addition
of excess RNase A as a scavenger for free RI (1). However,
pilot experiments revealed that this approach would not be
suitable for analysis of most of the present RI mutants because
the replacements affect binding of RNase A more drastically
than that of Ang, and thus preclude the use of RNase A as an
efficient scavenger. As an alternative method, Ang was bio￾synthetically labeled with 14C in E. coli and the radiolabeled
§The complex was crystallized from 0.6 M ammonium sulfate. Kinetic
parameters for RI interactions are determined in the absence of
sulfate.

Biochemistry: Chen and Shapiro Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997) 1763protein was used to form the initial complex with RI mutants.
Unlabeled Ang (20 eq) was then added as a scavenger for free
inhibitor, and at various times free and bound [14C]Ang were
separated by Mono S chromatography (1) and quantitated by
scintillation counting. The kd value for the complex of
[
14C]Ang with wtRI was 1.1 3 1027zs21 (t1y2 5 73 days). All four
mutant RI complexes dissociated more rapidly (Fig. 3). The
largest changes were found for the Y434A and D435A com￾plexes, which had half-lives of 26 h and 14 h, respectively—i.e.,
66-fold and 127-fold shorter than for the wtRI complex. The
half-lives of the Y437A and des(460) complexes were 26 days
and 13 days, respectively. The magnitudes of the kd increases
for all mutants except D435A were much smaller than those
observed for the corresponding RNase A complexes.
Kinetics of Association of Ang with RI Mutants. Association
of Ang with RI mutants was monitored by performing
stopped-flow measurements of changes in tryptophan fluo￾rescence that accompany complex formation (25). All mutant
RI complexes exhibited fluorescence enhancements similar to
that for the native complex ('50%). The dependence of the
pseudo-first-order rate constant (kobs) for this fluorescence
increase on Ang concentration in all cases was consistent with
the two-step mechanism described previously for association
of Ang and native RI (25). In this mechanism, rapid formation
of a loose complex is followed by a slower isomerization to the
tight complex. Values for the dissociation constant of the
initial complex (K1), the rate constant for conversion of this
complex to the tight complex (k2), and the apparent second￾order rate constant for association [ka ('k2yK1)] are obtained
from plots of 1ykobs vs. 1y[Ang], which yield straight lines with
intercepts at 1yk2 and 21yK1 and a slope equal to 1yka. These
parameters were altered significantly for Y434A, D435A, and
des(460) (Table 3). The ka values for the first two complexes
were decreased by 3.5-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively. K1 values
for these derivatives appeared to be changed by even greater
factors that were then partially offset by increases in k2.
However, it should be noted that these individual parameters
could not be quantitated as accurately as the k2yK1 ratio owing
to limitations of the stopped-flow instrument, which cannot
measure kobs values more than '100 s21. K1 and k2 values for
des(460) were both decreased by 2- to 3-fold, yielding a ka value
only 30% lower than for wtRI.
Kinetics of Association of RNase A with RI Mutants. No
significant change in fluorescence occurs upon formation of
the RIzRNase A complex. The rate constants for association of
the complexes of the RI mutants Y437A and des(460) with
RNase A were therefore determined by examining the com￾petition between RNase and Ang for inhibitor (1, 14). Both
mutants were found to associate somewhat less rapidly than
wtRI: values for ka were 2.8 3 108 (Y437A) and 2.5 3 108
M21zs21 [des(460)], compared with 3.8 3 108 M21zs21 for RI.
Rapid complex dissociation precluded the use of this approach
for Y434A and D435A.
Dissociation Constants. Ki values for the complexes of Ang
with the four RI mutants and the complexes of RNase A with
Y437A and des(460) were calculated from the rate constants
for dissociation and association. The dissociation constants for
the complexes of RNase with Y434A and D435A were deter￾mined by other methods because the individual rate constants
could not be quantitated. Assays measuring the effects of
Y434A on RNase A-catalyzed CpA cleavage showed that
concentrations of inhibitor well above that of enzyme (0.1 nM)
produced only partial inhibition. Thus it was possible to obtain
the Ki from a standard kinetic plot of 1yv0 vs. [I]. Binding of
D435A to RNase A was considerably tighter than for Y434A,
and the Ki for this complex was determined by measuring the
distribution of RI mutant between Ang and RNase at equi￾librium. Mixtures of Ang, 1.6 molar equivalents of D435A, and
100, 250, or 375 eq of RNase were incubated for 4 days (.7
half-lives of dissociation of either complex). The Ki was then
calculated from the concentrations of free and bound ligands.
The values obtained from the three experiments were in
excellent agreement.

1764 Biochemistry: Chen and Shapiro Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997)The Ki values for the complexes of RNase A with the four
mutants examined (Table 4) are all substantially higher than
for the wtRI complex. The increases range from 84-fold for
Y437A to 23,000-fold for Y434A, corresponding to losses in
binding free energy of 2.6 to 5.9 kcalymol. Thus each of the
sites mutated appears to be important for complex stability.
However, only one of these residues, Asp-435, makes a similar
contribution to binding of Ang (Table 4). Mutations of Tyr-437
and Ser-460 produce relatively small increases in the Ki for Ang
(4.1-fold and 8.5-fold, respectively). The effect of Tyr-434
replacement on affinity for Ang is much larger, but still nearly
two orders of magnitude less than with RNase A. Conse￾quently, the Y434A, Y437A, and des(460) mutants have
greatly enhanced specificity for Ang vs. RNase A: their Ki
values for Ang are lower than those for RNase A by factors of
7500, 1630, and 3640, respectively, compared with a factor of
80 for wtRI.
Dissociation of Complexes of Ang Lys-40 Mutants with
D435A–RI. We investigated the existence of a proposed hy￾drogen bond between Asp-435 of RI and Lys-40 of Ang, the
key residues for the RI–Ang interaction identified by mu￾tagenesis, by determining the rate of dissociation of the Ang
mutant K40Q from its complex with D435A–RI. The half-life
was found to be 2.8 h, nearly identical to that measured for the
complex of K40Q with wtRI (3.4 h; ref. 27). This provides
strong evidence for the hydrogen bond and suggests, moreover,
that Asp-435 does not interact with any Ang residues other
than Lys-40. However, it is unclear whether the converse is also
true because D435A dissociates from its complex with K40Q
several-fold more rapidly than from its complex with native
Ang (t1y2 5 14 h). This difference implies either that the Lys-40
amino group contacts some additional RI residue or that the
presence of the Gln-40 amide group in K40Q is sterically
disruptive.
These alternatives were distinguished by examining the rate
of dissociation of a K40G Ang mutant from RI. The half-life
(15.5 h) was nearly identical to that for the complex of native
Ang with D435A–RI. This supports the second explanation
and suggests that Lys-40 does not form important interactions
with RI residues other than Asp-435. Thus, it would appear
that the extensive contacts between the alkyl portion of the
RNase A residue Lys-41 and the phenyl ring of Tyr-430 seen
in the pRI complex (15) are not replicated in the Ang complex
or that they contribute little to the strength of that complex.
Consistent with this view, measurements of the dissociation
rate of the K40G–AngzY434A–RI complex demonstrate that
the effects of the K40G and Y434A mutations are indepen￾dent. The half-life of this mutant–mutant complex is '10
min—i.e., 100-fold and 200-fold faster than for the complexes
of K40G–Ang and Y434–RI with their unmutated partners,
respectively. These increases in dissociation rate are compa￾rable to those produced by each individual mutation.
Conclusions. The present mutagenesis study reveals major
differences in the molecular interactions of RI with two of its
ligands, RNase A and Ang. Comparison of the structures of
Ang and RNase A suggested that only few Ang residues are
potentially capable of forming important contacts similar to
those of their counterparts in RNase A. Individual mutations
of four of these (His-8, Gln-12, Asn-68, and Glu-108) were
shown here to produce relatively minor changes in binding
affinity, and replacements of two others (Arg-31 and His-114)
were found previously to have little or no effect (12, 26).
Indeed, only a single Ang residue (Lys-40) that is analogous to
an RI contact on RNase A has been demonstrated to have a
major functional role (27). These findings indicate, albeit
indirectly, that RI recognizes Ang and RNase in largely
different ways.
More direct evidence in support of this conclusion is pro￾vided by the differential effects of some RI mutations on
RNase A and Ang binding. Substitutions of three of the four
RI residues examined here in detail—Tyr-434, Tyr-437, and
Ser-460—produced 20- to 93-fold larger increases in the Ki
values for RNase A than for Ang (Table 4). Consequently,
interactions with Tyr-437 and Ser-460 appear to play a minor
role in the Ang complex but contribute substantially to binding
of RNase A. Tyr-434 is particularly critical for RNase recog￾nition: its replacement by Ala decreases the binding energy of
the complex by 5.9 kcalymol—i.e., 32% of the total.¶ Although
this residue is also important for Ang binding, its contribution
is much smaller. Only Asp-435 plays similarly large roles in the
two complexes.¶
The pRI equivalents of Tyr-434, Asp-435, and Tyr-437 lie on
a single loop, which is close to the C-terminal serine (Fig. 1).
All of these residues contact the active site region of RNase A,
and the importance of their human analogues can for the most
part be rationalized in terms of interactions observed in the
crystal structure (Table 2). The side-chain OH of Tyr-430 (434
in hRI) hydrogen bonds to Leu-35 of RNase and the phenyl
ring forms many van der Waals contacts with Pro-42, Arg-39,
and the catalytic residue Lys-41. As a consequence, this amino
acid is almost completely buried in the complex, whereas in the
free inhibitor one face is exposed to solvent (15, 16). Addi￾tional binding energy may derive from the major reorientation
of the RNase residue Arg-39 that is necessary for the ligand to
accommodate the Tyr side chain. The pRI counterpart of
Tyr-437 interacts extensively with the purine binding site of
RNase A: its side chain hydrogen bonds to both Asn-71 and
Glu-111 and makes van der Waals contacts with these and
other residues. Ser-456 (460 in hRI) hydrogen bonds through
its g-OH and a-carboxylate to Lys-7 and Gln-11, components
of two of the phosphate-binding subsites of RNase A. As noted
above, the interaction with Lys-7 contributes 2.4 kcalymol to
pRI binding (13). The somewhat larger energy loss upon
deletion of Ser-460 may indicate that Lys-7 is even more
important for binding hRI or that the contact with Gln-11 in
RNase A provides additional energy. Alternatively, removal of
Ser-460 may weaken the interactions of neighbors such as
Tyr-434.
The residue equivalent to Asp-435 in the pRIzRNase A
crystal structure forms van der Waals contacts with Lys-41 and
His-119, and a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of
Val-43 that can occur only if the Asp carboxylate is protonated.
Such interactions seem unlikely to account for the key con-
¶The thermal denaturation profiles for the RI mutants Y434A and
D435A are nearly identical to that of wtRI (data not shown). Thus
neither mutation appears to have a significant effect on the overall
integrity of RI.

Biochemistry: Chen and Shapiro Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997) 1765tribution of this residue at the pH of 6 used for kinetic
determinations. We propose instead that in solution Asp-435
hydrogen bonds to the «-amino group of Lys-41 and that this
interaction is prevented in the crystal by the bound sulfate.
This hypothesis is based on the demonstrated existence of the
corresponding Asp–Lys hydrogen bond in the RIzAng complex
(see above) and the nearly identical effects of mutating this
Asp on Ang and RNase binding.
The small changes in affinity for Ang associated with the
replacement of Tyr-437 and deletion of Ser-460 in RI are
consistent with the RIzRNase A crystal structure and effects
of the Ang mutations reported here (Table 1) and in previous
studies. Thus the Ang residues (Asn-68 and Glu-108) that
correspond to the hydrogen-bonding partners for Tyr-437 in
RNase A do not contribute to binding strength, perhaps
indicating that they are not positioned similarly to Asn-71 and
Glu-111 in the RNase complex. Minor interactions with His￾114 (26) may then account for the 4-fold decreased affinity of
Y437A. The loss of binding energy due to deletion of Ser-460
approximates the sum of the losses from mutating its putative
hydrogen-bonding partners, His-8 and Gln-12. The effect of
the Tyr-434 mutation on Ang binding appears to be more
complex. Two of the RNase A residues that interact with this
tyrosine (Arg-39 and Pro-42) are not conserved in Ang, and
the counterpart of another (Lys-41) does not form any signif￾icant contacts with it. It is therefore reasonable that Tyr-434
is less important for binding of RNase A than that of Ang. At
the same time, it is not clear how this residue makes its 3.3
kcalymol contribution to the stability of the Ang complex.
The RI residues Tyr-434, Asp-435, Tyr-437, and Ser-460
appear to constitute a hot spot within the binding interface of
the RNase A complex. Five additional RI residues examined
by mutagenesis—Glu-287, Lys-320, Glu-401, Cys-408, and
Arg-457—make only small contributions, estimated to be ,1
kcalymol on the basis of changes in kd, although all of them
were expected to form hydrogen bonds or charge–charge
interactions with RNase (15). These results therefore suggest
that a major portion of the binding energy resides in a small
region of the molecule. It should be noted, however, that the
apparent energetic contributions of individual residues are
frequently not fully additive, and that their sum can in fact
greatly exceed the total energy (21, 31). It is therefore possible
that other regions of RI yet to be examined may be of
considerable importance.
Clearly, a large fraction of the binding energy for the Ang
complex remains to be accounted for, since the contributions
of the four RI residues examined, even if completely additive,
would provide only 43% of the total. Part of this additional
energy presumably derives from contacts for the Ang residues
Arg-5 and Arg-32, whose replacements decrease the free
energy of binding by 2.4 kcalymol and 0.8 kcalymol, respec￾tively (12). Arg-5 would be expected to bind to the C-terminal
region of RI, not far from the four residues examined here,
whereas Arg-32 would interact near the N terminus. Crystal￾lographic studies on the AngzRI complex, together with mu￾tational studies based on this structure, should ultimately
identify the interactions that contribute the remainder of the
binding energy and provide further insights into the different
strategies used by RI to bind so extraordinarily tightly to its
various ligands.
