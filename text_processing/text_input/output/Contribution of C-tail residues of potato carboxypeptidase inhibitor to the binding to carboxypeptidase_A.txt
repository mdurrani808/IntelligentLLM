The role of each residue of the potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) C-terminal tail, in the interaction with
carboxypeptidase A (CPA), has been studied by the analysis of two main kinds of site-directed mutants: the point
substitution of each C-terminal residue by glycine and the sequential deletions of the C-terminal residues. The
mutant PCI±CPA interactions have been characterized by the measurement of their inhibition constant, Ki, in
several cases, by their kinetic association and dissociation constants determined by presteady-state analysis, and
by computational approaches. The role of Pro36 appears to be mainly the restriction of the mobility of the
PCI C-tail. In addition, and unexpectedly, both Gly35 and Pro36 have been found to be important for folding of
the protein core. Val38 has the greatest enthalpic contribution to the PCI±CPA interaction. Although Tyr37 has a
minor contribution to the binding energy of the whole inhibitor, it has been found to be essential for the
interaction with the enzyme following the cleavage of the C-terminal Gly39 by CPA. The energetic contribution
of the PCI secondary binding site has been evaluated to be about half of the total free energy of dissociation of the
PCI±CPA complex.

Protein±protein complexes are of great biological importance,
and many efforts are being devoted to the understanding of the
interactions responsible for these associations [1]. The com￾plexes of proteases and their proteic inhibitors constitute good
models for the study of such interactions and are among the
most frequently investigated [2,3]. In addition, the charac￾terization of the structural and energetic bases of the interaction
of proteases with inhibitors is of great interest because of the
involvement of both in fundamental biological processes, such
as proprotein processing, defense mechanisms, fertilization,
trauma and inflammation, virus replication, extracellular matrix
remodelling, carcinogenesis, invasiveness and others [4,5].
Potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) is a small,
39-residue, globular protein that competitively inhibits several
metallocarboxypeptidases with a Ki in the nanomolar range [6].
The 3D structure of PCI is known in aqueous solution [7] and in
a crystal complex with carboxypeptidase A [8]. The 27-residue
globular core of PCI is stabilized by three disulfide bridges
and has little regular secondary structure besides a short
five-residue helix. PCI belongs to the cystine-knot or T-knot
superfamily of proteins, named because of their particular
pattern of disulfide bridges [9]. A five-residue C-terminal tail
protrudes from the globular core of PCI. This tail docks into the
active site of carboxypeptidase, leading to a stopper-like
inhibition mechanism [8]. The functional importance of this
tail (residues 35±39) as the primary binding site to the enzyme,
and of a short stretch of residues of the core, the secondary
binding site located around Trp28, have been experimentally
tested by chemical modification studies [10]. Both regions have
been proposed to be essential in binding. All residues in the
C-terminal tail of PCI establish contacts with the S2 and S3
binding subsites of CPA except for Gly35. The involvement of
residues from S10 and S1 subsites of CPA is also assumed in the
pre and catalytic stages of the binding, in which the C-terminal
glycine residue of PCI is cleaved in the active site of the
enzyme [8]. Recently we have reported that a new carboxy￾peptidase inhibitor isolated from leech, with no structural
similarity to PCI, presents a very similar C-terminal tail,
probably as a consequence of convergent evolution [11]. This
stresses the importance of this region for the interaction with
carboxypeptidases.
Although the structure of the PCI±CPA complex is relatively
well known, knowledge of the basis of the complex formation
and of its thermodynamic stability is still scarce. To gain insight
into the molecular basis of the PCI±CPA interaction, we have
previously constructed a synthetic gene for PCI, overexpressed
it as soluble protein [12,13] and demonstrated that Val38 is a
key residue for the stabilization of the PCI±CPA complex
[14]. We have also performed computational simulations by
molecular dynamics of PCI or PCI±CPA behavior [15]. We
have recently reported that PCI has some structural
similarities to epidermal growth factor, another protein of
the T-knot superfamily, and can act as an antagonist of
epidermal growth factor, showing interesting anti-tumor

properties [16]. Therefore, we decided to perform a systematic
site-directed mutagenesis study to determine the contributions
of specific residues and chemical groups of PCI to the
thermodynamic stability of the complex with CPA, extending
our previous analysis to all residues of the C-terminal tail.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Chemicals and enzymes
Enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim
Biochemicals, and Pharmacia. [a￾35S]dATPaS was obtained
from Amersham. M13 sequencing kits were from Pharmacia
(T7 sequencing kit). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by
Clontech or by Boehringer. Deep Ventw polymerase was from
New England Biolabs. Taq polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer.
Cloning, site-directed mutagenesis and gene expression
The construction of a synthetic gene for PCI, its expression in
Escherichia coli and a procedure for purification of the
recombinant PCI secreted into the culture medium have been
previously reported [12,13]. The synthetic gene for PCI was
cloned into the pINIII-ompA-3 vector [17] and fused in-frame
to the OmpA signal sequence, generating the vector pIMAM3.
Mutagenesis and sequencing were performed after cloning the
XbaI±EcoRI fragment of pIMAM3, comprising the PCI gene
and the OmpA signal peptide, into vectors M13mp18 and 19
[18].
Site-directed mutagenesis for the mutants: P36G, Y37F,
V38G, delV38G39, was performed according to the method of
Nakamaye and Eckstein [19] using the Sculptor in vitro
mutagenesis system (Amersham). PCR techniques [20]
were used to obtain G35P + P36G, Y37G, delY37V38G39,
delP36Y37V38G39 and G39F mutants. PCR was made in one
step, using a mutagenic primer for each mutant, and the
Forward Universal Primer flanking the 50 end of the PCI gene.
The oligonucleotides employed to obtain each mutant were

The mutated gene was cut with EcoRI/XbaI and ligated to a
M13mp18 vector for sequencing. Sequence analyses were
performed by the dideoxy method [21]. The strain TG1 [22]
was used as a host for propagation of M13 derivatives. Mutant
PCI genes were recloned in pIN-III-ompA-3 plasmid generating
new pIMAM vectors. The E. coli strain MC1061 [23] carrying
the pIMAM plasmids was used to produce wild-type and
mutant recombinant PCIs, as previously reported [12]. Wild￾type and mutant inhibitors were expressed into the culture
medium [12,13].
Immunodetection
Purified polyclonal antibodies against PCI were used to detect
it by ELISA tests during production and purification of wild￾type and mutant forms of the inhibitor. They were obtained as
previously reported [12].
Purification and characterization of wild-type and mutant
PCIs
Wild-type and mutant forms of PCI were purified from
extracellular medium of E. coli [pIMAM] cultures grown in
aerobic fed-batch fermentation, by ion-exchange chromato￾graphy on DEAE FPLC and reverse-phase on C18 HPLC, as
previously reported [13]. PCI was detected by inhibitory
measurement assays, according to Hass and Ryan [24], and
by ELISA. The concentration of the purified solutions of
recombinant PCIs was determined from the A280 of the final
solution (PCI extinction coefficient: :0.1% = 3.0 [24]), and also
by Bradford assay using wtPCI as a standard. For mutants
lacking the Tyr37 residue (except for Y37F PCI), the extinction
coefficient was estimated from the sequence to be :0.1% = 2.8).
Both methods gave the same results. Molecular masses were
confirmed by MALDI-TOF spectrometry.
The mutants delG39 and Y37G + delG39 were prepared by
CPA digestion of wtPCI and the Y37G mutant, respectively, in
1 : 1 ratio (w/w) for 4 h, until Gly39 was completely cut off, as
monitored by MALDI-TOF MS. The proteins were then
purified by C18 RP-HPLC.
The Ki values of the wtPCI and mutants P36G, Y37G, Y37F,
delG39 and G39F for the inhibition of bovine CPA were
determined according to the Henderson method [25]. Ki values
of mutants Y37G + delG39, V38G, delV38G39 and del
Y37V38G39 were calculated according to the Lineweaver±
Burk method. Assays were performed essentially as previously
reported [12]. Benzoyl-glycyl-l-phenylalanine was used as a
substrate at different concentrations. For each one, several
measurements varying PCI concentration were made. Enzyme
(bovine carboxypeptidase A) was 42.5 nm in all cases.
Substrate hydrolysis was followed by A254 measurements
every 2 s for a minimum of 2 min; this value was much longer
in certain experiments. Velocities were expressed as the slope
of the linear increase in absorbance and used to calculate Ki.
Several independent Ki determinations were performed for
mutant PCIs. The average Ki for each form of PCI and Gibbs
free-energy (DGd8) for dissociation of the PCI±CPA complexes
were calculated.
The kinetic constants kon and koff for wtPCI, and mutants
delG39, P36G, Y37G, and Y37G + delG39 were determined by
a continuous photometric assay with the chromogenic substrate
N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-l-phenylalanine [26]. The
assay was performed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl,
pH 7.5, with a substrate concentration of 100 mm and CPA
2 nm. Rate constants kon and koff were obtained by presteady￾state analysis [27]. Equilibrium dissociation constants were
calculated (Ki = koff/kon) and corrected for substrate competi￾tion. Substrate consumption was less than 5% in all assays.
Mass spectrometry
MALDI-TOF MS was performed on a Bruker-BIFLEX
spectrometer. Ionization was accomplished with a 337-nm
pulsed nitrogen laser. Spectra were acquired in linear or
reflectron, positive-ion mode, using a 19-kV acceleration
voltage. Samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of1504 C. Marino-Buslje et al. (Eur. J. Biochem. 267) q FEBS 2000
a 1±10 mm solution of the protein and a saturated solution
of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, used as a matrix, in
aqueous 30% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. One
microliter of this mixture was spotted on the sample slide and
allowed to evaporate to dryness.
Peptide synthesis and characterization
Peptides were synthesized by solid-phase peptide methodology
[28], using Fmoc/OBu-t on a p-alcoxybenzyl alcohol resin. The
resulting crude product was characterized by MALDI-TOF MS.
Determination of the disulfide bond pairing of G35P + P36G
mutant
Assignment of the disulfide bond pairing of G35P + P36G PCI
was accomplished by the partial reduction method [29]. Fifty
micrograms of protein was denatured, partially reduced by
90 nm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and cyanylated by
4.8 mm 1-cyano-4-dimethylamino-pyridinum tetrafluoroborate.
The reaction mixture was subjected to RP-HPLC HPLC and the
three cyanylated isomers resulting from reduction of a single
disulfide bond, identified by MALDI-TOF MS, were isolated.
They were subjected to cleavage by aqueous ammonia on
the N-terminal side of the cyanylated cysteines, and finally
the remaining disulfide bonds were reduced by 0.1 m Tris
(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. The resulting mixtures of peptides
were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and the disulfide bonds
were deduced from the obtained mass maps.
Computer simulation and graphics
Molecular graphics and simulations were performed on SGI
Crimson Elan and 8 processors of an SGI Origin 2000 computer
from Silicon Graphics. The structure of wtPCI was taken from
the X-ray structure of the PCI-IIa isoform in complex with CPA
[8], adding the C-terminal Gly residue. The structure of the PCI
mutants and the corresponding complexes with CPA were
modelled and visualized by means of turbo frodo [30]. These
structures were optimized by 5000 steps of steepest descent
using the gromos package under explicit solvent force field
[31]. The position of the main-chain atoms was constrained,
assuming that conformational changes in mutants are small and
do not significantly perturb the structure of PCI.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The primary binding site of PCI that interacts with the active
site residues of CPA in the PCI±CPA complex [8] is formed by
the last four amino-acid residues of its five-residue C-terminal
tail (Gly35, Pro36, Tyr37, Val38, Gly39). The principal inter￾residue interactions within this zone of the complex are shown
in Fig. 1. In order to analyze in a systematic way the role and
energetic contributions of these residues in the complex, a
number of mutant inhibitors have been obtained, and their
interaction with CPA characterized in terms of their inhibition
constant Ki and the corresponding free energy of dissociation of
the respective complexes DGd8 (Table 1), or their kinetic
association and dissociation constants (kon, koff) (Table 2).
Two complementary approaches have been considered for
the choice of the mutant forms of PCI studied. In one approach,
each one of the C-tail residues have been substituted by Gly, i.e.
mutants P36G, Y37G and V38G (positions 35 and 39 already
have a Gly in the wild-type form). The analyses of the stability
of their corresponding complexes with CPA is expected to
give an evaluation of the contribution of each of the side￾chains of the C-tail residues. In the other approach,
sequential additive deletions of C-terminal residues of PCI
have been constructed, i.e. mutants delG39, delV38G39,
delY37V38G39 and delP36Y37V38G39. These can potentially
show the contribution of each of the residues sequentially
deleted. In addition, some other single and multiple mutant
forms, i.e. G35P + P36G, Y37F, and G39F have been studied
for specific purposes which will be discussed below.
All mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli as secreted,
soluble proteins. With the exceptions noted below, they showed
a chromatographic behavior identical to that of wtPCI, both in
DEAE ion-exchange and C18 reverse-phase columns, indicating
that they keep their polarity, and most probably a native-like

The distances in AÊ corresponding to the observed
inter-residue contacts are indicated.q FEBS 2000 Role of PCI C-tail residues in the PCI±CPA complex (Eur. J. Biochem. 267) 1505
conformation, and also that the disulfide pairing is not altered
by the amino-acid replacements [32].
The inhibition constants for CPA of the different PCI forms
and DGd8 values derived for their complexes are shown in
Table 1. In addition, the inhibition capacity of a synthetic
pentapeptide corresponding to the C-tail of PCI has been
evaluated. Kinetic association and dissociation constants for
several PCI forms were measured by presteady-state analysis
[27], using N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-l-phenylalanine
[26] as the carboxypeptidase substrate. Results are shown in
Table 2. The value of the second order association rate constant
measured for wtPCI, 2.4  106 m21´s21
, is in the range found
for other protease±inhibitor interactions [2] as well as for other
protein±protein interactions [33]. This value is about three
orders of magnitude below that for the diffusion-controlled
reaction. The values of the equilibrium dissociation constants
(Ki) calculated from the kinetic constants are in good agreement
with those determined by equilibrium methods (Table 1).
Computational studies of mutants P36GPCI and Y37GPCI
have also been performed as a complementary way to analyze
the importance of the mutated residues in the conformation of
the PCI C-tail, and thus its binding to the CPA.
In light of the presented results, the role of the different
C-tail PCI residues in the PCI conformation and its binding
to CPA can be analyzed as follows.
Roles of Gly35 and Pro36
The mutant PCI P36G showed a Ki for CPA 100-fold higher
than that of wtPCI (Table 1), indicating that the side-chain of
Pro36 makes a significant contribution of 2.5 kcal´mol21 to the
DGd8 of the complex. Although some contacts involving Pro36
and Tyr198 of CPA have been suggested from the X-ray crystal
structure, the covered surfaces seem not to be extensive [8]
(Fig. 1), and they are not likely to contribute significantly to the
stability of PCI±CPA complex. No hydrogen bonds between
backbone atoms of Pro36 and CPA residues have been observed
in the crystallographic structure; an intramolecular hydrogen
bond has been observed between the carbonyl oxygen and the
indol nitrogen proton of Trp28. Therefore, it seems likely that
the importance of a Pro in position 36 for the binding of PCI to
CPA is not a consequence of the contacts that it can
establish with residues of CPA. Instead, proline probably
keeps the C-terminal tail of PCI in an appropriate orientation to
interact with CPA. Glycine can be considered a drastic
replacement for proline in position 36. It probably has a strong
influence on the main-chain directionality of the PCI C-tail,
inducing an increased freedom of movement of the tail and
therefore a smaller binding energy of the protease-inhibitor
complex. Molecular dynamics studies support this hypothesis
[34]. Residue 36 would therefore have a more entropic than
enthalpic-based influence. The measured values of association
and dissociation constants of P36G binding to CPA (Table 2)
are also in agreement with the above hypothesis. The rate of
association of P36G is one order of magnitude lower than that
of wtPCI, which is in agreement with the higher conformational
mobility of the PCI C-tail. The dissociation rate, although it is
less affected by the mutation, increases with respect to the
wtPCI, contributing also to a higher Ki.
To further explore this issue we tried to extend the study
to Gly35, a residue potentially involved as well in the
maintenance of the C-tail conformation. According to X-ray
crystallography, residue Gly35 of PCI is located away from the
CPA active site in the enzyme±inhibitor complex, and is not
in contact with any atom of CPA. However, there are two
main-chain intramolecular hydrogen bonds between Gly35 and
Ala26 of the PCI core. Previous molecular dynamics studies

method in the case of PCIs delV38G39, del Y37V38G39, V38G, and
P36G. Several independent determinations of the inhibition constant
were made for each form of PCI. The dissociation free energy of the
PCI±CPA complexes was calculated according to the formula

have suggested that these intramolecular bonds could play an
important role in maintenance of the C-tail of the free inhibitor
in an appropriate orientation to bind CPA [15]. In order to test
this hypothesis the mutant G35P + P36G was obtained: the
replacement of Gly35 by Pro would prevent the formation of at
least one of the hydrogen bonds, between Gly35(N) and
Ala26(O), and the change of Pro36 by Gly would help to retain
the C-tail conformation, avoiding the presence of two
consecutive prolines. Only small amounts of such a mutant
protein were expressed (about 1±5% of the production of
wtPCI) and it showed a very different retention time in ion￾exchange FPLC and RP-HPLC compared to wtPCI and the
other mutant proteins (Fig. 2A). The above observations
seemed to indicate that the G35P + P36G mutant does not
fold properly. This was confirmed by determining the disulfide
pairing of this mutant by the method of partial reduction with
Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine [29], which resulted in a
different pairing pattern from the wtPCI native form
(Fig. 2B). This somewhat unexpected result suggests that the
intramolecular hydrogen bonds connecting Gly35 with Ala26 in
the PCI core could be involved in both the orientation of
the C-terminal tail, and in the folding pathway of the inhibitor.
Further evidence supporting this idea is the fact that other
molecules with a similar fold, such as all trypsin squash
inhibitors, have a Gly in this position, immediately after the last
Cys of the T-knot motif [35].
In addition, activity analysis of the purified G35P + P36G
PCI protein was carried out. No inhibitory activity against CPA
was detected even when using 2 mm mutant protein in the assay
(100-fold higher than the concentration required to reach the
50% of inhibition of CPA by wtPCI).
Comparative analysis of mutants delY37V38G39 and
delP36Y37V38G39 (PCI truncated in three or four residues at
the C-terminus) was intended as a parallel way to analyze the
role of Pro36. However, it was found that delP36Y37V38G39 is
unable to fold properly. The expressed protein eluted in several
peaks from the FPLC and HPLC columns, none of them
showing retention times similar to wtPCI or properly folded
mutants, nor inhibitory activity of CPA. Attempts to refold the
protein led to the same mixture of misfolded forms. These
results indicate that the C-tail residues close to the PCI core
are involved in its folding. Such external effects on the
folding pathway of the central globular core are very
interesting and experiments are in progress to analyze this
in depth. The mutant delY37V38G39 is analyzed in the
following section.
Finally, we prepared a synthetic pentapeptide with the
sequence of the C-tail of PCI, GPYVG, to test whether this
sequence in a linear peptide, thus having the maximal
conformational freedom, was able to retain some inhibitory
ability towards CPA. As a control, a mixture of random
peptides having the same amino-acid composition was also
synthesized. CPA was found to hydrolyze GPYVG, although
the hydrolysis rate was slow enough to allow the measurement
of its inhibitory capability (after 6 h the presence of the
tetrapeptide hydrolysis product was undetectable and after 24 h
only 22% of hydrolysis of the last Gly residue was observed). It
was found that peptide GPYVG can act as a slow-binding
inhibitor of CPA, with an estimated Ki about 106
-fold higher
than that of PCI, and being significantly lower than the random
peptide mixture that did not show apparent inhibitory capability
at the same concentration. This result is in agreement with
those observed for P36G PCI, and reflects the importance of the
conformational rigidity of the C-tail of PCI on its binding to
CPA. The slow-binding behavior in the case of the pentapeptide
(preincubation for longer than 1 min was necessary to get
inhibition), could be the consequence of the reduction in

Role of Tyr37
The substitution of Tyr37 by Gly caused an approximately
twofold increase of the inhibition constant of PCI. The crystal
structure of the complex with wtPCI shows that carbon atoms
of the Tyr37 side-chain of PCI can interact with the Cg2 methyl
group of Thr164 and with the Tyr248 phenol ring of CPA
(Fig. 1). No hydrogen bonds are observed involving the
hydroxyl group of Tyr37. Another mutant, Y37F, was
constructed to confirm that this hydroxyl group does not
contribute to the binding energy between PCI and CPA. Indeed,
the inhibition constants of wtPCI and Y37F mutant are
identical. The drop of binding energy caused by substitution
of Tyr37 by Gly, 0.5 kcal´mol21
, can be then considered an
estimation of the contribution of the Tyr37 benzyl group to the
stability of the PCI±CPA complex.
The Ki of the mutant Y37G is 3.5 nm, but it increases to
about 0.4 mm if the mutant is incubated with the enzyme for
10 min. Figure 3 shows the biphasic progress curve obtained
for the hydrolysis of a chromophoric substrate by CPA in the
presence of Y37G PCI. The corresponding progress curves for
wtPCI and Y37G + delG39 PCI are shown for comparison.
Monitoring the reaction by MALDI-TOF MS showed that such
a biphasic behavior is parallel to the scission of the C-terminal
Gly of Y37G PCI by the enzyme (Fig. 3). It is known that for
the inhibition of CPA by wtPCI [8,36], following complex
formation, the C-terminal glycine of the inhibitor is slowly
cleaved by the enzyme. After the C-terminal peptide bond
scission, the strong interaction between CPA and the trimmed
PCI keeps the enzyme active site occluded and retards the
release of the cleaved Gly. In the case of wtPCI, both PCI and
trimmed PCI act as tight binding inhibitors of CPA, having
approximately the same Ki. Therefore, the cleavage of Gly39 in
wtPCI by the enzyme does not cause a biphasic behavior of the
progress curve of substrate hydrolysis. However, the same
cleavage drastically increase the Ki of the inhibitor when this is
the Y37G mutant. This mutant was the only one studied that
presented such a biphasic behavior, a consequence of a big
difference between the Ki before and after Gly39 cleavage.
To better characterize these two forms of the inhibitor, the
cleaved form, Y37G + delG39 PCI, was prepared by digestion
with CPA and HPLC purification. Kinetic association and
dissociation constants of both Y37G PCI (at very short times of
incubation with CPA), and Y37G + delG39 PCI (the purified
form after a long incubation with CPA), were measured
(Table 2). For comparison purposes, the kinetic constants of
wtPCI and the corresponding cleaved form delG39 PCI were
also measured.
From the measured rate constants, it can be seen that the
slight increase in Ki of Y37G PCI with respect to wtPCI is due
to its faster dissociation from CPA (the measured association
rate for Y37G mutant is even slightly higher than that of
wtPCI). The clearly higher dissociation constant can be
explained from the loss of the interactions of the Tyr37 side￾chain with CPA in the complex with Y37G mutant with respect
to wtPCI; however, the behavior of this mutant after the scission
of Gly39 is particularly striking.
The large increase of Ki observed appears, from the values of
the kinetic constants, to be the result of both one order of
magnitude lower association rate and a sixfold higher
dissociation rate with respect to Y37G PCI. For comparison,
in the case of wtPCI, the cleavage of Gly39 leads to a fourfold
higher dissociation rate, while the association rate is essentially
unchanged. Thus, the change in dissociation rate upon deletion
of Gly39 is of the same order for Y37G PCI and wtPCI.
Therefore, the major difference in the behavior of Y37G mutant
compared to wtPCI upon deletion of Gly39 is related to the
decrease in its association rate constant. As Y37G PCI has a kon
even higher than that of wtPCI, it seems likely that the
substitution of Tyr37 by Gly does not strongly affect the
conformation and mobility of the C-tail of PCI, as was the case
of the P36G substitution. There is no apparent reason either to
suppose that cleavage of Gly39 from Y37G PCI would
affect the conformation of the C-tail. A computational
analysis by molecular dynamics simulation of the conforma￾tional mobility of the C-terminal tail of wtPCI and P36G
and Y37G mutants (performed in all three cases on the
Gly39 cleaved form), agrees with this hypothesis (Fig. 4).
Both the calculated B-factors for the C-tail residues and the
dispersion of the angles of the conformations adopted by
the C-tail show that the conformational mobility of Y37G PCI
is similar to the wtPCI, and is increased for P36G PCI, which
shows much larger B-factors and a wider angle dispersion.
Therefore, the less favorable association of Y37G + delG39
PCI with CPA is probably not related to the C-tail mobility, but
it might be caused by a less precise interaction of its C-tail with
the enzyme. The large reduction in Ki of the Y37G mutant upon
cleavage of Gly39 reveals that, although the Tyr37 residue does
not seem to be essential for the binding of the whole inhibitor, it
plays a key role in the interaction (i.e. proper positioning) of the
trimmed inhibitor after cleavage of the C-terminal Gly.
Another approach to evaluate the contribution of Tyr37 in the
binding to CPA has been the construction and comparative
analysis of the deletion mutants delY37V38G39 and del
V38G39. Surprisingly, the DGd8 of both mutants was identical,
5.9 kcal´mol21 (see Table 1). This result seems to indicate that
Tyr37 does not contribute at all to the binding energy, which
would not be in agreement with the analysis of the mutant
Y37G PCI that indicated that the side-chain of Tyr37
contributes 0.5 kcal´mol21 to the binding. A hypothesis to
account for this apparent contradiction was suggested from the
computer graphics analysis of the PCI±CPA complex. It is
found that the peptide bond between Pro36 and Tyr37 can
rotate freely when PCI is in solution, but becomes fixed when
Fig. 4. Computational analysis of the simulated dynamical behavior of
the C-tail. Fluctuations of the last seven residues of PCI species (wt, X;
Y37G, W; P36G, ) are shown as B-factors in the inset. The density of
probability of the c angle (defined in [34]) between the C-tail and the plane
formed by the core of PCI is shown in the main body of the figure. 1508 C. Marino-Buslje et al. (Eur. J. Biochem. 267) q FEBS 2000
the complex with CPA is formed because of the extensive
interactions that Val38 and Tyr37 establish with CPA in the
active site of the enzyme. Tyr37 is then in an appropriate
orientation to establish a p±p interaction with Tyr248 of CPA
and a hydrogen bond involving the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr37
and the guanidinium group of the CPA Arg71. In the mutant
lacking the two C-terminal residues, delV38G39 PCI, Val38 is
not present, and Tyr37 has more freedom to rotate around its
peptide bond when it is in the active site of CPA. Therefore,
neither the aromatic ring of Tyr37 is anymore in the adequate
position to form a p±p interaction with Tyr248, nor the
carbonyl oxygen can establish a hydrogen bond with Arg71. As
a consequence, Tyr37 probably does not establish any stable
interaction with CPA residues and therefore does not play any
role in the stabilization of the complex delV38G39 PCI±CPA.
Role of Val38
The importance of Val38 for the binding of PCI to CPA has
been previously studied. The contribution of its side-chain to
the stability of the PCI±CPA complex is 3.7 kcal´mol21
; each
methyl or methylene group in the b or g position of residue 38
enhances the binding energy of PCI to CPA by 1±1.5
kcal´mol21 [14]. The difference in binding energies between
delV38G39 and delG39 PCI had been assigned to the total
contribution of the Val residue. However, as discussed above,
analysis of the delY37V38G39 mutant performed in this work
has shown that Tyr37 does not contribute to the energy binding
of the delV38G39 mutant. Therefore, the difference in DGd8 of
delV38G39 PCI and delG39 PCI, 5.5 kcal´mol21
, has to
account for the contributions of both Tyr37 and Val38. As the
contributions of the side-chains of these residues can be
estimated from the above analysis at 0.5 and 3.7 kcal´mol21
,
the remaining 1.3 kcal´mol21 can be attributed to the main￾chain contribution of these two residues.
Role of Gly39
The C-terminal residue of PCI, Gly39, is slowly cleaved off by
the enzyme during the first stages of the inhibition process,
acting therefore as a substrate. The Ki value of the mutant
delG39 is only slightly higher than that of the wtPCI, indicating
that Gly39 contributes with 0.4 kcal´mol21 to the binding
energy of the complex PCI±CPA (see Table 1). As discussed
above, this change is related to the fourfold faster speed of
dissociation (Table 2).
Gly is a poor substrate for metallocarboxypeptidases [37]. In
order to test whether a PCI redesigned to be a better substrate
would affect the interaction with the CPA active site, we
constructed a mutant in which Gly39 was substituted by Phe, a
preferred substrate for CPA. As expected, such a G39F mutant
is more efficiently cleaved by CPA than wtPCI, giving rise
quickly to delG39 PCI. Surprisingly, analysis of the mutant
with incubation times with CPA short enough to avoid
significant Phe39 cleavage during the measurements showed
a Ki 10-fold higher than that of wtPCI. Thus, although the
C-terminal Phe is a better substrate for CPA than Gly, the
initial binding of the mutant to CPA is not efficient, probably as
a result of a more difficult docking into the active site of the
enzyme.
Contribution of the secondary binding site
X-ray studies have indicated that only residues 37±39 of the
PCI C-tail (the primary binding site) establish extensive
interactions with CPA residues and are the most important
contributors to the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme. As
deduced above, Pro36 does not seem to make a significant
enthalpic contribution to binding, its role being the main￾tenance of the C-tail in an appropriate orientation. According to
this hypothesis, the mutant PCI lacking the three terminal
residues, delY37V38G39 PCI, should not have any of the
residues responsible for the binding interactions in the primary
contact region. Therefore, the binding energy of this mutant to
CPA, 5.9 kcal´mol21
, could be considered as the overall
energetic contribution of the secondary contact region of PCI,
constituted by residues His15, Phe23, Trp28, Asn29, Ser30
and Ala31 [8]. The particular contribution of each one of
these residues to the binding to the enzyme await further
experimentation to be determined.
The ratio of estimated binding energies of the primary and
secondary binding sites (5.9 kcal´mol21
/5.9 kcal´mol21
,
assuming additivity) is in fair agreement with what can be
expected from the analysis of the structure of the PCI±CPA
complex [8], where the observed ratio of the number of atoms
that establish contacts and the buried surface for primary to
secondary binding regions is about 0.6 : 0.4. Our energetic
estimation would imply that the `secondary' binding site would
play a more important role than formerly expected.
The question of additivity of mutational effects in proteins is
a common point of interest in protein±protein interaction
studies. It has been demonstrated in an significant number of
cases that the sum of the free energy changes derived from
single mutations is nearly equal to the free energy change
measured in multiple mutants [38], with the exception of
cases in which the mutations are altering the overall three￾dimensional structure or binding mode. Some of the mutants
presented in this study could be examples of these latter cases.
A striking example is the simultaneous deletion of Gly39 and
substitution of Tyr37 by Gly which causes a 3.2 kcal´mol21
decrease of binding energy, instead of 0.9 kcal´mol21 expected
from the sum of the energy differences of the single mutations.
Similarly, the deletion of the two and three C-terminal residues
causes the same reduction in binding energy between PCI and
CPA, and no contribution of Tyr37 can be seen from this
comparison. This lack of additivity due to cooperative effects
can, in some cases, limit the validity of simple site-directed
mutagenesis approaches used to estimate the thermodynamic
contributions of chemical groups to the stability of protein±
protein complexes [39]. It also gives clues to the interpretation
of the perturbations produced by the mutations.
