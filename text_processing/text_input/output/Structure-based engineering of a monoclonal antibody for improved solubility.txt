Protein aggregation is of great concern to pharmaceutical
formulations and has been implicated in several diseases.
We engineered an anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody
CNTO607 for improved solubility. Three structure-based
engineering approaches were employed in this study:
(i) modifying the isoelectric point (pI), (ii) decreasing the
overall surface hydrophobicity and (iii) re-introducing an
N-linked carbohydrate moiety within a complementarity￾determining region (CDR) sequence. A mutant was ident￾ified with a modified pI that had a 2-fold improvement in
solubility while retaining the binding affinity to IL-13.
Several mutants with decreased overall surface hydropho￾bicity also showed moderately improved solubility while
maintaining a similar antigen affinity. Structural studies
combined with mutagenesis data identified an aggregation
‘hot spot’ in heavy-chain CDR3 (H-CDR3) that contains
three residues (99FHW100a). The same residues, however,
were found to be essential for high affinity binding to
IL-13. On the basis of the spatial proximity and germline
sequence, we reintroduced the consensus N-glycosylation
site in H-CDR2 which was found in the original antibody,
anticipating that the carbohydrate moiety would shield
the aggregation ‘hot spot’ in H-CDR3 while not interfer￾ing with antigen binding. Peptide mapping and mass
spectrometric analysis revealed that the N-glycosylation
site was generally occupied. This variant showed greatly
improved solubility and bound to IL-13 with affinity
similar to CNTO607 without the N-linked carbohydrate.
All three engineering approaches led to improved solubi￾lity and adding an N-linked carbohydrate to the CDR
was the most effective route for enhancing the solubility
of CNTO607.

Introduction
Successful development and launch of a new protein thera￾peutic is dependent on the selection of a protein candidate
with good activity and biophysical properties. The biophysi￾cal properties of candidate molecules have implications for
development of therapeutics relating to purification, formu￾lation, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and dosing regi￾mens. For biopharmaceuticals, low solubility of therapeutic
proteins renders formulation development more difficult and
may lead to poor bio-distribution, undesirable pharmacoki￾netics behavior and immunogenicity in vivo (Kerns and Di,
2003). Indeed, several recent reports on computational and
traditional biophysical methods have described new strategies
to characterize and improve the biophysical properties of
therapeutic candidates (Jespers et al., 2004; Famm and
Winter, 2006; Lienqueo et al., 2006; Demeule et al., 2007;
Jacobs et al., 2009).
The intrinsic properties of proteins such as size, hydropho￾bicity, electrostatics and charge distribution play important
roles in protein solubility (Bagby et al., 2001; Mosavi and
Peng, 2003; Andrews et al., 2005; Strickler et al., 2006;
Trevino et al., 2007). Aggregation or precipitation is driven
by protein self-association, which is often the result of weak
molecular interactions. Such interactions are a function of
the solution environment and include factors such as pH,
ionic strength, temperature and co-solutes. Recognizing the
importance of solubility, a variety of strategies have been
employed to improve protein solubility including site-specific
mutagenesis (Fowler et al., 2005; Pawar et al., 2005;
Swencki-Underwood et al., 2008) and stabilizing peptide
fusions (Lee et al., 2005). Covalent modification and conju￾gation of proteins by pegylation or hyperglycosylation fre￾quently used to enhance pharmacokinetics and in vivo
half-life also often result in higher solubility (Wiecek et al.,
2007; Veronese and Mero, 2008).
CNTO607 is a potent neutralizing anti-IL-13 monoclonal
antibody selected using Morphosys HuCAL phage display
technology (Rothe et al., 2008). An examination of the orig￾inal complementarity-determining region (CDR) sequences
from phage display selection indicated the presence of a con￾sensus N-linked glycosylation site (53NSS55) in heavy-chain
CDR2 (H-CDR2). Expression of the mAb in mammalian cell
cultures may thus lead to glycosylation at this site. This
could potentially lead to additional heterogeneity of the final
therapeutic mAb. To improve homogeneity, the potential
glycosylation site was removed by replacing N53 with an
aspartic acid, a residue commonly encoded at this position in
the corresponding germline genes (Vh3). The resulting anti￾body retained high affinity for IL-13, although the antibody
exhibited low solubility and aggregation near neutral pH.
In an effort to improve the biophysical properties of the
antibody, we employed three protein-engineering strategies:
(i) altering the isoelectric point ( pI); (ii) decreasing overall
surface hydrophobicity and (iii) introducing an N-linked
carbohydrate within H-CDR2 to disrupt a suspected mechan￾ism of aggregation based on structural studies. We demon￾strate that shielding an aggregation-promoting hydrophobic
patch on the surface of the antibody with a carbohydrate

Materials and methods
Reagents
Human recombinant IL-13 was purchased from R&D System
(Minneapolis, MN, USA). Sialidase A was obtained from
SelectinBio (Pleasanton, CA, USA). Trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA), EDTA disodium salt and 8 M guanidine hydrochlo￾ride stock solution were purchased from Thermo Scientific
Inc. (Rockford, IL, USA). Acetonitrile was purchased from
Honeywell International Inc. Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon,
MI, USA). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was purchased from
Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA). Iodoacetamide was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (St Louis, MO, USA). Ultrapure
1 M Tris-hydrochloride stock solution was purchased from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Lysyl endoproteinase C
mass spectrometry grade was purchased from Wako
Chemicals USA, Inc. (Richmond, VA, USA).
Engineered antibodies with germline mutations
The sequence of the light chain (LC) of CNTO607 was com￾pared with germline sequences in the IMGT database
(Lefranc et al., 2009) using BLAST (Rangwala and Karypis,
2007). The closest matching germline gene for LC vb_3h
(Vl3) was chosen based on the overall sequence identity.
Residues in the framework region were then mutated to their
counterparts in the chosen germline gene.
Construction of expression plasmids
Gene-specific primers were designed and synthesized based
on the heavy-chain (HC) V-region of CNTO607. The
primers contained flanking HindIII and EcoR1 restriction
enzyme sites for cloning into the Lonza pEE GS (glutamine
synthetase) vector that contains human IgG1 constant
regions. CNTO607 HC expression plasmid was designated as
p3401. The LC V-region of CNTO607 was cloned into the
pEE GS vector that contains human lambda constant regions.
CNTO607 LC expression plasmid was designated as p3408.
The plasmids, p3401 and p3408, were used as templates to
generate different variants either on CNTO607 HC or on
CNTO607 LC. Various mutations, as listed in Table I, were
introduced using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene, Cat# 200522).
Expression and purification
CNTO607 used in these studies is a fully human IgG1l
monoclonal antibody against human IL-13 (Centocor R&D)
produced from an SP2/0 stable cell line. The mutant anti￾bodies were transiently co-expressed by HC and LC plasmids
in either HEK293E or CHO cells. Antibody variants were
expressed transiently in 1 l volume HEK293E or CHO trans￾fections. We did not observe cell-line specific, HEK293E or
CHO, differences in antibody solubility among the
CNTO607 variants. For each transfection, in separate tubes,
150 mg each of LC and HC DNA and Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen Cat# 11668027) were diluted in 20 ml OptiMem
media. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for
5 min before combining the contents of both tubes and incu￾bating for additional 20 min at room temperature. The DNA/
Lipofectamine/OptiMem complex was added to the cells
drop-wise directly into media and cells were placed in the
incubator for 24 h. The transfection media was replaced with
293SFMII production media (Invitrogen Cat# 11686029)
24 h later. The conditioned media were harvested for purifi￾cation 6 days later, after the transfections were set up.
Antibodies were purified from the harvested media using
MabSelect SuRe resin (GE Healthcare, Cat# 17-5438-03).
The purity of the antibodies was analyzed by SDS – 10%
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) according to
Laemmli (1970).
Isoelectric-focusing gel analysis
To determine the pI values of antibodies, isoelectric-focusing
(IEF) gel electrophoresis was performed. Protein samples
were analyzed with Novexw Pre-Cast Vertical pH 3-10 IEF
Gels (Invitrogen). Samples comprised of 2 – 5 mg of proteins
were loaded on the gel. The detailed procedures were con￾ducted according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Solubility measurements
To determine the solubilities of antibodies, experiments were
carried out using the ultrafiltration method (Haire and Blow,
2001; van Reis and Zydney, 2001; Moore and Kery, 2009).
Antibodies in PBS buffer were added to Vivaspin ultrafiltra￾tion spin columns with 30 000 MWCO (Vivascience Ltd.) at
Table I. Sequence summary for anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody variants
a
Residue numbered annotations were identified according to Chothia structure-based numbering scheme

the swing bucket rotor in Eppendorf Centrifuge 5804R and
centrifuged at speed 3000g. Once the volume was reduced
to 2 ml, supernatant was transferred to a 2-ml spin column
and centrifuges at speed 4000g for 20 min. When the
volume was reduced to 500 ml, the sample was transferred to
a Vivaspin 500 spin column and centrifuged at 15 000g
until precipitation was observed using an Eppendorf 5415R
centrifuge. After spinning down the precipitation, the super￾natant was equilibrated at room temperature overnight. After
another centrifugation step to remove the precipitation, the
supernatant was collected and the antibody concentration in
solution was determined after appropriate dilution by
measuring absorbance at 280 nm using a Nanodrop (Thermo
Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). If the concentrations
reach more than 100 mg/ml without visible precipitation,
further concentration was stopped and the protein concen￾tration was determined as described.
Binding affinity determination by Biacore analysis
Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed
using a Biacore 3000 optical biosensor (Biacore AB,
Uppsala, Sweden; currently part of GE Healthcare). The
experiments were performed at 258C in D-PBS buffer con￾taining 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% surfactant P20. To analyze
the interaction of the antibodies with IL-13 (R&D systems,
Inc.), a capture surface was generated by covalent coupling
of goat antihuman IgG Fcg fragment (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) to a CM-5 sensor chip.
The antihuman Fcg fragment-specific antibody was diluted
into 10 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5 (Biacore AB) and
coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran surface of the
CM-5 chip [3000 response units (RU)] using the manufac￾turer’s instructions for amine-coupling chemistry. The
remaining reactive groups on the surface were deactivated
using ethanolamine –HCl. To perform kinetics experiments,
100 RU of anti-IL-13 antibodies were captured on this
surface followed by injection of IL-13 at various concen￾trations (typically 0.10 – 5 nM) for an 8-min period at 30 ml/
min. This was followed by buffer flow for 10 min to 1 h to
monitor binding dissociation. The capture surface was regen￾erated using 100 mM phosphoric acid, followed by injection
of running buffer.
Double reference subtraction of the data was performed to
correct for buffer contribution to the signal and instrument
noise using the Scrubber software (Myszka, 1999) version
1.1 g (BioLogic Software) for referencing. After this initial
data processing, kinetic analysis of the data was performed
using the BIAevaluation software, version 4.0.1 (Biacore
AB) assuming a simple 1:1 binding model.
Hydrophobic interaction chromatography
The procedure used to measure the antibody retention time
in hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) is similar
to one described previously (Lienqueo et al., 2006; To and
Lenhoff, 2007a) with some modifications. The experiments
were performed on a Beckman-Coulter HPLC system
equipped with a System Goldw 126 Solvent Module gradient
pump, a System Goldw 508 Autosampler with a 200-ml
injection loop and System Goldw UV detector of eluted
protein. A TSK-GELw Ether-5PW column (7.5  0.75 cm)
made of stainless steel and 10 mm diameter particles (P/N
08641, Tosoh Bioscience, LLC, Montgomeryville, PA, USA)
was equilibrated at room temperature with 80% 2 M
ammonium sulfate in PBS using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.
Samples were diluted to 100 mg/ml and 100 ml was
injected. The gradient used for each isocratic elution was
80% 2 M ammonium sulfate/20% PBS in 35 min.
After each isocratic run, the column was washed with
5 –10 column volumes of PBS and then re-equilibrated with
five column volumes of buffer containing the appropriate
ammonium sulfate concentration prior to the next sample
injection.
Characterization of N-glycosylation
Antibody samples (1 mg/ml) were brought into 20 mM
Tris –HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and digested with sialidase A (at
1:100 enzyme to substrate ratio) at 378C for 24 h (Raju and
Scallon, 2007). The desialylated antibody samples were
purified using a protein A affinity column and subjected to
IEF gel analysis. pIs were determined by applying the
antibodies to Novexw IEF Gels (Invitrogen, CA, USA)
contain 5% polyacrylamide and following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
The glycosylation in Mab VII was verified using
HPLC-Qq/TOF mass spectrometry (Agilent 1100 coupled
with a Waters Q-TOF MS). Peptide mapping of Mab VII
was performed as described previously (Dorai et al., 2009)
with some modifications. Briefly, 200 mg of the mAb was
desalted, dried and reconstituted with 150 ml of 6 M guani￾dine hydrochloride, 50 mM Tris –HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0.
The sample was reduced with 1.5 ml of 1.0 M DTT at 378C
for 1 h and alkylated with 3.0 ml of 1 M sodium iodoaceta￾mide at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. The reaction
was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of 1.0 M DTT. The
reduced and alkylated sample was then diluted with 750 ml
of 50 mM Tris –HCl, pH 8.0, and digested with Lys-C
(enzyme/protein ¼ 1:25) (w/w) for 4 h at 378C. The reaction
was quenched by the addition of 5 ml of TFA, and the resul￾tant peptides were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC using a
narrow bore C18 column (Vydac, 218TP5215, 2.1 mm 
150 mm) and a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The
chromatography was performed on an Agilent HPLC (model
1100) with a capillary pump and a diode array detector.
Absorbance was monitored and collected at 214 and 280 nm.
An online LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo
Electron) with an electrospray source was used in-line after
the UV detector to collect mass spectra of the intact peptide
as well as to fragment the peptides for sequencing (MS/MS
analysis).
Thermal stability analysis
Thermal stability experiments were carried out in PBS.
Antibodies were introduced into the sample chamber of a
Nano DSC calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences/TA
Instruments) at concentrations of 0.5– 1.0 mg/ml. The corre￾sponding PBS dialysate used in the sample preparation was
introduced into the reference chamber. Each mAb-buffer pair
was heated linearly from 208C to 1008C at a fixed pressure
of 3 atm, while differential power was monitored. In
addition, PBS was added to both sample and reference
chambers and scans were collected for baseline subtraction
using the same procedure as for the protein samples.
Engineering of an antibody for improved solubility
645
 at Monash University on December 7, 2014 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from           Results
The solubility of a protein depends strongly on the pH of the
solution. We use the term solubility here to define the
maximum protein concentration that can be achieved before
precipitation is observed. The highest concentration of
CNTO607 in PBS buffer at pH 7.2 is 13 mg/ml. To
evaluate the antibody in a biologically relevant pH environ￾ment, we focused on improving CNTO607 solubility in this
buffer.
The effect of pI
The range for pI of CNTO607 was determined by IEF gel
analysis to be 7.4– 7.5 (Fig. 1). The multiple bands observed
in the gel are typical of antibodies due to charge heterogen￾eity introduced by the variability of the N-linked glycosyla￾tion at N297 in the Fc region (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch,
2008; Raju, 2008). Owing to the close proximity of the pI to
the pH of PBS buffer, CNTO607 is likely to have a low net
charge in solution. Since the solubility of a protein in a
buffer is often lowest near its pI, it was hypothesized that
changing the pI of CNTO607 would yield a more soluble
antibody. To shift the pI of CNTO607 while introducing
minimal risk of immunogenicity, the Fv sequence was
altered to match that of the closest germline gene achieving
a net gain in positive charge, as described in the methods.
The sequence differences between the LC of CNTO607 and
germline vb_3h (Vl3) are E3 ! V and 77GTQAE81 !
77RVEAG81 in framework regions 1 and 3, respectively.
Thus, a CNTO607 variant with such changes would have a
net charge increase of 2. On the basis of the crystal structures
of the Fab fragment of CNTO607 and its complex with
IL-13 (Teplyakov et al., 2009), it was considered unlikely
that these residue changes would impact antigen binding.
Therefore, a variant, Mab II, with mutations of E3 ! V and
77GTQAE81 ! 77RVEAG81 in the LC was constructed
(Table I). With a net gain of þ2.0 per Fab in charge, Mab
II was predicted to have a pI of 7.9. The IEF gel analysis
of Mab II indicated that it had an average pI of 7.8
(Fig. 1), in agreement with the prediction. Biacore analysis
confirmed that Mab II bound to IL-13 with an affinity
similar to that of CNTO607 (Table II). Upon concentrating,
the solubility of Mab II was determined to be 29 mg/ml,
more than double that of CNTO607 (Table II). This result
is consistent with our hypothesis that a change in pI should
improve the solubility of the molecule in PBS buffer.
However, Mab II is still considerably less soluble than
many other antibodies, suggesting that the limited change
in charge was insufficient to overcome the other factors
that limit its solubility. Further change in pI was hampered
by the restraint to maintain a sequence compatible with
those of the human germline. These beneficial mutations in
the LC nevertheless were incorporated in some of the sub￾sequent variants to assess if other improvements in solubi￾lity would be additive.
The effect of hydrophobicity
Hydrophobic interactions have long been recognized as
major contributors to high affinity interactions between
macromolecules. Given the high affinity of CNTO607 to
IL-13 (18 pM), it is not surprising that the CDR loops in
CNTO607 contain a number of hydrophobic residues that
form a prominent hydrophobic ridge (Fig. 2A). Both the LC
and the HC contribute to this structural feature. Clusters of
such hydrophobic residues on the surface of proteins tend to
favor non-specific interactions that lead to aggregation
(Nasreen et al., 2006). On the basis of the crystal structure of
the Fab fragment of CNTO607 bound to IL-13, most of these
hydrophobic residues are involved directly in IL-13 binding
(Teplyakov et al., 2009). Nevertheless, we attempted to
reduce the surface hydrophobicity of the CDR loops in
CNTO607 by site-directed mutagenesis.
A number of diverse light-chain CDR3 (L-CDR3)
sequences were discovered during the phage display affinity
maturation process, indicating tolerance in the L-CDR3
region. On the basis of the crystal structure of the complex
between CNTO607 Fab and IL-13, the principal antibody
residues that contact IL-13 are located in H-CDR3, L-CDR1
and L-CDR2, whereas H-CDR1 and L-CDR3 make very few

replaced the L-CDR3 with more hydrophilic sequences,
resulting in Mab III, IV and V (Table I). Biacore data
showed that these CNTO607 variants bind to IL-13 with affi￾nities similar to that of CNTO607. The structural and
binding results suggested that these antibody variants would
likely recognize a very same epitope. The hydrophobicity of
these antibodies was evaluated by HIC. The retention time of
a protein by HIC is determined by protein surface hydropho￾bicity as well as protein size (Lienqueo et al., 2006; To and
Lenhoff, 2007a). When two proteins have virtually the same
size and similar structures, the less hydrophobic protein will
elute earlier on an HIC column. Although Mab III, IV and V
eluted earlier on an HIC column, suggesting reduced
surface hydrophobicity (Table II), the solubilities of Mab
III (25 mg/ml), Mab IV (12 mg/ml) and Mab V
(29 mg/ml) were not improved dramatically. Thus, the HIC
retention time does not correlate linearly with solubility.
These data also indicated that the L-CDR3 hydrophobicity
was not critical for CNTO607 aggregation.
Identification of the aggregation ‘hot spot’
In the analysis of the crystal structure of the Fab fragment of
CNTO607, it was observed that a nearly symmetrical tetra￾mer was formed as a result of crystal-packing contacts
(Fig. 3A; Teplyakov et al., 2009). In this tetramer, an aro￾matic amino acid residue triad 99FHW100a in H-CDR3 of a
Fab molecule was nestled against the elbow region of a
symmetry-related Fab molecule (Fig. 3B). These three resi￾dues located near the center of the hydrophobic ridge occupy
the center of the antigen-recognition site found in the three￾dimensional structure of the Fab:IL-13 complex (Fig. 2B;
Teplyakov et al., 2009). The potential contribution of these
residues to CNTO607 aggregation was explored by mutating
them all to alanine residues, resulting in Mab VI (99FHW100a
! 99AAA100a). This triple alanine mutant was found to be

less hydrophobic as indicated by a 6.5 min reduction in the
HIC elution time (Table II). However, not surprisingly, Mab
VI no longer binds to IL-13 with high affinity (Table II).
This result pinpointed the aromatic triad in the H-CDR3
sequence as a ‘hot spot’ for both aggregation and interaction
with IL-13.
A variable region N-glycan to prevent aggregation
The crystal packing of the Fab (Fig. 3A and B) suggested a
potential mechanism of aggregation. If this tetrameric
packing exists in solution, albeit at low affinity, it would
likely lead to large clusters of mAbs at high protein concen￾tration due to the bivalency of the mAb. Thus, we sought to
disrupt this potential specific mAb –mAb polymerization
while keeping the hydrophobic ‘hot spot’ in the H-CDR3
sequence intact for antigen binding. By careful examination
of the structures of Fab607 and Fab607/IL-13 complex, we
concluded that D53 of CNTO607 H-CDR2 was adjacent to
the aromatic triad and exposed to the solvent, but not directly
involved in antigen binding so that placement of an N-linked
carbohydrate moiety at D53 might block the mAb –mAb
interaction (Fig. 2B). Therefore, D53 of CNTO607 H-CDR2
was mutated to N in combination with the pI mutations in
the LC (Table I). The resulting molecule, Mab VII, was gen￾erated and characterized for solubility and ligand binding.
Upon concentration, Mab VII was found to be soluble to
.110 mg/ml in PBS buffer (Table II). Although the upper
limit of the solubility could not be determined because of the
quantity limitation, it was obvious that Mab VII exhibited far
superior solubility when compared with Mab II. Biacore
analysis indicated that Mab VII bound to IL-13 with affinity
comparable to CNTO607 and Mab II (Table II). Mab VII
was analyzed further to determine whether the
N-glycosylation site was occupied using analytical methods
including SDS –PAGE, IEF gel analysis combined with siali￾dase A treatment and peptide mapping using mass spec￾trometry. The HC of Mab VII showed distinctively higher
molecular weight than that of CNTO607 in SDS –PAGE gel
under reducing condition (Fig. 4A), consistent with an
additional N-linked carbohydrate moiety. The relatively
narrow band on the gel also suggested that the
N-glycosylation site was almost fully occupied. Although the
IEF gel of CNTO607 showed multiple bands due to charge
heterogeneity in the N-linked glycosylation in the Fc region,
there were many more bands for Mab VII consistent with
additional heterogeneity due to the new glycosylation in the
Fv region. Upon treatment with sialidase A, which specifi￾cally removes the sialic acids on glycans, Mab VII showed a
significant increase in pI (Fig. 4B) whereas CNTO607 shows
little difference (data not shown). The insensitivity of
CNTO607 to sialidase A treatment is consistent with pre￾vious reports that the N-linked glycosylation in the Fc region
is minimally sialylated (Scallon et al., 2007). The large
change observed for Mab VII suggested that the N-linked
glycosylation in the Fv of Mab VII was significantly sialy￾lated, analogous to the variable region N-linked carbohydrate
in Erbitux (Qian et al., 2007). The peptide mapping study
led to the conclusion that residue N53 was indeed glycosy￾lated and that the carbohydrate primarily consisted of a core￾fucosylated, tri-antennary structure with fucose (1), galactose
(2– 3), and N-acetylneuraminic acid (0 – 3) heterogeneity
(Fig. 5, top panel). On the basis of peak areas from the
HPLC chromatogram, it was estimated that 96% of the
antibody population had carbohydrate attached to N53
(Fig. 5, bottom panel).
Taken together, the analytical results demonstrated that
an N-linked carbohydrate existed in the H-CDR2 loop of
Mab VII. This carbohydrate moiety prevented aggregation of
the antibody while allowing it to interact with the antigen
with high affinity.
The effect of thermal stability
Poor thermal stability can affect the solubility of proteins
and lead to aggregation (Ewert et al., 2003; Jespers et al.,
2004; Riechmann and Winter, 2006; Christ et al., 2007;
Famm et al., 2008; Hmila et al., 2008). We sought to deter￾mine whether low thermal stability contributed to the low
solubility of some of the variants by measuring the melting
temperature. A typical differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) profile for an antibody contains multiple transitions,
corresponding to the unfolding processes of CH2 domain,
the Fab fragment and CH3 domain, respectively (Garber and
Demarest, 2007). Sometimes not all the transitions are
resolved. The Fab fragment transition signal is typically the
highest of the transition signals (Garber and Demarest,
2007). The sequences of the constant domains are invariable
and isotype-dependent. Their unfolding transition tempera￾tures are therefore less variable for antibodies of the same
isotype. In contrast, the variable domain sequences can be
very diverse, leading to a wide range of Fab unfolding tran￾sition temperatures from one antibody to another.
The thermal stability of CNTO607 and a number of the
variants was evaluated by DSC (Table II). Figure 6A
shows the DSC profiles of CNTO607, the Fab fragment of
CNTO607 and IgG1-Fc. With the IgG1-Fc sample, we
observed two transitions at 708C and 828C, which corre￾spond to the CH2 and CH3 domains, respectively (Garber
and Demarest, 2007). Fab607 (described in Teplyakov
et al., 2009) yielded two transitions at 658C and 778C, cor￾responding to the Fv and CH1 domains, respectively.
CNTO607 yielded 4 transitions that generally aligned
with the Fab and IgG1-Fc transitions. Therefore, we
assigned the transitions near 638C, 708C, 768C and 838C to
the Fv, CH2, CH1 and CH3 domains, respectively.
Figure 6B shows the DSC profiles of CNTO607, Mab V,
Mab VI and Mab VII. All of the antibodies in this study
possessed the human IgG1 isotype and therefore had identi￾cal constant domains. The Fab fragment melting tempera￾tures ranged from 61.98C to 69.48C. No correlation was
observed between the melting temperatures and the solubi￾lity, albeit they are within a relatively small range. Both
Mab V and Mab VII are highly soluble antibodies yet their
melting temperatures were at the high and low end of the
Tm range, respectively.
Discussion
In the work presented here, we successfully engineered a low
solubility monoclonal antibody into more soluble antibodies
while maintaining high affinity to the antigen. Three strat￾egies were devised to improve the solubility: (i) modifying
the pI, (ii) decreasing the overall surface hydrophobicity and
(iii) re-introducing an N-linked carbohydrate moiety in the
S.-J.Wu et al.

of success in improving solubility. Two of the variants, Mab
VI and Mab VII, were highly soluble. However, Mab VI,
with greatly reduced hydrophobicity, lost binding affinity to
IL-13. Mab VII, on the other hand, is a highly soluble and
potent antibody with elevated pI and the additional N-linked
glycosylation in H-CDR2.
Changing the pI is known as a valid approach for increas￾ing protein solubility (Tan et al., 1998). At a pH near the pI
of a protein, the net charge on the protein is close to zero
and the attractive electrostatic forces due to the dipole
moment of the protein dominate protein – protein interactions.
This often leads to non-specific aggregation of the molecules
and results in low solubility. Away from the pI, the mol￾ecules are positively or negatively charged and the resulting
repulsive forces promote higher solubility. Engineering the
pI to improve protein solubility has been successfully carried
out for an scFv, in which the pI was lowered from 7.5 to a
predicted 6.1 by an addition of five glutamate residues at the
C-terminus (Tan et al., 1998). This resulted in a 150-fold

able to achieve in Mab II was small (0.4 pH units) in com￾parison, hampered by the desire to maintain human germline
sequences to avoid immunogenicity. One can expect that
additional changes in pI without sequence constraints may
result in more significant improvement in solubility.
Hydrophobicity is well known to be involved in protein
aggregation. Unfolded or partially unfolded proteins tend to
form aggregates due to exposure of the hydrophobic interiors
to the aqueous solvent (Patra and Udgaonkar, 2007;
Ashbaugh and Hatch, 2008). Protein surface hydrophobic
patches are a source of aggregation at high protein concen￾trations (Mosavi and Peng, 2003). Reducing surface hydro￾phobicity by substitution with hydrophilic residues proved to
be an effective strategy for improving solubility in several
cases (Dale et al., 2003; Mosavi and Peng, 2003; Derewenda,
2004). For example, replacement of surface-exposed hydro￾phobic residues with arginine in ankyrin repeat proteins and
in the subtilisin family of proteases significantly improved
their solubility at physiological pH (Shirai et al., 1997;
Mosavi and Peng, 2003).
The hydrophobicity of a protein can be measured in differ￾ent ways. HIC is a technique used to purify and characterize
proteins (To and Lenhoff, 2007a, b). Compared with reverse￾phase chromatography, which uses highly hydrophobic sur￾faces and harsh eluents, HIC employs less hydrophobic
surfaces and milder protein –matrix interactions. Thus, pro￾teins purified by HIC are more likely to retain their native
conformations and biological activities (Lienqueo et al.,
2006; To and Lenhoff, 2007a). In this work, we used HIC
retention time to provide a relative ranking of the overall
surface hydrophobicity. We found that a reduction in overall
hydrophobicity, measured by the HIC retention time,
sometimes yielded more soluble molecules but was not a
reliable predictor for solubility.
We succeeded in engineering a highly soluble and potent
antibody by adding a consensus N-glycosylation site into the
H-CDR2 loop, paving the way toward high-concentration
formulations. Hyperglycosylation (Sinclair and Elliott, 2005),
similar to pegylation (Veronese and Mero, 2008), has been
shown to improve properties such as molecular stability,
solubility, increased in vivo biological activity and reduced
immunogenicity for therapeutic proteins. Antibodies are
natural glycoproteins with N-linked carbohydrates attached
to N297 in the Fc region. Many antibodies also have variable
region-associated oligosaccharides. In Kabat’s database,
18% of the variable region sequences contain a potential
N-linked glycosylation site in HCs. Approximately 15– 25%
of the Fab fragments and 15% of the LCs isolated from
human myeloma proteins were found to contain N-linked
oligosaccharides (Spiegelberg et al., 1970). Erbitux, a
human/mouse chimeric therapeutic antibody derived using
hybridoma technology, has an occupied N-linked glycosyla￾tion site within framework 3 of the HC variable region (Qian
et al., 2007). Variable region glycosylation is known to play
an important role in affinity, specificity, half-life, and immu￾nogenicity of several antibodies (Wright et al., 1991; Coloma
et al., 1999; Rudd et al., 1999). In many cases, carbohydrates
in the variable regions are found to modulate affinity
(Wallick et al., 1988; Wright et al., 1991; Co et al., 1993;
Khurana et al., 1997; Leibiger et al., 1999). In a previous
report, the presence of an N-linked carbohydrate placed in
the same position as in Mab VII increased the affinity for
dextran by 10– 50-fold (Wright et al., 1991). CNTO607 was
derived from the HuCAL Gold Fab phage display library, in
which the consensus N-glycosylation sites were present in
the V-regions (Rothe et al., 2008). In the latest HuCAL
Platinum library, these N-glycosylation motifs have been
largely eliminated (http://www.morphosys.com) to avoid
potential negative glycosylation effect on affinity and hetero￾geneity when antibodies are produced in mammalian cell
cultures. Glyco-engineering in antibody CDR sequences
remains an uncommon practice due to the high risk of
impeding antigen binding. To our knowledge, this is the first
report that intentionally adding an N-linked carbohydrate in a
CDR resulted in a highly soluble antibody without any sig￾nificant effect on affinity.
In our case, the introduction of the single carbohydrate
moiety in the H-CDR2 loop served to inhibit self￾interactions. On the basis of the crystal structure, a bulky
carbohydrate moiety attached to this site was predicted to
protrude outward with minimal perturbation to the structure.
Owing to the single-point attachment, the carbohydrate
moiety apparently has sufficient flexibility not to interfere
with the interaction with the antigen. Our work demonstrated
that variable region hyperglycosylation can be a viable
approach to improve antibody solubility. Although this
approach has received little attention in the past, we believe
that it may have wider applicability in antibody engineering
than previously thought, especially when antigen interaction
and aggregation ‘hot spot’ overlap. In a typical antibody –
antigen binding system, it was shown that less than half of
the potentially antigen contacting CDR residues are used
in the binding interactions (MacCallum et al., 1996). Some
of the remaining CDR residues are, in principle, available for
Fig. 6. DSC thermogram represented as a plot of Cp (heat capacity at

binding. It is conceivable that this may be more feasible with
small antigens. With detailed structural knowledge for the
antibody–antigen complex, attachment sites can be rationally
selected. In the absence of such structural information, a
number of sites could be tested according to modeled struc￾tures of the antibody. The additional heterogeneity intro￾duced by the variable region glycosylation may be limited
by utilizing glycol-engineered cell lines (Li et al., 2006).
Although protein aggregation is usually considered to
involve non-specific interactions, the interaction for
CNTO607 involves a specific aromatic triad in H-CDR3. Our
limited success in increasing solubility with the pI and LC
hydrophobic mutants is likely due to the retention of the
hydrophobic ‘hot spot’ in these molecules. The aggregation
mechanism may be rationalized in light of the crystal
packing of the Fab fragment in the absence of IL-13
(Teplyakov et al., 2009). In the crystal structure, the Fab of
CNTO607 forms a nearly symmetrical tetramer (Teplyakov
et al., 2009), protecting the aromatic triad from surface
exposure and non-specific aggregation. Such interactions in a
full length antibody could extend to neighboring antibodies
due to the bivalency and lead to precipitation at high concen￾trations. Further studies are on-going to test the hypothesis.
