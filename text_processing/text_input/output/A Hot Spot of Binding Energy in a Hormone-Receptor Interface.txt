observation that the mitogenic potency of
RET varies in different target cells (14).
These data establish that mutations in
MEN2A and MEN2B convert RET into a
dominant transforming gene. They also
show the underlying mechanism to be a
dominant oncogenic conversion rather
than a loss of suppressor function. This
finding is based on the observations that
MEN2A and MEN2B mutations concomi￾tantly activate the intrinsic kinase and
transforming ability of RET and that mu￾tant RET is enzymatically activated in the
presence of a coexpressed normal allele as
was shown in TT cells. Thus, the oncogenic
conversion of RET illustrates that a domi￾nant transforming gene can have a causal
role in human hereditary neoplasia. In ad￾dition, our identification of the molecular
mechanisms of RET activation provides the
basis for therapeutic strategies in MEN2A,
MEN2B, and FMTC.

5. We assembled the open reading frame (ORF) of
proto-RET by starting from clones derived from an
SK-N-BE complementary DNA (cDNA) library (corre￾sponding to the extracellular portion of RET) and a
fragment of a described EGFR-RET construct (14),
corresponding to the intracellular portion of RET. We
completely sequenced the resulting cDNA, which
encodes the short isoform of the RET protein (3), on
both strands and found it to match exactly the pub￾lished sequence of wild-type RET (3). The proto-RET
ORF was then cloned in the LTR-2 plasmid (18) to
yield the LTR-ret eukaryotic expression vector. Using
the RT-PCR, we cloned cDNA fragments with the
desired mutations from RNA obtained from neoplas￾tic tissues of individuals with MEN2A and MEN2B.
Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that no oth￾er mutations were present in the cDNA fragments.
For the MEN2A expression vectors, Nde l-Eco RI
fragments [corresponding to positions 1717 to 2348
of the proto-RET sequence (3)] from the mutated
cDNAs were individually substituted for the analo￾gous fragment in LTR-ret. For the MEN2B expres￾sion vector, a Bgl Il-Bcl fragment (positions 2765 to
2972 of proto-RE7) was substituted for the analo￾gous fragment in LTR-ret. A second cycle of se￾quence analysis confirmed the introduction of the
expected mutations. Because all of the mutations
were introduced directly into the LTR-ret vector, all
constructs were identical except for the specified
mutations, thus allowing comparison of their trans￾forming abilities.

A Hot Spot of Binding Energy in a
Hormone-Receptor Interface
Tim Clackson* and James A. Welist
The x-ray crystal structure of the complex between human growth hormone (hGH) and
the extracellular domain of its first bound receptor (hGHbp) shows that about 30 side
chains from each protein make contact. Individual replacement of contact residues in the
hGHbp with alanine showed that a central hydrophobic region, dominated by two tryp￾tophan residues, accounts for more than three-quarters of the binding free energy. This
"functional epitope" is surrounded by less important contact residues that are generally
hydrophilic and partially hydrated, so that the interface resembles a cross section through
a globular protein. The functionally important residues on the hGHbp directly contact
those on hGH. Thus, only a small and complementary set of contact residues maintains
binding affinity, a property that may be general to protein-protein interfaces.
Specific protein-protein interactions are
critical events in most biological processes.
A number of crystallographic studies have
shown that the binding interfaces between
proteins are generally large (600 to 1300 A2)
and include many intermolecular contacts,
involving 10 to 30 side chains from each
protein (1-3). However, structural analysis
alone cannot show whether all of these con￾tacts are important for tight binding. A com￾plete understanding of the chemistry of pro￾tein-protein association also requires a func￾tional map of each binding surface, to reveal
to what extent each contact contributes to
the overall free energy of binding.
The initial event in signaling through the
hGH receptor is the binding of the extracel￾lular domain (hGHbp) to site 1 of hGH to
form a high-affinity 1:1 complex (dissocia￾tion constant, Kd, of 0.3 nM, corresponding
to a binding free energy, AG, of -12.3 kcal/
mol) (4, 5). The crystal structure of this

complex (3, 6) shows that on each protein a
surface area of about 1300 A2 becomes bur￾ied (defined by calculated inaccessibility to
solvent) (7), including 33 side chains on the
receptor (Fig. 1A). We mutated each of
these side chains individually to alanine,
except for G168 and the C108-C122 disul￾fide (8). Substitution by alanine deletes all
interactions made by atoms beyond the P
carbon and should reveal the contribution to
binding energy made by the removed portion
of the side chain (9). Each mutant hGHbp
was expressed in Escherichia col, purified to
>90% homogeneity, and assayed for hGH
binding affinity (10, 1 1 ).
Fewer than half of the mutations caused
substantial loss in binding affinity (Fig. 1B).
By far the greatest reductions in affinity
(>4.5 kcal/mol) occurred on substituting
two tryptophan residues, W104 and W169
(12). Large effects (1.5 to 3.5 kcal/mol) were
also seen for alanine substitutions at other
hydrophobic residues (1103, 1105, P106, and
1165), and generally smaller effects (1 to 2
kcal/mol) were seen for some charged resi￾dues (R43, E44, D126, E127, and D164).
This subset of 11 contact residues, which we
term the functional epitope, maps to a con￾383
M-
 on November 14, 2014 www.sciencemag.org Downloaded from tiguous patch at the center of the contact
region (Fig. 2A) in which the hydrophobic
residues form a core flanked by the charged
groups (Fig. 2B). Several of the hydrophobic
residues (for instance 1103) are in fact large￾ly buried beneath the W104 and W169 side
chains, suggesting that their main functional
contribution is indirect (13). The functional
epitope is surrounded by the residues whose
mutation to alanine has little effect on bind￾ing affinity and in some cases (V171A) even
increases it. This peripheral nonfunctional
region corresponds to 46% of the area buried
upon binding.
A similar strategy has previously been
used to determine the functional profile on
the hormone side of the interface ( 14). Eight
out of 31 side chains in hGH accounted for
approximately 85% of binding energy, and
again, over half of the residues made no
substantial contribution to binding affinity.
Now that both sides of the interface have
been mutated systematically, the two func￾tional epitopes can be compared (Fig. 3A).
This reveals a striking complementarity￾the energetically critical and unimportant
regions on one molecule match those on the
other. Most of the important residues on
hGH are involved in forming a hydrophobic
pocket that closely docks the side chains of
W104 and W169 from the hGHbp (Fig. 3B).
Although the electrostatic interactions are
less important for affinity, direct intermolec￾ular contacts are made between the most
functionally important charged groups (Fig.
3C). Thus, the two proteins interact through
complementary functional epitopes that
pack together to form a tightly packed hy￾drophobic core, surrounded by five intermo￾lecular salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. In
this respect, the energetics of the binding
interface are reminiscent of a cross section
through a folded protein-hydrophobic res￾idues are inside and hydrophilic residues are
outside (15).
We wished to understand better why
some contacts are more important than oth￾ers. Structural parameters such as buried sur￾face area (16) did not correlate well with the
energetic importance of individual residues
at this interface (Fig. 1), nor did the number
of van der Waals contacts made by each side
chain (17, 18), their crystallographic tem￾perature factors ( 19), or solvation parameters
calculated with a semi-empirical method
(20). We presume that for the nonfunctional
residues, the energetic cost of desolvation
and side chain rearrangement offsets, and in
some cases exceeds, the energy gained
through the intermolecular interactions.
The structure of the complex does not allow
issues of solvent and side chain structure in
the free components to be addressed, and
neither protein has been crystallized alone.
Nonetheless, the complexed structure does
show that the intermolecular packing at the
functionally critical regions is frequently bet￾ter than that at the functionally unimpor￾tant ones: in particular, there are cavities

chains suggests that the interactions of these

The alkyl portion of the R43 side chain packs beneath the indole ring of W169 on the hGHbp; thus, R43
may play an indirect structural role by supporting W169, in addition to interacting directly with D1 71 and
T1 75. The observed energetic contributions of each side chain are indicated in parentheses (in units of

gaps between imperfectly packed regions of
the interface and form hydrogen bond inter￾actions that are approximately isoenergetic
with those for the two unbound proteins.
The generality of this correlation must await
the systematic functional analysis of other
structurally well-characterized interfaces.
The binding free energy between hGH
and hGHbp could be generated through
only a few strong interactions, or from the
accumulation of many weaker contacts over
the entire interface. Our data indicate that
the hGH-hGHbp interaction occurs in the
former manner. Functional studies on other
protein-protein complexes also indicate
that a small number of residues can confer
tight binding affinity. For example, muta￾tional analysis of antibodies (18, 25) or
protein antigens (26) has shown that only 3
to 10 side chains can account for most of
the binding energy, although the structures
of complexes between antibodies and pro￾tein antigens (2) show that typically be￾tween 14 and 21 residues are in contact.
These conclusions support theoretical pre￾dictions that only a few interactions may be
important for tight binding (27). For the
hGH-hGHbp interaction, we found that
these are predominantly interactions be￾tween hydrophobic interface regions. Bind￾ing sites in other protein-protein complexes
of known structure often include patches of
high surface hydrophobicity (28); perhaps
these are also sites of energetic importance.
Although the peripheral contact resi￾dues in the hGH-hGHbp complex do not
contribute much to net binding energy,
they probably have other important roles.
Peripheral electrostatic interactions in￾crease the rate of association (14) and may
be critical for the solubility of the hormone
and receptor when uncomplexed. The pe￾ripheries of interfaces can also contribute
substantially to the specificity of binding
(29), by repulsion of nontarget molecules
through unfavorable electrostatic or steric
interactions, or both. They may also be
required for other binding activities. For
example, hGH interacts with the human
prolactin receptor using the same contact
residues as for the hGH receptor (30); but
different, although overlapping, subsets of
residues are functionally critical for binding
(29). Thus, a single set of contact residues
can bind two different targets, using smaller
and alternative functional epitopes.
The structures of many oligomeric pro￾teins (31) and protein-protein complexes
(1-3, 6, 21, 22, 30, 32) show them to have
generally large and flat interfaces, making
the rational design of small molecule mim￾ics of these surfaces a daunting prospect.
However, if proteins generally interact
through much smaller functional epitopes,
as seen here, then the task of designing
small inhibitors might be greatly simplified:
385
ticipate in intermolecular hydrogen-bonding
networks involving both main chain and
side chain atoms (Fig. 4).
Ordered water molecules have been ob￾served in other protein-protein interfaces (1,
21, 22), and in one case the presence of
water in equivalent positions in the bound
and unbound states was demonstrated (21).
Some other complexes of proteins with small
molecules (23) or with DNA (24) appear to

265, 3111 (1990)]. Some mutants had been con￾structed previously (10). Mutants W104A, P106A,
and W1 69A were purified by ion-exchange chroma￾tography and hydrophobic interaction chromatogra￾phy on a BlOcad workstation (Perseptive Biosys￾tems). Binding affinities for hGH were determined by
competitive displacement with 1251-labeled hGH as
the tracer [S. A. Spencer et al., ibid. 263, 7862 (1988)]
except that monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5 [R. Bamard,
P. G. Bundesen, D. B. Rylatt, M. J. Waters, Endocri￾nology 115, 1805 (1984)] was used to precipitate
hGH-hGHbp complexes. This mAb blocks dimeriza￾tion of hGHbp [B. C. Cunningham et al., Science 254,
821 (1991)] so that simple 1 :1 binding affinity can be
accurately determined. Any discrepancies between
the present data and other measurements of affinities
(10) can be ascribed to the previous use of mAb 263,
which does not block dimerization.
12. The affinities of W1 04A and W1 69A were below the
sensitivity of the assay (Kd > 1 p.M), which is fixed by
the availability of mAb 5 for precipitation. We estimat￾ed the affinity of these mutants for hGH to be 1/2500
that of the wild-type hGHbp protein or even lower.
The mutations do not appear to introduce global
structural disruptions into hGHbp, as their reactivi￾ties with a panel of mAbs were unchanged [(10); T.
Clackson and J. A. Wells, unpublished data]; in ad￾dition, the W104A mutant has a native-like circular
dichroism spectrum (10) and can bind to a variant of
hGH engineered to have higher receptor-binding af￾finity [H. B. Lowman and J. A. Wells, J. Mol. Biol.
234, 564 (1993); S. Atwell and J. A. Wells, unpub￾lished data].
13. The sum of the apparent binding free energy con￾tributions of each interface residue (<-27 kcal/
mol) considerably exceeds the known binding free
energy for the complex (- 12.3 kcal/mol). This im￾plies that some of the mutations we engineered are
not having independent effects. This can be ex￾plained by the fact that many of these side chains
make intramolecular contacts [for a discussion, see

Solution Structure of the Epithelial Cadherin
Domain Responsible for Selective Cell Adhesion

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules containing extracellular re￾peats of approximately 1 10 amino acids. The three-dimensional structure of the amino￾terminal repeat of mouse epithelial cadherin was determined by multidimensional het￾eronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The calcium ion was bound by a short a
helix and by loops at one end of the seven-stranded P-barrel structure. An exposed
concave face is in a position to provide homophilic binding specificity and was also
sensitive to calcium ligation. Unexpected structural similarities with the immunoglobulin
fold suggest an evolutionary relation between calcium-dependent and calcium-indepen￾dent cell adhesion molecules.
Selective interactions between cells that
lead to morphogenesis require the action of
cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The cad￾herin and immunoglobulin (Ig) CAM super￾families provide Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-
independent cell adhesion, respectively (1).
Most vertebrate and some invertebrate cells
express at least one cadherin and require
Ca2+ to form solid tissues. Loss of epithelial
cadherin (E-cadherin) expression is correlat￾ed with the invasive potential of tumor cells
(2). The 30 known cadherins typically con￾tain five extracellular repeats (here termed
CAD repeats), a single membrane-spanning
region, and a cytoplasmic region. The NH2-
terminal CAD (CAD1) repeat is essential
for the homophilic binding specificity that
directs "like" cadherins to associate (3). The

cytoplasmic region of E-cadherin (also called
uvomorulin) is anchored to cytoskeletal ac￾tin microfilaments through catenins (4).
Here we present the solution structure of the
CADI domain of E-cadherin spanning ami￾no acids 1 through 104 (referred to hereafter
as E-CAD1), determined in the presence of
Ca2+ from 1793 nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR)-derived structural restraints (5).
The structure of E-CAD1 contains seven
PB strands (PA through P3G) and two short (x
helices (oA and oaB) (Fig. lA). All P strand
pairings are antiparallel except for that be￾tween PA' and 13G, with a P-barrel topology
similar to that of the Ig constant (C) domain
(6). Bulges in 13B and P3G contribute to the
curling of the P3 sheet into a barrel shape
(Fig. 1B). A proline-proline junction be￾tween 13A and P3A' bridges the two ends of
the sheet. Despite its helical appearance, the
backbone dihedral angles in the CD loop are
not compatible with a helix. The DE and FG
junctions are 13 hairpin turns. Conservation
of the P-barrel fold of E-CAD1 among other
CAD repeats is evident from the alignment
of structurally critical proline, glycine, and
