ABSTRACT: In an effort to relate structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic features in a model macromolecular
recognition process, the amino acid residues in the reactive surface of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
(BPTI) and surrounding residues were substituted individually by alanine, and the effects of the point￾mutations on the kinetics and thermodynamics of inhibition by BPTI toward trypsin and chymotrypsin
were investigated. Fifteen alanine mutants were produced. The majority of the BPTI mutants exhibited
a binding affinity similar to that of the wild-type protein. The exceptions were the primary specificity
site (P1) mutant and those mutants that seem to have nonlocal perturbations of structure, as revealed by
circular dichroism and thermostability measurements. The mutation at the P1 site caused a reduction in
the binding free energy of 10 and 1.8 kcal mol-1 for trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. The losses
in binding affinity were determined almost exclusively by an increase in the dissociation rate constant.
However, the rate of association of the P1 mutant, Lys-15-Ala, with trypsin was also drastically reduced
(>200-fold). Calorimetric measurements of the heats of binding for the association of chymotrypsin
with the wild-type inhibitor and its alanine mutants allowed determination of the relative contributions of
the changes in enthalpy and entropy to the free energy of binding. Compensatory changes in the two
parameters were observed in several cases, which were attributed to desolvation effects at the binding
interface.
The evaluation of the parameters involved in the energetics
of protein stability and binding to ligands, based upon the
application of fixed rules to the known structures of proteins
and protein/ligand complexes, is approaching saturation.
Future knowledge of the relationship of protein structure to
function and dynamics is more likely to come from correla￾tions of structural information with experimental parameters.
The number of macromolecular complex structures deter￾mined at high-resolution is increasing rapidly, including
antibody/antigen, hormone/receptor, protease/inhibitor, and
protein/nucleic acid complexes. However, the number of
studies relating the structural features of these complexes
with experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data is still
relatively scarce (Ayala et al., 1995; Go´mez & Freire, 1995;
Ladbury et al., 1994; Murphy et al., 1993, 1995; Bhat et al.,
1994; Ysern et al., 1994). These types of studies are an
important contribution to the understanding of the molecular
mechanisms involved in protein recognition and may provide
valuable information for the rational design of molecules
targeted at protein receptors. Serine proteases and their
natural inhibitors are attractive systems for such studies,
given the availability of high-resolution structural informa￾tion. The serine protease inhibitor bovine pancreatic trypsin
inhibitor (BPTI)1 is among the best characterized proteins;
its structural and physicochemical properties and mechanism
of inhibition having been extensively documented. BPTI
has also been shown to fold correctly in Escherichia coli
into a functional molecule, indistinguishable from natural
material (Marks et al., 1986). High-resolution crystal
structures are available for BPTI (Deisenhofer & Steigemann,
1975; Wlodawer et al., 1984, 1987) and serine protease/BPTI
complexes [for a review, see Bode and Huber (1991)].
Protease/BPTI systems are therefore particularly suitable to
investigate the atomic details of the interactions determining
the energetics of association processes. In the present study,
using trypsin/BPTI and chymotrypsin/BPTI as model sys￾tems, we have investigated the effect of single alanine
mutations (Cunningham & Wells, 1989) in the reactive
surface of BPTI on the kinetics and thermodynamics of
binding to â-trypsin and R-chymotrypsin.

+ +BPTI is a basic 58 amino acid peptide with a molecular
mass of 6.5 kDa (Kassell et al., 1963). It contains three
disulfide bridges that contribute to a very compact tertiary
structure and an extremely high stability against denaturing
agents and proteolytic degradation (Kassell, 1970). The
peptide has a broad inhibitory specificity, reacting tightly
with several serine proteases [for a review, see Fritz and
Wunderer (1983)], trypsin/BPTI being the most stable
complex. The higher affinity toward trypsin is conferred
by a lysine residue at the primary specificity site (P1).
Common structural features shared with other serine protease/
peptide inhibitor complexes are formation of a short anti￾parallel â-sheet between the enzyme and the N-terminal
portion of the binding region of the inhibitor, hydrogen
bonding between the carbonyl oxygen at the P1 residue and
the amide groups of the reactive serine and a glycyl residue
at the oxyanion binding site, and tight complementary of
the binding surfaces, with water molecules excluded from
the interface (Hubbard et al., 1991). Inhibition by BPTI is
competitive and reversible (Engel et al., 1974; Finkenstadt
et al., 1974; Quast et al., 1978a). The interaction between
inhibitor and protease is characterized by a slow association
rate, with formation of a loose complex, followed by a rate￾limiting step that results in a more stable complex. For
practical purposes, the cleavage of the reactive-site bond Lys￾15-Ala-16 is negligible and the inhibition reaction is
adequately expressed by the overall equation:
Figure 1 shows the tertiary structure of BPTI. Alanine
substitutions were made at the residues that directly contact
or come in close proximity to the protease in the BPTI/trypsin
complex (Ru¨hlmann et al., 1973; Huber et al., 1974), except
for the two cysteine residues that cross-link the binding loops
(Cys-14 and Cys-38). The mutated residues were: Thr-11,
Gly-12, Pro-13, Lys-15, Arg-17, Ile-18, Ile-19, Arg-20, Phe￾33, Val-34, Tyr-35, Gly-36, Gly-37, Arg-39, and Lys-46.
Positions 16 and 40 are occupied by alanines in the native
inhibitor. The wild-type (wt) and the 15 alanine BPTI
mutants were produced in a bacterial expression system. The
binding affinities of the different peptides toward trypsin and
chymotrypsin were determined by measuring the inhibition
constants, Ki. The relative contributions of the rate constants
of association, kon, and dissociation, koff, to the binding
affinity were also determined. Heats of binding were
determined for the chymotrypsin/BPTI system, allowing the
estimation of the enthalpy and entropies of binding. Circular
dichroism (CD) spectra of all the proteins were obtained, as
well as thermostability measurements, for a more complete
interpretation of the kinetic and thermodynamic data. The
results are discussed in terms of the general principles
governing protein/protein recognition and the atomic-resolu￾tion structures of BPTI and the trypsin/BPTI and chymo￾trypsin/BPTI complexes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. Bovine pancreatic â-trypsin and R-chymo￾trypsin were purchased from Sigma. Both enzymes were
purified further by FPLC through gel filtration, using a 16/
60 Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology),
to eliminate autolysis products. The eluent was 1 mM HCl
containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 3.0. Desalting was done on
a FPLC fast-desalting column in 1 mM HCl, pH 3.0. The
lyophilized material was dissolved in 1 mM HCl, 20 mM
CaCl2 at a concentration of around 0.1 mM and stored at
-20 °C. The protease substrates used were N-R-benzoyl￾L-arginine p-nitroanilide (BAPA; Boehringer Mannheim) for
trypsin and N-succinyl-Gly-Gly-Phe p-nitroanilide (SGG￾PPA; Sigma) for chymotrypsin. The active-site titrant
p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate (NPGB) was from Sigma.
All the chemicals were analytical or HPLC grade. FPLC
columns used in the purification of BPTI were from
Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology.
Production of BPTI. Mutagenesis and expression were
carried out using pEZZ vectors (Nilsson et al., 1991). BPTI
was expressed as a secreted fusion protein that included a
pair of synthetic IgG binding domains of staphylococcal
protein A (ZZ). A short linker of five amino acids separated
the two moieties, allowing specific cleavage of the fusion
protein. Vectors carrying the different BPTI mutant genes
were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis as described
(Zoller & Smith, 1987) using a pEZZ single-stranded
template containing a linker region that permitted site-specific
cleavage of the expressed fusion protein by hydroxylamine.
However, to avoid any possibility of chemical modification
of BPTI during the hydroxylamine treatment and to preserve
the natural N-terminus, the wt BPTI and alanine mutants
were subsequently recloned in another pEZZ vector that had
been engineered for efficient chymotrypsin cleavage of the
fusion protein. A competing chymotrypsin cleavage site was
eliminated in the linker region (Altman et al., 1991), by
mutating a methionine to a serine, in order to facilitate
purification. Cloning and DNA sequencing were done
according to standard procedures.
The wt and the different Ala mutants of BPTI were
expressed in E. coli grown in rich medium containing 250
mg/L ampicillin and supplemented with 1 g/L glucose and
100 mg/L thiamin. The fusion protein was recovered from
the periplasmic space by osmotic shock as described (Nilsson
et al., 1991). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at
6000g for 20 min at 4 °C. After incubation with 0.5 mg/L
of DNase I for 15 min at 4 °C, the periplasmic fraction was

Affi-Gel 10, Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with 0.1 M tri￾ethanolamine containing 0.3 M NaCl and 20 mM CaCl2, pH
7.8. This purification step allowed the simultaneous cleavage
of the fusion protein and recovery of the BPTI moiety. After
the column was washed with 10 bed volumes of equilibration
buffer, 50 µg of free chymotrypsin was added per 5 mL of
gel, and the column was incubated with gentle rocking for
48 h at 4 °C. BPTI was eluted with 1 mM HCl containing
0.5 M KCl, pH 2.1 The eluate was diafiltered using a 3000
MW cutoff ultrafiltration membrane from Amicon. A
contaminant of BPTI containing a 12 amino acid N-terminal
extension (0-10% of the total protein) was removed by
cation exchange FPLC using a Mono S column. The
peptides were eluted with a 0-1 M NaCl gradient in 50 mM
sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, or pH 6.0 for the mutants
that had one less positively-charged residue. In some cases,
a gel filtration step was performed with the fraction contain￾ing the correct-size BPTI to eliminate residual amounts of
the contaminating peptide, using a 16/60 Superdex 75 FPLC
column, in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.15
M NaCl, pH 7.0. Although the difference in molecular
weight between both BPTI molecules is only 1500, base￾line resolution was possible. The fraction containing the
main peak was desalted on an FPLC fast-desalting column
in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Due to the nonspecific
binding of BPTI to dextran-based chromatographic media
and consequent increased retention times, the salt concentra￾tion was monitored with an ion monitor. Completely salt￾free BPTI was lyophilized and stored in water at concen￾trations higher than 2 mg/mL. For the wt BPTI, the final
yield was around 1.5 mg of pure peptide per fermentation
liter, which corresponds to ∼70% recovery. The final yields
for the alanine mutants varied between 12% and 120% of
the wt. The lowest yields were caused by degradation during
expression, which seemed to be related to thermostability.
The purity of the peptides was established by reverse phase
HPLC, denaturing and nondenaturing PAGE, amino acid
composition determination, and N-terminal sequencing.
Homogeneity was >98%, in all the cases.
Determination of ActiVe Protease and Inhibitor Concen￾trations. The concentrations of functional trypsin and
chymotrypsin were determined with the burst titrant NPGB,
according to Chase and Shaw (1967). In the case of
chymotrypsin, since the titrant turnover is comparatively
high, the determination obtained with NPGB was verified
by titration with a known amount of wt BPTI. The two
determinations differed by 5%, and the average value was
taken. Protease stock solutions were not reused after
thawing. The concentration of BPTI was obtained by
titration with trypsin. A previously NPGB-titrated trypsin
solution was incubated with half of the molar amount of
inhibitor, estimated by UV absorption, under conditions that
permitted stoichiometric binding (1 µM trypsin). The
remaining trypsin activity allowed the accurate determination
of the concentration of active inhibitor. Three measurements
were taken per BPTI solution, and the differences between
them were found to be smaller than 3%. The concentration
of the Ala-15 BPTI mutant was determined by amino acid
analysis, due to the lower binding affinities for trypsin and
chymotrypsin. Determination of inhibitor concentration by
amino acid analysis was found to be comparable to the
concentration determined by titration with trypsin, for the
wt and the rest of the mutants.
General Kinetic Methods. The kinetic parameters of
inhibition, Ki and kon, were determined using spectrophoto￾metric assays, by monitoring the release of p-nitroanilide at
405 nm, resulting from the hydrolysis of the chromogenic
substrate by the protease. Protease activity was correlated
to protease concentration. A Kontron spectrophotometer was
used, equipped with an automatic cell changer. The cuvette
holder was connected to a thermostat-controlled water bath.
Reference samples were not included since spontaneous
hydrolysis of the synthetic substrates did not occur, even in
the longest times required to measure enzymatic hydrolysis.
Because of the very low concentration of protein present in
most of the assays, only quartz cuvettes were used, which
have been found to minimize the loss of protein by adsorption
(Empie & Laskowski, 1982). Routinely, working stock
solutions of protease and inhibitor were prepared, prior to
performing the assays, in polypropylene vials treated with
glycerol: 1 µM trypsin or chymotrypsin in 1 mM HCl/20
mM CaCl2 and 1 µM BPTI in 0.005% Triton X-100. (At a
concentration of 0.1 µM, BPTI absorption to polypropylene
vials, even if glycerol-treated and in the presence of 0.005%
Triton X-100, was found to be nonnegligible.) Stock
solutions of 34 mM BAPA and 6 mM SGGPPA in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) were prepared. The general assay condi￾tions were 50 mM Tris-HCl containing 20 mM CaCl2 and
0.005% Triton X-100, pH 8.2, 22 °C. The final assay
volume was 1 mL. Reactions were started with the addition
of 20 µL of substrate solution. The concentration of
chromogenic substrate in the assay was below the Km to
avoid displacement of the inhibitor from the enzyme/inhibitor
complex upon addition of the substrate. In the trypsin assays,
the final concentration of BAPA was 0.67 mM (Km ) 0.91
mM) and in the chymotrypin assays, the final concentration
of SGGPPA was 0.125 mM (Km ) 1.48 mM).
Equilibrium Dissociation Constant, Ki. The equilibrium
dissociation constant, Ki, was determined by an adaptation
of the method described by Green and Work (1953).
Enzyme and inhibitor were incubated at different concentra￾tions of inhibition. The incubation time was 10 half-lives
of the association reaction (t1/2 ) 1/konIo), according to the
rate constant of association, kon, that had been determined
previously. The residual protease activity allows the con￾struction of inhibition curves. For trypsin, the concentration
of protease was 5 nM, and the BPTI concentration was varied
between 0 and 10 nM, except in the case of Ala-15, where
the inhibitor concentration ranged from 0 to 6 µM. For
chymotrypsin, the concentrations of protease and inhibitor
were 0.1 µM and 0-1 µM, respectively. The data sets were
fitted to the theoretical equation that defines the amount of
free enzyme (E) as a function of the initial concentration of
inhibitor (Io), derived from eq 1, where Eo is the initial
concentration of enzyme:
A nonlinear regression analysis program was used (Leath￾erbarrow, 1987). This program was used in all the nonlinear
regression analyses for the determination of kinetic constants.
The standard error of the calculated variables was always
less than 10%.

+ +Association Rate Constant, kon. The association rate
constant, kon, was determined by measuring the extent of
protease inhibition after incubating equimolar amounts of
enzyme and inhibitor (except for trypsin/K15A BPTI) for
different times. The initial concentrations of protease and
inhibitor were 5 nM in the trypsin assays, and 10 nM in the
chymotrypsin assays. In the case of trypsin/K15A, the initial
concentration of inhibitor was 0.6 µM. Nonlinear regression
analysis was used to fit the data to a general equation that
describes the variation of free enzyme with time, at any given
ratio of Eo/Io, according to a second-order model:
The fittings were done with either Eo or Io as a variable in
order to find the kon value with the lowest standard error.
Apart from fitting data obtained with nonequimolar amounts
of enzyme and inhibitor, the nonlinear fitting allowed the
use of data points obtained through the entire time-course
of the reaction, which is not possible with typical linear
fittings.
Dissociation Rate Constant, koff. The published value for
the koff of the dissociation between wt BPTI and trypsin
(Vincent & Lazdunski, 1972) was confirmed by following
the time-course of exchange between isotopically 15N-labeled
trypsin-bound BPTI (Castro et al., submitted for publication)
with unlabeled inhibitor, present at a 10-fold excess con￾centration with respect to the 15N-labeled BPTI in the trypsin
complex. Trypsin and 15N-labeled BPTI were 0.4 mM.
Samples were collected at appropriate time intervals over a
period of 6 months, and the BPTI/trypsin complex was
recovered by FPLC gel-filtration on a Superdex 75 column
(Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology). Laser-desorption mass
spectrometry analysis allowed the determination of the
relative amounts of 15N-labeled and unlabeled BPTI.
Heats of Binding. The heats of binding of the association
of chymotrypsin with wt BPTI and alanine mutants were
measured in a stopped-flow microcalorimeter (Mudd &
Berger, 1988). Protein solutions were filtered and thoroughly
degassed prior to use. The chymotrypsin (0.5 mM) and BPTI
solutions (0.1 mM) were mixed with a 1:1 ratio, giving a
reaction volume of 160 µL (80 µL + 80 µL). The variation
in temperature in the mixing chamber was followed for 320
s, at a sampling rate of 2 per second. The heats measured
(average of a minimum of 15 injections) upon mixing of
the 2 solutions were corrected for the heats resulting from
protease dilution, inhibitor dilution, and reaction medium
mixture. The heat of buffer ionization arising from the
release of protons upon BPTI binding to chymotrypsin was
estimated to be negligible, based upon the comparison of
the ∆H of binding obtained for the chymotrypsin/wt BPTI
association with values of ∆H published previously for the
same system using kinetic assays. The calorimetric ∆H for
the chymotrypsin/wt BPTI system determined here is in good
agreement with two measurements of ∆H for this system,
obtained under similar pH conditions via kinetic assays
(Vincent & Lazdunski, 1973; Quast et al., 1974). These
authors determined the binding enthalpy from the difference
between the energies of activation of the association and
dissociation reactions (using Arrhenius plots for kon and koff),
or from the temperature dependence of Ki. Possible cleavage
of the inhibitor by chymotrypsin, or autolysis of chymo￾trypsin, was ruled out by inspection of the thermograms.
Protein cleavage would result in incomplete relaxation of
the heat signals to base line, and this was not observed. At
the concentrations of protein used, the binding is stoichio￾metric, even in the case of chymotrypsin/K15A, for which
the Ki is higher. Therefore, the binding enthalpy, ∆H, is
equal to the symmetric of the total heat of binding divided
by the number of active BPTI molecules present in the
reaction chamber. The major source of error in the deter￾mination of the binding enthalpy is associated with the error
in the determination of the BPTI concentration, which was
estimated to be no greater than 5%. The measurements were
carried out at 22 °C in the same reaction medium used for
the determination of the kinetic constants. Chemical calibra￾tion with a 1:1 dilution of 10 mM NaCl was performed
according to Mudd and Berger (1988).
Thermal Stability and Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectra.
Thermal denaturation was monitored by circular dichroism
(CD) using an AVIV 60DS spectropolarimeter. Ellipticity
was recorded at 222 nm using a 1 mm path length cuvette
(Helma) and thermoelectric control of temperature. Thermal
denaturation profiles were obtained over the temperature
interval 40-97 °C in 1 °C increments with a 1 min
equilibration time at each temperature. The BPTI concentra￾tion was 0.2 mg/mL in 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.0, adjusted
with HCl. A two-state transition model was assumed. The
melting temperature (Tm) and enthalpy change at the Tm
(∆Hm) were determined by fitting the data to the theoretical
unfolding curves, using a nonlinear least-squares procedure.
CD spectra were collected prior to each thermally-induced
denaturation. Three spectra were collected per peptide,
between 250 and 195 nm, in 1 nm steps and 2 s of averaging
time, at 22 °C. An average spectrum of the solvent was
subtracted for each peptide spectrum. Fractional helicity was
calculated according to Chen et al. (1972).
RESULTS
Binding Parameters. Equilibrium binding constants were
measured for the association of wt BPTI and its alanine
variants with trypsin and chymotrypsin (Table 1). A lower
limit of validity for the determination of the inhibition
constants was set at Eo/Ki e 100, owing to poor definition
of inhibition curves for higher values of the ratio Eo/Ki. The
departure from linearity at the equivalence point (Eo ) Io)
determines the accuracy of the determination of Ki. Under
the experimental conditions used for the trypsin/BPTI system,
such a limit corresponds to a Ki of 5 × 10-11 M. Most of
the equilibrium dissociation constants measured were lower
than this limit. Examples of inhibition curves are given in
Figure 2. The published value of Ki for the association of
trypsin with wt BPTI (Vincent & Lazdunski, 1972) was
confirmed through the measurement of kon and koff, as
described under Materials and Methods. The extremely slow
dissociation rate constant of the trypsin/BPTI complex (half￾life ∼8 months), under the conditions used, precluded the
direct measurement of koff by spectrophotometric methods.
The Ki determinations for the binding of wt BPTI to trypsin
and chymotrypsin reported in Table 1 are in good agreement
with previously reported Ki values obtained under similar
conditions of pH and temperature (Vincent & Lazdunski,
1972, 1973; Quast et al., 1974). In the case of the
chymotrypsin system, Ki was also determined through the

determinations of Ki proved to be consistent.
Figure 3 shows the difference in ∆G [∆G ) -RT ln (1/
Ki)] relative to the wt for each of the BPTI mutants in the
association with trypsin and chymotrypsin. In general, the
mutations had a small effect on the free energy of binding,
with variations in ∆G (∆∆G) of less than 1.5 kcal mol-1
for the chymotrypsin/BPTI system. A decrease in ∆G of
more than 4.0 kcal mol-1 is observed for the association of
four alanine mutants with trypsin, namely, Gly-12-Ala, Lys￾15-Ala, Ile-18-Ala, and Gly-36-Ala. It is possible that other
alanine mutants bind to trypsin with a significantly lower
affinity, since Ki values below 5 × 10-11 M were not
measurable, corresponding to a minimal detectable ∆∆G
value of 4 kcal mol-1
. The drop in ∆G for the association
of Lys-15-Ala with trypsin was extremely pronounced (∆∆G
∼ 10 kcal mol-1
). Similar results have been reported in the
literature for P1 mutants of BPTI obtained by semisynthetic
engineering (Tschesche et al., 1987). The decrease in
binding affinity observed with the Ile-18-Ala mutant for both
the trypsin and the chymotrypsin systems could be related
to the strong propensity of this peptide to aggregate in
solution, as seen by light scattering, gel-filtration chroma￾tography, and nondenaturing PAGE.
The rate constants of association of BPTI and its alanine
mutants with trypsin and chymotrypsin were determined, thus
allowing the evaluation of the relative contributions of kon
and koff to the binding affinity (Ki ) koff/kon). Typical curves
for the time-course of the association of inhibitor and protease
are shown in Figure 4. A second-order association mech￾anism was assumed. Table 1 lists the values of kon, computed
from the time-course of association, and of koff, derived from
the relationship between Ki and kon. The values of kon
reported for the wt inhibitor are in good agreement with
published values obtained with the same systems under
comparable conditions (Vincent & Lazdunski, 1972, 1973;
Quast et al., 1974).
None of the BPTI alanine mutations had a marked effect
on the association rate of the inhibitor with trypsin or
chymotrypsin, with the exception of the association of the
Lys-15-Ala mutant with trypsin. Although the substitution
of the charged side chain at the P1 site by a small
hydrophobic side chain would be expected to cause a
decrease in the association rate constant, a reduction over 2
orders of magnitude imposed by a single side chain substitu￾tion is comparatively high. This result suggests that the side
chain of Lys-15 is important in orienting the inhibitor relative
to the binding pocket of trypsin. Electrostatic interactions
are likely to be involved in the initial stages of recognition,
between the positively charged side chain of the lysine at
P1 and the negatively charged aspartic acid side chain at
the bottom of the specificity pocket of trypsin (Na´ray-Szabo´,
1993). For the chymotrypsin/BPTI system, only two side
chain substitutions, Lys-15-Ala and Gly-12-Ala, resulted in
an appreciable (>2-fold) decrease in kon. One mutant, Arg￾39-Ala, associated with chymotrypsin at a rate around 3 times
faster than that measured for the wt inhibitor.
The relative contributions of kon and koff to the change in
binding affinity caused by each alanine mutation in both the
trypsin and the chymotrypsin systems are expressed in the
histograms shown in Figure 5. In all the cases, for both
systems, the major determinant of the decrease in binding
affinity is the increase in dissociation rate constant. The
magnitude of the increase in koff is at least twice as much as
the magnitude of the decrease in kon. The only exception is
the case of chymotrypsin/G12A (Figure 5B), for which the
change in kon is larger that that of koff. These results mimic
the range of variation of kon versus koff observed in natural
protein/ligand systems.
Thermodynamic Parameters (Chymotrypsin System). The
enthalpic and entropic contributions to the energy of binding
were determined for the association of chymotrypsin with
wt BPTI and its alanine mutants. The heats of reaction for
the association of protease and inhibitor were measured in a
microcalorimeter, and the binding entropy was derived from
the relationship between ∆G and ∆H (∆G ) ∆H - T∆S).
The enthalpies of binding were not measured for the trypsin
system, since for most of the alanine mutants it was not
possible to calculate the ∆G of binding, and consequently
the values of ∆S would not be known through the measure￾ment of ∆H. The thermodynamic parameters ∆G, ∆H, and
-T∆S for the binding of wt BPTI and its alanine mutants to
chymotrypsin are given in Table 2. The cases of BPTI
mutants Ile-18-Ala and Phe-33-Ala were not investigated.

the association with chymotrypsin was 2.5 kcal mole-1, a
result that reproduces the values reported by Vincent and
Lazdunski (1973) and Quast et al. (1974) of 3.0 and 2.4 kcal
mol-1
, respectively. As seen in Table 2, the majority of the
mutations did not have a significant effect on the enthalpy
or entropy of binding to chymotrypsin. A graphical repre￾sentation of the proportions of binding ∆∆G contributed by
∆∆H and -T∆∆S is shown in Figure 6. For three of the
mutants, namely, Gly-12-Ala, Val-34-Ala, and Tyr-35-Ala,
a favorable decrease in binding enthalpy seems to be offset
by a decrease in binding entropy of similar magnitude. In
the first two cases, the change in the free energy of binding
is very close to that observed for the wt BPTI. Inversions
of relative contributions of ∆H and ∆S to the free energy of
binding seem to occur in opposite directions for other
mutants, although such trends may not be significant, due
to the small quantities of energy involved. The association
of chymotrypsin with Lys-15-Ala and Gly-36-Ala BPTI
occurs with an unfavorable change in both the enthalpy and
the entropy of binding as compared to the chymotrypsin/wt
BPTI case.

in structure or in thermostability, should be considered
apparent. The calculated changes in helical content found
for some of the mutants may be overestimated if the
chromophores of the side chains of tyrosines and pheny￾alanines have contributed to the observed perturbations in
the far-UV spectra (Manning & Woody, 1989). The thermo￾stability measurements should be considered approximate
since the unfolding of the protein may not be completely
reversible (Makhatadze et al., 1993). Partial refolding may
lead to lower Tm values as well as sharper transitions. It is
clear from the analysis of Table 3 that there is a strong
correlation between the parameters considered. The observed
perturbations of structure and/or decrease in thermal stability
also correlate well with the degree of proteolytic degradation
during expression (results not shown).
Ile-18-Ala is the only mutant that aggregates strongly, and
this may explain the pronounced perturbations in the far￾UV spectrum. Interestingly, position 18, whose side chain
is only partially exposed to the solvent, is preferably occupied
by large hydrophobic side chains in proteins homologous to
BPTI (Creighton & Charles, 1987). Five mutants, Phe-33-
Ala, Gly-12-Ala, Tyr-35-Ala, Gly-36-Ala, and Gly-37-Ala,
are considerably less stable than the wt peptide, with parallel
loss in helical content. This can be explained by perturbation
of the packing of the molecule for Phe-33-Ala and Tyr-35-
Ala, which have buried side chains, and by distortions of
the main chain conformation for the Gly-12-Ala, Gly-36-
Ala, and Gly-37-Ala variants. The mutants Lys-15-Ala, Arg￾17-Ala, and Ile-19-Ala exhibit slight structural perturbations
and decreases in stability. The remaining mutants do not
exhibit significant differences with respect to wt BPTI for
any of the parameters shown in Table 3, with the exception
of Arg-39-Ala, which has a larger loss in helical content.
Although surface single side chain substitutions rarely have
significant destabilizing effects in proteins, a decrease in
stability upon mutating surface residues has been observed

the protein are disrupted (Akke & Forse´n, 1990; Hammen
et al., 1995), or when interior hydrophobic groups become
more exposed to the solvent (Hurley et al., 1995). Minor
rearrangements of a side chain can also cause subtle changes
in the main chain structure (Smith et al., 1986). These
destabilizing effects introduced by side chain substitutions
are more likely to occur when glycine is the residue replaced,
due to steric hindrance restrictions caused by the presence
of a Câ-atom. Indeed, the three glycines replaced by alanine
in the binding epitope of BPTI (positions 12, 36, and 37) all
have φ and ψ angles (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975;
Wlodawer et al., 1984, 1987) that in general are sterically
not allowed for side chains with a Câ-atom (Ramachandran
& Sasisekharan, 1968), and all are highly conserved among
protein sequences homologous to BPTI (Creighton &
Charles, 1987).
DISCUSSION
Binding Affinity. Overall, the effect of alanine single
mutations in the reactive region of BPTI on the binding
affinity of the inhibitor toward trypsin and chymotryosin was
relatively modest (Figure 3). In the case of trypsin, the
analysis was limited by the small number of mutants for
which the absolute value of the inhibition constant was
obtained (a reduction in binding energy of less than 4 kcal
mol-1 was undetectable by the methods used). This lack of
effect is explained in part by the reduced contact between
inhibitor and protease at the periphery of the binding epitope
and by the fact that most intermolecular hydrogen bonds are
mediated by main chain atoms.
According to empirical estimates, a decrease in binding
energy of 4 kcal mol-1 corresponds to the loss of the
contribution of up to five methyl groups to the energy of
binding (Andrews et al., 1984), or to the disruption of two
uncharged hydrogen bonds or one charged hydrogen bond
(Fersht et al., 1985; Shirley et al., 1992; Byrne et al., 1995).
Analysis of the X-ray structures of free BPTI (PDB entry
5PTI) and of the complexes formed with trypsin (PDB entry
2PTC) and chymotrypsin (coordinates supplied by T. Hynes
and A. A. Kossiakoff) reveals that the reduction of surface
area upon complex formation of BPTI side chain atoms
beyond the Câ-atom is around 100 Å2 for Lys-15, Arg-17
(trypsin and chymotrypsin complexes), and Arg-39 (trypsin
complex), and significantly less than that for all the other
side chains in both complexes. Each of these three side
chains mediates two intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the
case of the trypsin/BPTI complex (excluding the salt bridge
between the charged amino group of Lys-15 and Asp-189
of trypsin). In the chymotrypsin/BPTI complex, the amino
group of Lys-15 forms two intermolecular hydrogen bonds,
and the guanidino groups of Arg-17 and Arg-39 form one
hydrogen bond each. The recent elucidation of the structure
of the chymotrypsin/BPTI complex by X-ray diffraction
studies (T. Hynes, and A. A. Kossiakoff, unpublished results)
has revealed that the Lys-15 side chain does not pack fully
into the hydrophobic specificity pocket of chymotrypsin, but
rather makes a sharp turn with the charged amino group,
reaching the surface of the contact region where it makes
two hydrogen bonds (Kossiakoff et al., 1993).
Partial exposure to the solvent of groups involved in
intermolecular hydrogen bonding is also likely to minimize
energy perturbations resulting from alanine substitutions, if
water molecules substitute for the donor groups removed.
The guanidino groups of Arg-17 and Arg-39 of BPTI are
partially exposed to the solvent in both the trypsin and
chymotrypsin complexes, as well as the amino group of Lys￾15 of BPTI in the chymotrypsin complex. The very limited
impact of the alanine substitutions at positions Lys-15, Arg￾17, and Arg-39 on the binding affinity of BPTI toward
chymotrypsin is striking, and could reflect local favorable
rearrangements in the structures of the protein molecules and
solvent.
Predictions of individual residue contributions to the free
energy of stabilization of the trypsin/BPTI complex using
an empirical energy function indicated that none of the
binding epitope residues of BPTI contributed more than 4.0
kcal mol-1 to the binding energy, with the exception of Lys￾15, which had an estimated contribution of 11.6 kcal mol-1
(Krystek et al., 1993). The mutation at the P1 site of BPTI
caused a pronounced drop in the energy of binding to trypsin
(∼10 kcal mol-1
) . In this complex, even if water molecules
in the protease binding pocket can act as hydrogen bond
partners, the charged group of Asp-189 will not be neutral￾ized, which by itself can cause a pronounced decrease in
the free energy of association, of up to 6-10 kcal mol-1
(Andrews et al., 1984; Fersht, 1985). Molecular electrostatic
potential (MEP) maps of the trypsin specificity pocket and
Lys-15 side chain reveal an almost perfect electrostatic
complementarity (Na´ray-Szabo´, 1993). In addition, the loss
of three methylene groups in the P1 side chain with the Lys￾15-Ala mutation means an appreciable loss in hydrophobic
energy (0.8-1.5 kcal mol-1 per methylene group removed)
(Andrews et al., 1984; Kellis et al., 1989).
It is unlikely that the reduction in the binding free energy
of the BPTI mutant Ile-18-Ala with trypsin and chymo￾trypsin, of nearly 5 and 0.5 kcal mol-1
, respectively, is
attributable exclusively to reduction in the aliphatic binding
surface, since part of the side chain of Ile-18 is already
partially buried in free BPTI. The aggregation of the peptide
molecule probably contributes to the observed loss in binding
affinity.
Distortions in the main chain are likely to be the cause of
the reduction in binding affinity observed for the glycine to
alanine variants of BPTI, and for the Tyr-35-Ala mutant
(Figure 3), based on the structural and thermostability
properties of these mutants (Table 3). A Tyr-35-Gly mutant
of BPTI (Housset et al., 1991) has shown significant main
chain perturbations, especially in the binding loops. These
effects are probably magnified in the case of the trypsin
system (Gly-12-Ala and Gly-36-Ala mutants) given the
optimal positioning of the side chain of Lys-15 of the wt
protein with respect to the negatively charged side chain of
Asp-189 in the binding pocket of trypsin. A difference in
distance between two charges of 0.1 Å can translate into a
difference in interaction energy of 1.3 kcal mol-1 (Weber,
1992). Steric hindrance caused by the addition of one methyl
group could also contribute to the decrease in binding affinity
observed here for the glycine to alanine mutants. A binding
cavity that is configured for a hydrogen atom, when occupied
by a methyl group, can impose an energy penalty of >7.5
kcal mol-1 (Fersht, 1985).
The results obtained in the present work are in agreement
with the general findings of alanine-scanning mutagenesis
studies, where only a few side chains dominate a functional
11442 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 35, 1996 Castro and Anderson
+ +
+ +epitope in the contribution to the energy of association, and
these side chains tend to be charged or have aromatic groups
(Cunningham & Wells, 1989; Jin et al., 1992; Nuss et al.,
1993; Dembowski & Kantrowitz, 1994; Clackson & Wells,
1995; Jendeberg et al., in press). The dominance of these
side chains in protein binding epitopes confirms their role
in conferring specificity to binding processes, as happens in
protein folding processes (Barlow & Thorton, 1983). On
the other hand, disruption of intermolecular hydrogen bonds
and/or an appreciable reduction in intermolecular van der
Waals contacts (Arg-17-Ala and Arg-39-Ala mutations) did
not produce substantial effects in the ∆G, at least in the case
of the interaction with chymotrypsin, for which the binding
affinities of all the mutants were quantified (Figure 3). The
data obtained for the Ile-18-Ala mutant are inconclusive
because of the aggregation of this peptide in solution.
Contribution of kon and koff to the Binding Affinity. In
naturally occurring protein/ligand complexes, the affinity of
binding is determined primarily by the dissociation rate
constant. Dissociation rate constants for protein/ligand
complexes can vary over a wide range (10-8 s-1 < koff <
106 s-1), the fastest dissociation rate constants being around
103-105-fold lower than the diffusion-controlled rates
(Fersht, 1985), whereas association rates vary over a much
narrower range, to within only a few orders of magnitude
of the diffusion-limited rate (104 M-1 s-1 < kon < 108 M-1
s-1
). In protease/inhibitor systems, the rate-limiting step of
the dissociation reaction is the transition from stable to loose
complex, and the rate constant of this initial step can be
considered equal to the overall dissociation rate constant,
koff (Engel et al., 1974; Finkenstadt et al., 1974; Quast et al.,
1978a,b). In this work, the decrease in the dissociation rate
constants was the predominant cause for the reduction in
affinity of the alanine BPTI mutants toward trypsin and
chymotrypsin (Figure 5). Therefore, the results obtained are
in accordance with the natural variation of rate constants for
protein/ligand systems and previous findings in other mu￾tagenesis studies (Jin & Wells, 1995; Jendeberg et al., in
press). It is the stability of the protein/ligand complex that
determines most of the binding affinity and not its rate of
formation.
The alanine substitutions had very little effect on the rate
of formation of the trypsin/PBTI and chymotrypsin/BPTI
complexes, with only one notable exception: the association
of trypsin with the P1 mutant (Table 1 and Figure 5). The
decrease in the association rate constant for the trypsin/K15A
complex was 230-fold, which corresponds to a loss in binding
free energy of around 3 kcal mol-1. This is a pronounced
drop in the rate constant of association, for a single side chain
substitution, and it suggests that changes in electrostatic
interactions are involved. Isolated cases been observed in
mutant studies where kon is drastically reduced (Jendeberg
et al., in press). In ViVo, ligands that associate slowly with
target receptors will probably be selected against, in order
to maintain a rapid response to physiological conditions.
In the two-step reaction that characterizes the association
of protease and inhibitor, the overall association rate constant,
kon, is determined by the equilibrium constant of the initial
reaction (formation of loose complex), and by the rate
constant of the conversion from loose to stable complex.
Obviously, both these constants influence the overall as￾sociation rate constant. It is likely that the decrease in kon
observed for the association of trypsin with the Lys-15-Ala
BPTI mutant is imposed by an increase in the dissociation
binding constant of the loose complex, because of a reduction
in the number of collisions and/or a decrease in the stability
of the loose complex. It seems that the charged amino group
of the side chain of Lys-15 of BPTI is crucial in the initial
recognition steps of the association with trypsin, probably
steering the BPTI molecule into productive orientations
during diffusional encounters with the protease. There are
no effects on the association rate constants with the replace￾ment by alanine of other positively charged side chains of
BPTI (Arg-17, Arg-20, and Arg-39), suggesting that these
additional charges do not contribute to promoting productive
encounters between the inhibitor and trypsin, as seems to
be the case with Lys-15. Determinations of association rate
constants under different ionic strengths (results not shown)
indicated that the presence of formal positive charges in the
vicinity of the P1 site can have a counter-productive effect
in the absence of the Lys-15 side chain, especially in the
association with trypsin. This would occur if any of the
positively-charged side chains in the vicinity of P1 oriented
the BPTI molecule in a less favorable manner with respect
to the protease.
A broad range in variation of kon rate constants for
homologous protein ligands adds to the limitations of
empirical methods to calculate binding free energies, which
do not take into account differences in association rates.
Electrostatic effects are extremely difficult to characterize,
especially if conformational fluctuations of ligand and/or
receptor molecules are taken into account. Interestingly,
complexes that form with similar activation energies can
associate with very different rates (Riggs et al., 1970). This
suggests that adverse electrostatics (reduction of total number
of encounters or of productive encounters between the two
molecules) can be more limiting to the overall rate of
association than conformational and solvation effects. It is
reasonable to say that molecular recognition begins before
actual contact between ligand and receptor occurs.
Thermodynamic Parameters of Binding (Chymotrypsin/
BPTI System). A comparison of the thermodynamic param￾eters for the association of chymotrypsin with wt BPTI and
its alanine mutants shows that changes in entropy tend to be
compensated by changes in enthalpy (Figure 6). This is
particularly noticeable for the mutants Gly-12-Ala, Val-34-
Ala, and Tyr-35-Ala. For the Lys-15-Ala and Gly-36-Ala
variants, there is a small unfavorable change in both entropy
and enthalpy. As observed before for the effect of the alanine
mutations on the kinetic parameters of inhibition, differences
in the thermodynamic parameters occur predominantly for
those mutants that exhibit structural perturbations and for
the P1 mutant. The range in ∆G variation caused by the
alanine mutations (2 kcal mol-1) was significantly less than
the range in variation for ∆H or T∆S (5.2 kcal mol-1 for
both parameters). Therefore, ∆∆H measurements may be
more sensitive than ∆∆G measurements (compare Figures
3 and 6) in mapping binding epitopes by alanine-scanning
mutagenesis.
The compensating changes in enthalpy and entropy, in the
cases of Gly-12-Ala and Tyr-35-Ala, could be related to
desolvation effects. For these mutants, assuming that even
small distortions of the loop structures can create room for
more water molecules at the binding interface, binding
entropy would be lost by a reduction in the number of water
molecules displaced from the interacting surfaces upon

+ +binding, while favorable electrostatic interactions could be
preserved. The Val-34-Ala mutation caused the largest
changes in ∆H and ∆S. This mutant showed identical
structural properties to the wt peptide, and its stability and
kinetics of inhibition were also identical. For the desolvation
argument to hold in this case, it is necessary to postulate
that the interactions of the side chain of Val-34 of BPTI with
chymotrypsin are not optimal, and that the removal of two
methyl groups could create room for water in the chymo￾trypsin/V34A complex. Indeed, inspection of the X-ray
structures of the chymotrypsin/BPTI and trypsin/BPTI
complexes revealed that the Val-34 side chain of BPTI is
close to two aromatic rings of the protease (5.8-8.0 Å) in
the complex with chymotrypsin, a situation that does not
occur in the trypsin/BPTI complex, and the -nitrogen of
the Arg-17 of the inhibitor is pushed 1 Å closer (4.8 Å)
toward the γ-CH3 of Val-34. In future work, we plan to
determine the heat capacities of binding to investigate
possible solvation effects.
Consistent compensatory changes in the enthalpy and
entropy of binding have been observed in other protein
systems, namely, protease/inhibitor (Amiconi et al., 1987),
antigen/antibody (Szewczuk & Mukkur, 1977; Oss et al.,
1982; Herron et al., 1986; Siguskjøld et al., 1991; Siguskjøld
& Bundle, 1992; Brummell et al., 1993; Ito et al., 1993),
and enzyme/substrate associations (Berland et al., 1995).
Such entropy/enthalpy correlations have also been interpreted
as evidence for the involvement of water molecules in the
association process and are observed in a wide variety of
reactions in aqueous solution (Leffler & Grunwald, 1963;
Lumry & Rajender, 1970; Hindsgaul et al., 1985). These
enthalpy/entropy compensation effects may limit efforts to
engineer the specificity of binding in protein/ligand associa￾tions.
A prominent result obtained in this thermodynamic study
is that the binding enthalpies of the association of chymo￾trypsin with the BPTI alanine mutants are always positive,
except in two cases (Table 2), contrary to what is generally
observed in the association of proteins with their ligands.
However, a positive enthalpy of binding for the interaction
of Kunitz inhibitors with their cognate proteases seems to
be the rule rather than the exception, judging by the
thermodynamic parameters reported in the literature for these
protease/inhibitor systems (Laskowski & Laskowski, 1954;
Vincent & Lazdunski, 1972, 1973; Finkenstadt et al., 1974;
Quast et al., 1974; Amiconi et al., 1987; Ascenzi et al., 1988,
1990a,b). Although the information available on the ther￾modynamics of protein/ligand interactions is currently still
scarce, as compared to structural and kinetic information,
and especially for protease/inhibitor associations, these data
suggest that the association of Kunitz-type inhibitors has a
particular thermodynamic profile that contrasts with the
customary negative-change-in-enthalpy and positive-change￾in-entropy observed in protein/ligand association processes.
It is possible that this characteristic of Kunitz inhibitors is
shared by other serine protease inhibitor groups.
Several explanations can be advanced to rationalize this
unusual thermodynamic behavior. It could be hypothesized
that exclusion of water from the contact interface is a
determinant of a highly favorable binding entropy and
unfavorable enthalpy, arising from suboptimal van der Waals
contacts and electrostatic interactions. However, removal
of water from binding interfaces is a general occurrence in
protein/protein associations (Janin & Chothia, 1990). Spe￾cific desolvation effects could be in part related to the balance
between the enthalpy and entropy of binding, given the
variation in the enthalpy and entropy of hydration for
aliphatic, aromatic, and polar groups (Makhatadze & Privalov,
1993; Privalov & Makhatadze, 1993). The percentage of
aromatic and charged residues in the binding interfaces of
protease/inhibitor complexes is significantly less than in
antibody/antigen complexes, which can have more than half
of the contact interfaces composed of these residues (Kabat
et al., 1987; Janin & Chothia, 1990; Padlan, 1990; Krystek
et al., 1993; Nuss et al., 1993). Since polar surfaces have
more unfavorable enthalpies of desolvation than apolar
surfaces (Novotny & Sharp, 1992; Makhatadze & Privalov,
1993), at a first analysis, this factor does not seem to be the
determinant for the particular thermodynamics of the forma￾tion of protease/Kunitz inhibitor complexes. The relative
rigidity of the binding loops of small protein inhibitors, in
particular BPTI, may also contribute to the large gain in
entropy upon binding to the protease. Binding surfaces of
several inhibitors and enzymes were found to be rich in
amino acids with side chains that incur no conformational
entropy penalty on complex formation (Krystek et al., 1993).
The loss of one torsional degree of freedom can result in
the loss of 0.6-0.8 kcal mol-1 of binding energy (Andrews
et al., 1984; Krystek et al., 1993). In BPTI, in addition to
two of these residues being present at the binding epitope
(Pro-13 and Ala-16), three other side chains are totally
immobilized by covalent cross-linking or burial in the
structure (Cys-14, Cys-38, and Tyr-35), and three residues
are glycines (Gly-12, Gly-36, and Gly-37). Ile-18 is also
partially inaccessible to solvent.
Perhaps the positive change in enthalpy and large positive
change in entropy, which seems to characterize the associa￾tion of at least some small inhibitors with their cognate
proteases, are the natural consequence of the selective
pressures under which these inhibitors have evolved: the
rigidity of the binding loops (presence of a particular
conformation) is used to raise the energy of the transition
state of the hydrolysis of the P1-P1′ bond by the protease
(Longstaff et al., 1990). The fact that most of the inter￾molecular hydrogen bonds in protease/Kunitz inhibitor
complexes that are contributed by the inhibitor involve main
chain atoms adds to the requirement for maintaining the
backbone conformation of the inhibitor. Increased mobility
of the binding loops could mean a decrease in internal energy
and more favorable intermolecular contacts, as well as
possibility for cleavage of the P1-P1′ bond. Increased
flexibility of the inhibitor binding loops has been pointed
out as the reason for cleavage of BPTI selectively reduced
at the Cys-14/Cys-38 disulfide bridge (Vincent & Lazdunski,
1972) and of the Cucurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor-V (Cai
et al., 1995).
