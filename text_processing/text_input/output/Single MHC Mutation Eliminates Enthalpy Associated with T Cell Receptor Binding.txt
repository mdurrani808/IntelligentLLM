The keystone of the adaptive immune response is T cell receptor (TCR)
recognition of peptide presented by major histocompatibility complex
(pMHC) molecules. The crystal structure of AHIII TCR bound to MHC,
HLA-A2, showed a large interface with an atypical binding orientation.
MHC mutations in the interface of the proteins were tested for changes in
TCR recognition. From the range of responses observed, three representa￾tive HLA-A2 mutants, T163A, W167A, and K66A, were selected for further
study. Binding constants and co-crystal structures of the AHIII TCR and the
three mutants were determined. K66 in HLA-A2 makes contacts with both
peptide and TCR, and has been identified as a critical residue for
recognition by numerous TCR. The K66A mutation resulted in the lowest
AHIII T cell response and the lowest binding affinity, which suggests that
the T cell response may correlate with affinity. Importantly, the K66A
mutation does not affect the conformation of the peptide. The change in
affinity appears to be due to a loss in hydrogen bonds in the interface as a
result of a conformational change in the TCR complementarity-determining
region 3 (CDR3) loop. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed the loss of
hydrogen bonding by a large loss in enthalpy. Our findings are inconsistent
with the notion that the CDR1 and CDR2 loops of the TCR are responsible
for MHC restriction, while the CDR3 loops interact solely with the peptide.
Instead, we present here an MHC mutation that does not change the
conformation of the peptide, yet results in an altered conformation of a
CDR3.

Introduction
T cells are an integral part of the ability of the
adaptive immune system to recognize virtually any
pathogen that might attack the host. A critical step
required for T cell activation is the recognition of
peptides derived from these pathogens when pre￾sented by the major histocompatibility complex
protein (MHC). Recognition of foreign peptide
bound to MHC is achieved through the clonotypic
T cell receptor (TCR). Upon TCR recognition of a
peptide bound to MHC (pMHC), sets of T cells either
kill the cell presenting the foreign peptide (cytotoxic
T cells) or produce cytokines to “help” B cells and
other T cells (helper T cells). The pathogens are
subsequently eliminated from the host by a combi￾nation of killing infected cells to remove reservoirs
of replicating pathogen, and antibody-mediated
neutralization of the pathogen outside of the cell.
Although TCR binding to pMHC is paramount for T
cell activation, there are still many unanswered
questions regarding how TCR-pMHC interactions
dictate T cell responses.
Recognition of pMHC by the TCR heterodimer is
accomplished using the three complementarity
determining region (CDR) loops from each chain.
The CDR1 and CDR2 loops are germ-line encoded
within the variable gene segment of each TCRα and
TCRβ chain. The CDR3 loop of each chain is unique

recognition of the pMHC is carried out using all the
CDR loops of each chain, generally, the CDR3 makes
more contacts with the bound peptide than CDR1
and CDR2.3
Engagement of TCR with pMHC may result in
a variety of reactions from the T cell, and the mech￾anisms that generate these different responses are
not understood.3 The structures of TCR bound to
partial agonist or antagonist pMHC complexes do
not show changes in the TCR domains that would
suggest a way for the TCR to propagate a qualita￾tively different signal to the T cell through the plasma
membrane.4,5 It is generally accepted that there is
great plasticity in the interaction between TCR and
pMHC. However, as seen in a variety of TCR-pMHC
co-crystal structures, the degree and location of this
plasticity is not uniform. For example, the co-crystal
structures of 2C-dEV8/Kb
,
6 2C-SIYR/Kb
,
4 and KB5-
C20-pKB1/Kb7 when compared to crystal structures
of those TCRs alone show great flexibility in the
CDR3 loops of the TCR. The LC138 and BM3.39 TCRs
undergo changes in their CDR3s and in their CDR1
and CDR2 loops. Conversely, the A6-Tax/A210 and
ELS4-EPLP/B*350111 co-crystal structures exhibit
conformational changes in the peptides upon TCR￾pMHC binding. Finally, the crystal structures of the
1G4 TCR alone and complexed with its pMHC
ligands show no significant change in either the TCR
or the pMHC.12
Similarly, there appear to be no general thermo￾dynamic rules that describe TCR binding to pMHC.
Although surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has been
used for more than a decade to examine binding
of TCR to pMHC, it measures kinetic constants
between TCR and pMHC, and binding via Scatchard
analysis or mathematically using the kinetic con￾stants. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) pro￾vides a direct measure of ΔH and is hence considered
a more reliable determination of thermodynamic
parameters. ITC has rarely been used for TCR￾pMHC studies because of the much larger amounts
of protein required for the studies. Early experiments
suggested that TCR-pMHC interactions seem to be
governed by large enthalpically favorable and
entropically unfavorable thermodynamics.13–16
However, more recent thermodynamic data of L13-
FLR/B8,17 A6-Tax/A2,18 and 2C-QL9/Ld19 all show
entropically favorable associations.
The human MHC, HLA-A2 (A2), is the most fre￾quent MHC found in Caucasians and African Ame￾ricans.20 A large panel of A2 mutants were created
by Baker et al. and tested against a panel of T cells.21
Most interesting from that study, the K66A mutant
was found to adversely affect recognition of 98% of
the T cells examined.21 K66 has been shown to be a
critical residue in TCR recognition of A2, regardless
of the peptide presented,21–24 resulting in K66 to be
labeled a potential “hot spot” for TCR recognition of
A2. Importantly, even though K66 interacts with the
peptide, the structure of Tax/A2(K66A) shows that
the K66A mutation does not alter the structure of A2
or the conformation of the Tax peptide.24 However,
the effect of the K66A mutation on the cognate TCR
has never been determined structurally.
AHIII12.2 (AHIII) is a murine T cell clone that
recognizes human HLA-A2.125 when peptide 1049
(ALWGFFPVL) is presented.26 Reactivity towards
p1049/A2 does not require binding of the TCR
co-receptor CD8,27 which allows for the study of
TCR-pMHC interactions without the additional
complexity of the third protein. We have previously
described the crystal structure of the AHIII TCR
complexed with p1049/A2.28 From the AHIII￾p1049/A2 co-crystal structure, we identified a num￾ber of A2 surface residues that may be responsible
for binding the AHIII TCR. These residues were
mutated in A2 and the changes in T cell cytolytic
activity were examined as a function of the muta￾tion. Three mutants were then selected for kinetic,
thermodynamic, and structural studies. Most
importantly, the K66A mutation causes substantial
changes to cytotoxicity and the affinity. This change
in affinity appears to be due to a large reduction in
hydrogen bonding that is a result of a large
conformational change in the CDR3 loop. This loss
of hydrogen bonding is reflected in the almost
complete loss of enthalpy in the binding reaction.
Results
AHIII T cell reactivity
On the basis of the co-crystal structure of AHIII
bound to p1049/A2,28 13 HLA-A2 mutations were
selected to probe the interface. The ability of AHIII T
cells to lyse target cells expressing this panel of A2
variants was assessed by loading the target cells
with radioactive chromium (51Cr), incubating the T
cells with the target cells for four hours and then
measuring the radioactivity released to the medium.
Measured lysis was normalized to AHIII lysis of
wild-type A2-expressing cells in each experiment. A
spectrum of responses to the mutations was seen
(Figure 1). Some of the mutants showed little effect
on reactivity (E166A and T163A). At the other end of
the spectrum, the K66A mutation abolished the
response almost completely. In addition to the K66
“hot spot” in A2,21–24 it has been suggested that
positions 65, 69, and 155 could be critical to MHC￾restriction due to the high frequency with which
they are seen contacting TCRs in TCR-pMHC
structures.3,29,30 Consistent with those data, muta￾tions at positions 65, 69, and 155 all had deleterious
effects on AHIII cytotoxicity.
Three A2 variants that represent the range of T cell
reactivity were chosen for further study: T163A
(high), W167A (medium), and K66A (low). Mutant
proteins were expressed recombinantly as inclusion
bodies in Escherichia coli and refolded in vitro with
peptide p1049. Binding to the recombinant AHIII
TCR was measured using SPR. Binding curves for
these three complexes in addition to wild-type A2
are shown in Figure 2. The mutations in the MHC
cause significant changes to the affinity for AHIII

(p1049/A2(T163A)) to 31.8 μM (p1049/A2(K66A)).
The kinetics was also dramatically affected. The
dissociation rates (koff) were both faster and slower
than wild-type p1049/A2 (0.27 s−1
). Interestingly,
even though the affinity of AHIII for p1049/A2
(K66A) is significantly lower than for wild-type A2,
the dissociation rate is significantly slower (Figure 2
and Table 1). Association rates (kon) were generally
less affected by the substitutions, except for p1049/
A2(K66A) (4.7 × 103 M−1
s

), which has a much
slower on-rate compared to that of wild-type A2

Structural analysis of A2 variants
The physical manifestation of the differences
found in T cell recognition and binding was ex￾amined using X-ray crystallography. The three
mutants described above (A2(K66A) A2(T163A)
and A2(W167A)) were co-crystallized with AHIII
TCR. The locations of the mutations in the interface
between the AHIII TCR and p1049/A2 are shown in
Figure 3. On the basis of previous work, it seemed
unlikely that these relatively small alterations
would cause large changes in the overall structures
of the TCR or pMHC, or the docking orientation
of the TCR.5 Therefore, we hypothesized that the
substitutions resulted in local alterations in the

MHC Mutation Results in CDR3α Loop Rearrangement 317MHC or peptide, changing hydrogen bonds or
van der Waals contacts present in our previously
determined AHIII-p1049/A2 structure.28 Crystal￾lographic data were collected from three single co￾crystals comprised of AHIII TCR complexed with
p1049/A2(T163A), p1049/A2(W167A), or p1049/
A2(K66A), to a resolution of 2.4 Å, 2.5 Å, and
2.88 Å, respectively. All the crystals were nearly
isomorphous with AHIII-p1049/A2.28 Data collec￾tion and refinement statistics can be found in Table 2.
As might be expected because of the similar level
of T cell activity, no gross structural change was
observed in the structure of p1049/A2(T163A)
bound to AHIII TCR (Figure 4(a)). For all three
structures, superimposition was performed using the
“align” feature in PyMol†, restraining the alignment
to the α-carbon atoms of the TCR-pMHC interface
(TCR Vα, Vβ; and MHC α1, α2 and peptide). The
AHIII-p1049/A2(T163A) complex superimposed
onto AHIII-p1049/A2 with an RMSD of 0.20 Å2
.
Difference electron density (Fo–Fc) maps show a large
negative electron density peak in the position of the
mutated residue, which demonstrates the quality of
the data and confirms the location of the mutation
(Figure 4(a)). One change in the TCR was observed.
The side-chain of serine 99 in the TCR CDR3α has
rotated into the cavity where the MHC threonine
side-chain is found in the wild-type structure.
Interestingly, the electron density maps show the
location of the serine without ambiguity, but there is
no contact visible for the serine side-chain. This side￾chain orientation is not the most preferred rotamer;31
the preferred conformation is found in the wild-type
structure. Therefore, it may be that this position
reduces undesired energetic contributions to the
binding, such as the fixation of solvent or the
production of a cavity in the interface.
In addition to its importance to this study
concerning T cell reactivity, the A2(W167A) complex
was interesting also because W167 forms a bound￾ary of the peptide-binding cleft (Figure 3) and helps
form the conserved pocket that binds the amino
terminus of the peptide.32 This tryptophan is highly
conserved in HLA-A2 subtypes (96%), and across all
human class I MHC molecules (88.5%).33 Mutating
tryptophan to alanine results in the loss of a
hydrogen bond between the Trp indole nitrogen
atom to the Tyr28 hydroxyl group on the TCR CDR2
(Figure 4(b)). Aside from the loss of the W167-Y28
hydrogen bond, the structure of AHIII bound to
p1049/A2(W167A) shows no significant change in
the peptide amino terminus, the CDR2α or CDR3α
of the AHIII TCR, or the MHC itself. The mutant
complex alpha carbon atoms have an RMSD of
0.27 Å2 when superimposed onto the wild-type
atoms. The difference electron density (Fo–Fc) map
once again shows a large negative peak in the
position of the mutated residue demonstrating the

318 MHC Mutation Results in CDR3α Loop Rearrangementside-chain. Two side-chains in A2 near the site of
mutation do change conformation, but these differ￾ences do not alter binding to the TCR. The amino
terminus of the peptide is still coordinated by
hydrogen bonds to three tyrosine hydroxyl groups
Tyr7, Tyr 159, and Tyr171 of the MHC, as in wild￾type p1049/A2. The AHIII-p1049/A2(W167A) struc￾ture shows weak positive difference density in the
location where the nitrogen atom of the indole ring
of wild-type Trp167 would be (data not shown). This
suggests that there may be a weakly associated water
molecule replacing the amine, which could hydrogen
bond to the hydroxyl group on Tyr28 of CDR2α.
The structure of AHIII bound to p1049/A2(K66A)
is critical to this study because of the significantly
different binding constants of p1049/A2(K66A)
(Table 1). Additionally, K66 on the α1 α helix of
HLA-A2 has been identified as a “hot spot” for TCR
recognition of HLA-A2 in a number of studies.21–24
Structures of A6-Tax/A2,10,34 and AHIII-p1049/
A228 also show that K66 is rare, in that it makes
critical contacts with both the TCR and the peptide.
K66A mutants have increased peptide dissociation
rates; yet this is not likely to be responsible for the
decrease in T cell function because T cell clones have
been identified that do not have altered recognition
to the K66A mutation.21,22 Furthermore, the K66A
mutation does not alter the MHC structure or the
conformation of the Tax peptide in Tax/A2(K66A).24
So, if increased peptide dissociation from A2(K66A)
mutants does not influence T cell activation, and the
pMHC molecular surface is not altered by the
mutation, the next logical hypothesis would be
that the K66A variation results in a change in the
TCR that negatively affects T cell function.
The co-crystal structure of AHIII-p1049/A2
(K66A) determined to 2.88 Å resolution shows an
altered conformation of the CDR3α of the AHIII
TCR (Figure 4(c)). The AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A)
structure superimposes onto AHIII bound to wild￾type A2 with an RMSD of 0.37 Å2
. The 2Fo–Fc
electron density map shows the new conformation
of the loop (Figure 4(d)) and this location is
confirmed by omit maps. The conformational
change in CDR3α is that the loop appears to fill
the void left by the removal of the Lys66 side-chain.
The Cα atoms of the loop move, on average, 2.0 Å
with Ala97 moving over 4.0 Å (Table 3). This
altered conformation of the loop likely disrupts
the hydrogen bonding contacts found in the
native structure between the CDR3α and wild-type
p1049/A2 (Figure 4(e)).28 In a manner similar to
the Tax/A2(K66A) structure,24 the K66A mutation
does not change MHC or peptide conformation in
this AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A) structure. The CDR3
loop change negatively affects the surface comple￾mentarity (SC). The SC value for the wild-type
AHIII-p1049/A2 structure is 0.71 and drops to 0.55
for AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A).
The Tax/A2(K66A) structure showed a water
molecule replacing the Lys66 side-chain, mediating
hydrogen bonds between Glu63 of A2 and the Tax
peptide.24 There is no electron density that would
suggest a water molecule replaces the Lys66 side￾chain in our AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A) structure. It
appears that the new conformation of the CDR3α
loop pushes further into the peptide-binding cleft
along the MHC α1 α helix, where the Lys66 side￾chain would have been, displacing any water
that might have filled the void before TCR binding.

MHC Mutation Results in CDR3α Loop Rearrangement 319Figure 4 (legend on next page)
320 MHC Mutation Results in CDR3α Loop Rearrangement2.88 Å resolution data cannot support the modeling
of water molecules in the structure of AHIII-p1049/
A2(K66A). However, there is a small peak in the
2Fo – Fc electron density map that suggests that there
may be a weakly associated water molecule that
would hydrogen bond with Glu63 of A2 and Ser100
on CDR3α of AHIII (Figure 4(f)). The only other
plausible hydrogen bond between the AHIII CDR3α
to p1049/A2(K66A) is from the Ser102 nitrogen
atom to the Gly4 oxygen atom of the peptide (2.88 Å)
(Figure 4(f)). In summary, there is a large alteration
in the AHIII CDR3α loop when bound to p1049/A2
(K66A) as compared to the wild-type complex, and
this alteration appears to dramatically change the
number of hydrogen bonds in the complex.
Calorimetric measurement of AHIII TCR and
HLA-A2 binding
The altered hydrogen bonding pattern proposed
here on the basis of the crystal structure of AHIII￾p1049/A2(K66A) suggests that there should be a
large change in the enthalpy of binding. To examine
this directly, the heat of binding was measured using
ITC. Our data show that the wild-type complex
binding has a relatively small enthalpic component
(−3.9 kcal/mol) and that the binding is more
entropically driven (Table 4 and Figure 5(a)). As
predicted, this small enthalpic contribution to
binding is almost completely eliminated by muta￾tion of K66 to alanine. This change is manifest
clearly during the experiments because the K66A
mutation changes the reaction from exothermic to
endothermic (Figure 5(b)). The enthalpy of binding
(ΔH) goes from −3.9 kcal/mol for AHIII-p1049/A2
to almost zero (−0.6 kcal/mol) for AHIII-p1049/A2
(K66A). The free energy of binding (ΔG) measured
for the two complexes is in agreement with those
determined for other TCR-pMHC (Table 4). The ther￾modynamic changes for AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A)
correspond to a ΔΔG of only 1.4 kcal/mol, which
highlights the tight range between activating and
non-activating signals for TCR.
Discussion
The initial goal of this study was to determine how
structural alterations in the TCR are responsible for
the spectrum of T cell cytolysis by AHIII T cells.
Mutations in HLA-A2 were made and changes in
cytolysis examined as a function of the mutation.
Recombinant protein for three A2 variants was
produced, and binding constants were determined
by SPR. Surprisingly, A2(K66A) showed very dif￾ferent kinetic constants as compared to the wild￾type complex. Structural studies showed that most
hydrogen bonds involving the CDR3α loop in the
complex were lost upon mutation. ITC confirmed a
greatly decreased enthalpy of binding associated
with the conformational change of the loop.
On the basis of the AHIII-p1049/A2 co-crystal
structure,28 A2 residues that were predicted to be
involved in binding the AHIIII TCR were mutated.
The AHIII T cells reacted with a full spectrum
of outcomes from very low cytotoxicity to slightly
improved cytotoxicity as a result of changing
residues in the interface between the proteins.
Residues at positions 6621–24 and 65, 69 and
1553,29,30 have all been identified as critical contacts
in a number of TCR-pMHC systems. Mutations at
all four of these positions in A2 resulted in a
reduction of AHIII T cell cytotoxicity of 30% to
almost 100%. Clearly, these residues are critical for
AHIII TCR binding. As an important control, it
has been shown that peptide binding does not
change significantly for the mutations studied except
K66A (it has a faster peptide off-rate).22 However,
this faster peptide off-rate cannot account for the
Figure 4. Mutation of Lys66 to alanine results in a large change in the CDR3α loop. (a) The complex of AHIII TCR
bound to p1049/A2(T163A) superimposed on the wild-type structure of AHIII-A2. Mutant A2 (cyan) and peptide (blue)
show little difference from wild-type A2 (yellow) or peptide (orange). The conformations of TCR CDR2 and CDR3 loops
and side-chains are not different between the mutant (magenta) and wild-type (green) structures (the coloring scheme is
the same throughout the Figure). (b) The complex of AHIII TCR bound to p1049/A2(W167A) also shows no change in
TCR structure and only minor alterations in local MHC side-chains. (c) Superimposition with of AHIII TCR bound to
p1049/A2(K66A) onto wild-type shows a major rearrangement of the AHIII CDR3α loop, while the structure of pMHC is
unchanged. (a)–(c) Mutations at T163A, W167A, and K66A are confirmed by difference electron density (Fo–Fc) contoured
at −3σ surrounding the side-chains. (d) The 2Fo–Fc density map (blue), contoured at 1 σ, confirms placement of the final
modeled CDR3α loop at 2.88 Å. (e) Five hydrogen bond interactions occur between AHIII TCR CDR3α and wild-type
p1049/A2. As shown above, some or all of these bonds may be broken due to loop movement. (f) The 2Fo–Fc electron
density suggests the presence of a water molecule in the AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A) structure, which would allow for a
water-mediated hydrogen bond between Glu63 of A2 and Ser100 on CDR3α of AHIII (water is shown for illustration, but
is not included in PDB). The only other possible hydrogen bond to CDR3α is from the Ser102 nitrogen atom to the Gly4
oxygen atom of the peptide. The Figure was generated using PyMol [http://pymol.sourceforge.net/].

MHC Mutation Results in CDR3α Loop Rearrangement 321changes in activity because T cells can be found that
are not affected by the K66A mutation.21,22 This
implies that significant peptide bound to MHC
remains on the cell surface even with the K66A
mutation. In addition, the levels of expression of the
various mutants studied here were confirmed to be
similar by flow cytometry (data not shown). There￾fore, any observed changes in reactivity, binding, or
structure should be due to changes in how the
complexes interact. A more thorough study of how
those mutations resulted in a change of function was
then initiated.
A sub-set of the MHC mutants that represent
dramatically reduced to full reactivity (K66A,
W167A, and T163A, respectively) were chosen to
study the physical manifestation of the differences.
TCR-pMHC binding studies were performed using
SPR. While all mutants showed some degree of
change from wild-type A2, the K66A mutation
resulted in remarkably slower on and off-rates than
the wild-type complex. The three mutant complexes
were then co-crystallized with AHIII TCR. The
structures were determined and compared to the
wild-type co-crystal structure. Similar to the results
seen for the altered peptide ligands for the Tax/A2
specific TCR,5 there was no gross differences in any
of the structures examined. Significantly, there was
no change in domain packing of the TCR that would
suggest a mode to transmit information through the
domains to the interior of the cell to confer different
activities, as previously suggested.14 There is always
the possibility that the domain movements are
dynamic and/or weakly manifested, and are over￾come here by crystal packing forces that would make
it impossible to view using protein crystallography.
Similarly, it has been suggested that upon TCR–
pMHC interaction, a conformational change in the
AB loop of the TCR Cα domain is required for
signaling into the cell.8 Although the position of the
AB loop for the non-liganded AHIII TCR is
unknown, the loop in the AHIII TCR bound to all
p1049/A2, even p1049/A2(K66A), is identical, and
is the same conformation as that seen in the liganded
LC13 TCR.8 Importantly, the AB loop in the AHIII
structures are not involved in any crystal contact.
These data imply that the AB loop has no impact on
the level of cytotoxicity seen in the AHIII system.
There is no definitive structural explanation for
the “improved” AHIII T cell reactivity for the A2
(T163A) mutant. With threonine being conserved in
98% of all known HLA-A2 subtypes,33 we had
expected a greater impact mutating it to alanine. If
anything, the rotation of the TCR CDR3α Ser99 into
the cavity formed by the removal of the MHC
threonine side-chain would be expected to contri￾bute negatively to the binding due to the less
favorable rotamer that is chosen. There is no
hydrogen bonding partner near the new position
of the serine hydroxyl group. There is no significant
increase in the complementarity in the fit between
the complexes. The complementarity of fit of AHIII
to p1049/A2(T163A) is 0.72 versus 0.71 for the wild￾type structure. We conclude that the most likely
explanation for the slightly increased binding
affinity is that there is a set of very subtle changes
that increase the complementarity of fit.
The A2(W167A) mutation results in a 20% loss in
lysis by the AHIII T cells. There is no significant
structural change other than the loss of the W167-
Y28 hydrogen bond. Loss of the W167 indole group
also affects surface complementarity between
AHIII-p1049/A2(W167A) (SC= 0.68) compared to
AHIII-p1049/A2 (SC= 0.71). Therefore, the dramatic
loss of affinity to the AHIII TCR is likely a result of
the lost hydrogen bond and the concomitant loss of
complementarity (i.e. van der Waals contacts). The
fact that the absence of the indole group from the
end of the peptide-binding cleft in the AHIII-p1049/
A2(W167A) structure did not significantly alter the
conformation of the bound peptide is surprising.
Tryptophan is present at position 167 in 96% of all
known HLA-A2 subtypes and 88.5% conserved in
all human class I MHC molecules.33 It begs the
question, why is this amino acid so highly con￾served? Unfortunately, the data provided in the
AHIII-p1049/A2(W167A) structure are unable to
address this.
Of all the mutants tested, the K66A mutation
caused the largest decrease in AHIII cytolysis. The
slow on-rate seen for AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A) and
significant energy barriers measured for other TCR￾pMHC35,36 imply that there are structural changes
associated with binding and, in fact, a large change
was seen in the CDR3α loop of the AHIII TCR. This

322 MHC Mutation Results in CDR3α Loop Rearrangementsuggests that binding requires a conformational
change in the TCR, but when exactly does this
occur? Does the AHIII TCR make initial contact with
p1049/A2(K66A) and then the CDR3α loop moves
(induced fit) or does p1049/A2(K66A) associate
with a minority member of the population of the
AHIII TCRs in solution (pre-existing equilibrium).
The induced-fit or two-step model has been a
popular means of describing TCR-pMHC in￾teraction.37 However, the validity of the two-step
model has been questioned by both thermo￾dynamic35 and structural8,9,12 data. We propose
that a pre-existing equilibrium model better
describes TCR–pMHC association. The idea that
CDR loops exist in alternative pre-existing confor￾mations in solution has been shown in antibody
crystal structures.38 Knowing the structural simila￾rities between antibodies and TCR, it is easy to
imagine this binding mechanism to exist for TCR
and pMHC. The total number of possible conforma￾tions that the CDR loops can adopt is finite and
limited by the conserved framework regions of the
TCR and/or antibody structure.39–42 The residues
that constitute the loop will maintain φ and ψ angles
that allow for the lowest potential energy. Loops in
higher potential energy conformations would be
found less often in the population (minority
member). Therefore, the pMHC surface that allows
the TCR to have the greatest number of its CDR
loops in conformations with the lowest energy
would provide the most stable interaction, a higher
affinity, and subsequent greater activation of the T
cell. The structural and thermodynamic data pre￾sented here for AHIII TCR-p1049/A2(K66A)
demonstrate this relationship between energetics
and activation. When the CDR3α loop is required to
take a conformation with higher energy, the inter￾actions between TCR and pMHC suffer, and T cell
activation is adversely affected. As the structure of
AHIII TCR alone is not available, we cannot be sure
where the CDR3α loop lies when it is free in
solution. However, the on-rate of AHIII-p1049/A2
(K66A) being an order of magnitude slower than
wild-type AHII-p1049/A2 binding, suggests the
loop to undergo greater change in order to bind
p1049/A2(K66A) than wild-type p1049/A2. We
propose the TCR conformations seen in our AHIII￾p1049/A2(K66A) complex are minor in the popula￾tion, so the longer kon is a reflection of the un￾Figure 5. K66A mutation in p1049/A2 decreases the
enthalpy of binding dramatically. The binding enthalpy of
AHIII TCR was measured directly with ITC for both wild￾type p1049/A2, and p1049/A2(K66A). (a) A power versus
molar ratio plot for titration of 234 μM p1049/A2 into

heat versus molar ratio after baseline correction (lower

measured for the last ten injections. (b) A plot of power

(K66A) into buffer alone. All experiments were done at
25 °C. The fitted curves are from the model for single-site
binding provided in Microcal Origin Software. The
thermodynamic parameters determined are given in
Table 4.
MHC Mutation Results in CDR3α Loop Rearrangement 323favorable equilibrium of the pMHC binding that
minority member.
The AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A) structure also sug￾gested most of the hydrogen bonds found between
AHIII CDR3α and wild-type p1049/A2 are not
present in the mutant structure. The conformational
change in CDR3α potentially leaves only the Ser102
to Gly4 hydrogen bond. This suggested that the
enthalpy of binding is greatly diminished. The ITC
data complement the structural data, as they show
there is a significant loss in binding enthalpy. Due to
the small amount of heat absorbed upon AHIII￾p1049/A2(K66A) binding, the titration curve gener￾ated does not allow for confident analysis of the
entropy in the system. However, the endothermic
binding combined with the loss of enthalpy suggests
that the binding of AHIII TCR to p1049/A2(K66A) is
nearly entirely entropically driven. For TCR-pMHC
complexes where heats of binding have been mea￾sured directly (and inferred from van't Hoff calcula￾tions), the enthalpic and entropic contributions are
different for each TCR–pMHC system without any
unifying thermodynamic properties. Originally it
was thought that TCR–pMHC interactions were
governed by enthalpically favorable and entropi￾cally unfavorable thermodynamics features;13–15
however, AHIII-p1049/A2 joins LC13-FLR/B8,17
A6-Tax/A2,18 and 2C-QL9/Ld19 as TCR–pMHC
systems that rely on entropically favorable binding.
One of the difficulties associated with studying
diverse receptor systems such as TCR recognition of
pMHC is that it is difficult to extract general rules
about the system. However, in the context of what
has been done with other TCR–pMHC, there are
some general features that we can present from these
data. Previous structural studies have highlighted
TCR recognition of altered peptide ligands,5,12 dif￾ferent peptides presented by the same MHC,4,6,9,43
or the effects of mutation in the TCR to binding,44
but not the structural effects of MHC mutation on
TCR–pMHC binding. The effects of mutations in
the MHC through biological readout, co-crystal
structures, and thermodynamics suggest a correla￾tion between T cell response and affinity. As many
as 32 hydrogen bonds determine specificity in
BM3.3-pBM1/Kb
,
43 but only 21 in AHIII-p1049/
A228 and approximately 15 in the AHIII-p1049/A2
(K66A) complex. The recently determined structure
of 2C-QL9/Ld19 reveals an interface with less than
ten hydrogen bonds and entropically favorable
binding. What does this say about specificity?
If there are no hydrogen bonds determining
specificity, the only way the TCR can be sure to
recognize only the foreign complex must be
complementarity of fit. Not surprisingly perhaps,
AHIII-p1049/A228 and 2C-QL9/Ld19 have the
greatest complementarity of fit of all TCR-pMHC
structures determined to date. In addition to other
published results, our data suggest that the
thermodynamics for each TCR–pMHC interaction
is unique. The large range of thermodynamic
constants reveals that there are many ways to
induce T cell activation. This all suggests that the
pathways to activation are not important, just the
end point.
Most importantly, the AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A)
structure provides evidence that a variation in the
MHC and not the peptide can directly affect a CDR3
loop. The idea of CDR1 and CDR2 recognition of
MHC followed by CDR3 binding to peptide works
for a select few TCR, but not for most. In the case of
K66, Lys is not conserved across all MHC (93% of
HLA-A2 subtypes, but only 42.5% conserved in
HLA-A overall, and only 1.5% of HLA-B mole￾cules33). Therefore, the presence of this charge is not
required, but can be thought of as another piece of
the antigen surface. TCR recognition of the pMHC
surface cannot be divorced into separate binding
events of peptide and MHC.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The HLA-A2 mutants transfected into Hmy2.C1R cells
have been described.23 All cell lines showed cell surface
expression of HLA-A2 at levels similar to that of wild-type
HLA-A2 as detected by the HLA-A2-specific Ab BB7.2.47
Protein production and purification
Soluble AHIII12.2 TCR was produced as described.28
Briefly, the ectodomains of AHIII TCR α and β chains
were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli. Purified
inclusion bodies, previously dissolved in 8M urea, were
injected rapidly into a folding buffer optimized for the
AHIII TCR at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. After
incubation for 36 h at 10 °C and extensive dialysis, the
native TCR was purified and concentrated by DE52 anion￾exchange chromatography (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ))
followed by gel-filtration chromatography (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA) on HPLC. The purified AHIII TCR was
concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. Soluble
AHIII TCR was tested for proper folding and activity
through an ELISA using HLA-A2 tetramer. Typical yield
for each 1 l of refold is about 3–5 mg of active TCR.
Similarly, soluble HLA-A2 variants were produced as
inclusion bodies in E. coli and refolded in vitro.
48 Peptide
p1049 (ALWGFFPVL), presented by A2, was synthesized
by the UNC Peptide Synthesis Facility (Chapel Hill, NC).
Briefly, peptide, β2m, and heavy chain were injected in
that order into a folding buffer optimized for refolding
class I MHC at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. After
incubation for 24–36 h at 10 °C the folded pMHC was
concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell (Millipore,
Billerica, MA) and purified using gel-filtration chromato￾graphy (Phenomenex) on HPLC. The purified wild-type
and A2 variants were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and
stored at −80 °C. Typical yield for each 1 l of refold is about
5 mg of pMHC.
Cytotoxicity assay
Cytotoxicity was assayed using a standard 4 h 51Cr
release assay as described.49 Briefly, between 5.0 × 103 and
5.0 × 104 AHIII 12.2 T cells were incubated with 5000
peptide-pulsed 51Cr-labeled A2 mutant-transfected cells.
324 MHC Mutation Results in CDR3α Loop RearrangementSince p1049 is a human self-antigen, the transfectants were
recognized without the addition of p1049 to the cells.
Additional p1049 did not increase cytotoxicity (data not
shown).
Surface plasmon resonance experiments
Five-thousand resonance units (RUs) of H57-597 (cap￾turing molecule, anti-TCR Cβ Ab) were covalently bound
to a Biacore CM5 sensor chip (Uppsala, Sweden) using
standard amine coupling. Soluble AHIII12.2 TCR (ligand)
was then added to the Ab at a final concentration of
50–100 nM to generate 300–400 RU of bound TCR. Soluble
class I MHC (analyte) was injected onto the surface at a
flow-rate of 100 μl/min in a 30 s pulse. TCR and MHC
were removed from the surface with 0.1 M glycine
(pH 2.5), 0.5 M NaCl and the procedure was repeated
until at least three curves were obtained for the different
concentrations of analyte. Curves obtained at each
concentration were subtracted from a reference surface
that contained Ab alone without TCR or using recombi￾nant P14 TCR as a negative control. Data were processed
using Scrubber (BioLogic Software, Campbell, Australia)
and CLAMP.50 The suitability of the fit was measured
based on χ2 values and the appearance of residuals. In all
cases, χ2 was b1, residuals were small and random, and
the experimental curves visually matched the predicted
curves.
Protein crystallization and structure determination
The crystallization conditions for the crystal complexes
were similar to those optimized for AHIII TCR with wild￾type A2.28 Briefly, crystals were grown by hanging-drop,
vapor-diffusion, using AHIII TCR and A2 variants mixed
at equal ratios at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Drops
contain 1 μl of protein solution mixed with 1 μl of a well
solution containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5–8.0), 1 M NaCl,
14–18% (w/v) PEG 8000. Small crystals formed within
three days along with precipitate in the drops. Crystal size
was improved by macro-seeding under identical condi￾tions. Crystals were transferred to mother liquor contain￾ing 25% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant. Crystallographic
data were collected at the Southeast Regional Collabo￾rative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-ID and 22-BM beam￾lines at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National
Laboratory (Argonne, IL). Data for AHIII-p1049/A2(T163A)
were collected on the 22-BM beamline at 12,398.42 eV for
360° at a distance of 200 mm using 1.0° oscillations. Two
datasets for AHIII-p1049/A2(W167A) were collected on
the 22-ID beamline at 12,759.89 eV at a distance of 300 mm
using 1.0° oscillations: a 180° dataset was collected at an ω
angle of 90° and an additional 45° dataset was collected at
an ω angle of 45°. These datasets were indexed separately
and then scaled together. Data for AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A)
were collected on the 22-ID beamline at 12,759.89 eV for
180° at a distance of 300 mm using 1.0° oscillations. Data for
all co-crystal complexes were indexed and scaled
with HKL2000.51 The dataset for AHIII-p1049/A2(T163A)
was collected originally out to 2.1 Å, but it was highly
anisotropic. As a result, the statistics in the highest shells
were poor, so the dataset was truncated at 2.4 Å. Molecular
replacement solutions were determined using rigid body
refinement in Refmac 5.0,52 with AHIII-p1049/A2 (1LP9) as
the search model.28 Temperature factors were set to 30.0
using Moleman.53 Positional refinement using non-crystal￾lographic symmetry restraints for the first few cycles and
TLS refinement54 in Refmac 5.0 was performed iteratively
with manual intervention with O.55 When the statistics
did not improve over two subsequent rounds of refine￾ment and the Rfree value was below 30%, water molecules
were added using Arp within Refmac 5.0 to AHIII-p1049/
A2(T163A) and AHIII-p1049/A2(W167A) models. All
water molecules were examined to confirm the presence
of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors at reasonable
geometries. For the AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A) model, an
omit map of the CDR3α loop was generated to verify the
conformational change. The refinement statistics for the
final models are presented in Table 2. Surface comple￾mentarity (SC) values were calculated using Sc56 in the
CCP4 suite.52
Isothermal titration calorimetry
ITC experiments on AHIII TCR with wild-type p1049/
A2 and p1049/A2(K66A) were performed on a Microcal
VP-ITC in the UNC Macromolecular Interactions Facility
(Chapel Hill, NC). Thermodynamic constants were
obtained for AHIII TCR binding wild-type p1049/A2 as
well as p1049/A2(K66A) by fitting the calorimetric data
using a one-site binding model in Microcal Origin version
5.0 Software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA).
Soluble AHIII TCR was placed in the mixing chamber.
p1049/A2 or p1049/A2(K66A) was titrated into the AHIII
TCR solution until binding reached saturation. Titration of
wild-type p1049/A2 into AHIII TCR was performed in
duplicate, once in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH
7.5), and then in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5), to ensure
that the determined enthalpy was not affected by
ionization enthalpy of the buffer.57 Concentrations of
AHIII TCR and p1049/A2 were 17 μM and 217 μM,
respectively, in the phosphate buffer and 19 μM and
234 μM, respectively, in the Tris buffer. For wild-type
p1049/A2 experiments, a volume of 3 μl was used for the
first four injections, and then 5 μl for the remaining
titrations. The baseline, generated by averaging the heat
measured for the last ten injections, was subtracted from
all peaks. Titration of p1049/A2(K66A) in AHIII TCR was
performed in triplicate in the phosphate buffer. Concen￾trations of AHIII TCR and p1049/A2(K66A) were 40 μM
and 618 μM, 65 μM and 450 μM, and 43 μM and 394 μM,
respectively, for the three replicates. For all p1049/A2
(K66A) experiments, a volume of 5 μl was injected for the
first four peaks, increased to 10 μl for the remainder of the
experiment. Because of the relatively small amount of heat
released upon AHIII-p1049/A2(K66A) binding, a more
accurate baseline was determined by injecting p1049/A2
(K66A) into the phosphate buffer to measure the heat of
dilution. This reference dataset was subtracted from the
experimental dataset in Origin Software. All concentra￾tions were determined before the proteins were placed in
the microcalorimeter using extinction coefficients. ΔH and
ΔS were calculated using the Origin software. Gibbs free
energy was calculated as ΔG=ΔH – TΔS, where T= 298 K.
