ABSTRACT: Tissue factor (TF) is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that functions as a cofactor for coagulation 
factor VIIa (VIIa) and initiates blood coagulation at sites of vascular injury. On the basis of sequence 
alignments, TF was predicted to be a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Utilizing the structural 
information available for the cytokine receptor superfamily, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to 
identify the binding site on TF for VIIa. The predicted loop regions in TF were systematically replaced 
with the homologous loops from the y-interferon receptor (y-IFN-R), the protein most related to TF in 
the superfamily of cytokine receptors. Six discontinuous regions (residues 16-20,40-46, 60-69, 101 - 
11 1, 129- 151, 193-207) were identified that are required for interaction with VIIa and enhancement of 
activity. Individual substitution of 68 residues within these loops with alanine revealed eight residues 
(K20, D44, W45, K46, Q110, R135, F140, V207) that are required for cofactor activity. These residues 
fall into two groups, those that are required only for interactions with VIIa (K46, QllO, R135, F140, 
V207) and those that are also required to induce the conformational change in VIIa required for enhanced 
activity (K20, D44, W45). The discontinuous regions of TF required for interactions with VIIa form a 
single binding surface for VIIa that is analogous to the interface defined by the crystal structure of the 
complex between growth hormone and its receptor. This suggests that in addition to the conservation of 
structure between the members of the cytokine receptor superfamily there is also conservation of the 
mode of ligand binding despite the structural and functional diversity among the ligands. 
Tissue factor (TF) is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that 
acts as a receptor for coagulation factor VI1 (VII) and factor 
VIIa (VIIa). TF participates in the proteolytic activation of 
VI1 to VIIa (Nakagaki et al., 1991; Yamamoto et al., 1992) 
and functions as a cofactor for VIIa, enhancing the proteolytic 
activity of VIIa toward its physiological substrates, coagula￾tion factor IX (IX) (0sterud & Rapaport, 1977) and factor 
X (X) (Nemerson, 1966). The proteolytic activation of IX 
to IXa and X to Xa by the TFNIIa complex leads to the 
activation of prothrombin and the formation of a fibrin clot 
(reviewed in Bach, 1988; Nemerson, 1988; Edgington et al., 
1991). TF is expressed on the surface of a wide variety of 
cells in the extravascular space but is not normally expressed 
on cells in contact with the circulation. Vascular damage 
or induction of TF expression on monocytes and endothelial 
cells by various inflammatory signals such as bacterial 
lipopolysaccharide (Crossman et al., 1990), TNF-a (Scarpati 
& Sadler, 1989) and IL-1 (Bevilacqua et al., 1984) can lead 
to the exposure of TF to circulating VI1 and VIIa. The ability 
of thrombin itself to stimulate the intrinsic pathway of blood 
coagulation by feedback activation of factor XI has led to 
the proposal that VIIa activation by TF is the major 
mechanism for the initiation of blood coagulation in vivo at 
sites of inflammation and vascular injury (Gailani & Broze, 
1991). Because the interaction of TF with VIWIIa is 
believed to be such a critical event in the initiation of blood 
coagulation, we attempted to identify the structural elements 
in TF that are involved in this interaction.

Human TF is a glycoprotein composed of 263 amino acids 
and consists of three domains. The extracellular domain 
(residues 1-219) contains three sites for N-linked glycosyl￾ation and four cysteine residues that form two disulfide bonds 
(C45-C57 and C186-C209) (Bach et al., 1988). However, 
the functional expression of both full-length recombinant 
human TF and a mutant TF (C245S) in Eschericia coli (E. 
coli) demonstrated that glycosylation was not required for 
TF activity (Paborsky et al., 1989). A truncated soluble form 
of TF (sTF) consisting of only the extracellular domain has 
been expressed in E. coli, cultured Chinese hamster ovary 
cells and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Waxman et al., 1992; 
Ruf et al., 1991a,b; Shigematsu et al., 1992). The TF 
extracellular domain alone appears to be capable of forming 
high affinity interactions with VIIa and acting as a cofactor 
for VIIa, enhancing the hydrolysis of small peptidyl sub￾strates and the proteolytic activation of X to Xa. The broad 
range of affinities reported for this interaction (0.5-100 nM) 
is generally reduced compared to the values reported for full 
length TF (7.0 pM-9.0 nM). We chose to analyze the 
interaction between VIIa and sTF because the interaction 
can be studied in the absence of potential complications due 
to the presence of detergents and phospholipids. 
On the basis of sequence alignments it was predicted that 
TF is a member of the superfamily of cytokine receptors 
that includes receptors for a diverse group of growth factors, 
hematopoietic factors, interleukins, and interferons (Bazan, 
1990a,b). The extracellular domains of the members of this 
cytokine receptor superfamily have a conserved structure 
composed of two tandemly repeated folding modules of 
approximately 100 residues. Each module consists of seven 
conserved @-strands connected by more variable loop regions 
0006-2960/94/0433- 14003$04.50/0 0 1994 American Chemical Society 14004 Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 47, 1994 
assembled into two antiparallel P-sheets in a manner 
analogous to the constant domains of immunoglobulin 
molecules. These predictions were found to be generally 
correct upon the solution of the crystal structure of the 
extracellular domain of human growth hormone receptor 
(hGH-R) in a 2:l complex with human growth hormone 
(hGH) (de Vos et al., 1992). 
Utilizing the structural information available for the 
cytokine receptor superfamily to guide our mutagenesis 
strategy, we attempted to identify the regions of TF important 
for interactions with VIIa. The predicted loop regions in 
TF were targeted for mutation because the loop regions in 
proteins are often exposed on the protein surface and make 
important contributions to interactions with ligands (Rose 
et al., 1985; Kuntz, 1972). They are tolerant of considerable 
sequence variation (Bajaj & Blundell, 1984), and substitution 
of the residues in these regions has less potential for causing 
nonspecific structural disruptions. We systematically re￾placed the loop regions in TF with the homologous regions 
from the human y-interferon receptor (7-IFN-R), the closest 
relative to TF in the cytokine receptor superfamily. The 
homologous loop swap mutants were screened for TF 
cofactor activity. To identify the specific amino acids 
involved, individual residues in the TF loop regions identified 
as being important for interactions with VIIa were then 
substituted with alanine. The alanine replacement mutants 
were screened for cofactor activity, and the contribution of 
each residue to the binding energy of the TFNIIa complex 
was determined by estimating the change in KD attributable 
to the mutation. 
Gibbs et al. 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
Materials. VIIa was from Haematologic Technologies, 
Inc., and BiosPacific (Emeryville, CA); the chromogenic 
substrate, H-D-Isoleucyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline di￾hydrochloride (S-2288) was from Chromogenix. The goat 
anti-TF antibody and the monoclonal antibody against TF 
(catalogue number 4503) were from American Diagnostica, 
Inc.; anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody and anti-FLAG 
MI affinity gel were from IBI; BCA (bicinchoninic acid) 
protein assay reagent was from Pierce. 
Construction of Vectors for TF Expression. An expression 
vector, pT7-hTF(T)FLAG was constructed for the expression 
of sTF in E. coli. The 657 nucleotide fragment encoding 
the extracellular domain of human TF (amino acids 1-219) 
was isolated by PCR (GeneAmp kit, Perkin Elmer Cetus) 
from a cDNA clone of human TF, pHTF8 (ATCC 61351) 
(Scarpati et al., 1987). A stop codon (TAA) was introduced 
immediately after the codon for residue 219 and NsiI sites 
were introduced at the 5' and 3' ends of the fragment. The 
fragment was ligated into the NsiI site in pT7-3.0. pT7-3.0 
is a pUC-based phagemid expression vector that contains 
the T7 RNA polymerase promoter upstream of a region 
encoding the translation initiation site and signal peptide from 
the ST I1 enterotoxin gene. This is followed by the T7 
transcription termination region and the origin of replication 
for single-stranded bacteriophage, fl (Dotto et al., 1981). 
Synthesis of single-stranded DNA and packaging into 
filamentous bacteriophage particles can be induced by a 
helper phage, M13K07 (Vieira & Messing, 1987). The STII 
signal sequence in pT7-3.0 has been engineered to cryptically 
encode unique restriction sites for BsmI, NruI, MluI, and NsiI 
that can be used to create fusions between any coding 
sequence and the ST I1 signal sequence. This fusion directs 
secretion across the bacterial inner membrane. High-level 
expression from this vector can be induced in E. coli strain 
BL21(DE3) containing pLysS (Studier et al., 1990) which 
supplies the gene for T7 RNA polymerase expressed from 
the lacUV5 promoter. This promoter can be induced by 
IPTG. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to 
insert a sequence encoding an octapeptide (DYKDDDDK) 
known as the FLAG motif (Hopp et al., 1988) at the junction 
between the carboxyl terminal of the STII signal sequence 
and the amino terminal of the coding region for sTF to create 
a fusion protein. The octapeptide motif serves as an epitope 
for a Ca*+-dependent monoclonal antibody, M1. 
Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis. The procedure 
used has been previously described in detail (Gibbs & Zoller, 
1991). A uracil-containing, single-stranded template of pT7- 
hTF(T)FLAG was generated by isolating single-stranded 
DNA from a dut-ung- strain of E. coli, CJ236, transformed 
with pT7-hTF(T)FLAG and infected with helper phage 
M13K07 (Kunkel et al., 1987). Synthetic oligonucleotides 
were designed that encode various predicted loop regions 
from the y-IFN-R or single alanine substitutions flanked by 
regions of 15 nucleotides complementary to the pT7-hTF(T)- 
FLAG template. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthe￾sized on an Applied Biosystems Inc. solid-phase synthesizer 
using phosphoamidite chemistry. Phosphorylated oligo￾nucleotides were annealed to the pV-hTF(T)FLAG template, 
extended by T7 DNA polymerase, and joined to the newly 
synthesized strand by DNA ligase. The reaction mixture was 
used to transform a dut+ung+ strain of E. coli, XL1-Blue, to 
select against the uracil-containing template strand. Single￾stranded DNA from individual colonies was sequenced using 
dideoxy chain termination and Sequenase 2.0 (United States 
Biochemicals) to confirm the identity of the mutation. 
Single-stranded DNA was used to transform E. coli strain, 
BL21(DE3), containing pLysS for expression of mutant 
constructs. 
Expression of sTF Fusion Proteins in E. coli. The sTF 
mutants were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) contain￾ing pLysS. Single colonies were picked from a plate of LB 
agar containing 200 pg/mL ampicillin and 30 pglmL 
chloramphenicol and used to inoculate 2 mL of LB broth 
containing 200 pglmL ampicillin and 30 pg/mL chloram￾phenicol. The 2 mL cultures were grown overnight at 37 
"C (250 rpm) and 300 pL was used to inoculate 30 mL of 
LB broth containing 200 pg/mL ampicillin and 30 pglmL 
chloramphenicol. The 30 mL cultures were incubated at 37 
"C (250 rpm) for 6 h and induced by the addition of IPTG 
to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. The incubation was 
continued at 30 "C (250 rpm) overnight. Cultures were 
scaled up to 200 and 1000 mL final volumes as required. 
Pur@cation of sTF Fusion Proteins. Soluble TF was 
purified from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) containing pLysS 
culture medium, or combined periplasmic and cytoplasmic 
extracts, by affinity chromatography using the anti-FLAG 
M1 monoclonal antibody. The cells were harvested by 
centrifugation and stored at -20 "C, and the bacterial culture 
supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration. The cell 
paste was thawed and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HC1 and 
150 mM NaC1, pH 7.5, containing 1 mg/mL lysozyme. The 
extract was sonicated and rotated end over end for 1 h at 4 
"C. Poly(ethy1enimine) (5% (wlv)) was added to a final 
concentration of 0.1%, and the extract was clarified by 
centrifugation. The resulting cell extract or concentrated Factor VIIa Binding Site on Tissue Factor Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 47, 1994 14005 
culture medium was adjusted to 1 mM CrTl2 and then loaded 
at 4 "C (20 mLk) onto the anti-FLAG MI affinity resin 
preequilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCI, 150 mM NaCl, and 
1 mM CaC12, pH 7.5. The column was washed with 10 
column volumes of the equilibration buffer and eluted with 
SO mM Tris-HC1 and 50 mM EGTA, pH 7.5. The fractions 
were collected and the peak was pooled by optical density 
at 280 nm. The pool was dialyzed extensively against 50 
mM Tris-HC1 and 150 mM NaCI, pH 7.5. The protein 
concentration of wild-type sTF was based on a BCA protein 
assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. 
ELISA. The amount of sTF antigen expressed was 
estimated using a sandwich immunoassay employing the anti￾FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody and a goat anti-human TF 
antibody. Purified wild-type sTF was used as standard. The 
anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody was coated on to 96- 
well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates 
(Corning) at 20 yglmL IgG in 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 
9.2, overnight at 4 "C. The plates were washed with wash 
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 % BSA, 1 mM 
CaC12, 0.02% Tween 20), and the excess sites on the plate 
were blocked for 1 h with 5% BSA in 50 mM Tris-HC1, 
150 mM NaCI, 1 mM CaC12, and 0.02% Tween 20. The 
plates were washed again, and sTF was added at increasing 
concentrations and incubated for I h at 4 "C. Soluble TF 
was detected by incubating the plates for 1 h at 4 "C with 
the goat anti-TF antibody (10 yglmL) followed by a 1 h 
incubation at 4 "C with an anti-goat antibody conjugated to 
horseradish peroxidase ( 1 : 5000). The plates were washed 
in between each incubation step and developed using the 
peroxidase substrate, ABTS (Vector Laboratories). The 
absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a Molecular 
Devices plate reader. The sensitivity of the assay was 1 - 10 
ng/mL. 
sTF Cqfacror Activity Assay. To examine the functionality 
of the sTF mutants, the cofactor activity for VIIa-catalyzed 
hydrolysis of a peptidyl chromogenic substrate S-2288 was 
measured. Varying concentrations of sTF were incubated 
for 5 min at 37 "C in 50 mM Tris-HCI, 100 mM NaCl, and 
0.1% BSA, pH 7.5, containing 5 mM CaC12 and 2 nM VIIa. 
The chromogenic substrate S-2288 was added, and the 
reaction was incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 "C. 
The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50% acetic 
acid, and the amount of p-nitroaniline released was measured 
by the absorbance at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices plate 
reader. The KD for the interaction of purified wild-type sTF 
with VIIa was calculated by curve fitting using nonlinear 
regression analysis. 
VIIa Binding Assay and Monoclonal Antibody Binding 
Assay. A 96-well ELISA plate (Corning) was coated 
overnight at 4 "C with 20 yglmL anti-FLAG MI monoclonal 
antibody in 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.2. The excess 
sites on the plate were blocked with 5% BSA in 50 mM 
Tris-HC1, 150 mM NaCI, 1 mM CaC12, and 0.02% Tween 
20, and the plate was washed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris￾HCI, 150 mM NaCI, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM CaC12,0.02% Tween 
20). Soluble TF (3.8 nM) was added and incubated for 1 h 
at 4 "C. The plate was washed and then incubated with 
increasing concentrations of biotinylated VIIa (0- 1 pM). 
(VIIa was biotinylated using a Molecular Probes kit accord￾ing to manufacturer's instructions.) Binding was detected 
by incubating the plate with avidin-horseradish peroxidase 
(2.5 yg/mL) for 1 h at 4 "C. The plate was washed and 
then developed by incubating for 30 min at room temperature

nm was determined using a Molecular Devices plate reader. 
KD was determined by curve fitting using nonlinear regres￾sion analysis. 
The assay described above was modified to test for the 
conformational integrity of the sTF mutants. The ELISA 
plate was coated with the M1 antibody, blocked, and 
incubated with sTF as described. The plate was washed and 
incubated with increasing concentrations (0-50 nM) of 
biotinylated monoclonal antibody (American Diagnostica 
4503). Binding was detected and KD was determined as 
indicated for the VIIa binding assay. The conformational 
dependence of the monoclonal antibody was established 
using denatured sTF that had been reduced and carboxy￾methylated using iodoacetic acid. 
RESULTS 
Purification and Characterization of sTF. Bacterial 
culture medium concentrated by ultrafiltration or an E. coli 
cell extract was adjusted to 1 mM CaCI2 and loaded onto 
the anti-FLAG M 1 affinity column. The column was washed 
with equilibration buffer and eluted with EGTA. The pooled 
fractions were concentrated and then dialyzed against SO mM 
Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCI. The purified sTF 
appeared as a single band of -35 kDa when analyzed by 
nonreducing SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Figure 1, lane 
I). This material was assessed to be greater than 90% pure 
and was subsequently used as the standard in the TF ELISA. 
The purified sTF was assayed for cofactor function by 
determining its ability to enhance the catalytic activity of 
VIIa toward a peptidyl chromogenic substrate, S-2288 
(Figure 2). The concentration required to generate half￾maximal enhancement of VIIa activity was 5.3 nM, which 
is consistent with published values for the interaction between 
sTF and VIIa (0.5-100 nM) (Waxman et al., 1992; Ruf et 
al., 1991a,b; Shigematsu et al., 1992). This assay represents 
a simple method for analyzing the interaction between sTF 
and VIIa and provides an easy screen to characterize TF 
mutants.

receptor superfamily, and the hGH-R, the cytokine receptor 
for which the most structural information exists (Bazan, 
1990b). The 14 regions of P-secondary structure from the 
hGH-R crystal structure were superimposed on the TF 
alignment (Figure 3). In order to identify the loop regions 
in TF which interact with VIIa, structurally nondisruptive 
homologous loop swap mutations were constructed. The 
loops connecting P-strands in each module, those connecting 
P-strands with the N- and C-terminal regions, and the 
intermodule linker were systematically replaced with the 
corresponding loop regions from the y-IFN-R (Table 1) by 
oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The loop connecting 
P-strands C-B and C-C was too large to be swapped using 
a single oligonucleotide primer; thus this loop was swapped 
in two separate portions, loop regions 10 and 11. Homolo￾gous loop swap mutants in which TF loop regions 3 and 11 
were replaced could not be stably expressed. Therefore, loop 
regions 3 and 11 were swapped in two discrete portions, 3a, 
3b, lla, and llb.

a Predicted loop regions in TF (1-16) were replaced with the 
corresponding residues from y-IFN-R according to the alignment in 
Figure 3. TF mutants were screened for TF cofactor activity at a 
concentration of 38 nM. Activity is expressed as a percentage of the 
cofactor activitv of wild-tvve sTF. 
A total of 18 sTF loop swap mutants and wild-type sTF 
were stably expressed in E. coli. Culture medium containing 
the mutant proteins was concentrated by ultrafiltration and 
the amount of sTF was quantitated by ELISA. The sTF 
mutants were screened at a concentration of 38 nM for their 
ability to stimulate VIIa activity toward the chromogenic 
peptide substrate S-2288. This concentration exceeds the 
ECso for this reaction by approximately 7-fold. Eight 
mutants, encompassing six distinct loop regions, had less 
than 10% of the wild-type cofactor activity, indicating that 
these loops were important for interactions with VIIa (Table 
1). Using the a-carbon trace of hGH-R structure as a model 
for the topology of sTF (Figure 4A), three of these loop 
regions were located on one face of the N-terminal module 
(N-A-N-B, N-C-N-C', N-E-N-F), two loop regions com￾prised one face of the C-terminal module (C-B-C-C, C-F￾40

and receptor 1 (blue) illustrates that the same general surface was 
utilized by hGH-R for the recognition of hGH as was used by TF 
for interactions with VIIa. The regions utilized by the hGH-R 
include two loop regions from one face of each of the two 
subdomains, part of P-strand N-G, and the linker region that 
connects the two subdomains. 
C-G), and the remaining loop region consisted of the 
intermodule linker (N-G-C-A). These six loop regions form 
a single continuous binding surface for VIIa on the surface 
of TF (Figure 4A) that is analogous to the interface identified 
in the crystal structure of the complex between hGH and 
hGH-R (Figure 4B). 
Identification of Specific Amino Acid Residues in TF 
Important for Interactions with VIIa by Alanine Scanning 
Mutagenesis. To identify the individual amino acids in￾volved in specific interactions with VIIa, the 68 residues 
(excluding glycine) within the six important loop regions of 
TF were substituted with alanine (Table 2). Four of the 68 
alanine substitution mutants could not be expressed in soluble 
form in E. coli (F19A, T60A, F147A, L151A). Three of 
these mutants involve large hydrophobic residues (phenyl￾alanine and leucine) that are often buried in proteins, and 
the substitution of such residues may disrupt the overall 
conformation of the protein (Bowie et al., 1990). 
The remaining 64 sTF mutants were isolated in the 
combined periplasmic and cytosolic extracts from 200 mL 
of E. coli culture and the concentration of each mutant protein 
was determined by ELISA. Extracts containing the mutant 
proteins were screened for cofactor activity at a concentration 
of 13 nM, approximately 2.5-fold in excess of the ECso for 
wild-type sTF (Table 2). Eight sTF mutants (K20A, D44A, 
W45A, K46A, QllOA, R135A, F140A, V207A) involving 
residues from five of the six TF loop regions displayed less 
than 40% of the cofactor activity of wild-type sTF. These 
eight sTF mutants were selected for further analysis to 
determine the energetic contribution of each residue toward 
interactions with VIIa. 
Quantitative Analysis of the Contribution of Specific TF 
Residues to Interactions with VIIa. The eight sTF alanine 
replacement mutants were purified from combined periplas￾mic and cytoplasmic extracts by M1 affinity chromatography. 
The mutant proteins were at least 90% pure as estimated by 
silver-stained SDS-PAGE (Figure 1), and the concentration 
of each sTF mutant was determined by ELISA. 
The conformational integrity of each sTF mutant was 
assessed using a noninhibitory conformationally sensitive 
monoclonal antibody in a modified ELISA format (Table 
3). The KD for native sTF was 0.13 nM while the KD for 
denatured sTF was 1.0 nM. The affinity of each of the sTF 
mutants for the monoclonal antibody was identical to native 
sTF (KD = 0.12-0.16 nM), indicating that the conforma￾tional integrity of all mutants was preserved. 
The interaction of each mutant with VIIa was quantita￾tively assessed by the sTF cofactor activity assay (Table 3). 
Each of the mutants displayed decreased affinity for VIIa. 
The KD for each mutant was increased by 4.5 to 61-fold, 
corresponding to a loss of 0.9-2.5 kcal/mol of free energy 
of binding for each residue substituted. 
When the ability of each mutant to enhance the activity 
of VIIa was considered, the mutants fell into two classes. 
Despite the decrease in affinity for VIIa, the ability to 
enhance VIIa activity at saturating concentrations of TF was 
undiminished for some mutants (K46A, Q 1 10A, R135A, 
F140A, V207A). The residues substituted in these mutants 
are candidates for those that may solely participate in binding 
interactions with VIIa. For other mutants (K20A, W45A, 
and to a lesser degree mutant D44A) the level of enhance￾ment of VIIa activity at saturation was diminished by 2-4- 
fold. In addition to contributing to binding interactions with 
VIIa, the residues replaced in these mutants are potentially 
required to induce the conformational change in VIIa 
postulated to be responsible for the increased activity of VIIa 
in the TFNIIa complex. 14008 Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 47, 1994 Gibbs et al.

Monoclonal antibody affinity was determined from the concentra￾tion dependence of biotinylated antibody binding. Maximal VIIa 
activity at saturating concentrations and affinity of TF mutants for VIIa 
were determined from the concentration dependence of VIIa activity. 
Maximal VIIa activity is expressed as the percentage of VIIa activity 
induced by wild-type sTF at saturation. Mean standard error for KD 
determinations is less than 30%. Loss of free energy of binding (AAG) 
was calculated from the equation AAG = -RT In& mutant/& u.lid ,ype). 
The interaction of sTF mutants for VIIa was also examined 
utilizing biotinylated VIIa in a modified ELISA format. The 
KD for wild-type sTF under these conditions was estimated 
to be 38 nM. Despite the nonequilibrium nature of this assay, 
the rank order of affinity for each sTF mutant was preserved 
(data not shown), with the exception of V207A which 
displayed only a slight (24%) decrease in affinity. The 
interaction of this mutant may be affected by the biotinylation 
of VIIa. 
DISCUSSION 
Using a site-directed mutagenesis strategy guided by 
structural information, we have identified the regions of TF 
that are important for VIIa binding and cofactor activity. The 
systematic replacement of predicted loop regions in the 
extracellular domain of TF with the homologous loops from 
a protein of related structure (y-IFN-R) revealed six discon￾tinuous regions that are required for enhancement of VIIa 
activity (16-20,40-46, 60-69, 101-111, 129-151, 193- 
207). The individual substitution of each residue within the 
six putative loop regions with alanine revealed eight residues 
(K20, D44, W45, K46, QllO, R135, F140, V207) that are 
important for binding interactions with VIIa. The possibility 
exists that the loss of function observed may be due to the 
nonspecific disruption of protein conformation rather than 
the replacement of a genuinely functional residue. Our 
mutagenesis approach was designed to reduce this. Alanine 
was used for all substitutions as its small size and neutral 
character impose the least constraints on secondary structure Factor VIIa Binding Site on Tissue Factor 
and tertiary conformation (Mapper, 1977; Rose et al., 1985). 
Therefore, the effects of the amino acid substitution can be 
studied with minimal interference from nonspecific structural 
disruption. Previous studies utilizing alanine scanning 
mutagenesis or incorporation of homologous residues from 
related proteins have indicated that gross structural perturba￾tions are an uncommon event (Cunningham et al., 1989; 
Cunningham & Wells, 1989; Gibbs & Zoller, 1991). The 
conformational integrity of each of our sTF mutants was 
established by demonstrating that affinity for a conforma￾tionally sensitive monoclonal antibody was preserved. 
In addition, several lines of evidence indirectly indicate 
that structural disruption was not a problem in our study. 
All of the mutants analyzed were stably expressed in soluble 
form, suggesting that global conformation was preserved. 
Among the 64 alanine substitution mutants analyzed only 8 
were functionally defective, suggesting that alanine substitu￾tions do not commonly disrupt protein folding. In addition, 
residues whose replacement with alanine caused large 
functional defects could be found adjacent to residues that 
could be substituted without loss of function, suggesting that 
any structural perturbations were small, localized, and not 
perpetuated to affect flanking residues. Finally, the energetic 
contribution of each of the eight TF residues (K20, D44, 
W45, K46, Q110, R135, F140, V207) to the binding of VIIa, 
calculated from the change in KD attributable to the substitu￾tion of each residue, varied between 0.9 and 2.5 kcal/mol. 
These residues have polar, charged and hydrophobic side 
chains that could contribute hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, 
and hydrophobic interactions to stabilize the TFNIIa com￾plex (Janin & Chothia, 1990). The magnitude of the 
contribution of individual residues to the free energy of 
binding was comparable to previous determinations dem￾onstrating that hydrogen bonds between polar residues 
contribute 0.5- 1.5 kcal/mol, hydrogen bonds involving a 
charged residue contribute 3.5-4.5 kcal/mol (Fersht et al., 
1985), and salt bridges contribute up to 2.0 kcal/mol (Wells 
et al., 1987). Thus the magnitude of the functional disruption 
caused by the alanine substitutions was consistent with the 
loss of individual hydrogen bonds and salt bridges rather 
than the gross disruption of the protein structure. 
The six regions and the individual residues within these 
regions characterized as being important for cofactor activity 
are widely dispersed in the primary sequence of TF, implying 
that TF must fold to bring these regions into proximity for 
interactions with VITa. When the hGH-R structure was used 
as a model for TF (de Vos et al., 1992), the six dispersed 
loop regions in TF were found to be in close proximity to 
each other (Figure 4A) and defined a binding surface for 
VIIa that was homologous to the interface for hGH on 
hGH-R (Figure 4B). This suggests that in addition to the 
conservation of structure between the members of the 
cytokine receptor superfamily there is also conservation of 
the mode of ligand binding despite the structural diversity 
among the ligands. This is remarkable because the bundle 
of four a-helices that comprise hGH would not be expected 
to resemble the y-carboxyglutamic acid, epidermal growth 
factor-like and protease domains of VIIa which have been 
proposed to be involved in interactions with TF (Wildgoose 
et al., 1990, 1992, 1993; Toomey et al., 1991; Kazama et 
al., 1993). 
Six of the eight amino acid residues of TF that are 
important for interactions with VIIa (K20, W45, K46, Q110, 
R135, F140) are conserved in the human, bovine, rabbit, and 
Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 47, 1994 14009 
mouse TF sequences. D44 is conservatively substituted with 
asparagine in bovine, rabbit, and mouse and V207 is 
nonconserved. The high degree of conservation of these 
residues among mammalian TF molecules is consistent with 
the proposed functional importance of these residues (Creigh￾ton & Darby, 1989). None of these residues are conserved 
among the other members of the cytokine receptor super￾family (Bazan, 1991b). Mapping of the residues in the 
crystal structure of hGH-R reveals 19 residues that are buried 
in the interface with hGH or make electrostatic interactions 
with hGH and may contribute to ligand binding (de Vos et 
al., 1992). The importance of eight of these residues has 
been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (Bass et al., 
1991). When the TF and hGH-R sequences are aligned, the 
residues in each protein predicted to be important for ligand 
binding are located in similar regions (Figure 3). However, 
it is difficult to predict whether these residues are in spatially 
equivalent locations in the respective three-dimensional 
structures because most of these residues are located in loop 
regions which are less homologous and more variable in 
length than the @-strand regions. 
The eight residues identified could be divided into two 
groups based on the effects of their replacement on affinity 
for VIIa and their ability to mediate maximal enhancement 
of VIIa activity. The substitution of K46, QllO, R135, F140, 
and V207 decreased the affinity for VIIa only, suggesting 
that these residues were involved in simple binding interac￾tions with VIIa. The replacement of K20, W45, or D44 
resulted in a decrease in the maximal level of enhancement 
of VIIa activity at saturation as well as decreased affinity 
for VIIa. These results suggest that these residues may 
participate in the conformational change postulated to be 
responsible for the enhancement of VIIa activity when bound 
to TF (Nemerson & Gentry. 1986). These residues may 
make additional or more energetically favorable interactions 
when bound to VIIa in the active conformation. 
Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine residues in TF 
suggested that the integrity of the disulfide bond between 
C186 and (2209 in the carboxyl-terminal region of the TF 
extracellular domain was required for interactions with VIIa 
(Rehemtulla et al., 1992). Competition studies using mono￾clonal antibodies directed against TF identified two extended 
regions (40-83 and 106-165) that are recognized by 
antibodies that block VI1 binding (Ruf et al., 1991~). Two 
similar regions (44-84 and 129-169) were identified by 
peptide mapping of TF photoaffinity labeled with VIIa (Ruf 
& Edgington, 1991). The two extended regions identified 
in those studies encompass four of the six critical loop 
regions identified in our study. Random substitution of 
residues in TF and screening crude membrane preparations 
for TF function in an assay measuring factor Xa activity 
revealed five mutants defective in VIIa recognition (Ruf et 
al., 1994). Three of these residues (K20, R135, and F140) 
were also identified in our study: the other residues impli￾cated (I22 and D58) are located in predicted @-strand regions 
and were not tested in our analysis. 
The grouping of the cytokine receptors into a superfamily 
that shares a common structure requires assumptions of 
structural relatedness because the sequence homology at the 
level of amino acid identity is weak. The identification of 
a ligand binding site on TF that is spatially homologous to 
the hormone binding site on the hGH-R validates the 
relationship between these two diverse members of the 
superfamily. This also indicates that the mode of ligand 14010 Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 47, 1994 Gibbs et al. 
binding and structure-function relationships are likely to be 
conserved among superfamily members despite the consider￾able evolutionary distance between sequences and the 
diversity of receptor function. Our results reveal a common 
region on all the cytokine receptors that may be exploited 
as a target for competitive inhibitors of ligand binding and 
may provide opportunities for the protein engineering of 
receptors with altered specificities.
