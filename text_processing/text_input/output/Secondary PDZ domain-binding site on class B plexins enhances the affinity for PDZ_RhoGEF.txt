PDZ domains are abundant protein interaction modules and typi￾cally recognize a short motif at the C terminus of their ligands, with
a few residues in the motif endowing the binding specificity. The
sequence-based rules, however, cannot fully account for the speci￾ficity between the vast number of PDZ domains and ligands in the
cell. Plexins are transmembrane receptors that regulate processes
such as axon guidance and angiogenesis. Two related guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), PDZ–RhoGEF and leukemia￾associated RhoGEF (LARG), use their PDZ domains to bind class B
plexins and play critical roles in signaling. Here, we present the
crystal structure of the full-length cytoplasmic region of PlexinB2
in complex with the PDZ domain of PDZ–RhoGEF. The structure
reveals that, in addition to the canonical C-terminal motif/PDZ
interaction, the 3D domain of PlexinB2 forms a secondary inter￾face with the PDZ domain. Our biophysical and cell-based assays
show that the secondary interface contributes to the specific in￾teraction between plexin and PDZ–RhoGEF and to signaling by
plexin in the cell. Formation of secondary interfaces may be a
general mechanism for increasing affinity and specificity of mod￾ular domain-mediated interactions.
PDZ | plexin | signaling | protein interaction module | specificity
Plexins are cell surface receptors for semaphorins, extracellular
cues that control essential processes such as neuronal axon
guidance and vasculature development (1). Binding of semaphorin
to the extracellular region of plexin induces formation of the
active dimer of the cytoplasmic region, which transduces signal to
downstream pathways (2–7). The plexin cytoplasmic region contains
a juxtamembrane segment (JM-segment), a RhoGTPase binding
domain (RBD), and a GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain
(8–10). The GAP domain, activated by the dimerization, trans￾duces signal through converting its substrate GTPase Rap from
the GTP-bound active to the GDP-bound inactive state (2, 3). The
RBD regulates plexin activity in response to binding of Rho family
GTPases, such as Rac1 (reviewed in ref. 11).
In addition to the common signaling pathways through the do￾mains shared by all plexins, class B plexins (B1, B2, and B3) me￾diate a pathway through their unique C terminus. The conserved
“VTDL” motif at the C terminus of these plexins binds to the
N-terminal PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1) domains of two re￾lated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), PDZ–RhoGEF,
and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) (12–17). This in￾teraction recruits PDZ–RhoGEF and LARG to the plasma mem￾brane, where they promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on
RhoA. GTP-bound RhoA binds its downstream effectors and
contributes to plexin signaling (13–15, 18). A recent study has shown
that deletion of the C terminus of PlexinB2 causes defects in the
development of the liver vasculature in mice, highlighting the crit￾ical role of the PDZ–RhoGEF/LARG–RhoA pathway in plexin
function in vivo (19).
More than 250 PDZ domains exist in the human proteome,
constituting one of the most abundant protein interaction mod￾ules (20, 21). Correspondingly, there are ∼600 ligands for the PDZ
domains (22). A high degree of mutual specificity is expected
between PDZ domains and their respective ligands to ensure
fidelity of signaling in the cell. The fold of PDZ domains is com￾posed of a six-stranded β-barrel and two α-helices. The canonical
interaction mode between the PDZ domains and their ligands in￾volves the binding of the C terminus of the ligand in an extended
β-strand conformation to the groove between βB and αB in the
PDZ domain. The C-terminal carboxyl group of the ligand forms
two hydrogen bonds with the backbone of the conserved “GΦGF”
motif (Φ: hydrophobic residue) in the βA–βB loop of the PDZ
domain, which underlies the strong preference of PDZ domains for
C termini. Previous studies have established the general rules of
ligand specificity for PDZ domains (23). Class I PDZ domains
recognize C-terminal motifs with the “T/S-X-Φ” (X: any residue)
sequence, whereas class II PDZ domains prefer the “Φ-X-Φ” se￾quence. The structural basis for this selectivity is relatively well
understood (20). However, many PDZ domains are promiscuous
toward short peptidic ligands and defy these simple rules of spec￾ificity. Particularly, the PDZ domains in PDZ–RhoGEF and
LARG, categorized as class I PDZ domains, bind with similar af￾finities to many peptides of both classes I and II (24).
Binding of PDZ–RhoGEF and LARG to full-length class B
plexins has been detected by various in vitro and cell-based ex￾periments, whereas many other PDZ domains showed no binding
under similar conditions (12–16). In contrast, isolated C-terminal
peptides from class B plexins and the PDZ domains of PDZ–
RhoGEF/LARG only exhibit modest affinity, with the dissocia￾tion constant (Kd) in the range of 10–40 μM (24–26). This
Significance
Protein interactions mediated by modular domains, such as PDZ
and SH2 domains, play critical roles in biology. The modules typ￾ically recognize a linear motif in their ligands, with a few resi￾dues in the motif determining the specificity. We report a crystal
structure of the complex between the cytoplasmic region of
PlexinB2 and the PDZ domain of PDZ–RhoGEF. The structure
shows that, in addition to the PDZ/motif interaction, a secondary
interface is formed between the three-dimensional domains of
the two proteins. We further show that the secondary interface
enhances the affinity between plexin and PDZ–RhoGEF and is
important for plexin signaling. Our analyses suggest that sec￾ondary interface-mediated interactions may be a broadly used
mechanism for modular domains to achieve high specificity.

and PDZ–RhoGEF/LARG is not fully recapitulated by the peptide/
PDZ interaction. More broadly, the sequence-based rules de￾scribed above are likely an oversimplification of the mechanisms
underlying specificity between PDZ domains and their ligands.
Most previous structural and binding analyses focused on iso￾lated peptidic binding motifs derived from PDZ ligands, leaving
open the question of whether other regions in the ligands are
involved in the interaction.
To address these questions, we determined the crystal struc￾ture of the complex between the full-length cytoplasmic region of
PlexinB2 and the PDZ domain of PDZ–RhoGEF. The structure
reveals a secondary interface between PlexinB2 and the PDZ
domain, in addition to the canonical interaction mediated by the
C-terminal “VTDL” motif of PlexinB2. Our structure-based mu￾tational analyses show that the secondary interface plays an im￾portant role in the specific interaction between class B plexins
and PDZ–RhoGEF.
Results
Crystal Structure of the PlexinB2/PDZ Complex Reveals a Secondary
Binding Interface. We determined the crystal structure of the full￾length cytoplasmic region of mouse PlexinB2 (PlexinB2cyto) in
complex with the PDZ domain from human PDZ–RhoGEF
(Fig. 1A). The diffraction data are anisotropic, extending to
3.2-Å resolution in the a* and b* directions and ∼5 Å resolution in
the c* direction (Table S1). The asymmetric unit of the crystal
contains one PlexinB2/PDZ complex (Fig. S1). The structure of
PlexinB2cyto, except for the disordered JM-segment, is similar
to reported structures of other plexins (2, 3, 8–10). The PDZ
domain here is similar to the NMR structure of the PDZ domain
of LARG (Fig. S2). PlexinB2cyto and the PDZ domain form a 1:1
complex, with the PlexinB2 “VTDL” motif and the PDZ domain
interacting in the typical PDZ/type I ligand binding mode (Fig. 1
B and C). These interactions are similar to those seen in the
NMR structure of the complex between the octameric tail pep￾tide from PlexinB1 and the PDZ domain from LARG (Fig. 1 B
and C and Fig. S2) (25). In addition, Lys-1838 in PlexinB2, im￾mediately upstream of the VTDL motif, makes an electrostatic
contact with Asp-64 in the PDZ domain (Fig. 1C). The equivalent
interaction, between Lys-2131 in the human PlexinB1 peptide and
Asp-89 in the LARG PDZ domain, is also present in the NMR
structure (Fig. S2) (25). Similar interactions have been extensively
characterized for many PDZ domains and their ligands (20).
In addition to the canonical interface, our structure shows a
secondary interface between the last two helices in the GAP
domain of PlexinB2 and one face of the PDZ domain composed
of β strands B–D (Fig. 2A). The two interfaces together bury
∼1,500 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area, with the canonical
and the secondary interfaces contributing ∼600 and ∼900 Å2
,
respectively. The center of the secondary interface is mediated
by hydrophobic interactions between Leu-68 from the PDZ do￾main and two alanine residues (Ala-1832 and -1833) from
PlexinB2 (Fig. 2A). Ile-66 of the PDZ and Tyr-1806 of PlexinB2
contribute additional hydrophobic contacts at the periphery of
the interface. The interface is further stabilized by polar inter￾actions. Arg-88 and Asp-64 from the PDZ domain interact with
Asp-1807 and Lys-1838 from PlexinB2cyto, respectively (Fig. 2B).
Tandem glutamine residues from PlexinB2 (Gln-1829 and -1830)
interact with the backbone carbonyls of Gly-86 and Asp-87 from
the PDZ domain. Ser-62 and Gln-70 from the PDZ domain
make polar interactions with the C terminus of the last helix in
the PlexinB2 GAP domain (Fig. 2B). Some of these interactions
may be mediated by hydrogen bonds, but are not assigned be￾cause of the moderate resolution of the structure.
The residues in PlexinB2 mediating the secondary interface
are conserved across class B plexins, but not among class A, C,
and D plexins (Fig. 2C). Ile-66 and Leu-68 in the PDZ domain of
PDZ–RhoGEF are replaced by a proline and phenylalanine
residue, respectively, in LARG, maintaining the hydrophobicity
(Fig. 2D). Other residues in the secondary interface are identical
between PDZ–RhoGEF and LARG from both human and
mouse (Fig. 2D). These residues, however, are not conserved in
PDZ domains from other proteins (Fig. 2D). These patterns of
sequence conservation suggest that class B plexins and PDZ–
RhoGEF/LARG have coevolved the secondary interface to en￾hance their mutual specificity, and the secondary interface is
functionally important.
Tight Binding Between PlexinB2cyto and the PDZ Domain from PDZ–
RhoGEF. By using fluorescence-based methods or isothermal ti￾tration calorimetry (ITC), several studies have determined the Kd
value between isolated C-terminal peptides from PlexinB1 and the
PDZ domain of PDZ–RhoGEF in the range of 30–36 μM under
various buffer conditions (24, 26). The PDZ domain of LARG
shows similar affinity to the tail peptide from PlexinB1 (24–26).
The peptides used in the studies of PDZ–RhoGEF included no
more than the C-terminal six residues of human PlexinB1, which
are identical to those in mouse PlexinB2. We analyzed the binding
between PlexinB2cyto and the PDZ domain of PDZ–RhoGEF
using ITC. PlexinB2cyto with the C-terminal four residues trun￾cated (ΔVTDL) showed no detectable binding to the PDZ do￾main, consistent with the notion that the VTDL motif is critical for
the interaction (Fig. 3). PlexinB2cyto binds the PDZ domain with a

BIOPHYSICS AND
COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGYKd value of 2 μM (Fig. 3), >10-fold tighter than that of the iso￾lated C-terminal motif. These results suggest that the secondary
interface as observed in our crystal structure substantially en￾hances the plexin/PDZ interaction.
Mutational Analyses of the Secondary Interface. To assess the
contribution of the secondary interface to the plexin/PDZ in￾teraction, we examined the effects of a series of mutations at
this interface by ITC. Three mutations—Y1806A, A1832E,
and A1833E—were introduced individually into PlexinB2cyto.
The Y1806A mutant displayed approximately twofold reduction
in binding (Kd = 3.7 μM) compared with the wild-type (WT)
PlexinB2cyto (Fig. 3). The A1832E and A1833E mutants showed
much weaker binding, with Kd values of 13 and 30 μM, respectively.
The A1833E mutation reduces the affinity to the reported level
of the isolated C-terminal peptide of PlexinB1, effectively elimi￾nating the contribution of the secondary interface. Tyr-1806 is lo￾cated at the periphery of the interface, and the alanine mutation
removes a portion of the hydrophobic interaction, but does not ste￾rically occlude binding. Introducing a charged and larger residue to
the hydrophobic core of the interface, as in the case of the A1832E
and A1833E mutations, however, disrupts the secondary interface.
The PDZ mutations also attenuated binding to various de￾grees, consistent with the features of the secondary interface.
The PDZ R88A mutant increased Kd by approximately threefold
to 6.4 μM (Fig. 3). Loss of the peripheral interaction between
Arg-88 in the PDZ domain and Asp-1807 in PlexinB2cyto is not
expected to actively disrupt the interface core or the ability of
other contacts to form. The R88E mutation, which introduces
charge/charge repulsion with Asp-1807 in PlexinB2cyto, reduced
the affinity by 20-fold (Kd = 40 μM). An alanine mutation of
Leu-68 in the PDZ domain, which docks into the hydrophobic
patch created by Ala-1832 and -1833 in PlexinB2cyto, reduces the
affinity by approximately fivefold. Mutating a peripheral hydro￾phobic residue in the PDZ domain, I66A, attenuated binding by
less than twofold. Together, these data demonstrate that the
secondary interface is responsible for the >10-fold tighter bind￾ing to the PDZ domain by PlexinB2cyto compared with the iso￾lated PDZ-binding motif.
Both Binding Interfaces Contribute to Recruitment of PDZ–RhoGEF by
Plexin. We have shown previously that the GEF activity of PDZ–
RhoGEF and its homologs can be facilitated by membrane re￾cruitment to membrane-delimited substrates such as RhoA (27)
and that this functional recruitment can mediate hormone sig￾naling in cells (28). In the reconstituted system, GEFs were
recruited to the surface of lipid vesicles that contained regulatory
partners and substrates tethered to the membrane surface
through interaction of polyhistidine tags with Ni–NTA-conjugated
lipids. We used this system to examine the interaction of full￾length PDZ–RhoGEF with PlexinB2cyto (Fig. 4 A–C). PDZ–
RhoGEF in solution displayed modest nucleotide exchange ac￾tivity toward RhoA tethered to lipid vesicles. Addition of His6–
PlexinB2cyto produced a concentration-dependent increase in the
exchange activity (Fig. 4 A and B), suggesting functional re￾cruitment of PDZ–RhoGEF by His6–PlexinB2cyto to membrane￾localized RhoA. Deletion of the C-terminal motif from PlexinB2
(ΔVTDL) eliminated the GEF activity increase (Fig. 4 B and C),
consistent with an anticipated reduction in the recruitment. We
further tested mutations in the secondary interface, two in the
PDZ domain (R88E and R88A) and two in PlexinB2cyto
(A1832E and A1833E). All four mutants attenuated the

RhoGEF (Fig. 4C). The partial reduction by the R88A mutation is
consistent with its more moderate effect on binding affinity
(Fig. 3). These results implicate both the primary and secondary
interfaces in the recruitment of PDZ–RhoGEF by plexin. The
sufficiency of this interaction is demonstrated by the recruitment
of a chimeric protein containing the PDZ domain of PDZ–
RhoGEF linked to an unrelated RacGEF, TRIO (triple func￾tional domain protein) (Fig. 4D). His6–PlexinB2cyto stimulates
nucleotide exchange of membrane delimited Rac1 by the chi￾meric PDZ–TRIO, but not TRIO alone.
Secondary Interface Contributes to Plexin-Mediated Activation of PDZ–
RhoGEF in Cells. Activation of class B plexins by semaphorin acti￾vates PDZ–RhoGEF and LARG, leading to increased levels of
GTP-bound RhoA in cells (12–17). To examine whether this plexin/
PDZ–RhoGEF-mediated activation of RhoA is dependent on
the secondary interface, we used a pull-down assay for quantifying
RhoA(GTP) levels in the cell (29). Full-length human PlexinB1,
which is nearly identical to mouse PlexinB2 in both the C-terminal
motif and the secondary interface, was used in these experi￾ments. Consistent with previous studies, the results show that
overexpression of PlexinB1 increased the levels of RhoA(GTP)
in HEK293T cells, which express PDZ–RhoGEF endogenously
(Fig. 5) (13, 18). RhoA activation was further enhanced by
semaphorin treatment. Deletion of the VTDL motif in PlexinB1
(ΔVTDL) abolished RhoA activation in the presence or absence
of semaphorin treatment. These results are also consistent with
previous studies (13, 14). We then tested the effects on RhoA
activation of the A2125E and A2126E mutations of PlexinB1,
equivalent to the secondary interface mutations A1832E and
A1833E of PlexinB2, respectively. These mutations both attenu￾ated RhoA activation, although the reduction was not as severe as
that caused by ΔVTDL (Fig. 5). Together, our data strongly support

Discussion
Protein interactions between modular domains, such as PDZ,
SH2, and SH3 domains, and linear binding motifs are a common
theme in biology (30). An established paradigm is that se￾quence variations of one or a few residues in the binding motifs
determine the specificity. However, modules of the same type
often show similar sequence preferences for the binding motifs,
and similar or identical motifs often exist in different proteins.
This paradigm is therefore inadequate for rationalizing the di￾verse yet specific interactions mediated by modular domains. In
the case of PDZ domains, binding motifs of different classes do
not always show large differences in affinity to cross-typed PDZ
domains. Extensive investigations, including large-scale peptide
library screening and bioinformatics analyses, have shown that
residues beyond positions 0 and −2 in PDZ binding motifs are
involved in fine-tuning the specificity (20, 21). Based on these
studies, as many as 16 classes have been defined to account for
the specificity profiles of PDZ domains (31). A recent study has
shown that the PDZ domain in the protein PALS1 forms a
structural supramodule with the SH3 and guanylate kinase do￾mains, with all of the three domains collectively contributing to
specific binding to the C terminus of its ligand crumbs (32).
The above analyses are largely limited to linear binding motifs.
Our finding of the secondary interface mediated by the folded
domains of PlexinB2 and PDZ–RhoGEF provides an addi￾tional dimension to the mechanism by which PDZ domains
achieve specificity. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that the
C-terminal SH2 domain in phospholipase Cγ forms a secondary
interface with the kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor re￾ceptor, in addition to the SH2/phosphoryl–peptide interaction
(33). Similar secondary interactions have also been seen for a
SH3 domain and a small GTPase (34, 35). The 3D domain-mediated
secondary interfaces may be broadly used by modular domains to
increase affinity and specificity, but are underappreciated because
they involve residues not adjacent in sequence to the binding motifs
and cannot be easily identified by sequence analyses. Structural

motifs are required to reveal such interactions.
It is unclear how the interaction between class B plexins and
PDZ–RhoGEF/LARG is regulated by semaphorin binding to
plexin. Before activation, plexin exists as an inactive monomer or
inhibitory dimer (3, 9, 36). Semaphorin binding induces the for￾mation of the active dimer of plexin (2, 4–7). PDZ–RhoGEF and
LARG also form dimers or oligomers through their C-terminal
coiled-coil region (37). The plexin active dimer and the PDZ–Rho￾GEF/LARG dimer may form a 2:2 complex (Fig. S3A). Alternatively,
dimeric PDZ–RhoGEF/LARG may bridge two copies of the plexin
dimer, leading to their clustering on the cell surface (Fig. S3B). The
dimerization/oligomerization may increase the avidity between plexin
and PDZ–RhoGEF/LARG. PDZ–RhoGEF and LARG both have
other domains that help target them to the plasma membrane, such
as the Pleckstrin-homology domain that interacts with GTP-bound
RhoA (38). These factors together may facilitate the interaction be￾tween plexin and PDZ–RhoGEF/LARG and thereby enhance their
ability to discriminate against nonspecific interactions.
