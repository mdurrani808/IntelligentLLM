The interactions between the Fab and single-chain Fv
(scFv) fragments of an antibody (NC10) and its antigen,
influenza virus neuraminidase, were analysed in the
crystal structures of the Fab–neuraminidase and scFv–
neuraminidase complexes. To investigate the contribution
to binding made by cavities, salt links and hydrogen bonds
in the antibody–antigen interface, 14 single amino acid
replacements were made at six contact residues in the scFv
fragment by site-directed mutagenesis. The binding affinity
of each mutant scFv antibody for neuraminidase was
determined with a BIAcore™ optical biosensor. Four of
the mutations resulted in large changes in the free energy
of binding to neuraminidase (∆∆G > 1 kcal/mol) and
together may account for ~70% of the free energy of
binding. Hence these data support the theory that a small
number of residues form the ‘functional epitope’ and are
most important for binding of NC10 to neuraminidase.
The salt link between antibody residue AspH56 and LysN432
from neuraminidase was demonstrated to be important
for affinity, since substitution of AspH56 with Asn caused a
large reduction in the free energy of binding (∆∆G J F2.8
kcal/mol). Hydrogen bonds provided by TyrL32 and AspH56
were also important for binding: mutation of TyrL32 to Phe
resulted in a significant reduction in binding affinity (∆∆G
J F1.7 kcal/mol). Disruption of hydrophobic interactions
(van der Waals contacts) led to significant reductions in
affinity also (TyrH99 to Ala, ∆∆G J F1.5 kcal/mol; LeuL94
to Ala, ∆∆G > F3.0 kcal/mol). An attempt to increase
binding affinity by filling a cavity in the interface with a
larger antibody side chain was unsuccessful, as the free
energy gained by new antibody–antigen interactions did
not compensate for the removal of cavity-bound water
molecules.

Introduction
Our understanding of the structural basis of antibody affinity
is based upon a data set of less than 20 antibody fragments
crystallized in a complex with protein antigens (Braden and
Poljak, 1995; Davies and Cohen, 1996). The interacting
antibody and antigen surfaces in these structures are comple￾mentary, both sterically (Lawrence and Colman, 1993) and
electrostatically (McCoy et al., 1997). Usually, 12–20 antibody

residues make contact with antigen over 600–900 Å of buried
molecular surface and water molecules are mostly excluded
from the interface. The stability of antibody–antigen binding
is mediated by 10–15 hydrogen bonds, up to three salt links
and numerous van der Waals interactions. The surfaces of
interaction of antibody and antigen are typical of protein–
protein interactions, with the exception of the unusually
high proportion of tyrosine residues in the complementarity￾determining region (CDR) loops of the antibody. As detailed
information about the molecular interactions between anti￾bodies and antigens is available, we can investigate the
following questions: is binding affinity dominated by a few
critical residues in the interface or does it result from combina￾tion of a large number of weak interactions? Which are the
most important interactions between antibody and antigen?
Are the predominant forces in binding enthalpic or entropic
and do the energetics of solvation play a major role?
Affinity maturation of antibodies by protein design involves
the replacement of antibody residues involved in binding
antigen, based on the structures of the antibody and antigen
both free and in a complex (Rees et al., 1994). Antibodies
with improved affinity have been made both by increasing the
size of the buried surface area and by increasing the number of
specific interactions at the antibody–antigen interface (Roberts
et al., 1987; Simon and Rajewsky, 1992; Rees et al., 1994).
The interaction between the monoclonal antibody NC10 and
the influenza virus glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) is a model
system for structure-based protein design. The crystal structures
of both the Fab–NA and scFv–NA complexes have been
refined to nominal resolutions of 2.5 and 3.0 Å, respectively
(Kortt et al., 1994; Malby et al., 1994). The scFv exhibits
both a similar binding affinity and a similar structure to that
of the parent Fab fragment of NC10 (Kortt et al., 1994). The
NC10 Fab–NA interface features 12 hydrogen bonds, a single
solvated salt link and numerous van der Waals interactions
(Malby et al., 1994). An attempt has been made to calculate
the contribution made by each residue towards the overall
free energy of binding (Tulip et al., 1994). However, these
calculations made a number of assumptions to formulate a
minimum empirical Gibbs free energy model and yield only
an estimate of the contribution of individual residues (Novotny,
1991). These results were compared with experimental binding
data based on mutations in NA (Nuss et al., 1993).
Our aim in this work was to provide experimental data on
the contribution towards binding NA of individual antibody
residues. To this end, this paper describes the design and
synthesis of 14 mutant NC10 scFvs, in which single amino
acid replacements were made in six contact residues by site￾directed mutagenesis. Five replacements were made at AspH56
in CDR H2, to evaluate the contribution provided by (a) a salt
link and (b) a hydrogen bond. A single residue in CDR L1
(
TyrL32) was replaced with phenylalanine to determine the
effect of removing a single hydrogen bond at this position.
Single replacements at TyrH99 and TyrH100a in CDR H3 wereD.A.Dougan et al.
designed to evaluate the destabilising effect of introducing a
cavity in the NC10 scFv–NA interface. Two replacements at
ThrL93 and four at LeuL94 in CDR L3 were designed to increase
shape complementarity (and thereby increase binding affinity)
by filling a cavity in the antibody–antigen interface. The
binding affinities of these mutant scFvs, to both the target
antigen NA and to an anti-idiotope antibody, were determined
from ELISA and BIAcore measurements.
Materials and methods
Sequence numbering and mutant nomenclature
Antibody residues were numbered according to Kabat et al.
(1991): residues in the heavy and light chain of the scFv are
prefixed with (H) and (L) respectively and residues in the
antigen NA prefixed with (N). Mutant scFvs are described
using the following nomenclature: TyrH99Ala denotes that
residue 99 of the VH domain (variable region from antibody
heavy chain), tyrosine in the wild-type NC10 scFv, has been
replaced with alanine.
Design of mutant scFvs
The coordinates of the NC10 Fab–NA complex (PDB entry
1NMB; Malby et al., 1994) were analysed with the graphics
program TURBO-FRODO (Roussel and Cambillau, 1989).
Fourteen mutant scFvs were designed, in which single amino
acid replacements were made at six contact residues (Table I;
Figure 1). The amino acid frequencies for murine antibodies
at each position to be mutated in NC10 were examined, to
avoid the introduction of evolutionarily rare residues (residues
with frequency ,1%; Table II; Kabat et al., 1991). For
example, AspH56 was substituted with conservative replace￾ments asparagine (8.1%) and glutamic acid (3.9%) and also
with the small residues serine (21.0%), alanine (4.2%) and
glycine (13.7%) since there was a strong bias against most
hydrophobic residues. Hydrophilic amino acids usually pre￾dominate at positions H99 and H100a, where the natural
frequency of tyrosine (which occupies these positions in NC10)
is 20.1 and 13.1%, respectively. Of the hydrophobic residues
suitable for substitution, alanine (2.6%) was chosen to replace
TyrH99 and phenylalanine (5.1%) to replace TyrH100a. At
position L32, the wild-type residue tyrosine (79.5%) was
replaced by phenylalanine (6.0%) to examine the effect of
removal of the hydrogen bond formed through the tyrosyl
hydroxyl. L93 is strongly biased against hydrophobic residues:
unlike all other positions examined in this study, this also
includes tyrosine. Consequently, the rarely observed phenyl￾alanine (0.2%) and tryptophan (0%) were chosen to replace
ThrL93. In contrast, LeuL94 showed a bias towards hydrophobic
residues and was replaced with tyrosine (19.6%), valine
(18.6%) and tryptophan (1.9%) in comparison with a small
residue replacement, alanine (1.0%).
Site-directed mutagenesis of antibody fragments
The DNA encoding the mutant scFvs was constructed by
overlap polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (SOE￾PCR; Horton et al., 1989) rather than by PCR mutagenesis of
the entire scFv gene (921 bp). Using SOE-PCR, two small
DNA fragments were first generated that overlapped at the
site of mutation. One fragment (A) was amplified from a
unique 59 restriction site to the site of mutation, whilst the
second fragment (B) was amplified from the site of mutation
to a unique 39 restriction site. The overlapping DNA segments
(A 1 B) were joined together into fragment C by splice

CDRs L1, L3, H2 and H3 make contact with antigen. The mutated residues
are coloured yellow: AspH56 in CDR H2 was replaced with Asn, Glu, Ser,
Ala and Gly to evaluate the contribution provided by a salt link and a
hydrogen bond; TyrL32 in CDR L1 was replaced with Phe to examine the
effect of removing a single hydrogen bond; TyrH99 and TyrH100a in CDR
H3 were mutated to Ala and Phe, respectively, to investigate the
destabilizing effect of introducing a cavity; ThrL93 was mutated to Phe and
Trp and LeuL94 was mutated to Tyr, Trp, Val and Ala in CDRL3 in an
attempt to increase shape complementarity and to fill a cavity.
A of AspH56Asn was amplified between the NdeI site in pPOW
and the mutation site using the primers N697 and N2133,
while fragment B of AspH56Asn was amplified between the
mutation site and the BstEII site using primers N2134 and
N2421. The primers (N2133 and N2134) introduced an XmnI
restriction endonuclease site at the site of mutation for positive
identification of the mutant clones. The two DNA fragments
67
were joined together by amplification using the outermost
primers (N697 and N2421) to produce a fragment of 483 bp
(fragment C). The NdeI–BstEII-digested PCR fragment C was
ligated into the likewise digested NC10 scFv/pPOW vector
and transformed into TOPP2™ Escherichia coli. Complete
nucleotide sequencing of the amplified region of each mutant
scFv gene was performed, to ensure that additional PCR￾induced changes had not been incorporated as a result of
polymerase infidelity.
Expression and purification of mutant scFvs
The mutant NC10 scFv constructs in pPOW were expressed
in TOPP2™ E.coli (Stratagene) by the method described
previously for the wild-type NC10 scFv (Malby et al., 1993;
Kortt et al., 1994). Expression was induced by raising the
temperature of the culture from 30 to 42°C for 15 min and
then maintaining it at 37–39°C for 4–6 h, to ensure the repressor
remained denatured during protein synthesis. Synthesized scFv
was recovered from insoluble periplasmic inclusion bodies by
solubilization in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride and purified
after refolding as described previously (Kortt et al., 1994),
except that affinity chromatography on an anti-FLAG M2
agarose column (Kortt et al., 1997a) replaced the ion-exchange
step used previously. Each mutant scFv was concentrated and
fractionated on Superdex 75 (HR10/30) in PBS at pH 7.4 to
remove higher molecular mass components, including dimers.
This procedure yielded pure scFv monomer with a molecular
mass of ~27 kDa. The purity of the scFvs was monitored by
SDS–PAGE (electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel
containing 1% SDS) and Western blot analysis as described
previously (Kortt et al., 1994). The concentration of each scFv
fragment was determined spectrophotometrically, using a value
for the extinction coefficient (ε0.1%) at 280 nm calculated
from the protein sequence (as described by Gill and von
Hippel, 1989).
Preparation of tern N9 NA and 3-2G12 anti-idiotope Fab9
NA was isolated from tern N9 influenza virus as a stable
tetramer of ~190 kDa following treatment of the virus with
pronase and purified by gel filtration as described previously
(McKimm-Breschkin et al., 1991). Monoclonal antibody
3-2G12, an anti-idiotope antibody to NC10 (Kortt et al.,
1997a,b), was digested with papain to yield F(ab9)2 fragments,
reduced to form Fab9 fragments and purified as a stable
monomer of ~50 kDa, as described by Gruen et al. (1993).
Determination of binding affinities of mutant scFvs
The BIAcore™ 1000 biosensor (Pharmacia Biosensors,
Uppsala, Sweden), was used to measure the binding kinetics
of the mutant scFvs as described by Kortt et al. (1997a,b).
NA was immobilized on to a CM5 sensor chip in 10 mM
sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, via amine groups using the
Amine Coupling Kit (Pharmacia Biosensors) as described
previously (Gruen et al., 1993). Binding measurements were
performed in HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl,
3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) at a constant
flow rate of 5 µl/min. Tetrameric NA (Mr 190 kDa) was
not stable to acidic regeneration conditions, so sequential
binding experiments were performed by first allowing com￾plete dissociation (~12 000 s) to occur in each binding experi￾ment. Although unstable under acidic conditions, NA was
found to be stable to prolonged exposure (>2 weeks) to the
HBS buffer at 25°C when immobilized on the sensor surface.
3-2G12 Fab9, the anti-idiotope of NC10, was immobilized atD.A.Dougan et al.

for each experiment by gel filtration on Superdex 75, to remove
dimer that may have formed upon storage. Binding data
for each mutant NC10 scFv were collected for a range of
concentrations (29–921 nM) and the kinetic constants, ka and
68

transformed as ln(dR/dt) versus time plots and the region
of linearity was chosen for further analysis. Fitting of the
experimental data by non-linear least-squares analysis (using
the single exponential form of the integrated rate equation in
BIAevaluation 2.1) and using a predetermined value of kd (see
below), directly yielded an apparent association rate constant,
ka (Figure 3A). The association rate constant was also deter￾mined by evaluating the pseudo-first-order rate constant (ks)
at a number of analyte concentrations (C) (as described in
BIAevaluation 2.1), followed by linear regression of a ks
versus C plot to determine ka (Figure 3B).
The dissociation phase data were analysed by non-linear
least-squares analysis using a single exponential form of the
rate equation (Figure 4A). The apparent dissociation rate
constant, kd, was also determined by logarithmic transformation
of the dissociation phase data [ln(R0/R) versus time; Figure
4B]. All scFv mutants showed considerable non-linearity with
an apparently faster initial dissociation rate (Figure 4B).
The equilibrium affinity constant, Ka(eq), was determined
from a plot of Req versus C according to the equation Req 5
KCRmax/KCn 11 (as described in BIAevaluation 2.1) or from
a linearized plot of Req/C versus Req, where Req is the response
at steady state. Representative plots for the Tyr100aPhe scFv
mutant are shown in Figure 5. The kinetically-determined
association binding constant (Ka5 ka/kd) and the equilibrium
binding constant [Ka(eq)] for each mutant scFv are summarized
in Table IV.
Results
Synthesis and purification of NC10 mutant scFvs
Fourteen mutant scFvs were produced, each with a single
amino acid replacement in a contact residue (Table I; Figure
1). The level of production of all NC10 mutant scFvs was
similar to that of the wild-type NC10 scFv (data not shown),
with accumulation in the periplasm of E.coli as insoluble
inclusion bodies (Malby et al., 1993). The scFvs were recovered
by a strategy of denaturation, refolding, affinity chromato￾graphy and size-exclusion chromatography (Kortt et al., 1994,
1997a). The mutant scFv monomers were stable for up to 28
days at 4°C at concentrations below 1 mg/ml, as indicated
by size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex-75 (data not

at concentrations above 1 mg/ml did the mutant scFvs exhibit
a tendency to form dimers in solution.
Analysis of mutant scFvs binding to NA
Sensorgrams of the binding to immobilized NA of five of
the eight active NC10 mutant scFvs (TyrL32Phe, AspH56Glu, LeuL94Val, TyrH99Ala, Tyr100aPhe) are illustrated in Figure 2. The
other six mutants (AspH56Ser,Ala,Gly, LeuL94Trp,Tyr,Ala) exhibited
no measurable binding activity to NA either by BIAcore
analysis or by ELISA. The loss of binding activity did not
appear to be due to incorrect folding of the mutant scFvs,
since all yielded stable monomers in solution and, more
significantly, bound to immobilized Fab9 fragments of anti￾idiotope IgG (3-2G12) with similar affinity to that of the wild￾type NC10 scFv by BIAcore analysis (data not shown). The
anti-idiotope 3-2G12 is known to bind only to correctly folded
NC10 scFv (Kortt et al., 1997a,b).
The apparent association and dissociation rate constants and
association constant (Ka 5 ka/kd) were determined for the
binding of each scFv mutant to immobilized NA and are
summarized in Table IV. In the analysis it was assumed that
each scFv mutant monomer was univalent and bound to the
epitope on each NA subunit in an independent, non-cooperativeD.A.Dougan et al.

manner. The binding data were analysed according to a 1:1
interaction model of the type A 1 B 5 AB. For most mutants,
including the example in Figure 3, a reasonably good fit to
the experimental data was observed, although the residuals for
these data have a magnitude greater than the noise level of
the instrument [61 RU (resonance unit)] and their distribution
is not completely random (not shown). Analysis of the dissoci￾ation phase data invariably resulted in a less than perfect fit
expected for a 1:1 interaction (Figure 4), which indicated that
the binding data may be influenced by the mass transport and
surface heterogeneity effects that are often observed in BIAcore
binding data (Kortt et al., 1997b; Oddie et al., 1997).
The equilibrium binding constants [Ka(eq)] evaluated from
values of Req (response at steady state) from a plot of Req
against C (as illustrated in Figure 5A for scFv mutant TyrL32Phe
and summarized in Table IV), were in reasonably good
agreement with the kinetically determined association binding
constants (Ka 5 ka/kd). Despite the deviations from the ideal
1:1 interaction model noted above, the comparison of apparent
rate constants and apparent affinity constants is valid, as the
binding of all NC10 scFv mutants was measured under the
same experimental conditions.
The binding constant for a mutant scFv was considered to
be significantly different from the wild-type binding constant

when the difference was greater than three times the standard
deviation of the wild-type scFv binding constant. Using this
criterion, the mutant scFvs exhibited either unchanged or
reduced binding constants compared with wild-type scFv.
Interestingly, the mutations had the greatest effect on dissoci￾ation rate (kd), which is in agreement with other mutational
studies of antibody CDR residues (Hawkins et al., 1993; Ito
et al., 1995).
Changes in binding energy (∆∆G; Table IV) were calculated
from the kinetically determined association constant, Ka (Table
IV) according to the following equation (e.g. for TyrL32Phe ):
∆∆G(
TyrL32Phe) 5 [–RTlnKd(wild-type NC10)] –
[–RTlnKd(
TyrL32Phe)]
where ∆G 5 the Gibbs free energy change (cal/mol), R 5 the
ideal gas constant (1.989 cal/K.mol), T 5 298 K and Kd 5
1/Ka. Using this equation, ∆∆G(
TyrL32Phe) 5 11.7 kcal/mol.
The binding constants of two mutant scFvs (ThrL93Phe and
ThrL93Trp) were essentially identical with that of wild-type
scFv (∆∆G 5 10.1 and 10.3 kcal/mol, respectively). Two
mutations (TyrH100aPhe and LeuL94Val) resulted in moderate
changes to the free energy of binding, ∆∆G 5 10.5 and
10.9 kcal/mol, respectively. Four mutations (TyrL32Phe, TyrH99Ala, AspH56Asn and AspH56Glu) resulted in severe changes
in binding free energy (∆∆G . 11.0 kcal/mol). Apart from
replacements at AspH56, the association rate constants wereSubstitutions in the binding surface of an antibody

The kinetic rate constants and binding affinity constants were determined in a BIAcore biosenor with immobilized tern N9 NA. The kinetic constants, ka and
kd, were evaluated from the association and dissociation phase data using the fitting procedures described in BIAevaluation 2.1. The affinity constants at
equilibrium [Ka(eq)] was determined from a plot of Req (response at steady state) against C (concentration of analyte) as described in BIAevaluation 2.1 (see
Figure 5A). The ∆∆G values were calculated from –RTlnKd (wild-type scFv) – (–RTlnKd (mutant scFv) as described in the text. Ka 5 ka/kd and Kd 5 1/Ka.

similar for all mutant scFvs, the largest change being a twofold
decrease for LeuL94Val (Table IV). In contrast, changes in the
dissociation rate of .10-fold were observed for mutants
TyrL32Phe, AspH56Glu and TyrH99Ala (Table IV). As noted above,
the modified rate constants were unlikely to have resulted
from major changes to protein folding or conformation, since
all mutants exhibited similar binding kinetics to an immobilized
anti-idiotope IgG (3-2G12) specific for the NC10 antibody
(data not shown).
Discussion
Energetic contribution provided by a salt link
Electrostatic interactions play an important role in protein
association and salt links contribute a considerable amount to
the free energy of binding (Davies and Cohen, 1996). For
example, the conservative replacement of Arg68 with lysine in
lysozyme, which removes a salt link, with HyHEL-5 Fab
reduces the binding affinity of HyHEL-5 by 1000-fold (∆∆G 5
14.1 kcal/mol; Chacko et al., 1995). The mutation was
restricted to the loss of a salt link since lost hydrogen bonds
were partly compensated for by the addition of a solvent water
molecule. These data are in agreement with the theoretical ∆G
of up to 14.5 kcal/mol for a hydrogen bond between charged
residues (Fersht et al., 1985).
Analysis of the refined crystal structure of the NC10 Fab–
NA complex at 2.5 Å (Malby et al., 1994) revealed that AspH56
makes a salt link with LysN432 (Table I). The distance between
AspH56 Oδ1 and LysN432 Nζ is 3.9 Å (Figure 6A), which is
approaching the upper limit for a salt link interaction (4.0 Å;
Tsai et al., 1996). The loss of this salt link, together with the
loss of two hydrogen bonds from SerN370 and SerN372 to
AspH56, completely abolished antigen binding when AspH56
was replaced with serine, alanine and glycine. Replacement
of AspH56 with the uncharged side chain of asparagine would
have prevented the formation of a salt link, yet presumably
would have preserved the two hydrogen bonds to AspH56 Oδ2
(Figure 6A). This mutation caused a 100-fold reduction in
binding affinity (Table IV), with a large (.100-fold) decrease
in the association rate and (surprisingly) only a slight decrease
in the dissociation rate (Table IV).
In an attempt to increase the strength of the salt link, AspH56
was replaced with glutamate. It was envisaged that this
replacement would bring the terminal side chain carboxyl
oxygen of GluH56 closer to LysN432 by up to 1.5 Å and thereby
increase the strength of the salt link. However, the AspH56Glu
71
mutant had ~40-fold lower binding affinity, owing primarily
to an increase (~20-fold) in the dissociation rate and a small
decrease (threefold) in the association rate. Although the
replacement of AspH56 with glutamate should have provided
the antibody with the ability to form a stronger salt link, the
larger size of the side chain may have introduced steric
conflicts at this position, which would offset any energetic
gains made through the increased proximity of the two
charged groups.
The charged side chain, AspH56, appears to make an
important contribution to binding, which is consistent with its
calculated contribution of ∆G 5 –7.0 kcal/mol (Tulip et al.,
1994). It is likely to be one of the critical residues in the
‘functional epitope’, which has been proposed to be dominated
by a few charged residues (Jin et al., 1992). Similar dominant
roles have been proposed for salt links in other protein–
protein complexes, e.g. Asp101 in the lysozyme–HyHEL-10
Fab complex (Novotny, 1991; Kam-Morgan et al., 1993) and
Glu65 and Glu174 in the interaction of human growth hormone
with its receptor (Cunningham and Wells, 1993).
Energetic contribution provided by an interface cavity
To evaluate the destabilizing effect of the introduction of an
interface cavity, TyrH99 and TyrH100a were replaced with
smaller hydrophobic residues (Figure 6B). These two
tyrosines, located in CDR H3, make a large contribution to
the accessible surface area buried by complex formation
(97 and 60 Å2, respectively); however, calculations have
attributed to them only a small contribution to the free energy
of binding [∆G(
TyrH99) 5 –1.3 kcal/mol and ∆G(
TyrH100a) 5
–0.8 kcal/mol; Tulip et al., 1994]. The replacement of TyrH99
with alanine would presumably introduce a cavity in the scFv–
NA interface, which could result in the loss of several van der
Waals contacts between TyrH99 and the NA residues IleN366
and AsnN400 (Figure 6B). Conversely, the conservative
substitution TyrH100aPhe was designed to cause minimal disrup￾tion in main chain conformation and to retain the hydrogen
bond between the main chain carbonyl oxygen of TyrH100a
and AsnN329 Nδ2 (Table I; Figure 6B). Both the mutations
TyrH99Ala and TyrH100aPhe significantly reduced the Gibbs
free energy of binding [∆∆G(
TyrH99Ala) 5 11.5 kcal/mol
and ∆∆G(
TyrH100aPhe) 5 10.5 kcal/mol; Table IV]. The
reduction in binding affinity in TyrH99Ala was mainly due to
an increase (12-fold) in the dissociation rate constant (kd 5
5.9310–2 s–1), whereas the reduced binding affinity of
TyrH100Phe was mainly due to a decrease (approximatelyD.A.Dougan et al.
Fig. 6. Atomic interactions at the antibody–antigen interface of the NC10 Fab–NA complex. (A) The salt link between AspH56 and LysN432 spans the 3.9 Å
between AspH56 Oδ1 and LysN432 Nζ. Two hydrogen bonds are also formed between AspH56, SerN370 and SerN372. AspH56 also makes van der Waals contacts
with TrpN403. (B) TyrH99 makes van der Waals contacts to IleN366 and AsnN400. TyrH100aPhe is involved in a hydrogen bond between its main chain O and AsnN329 Nδ2 and makes van der Waals contacts with IleN368 and AlaN369. (C) TyrL32 makes a single hydrogen bond between TyrL32 Oη and the main-chain
O of AspN330. It also makes van der Waals contacts with AsnN329 and AspN330. (D) ThrL93 makes extensive contacts with NA via residues Pr°N328, GlyN343
and AsnN344. In contrast, LeuL94 makes only limited contacts with NA, through van der Waals contact to the side chain of AlaN369 and a hydrogen bond to a
bound water molecule W302.
twofold) in the association rate constant (ka 5 8.83104
M–1s–1). These kinetic values agree with the calculated
contribution each of these residues makes towards binding
[∆G(
TyrH99) 5 –1.3 kcal/mol and ∆G(
TyrH100a) 5 –0.8 kcal/
mol; Tulip et al., 1994].
Energetic contribution provided by a hydrogen bond
Although hydrogen bonds are important in the formation of
protein–protein complexes, there are conflicting views regard￾ing the exact value of their energetic contribution (Fersht et al.,
1985; Murphy and Gill, 1991; Pace, 1992). In particular, water
molecules compete for hydrogen bonding sites and complicate
energetic calculations. From mutational analyses of tyrosyl–
tRNA synthetase and human growth hormone, it has been
estimated that the energy loss from the removal of a hydrogen
bond to an uncharged residue is 0.5–1.5 kcal/mol (Fersht et al.,
1985; Cunningham and Wells, 1993).
Four of the 12 antibody–antigen hydrogen bonds in the
72
NC10 Fab–NA complex occur through aromatic residues:
TyrH100a and PheL92 form hydrogen bonds via their main
chain carbonyl oxygens, whereas TyrH52 and TyrL32 form
hydrogen bonds through their side chain hydroxyl groups. Of
these four aromatic residues, Tulip et al. (1994) predicted
that PheL92 alone provided favourable energetics for binding
(∆Gresidue , –1 kcal/mol), whereas TyrH52 and TyrL32 provided
a small energetic penalty (∆Gresidue . 0 kcal/mol). When the
formation of the single hydrogen bond between TyrL32 Oη and
the main chain carbonyl oxygen of AspN330 (Table I; Figure 6C)
was prevented by replacement of TyrL32 with phenylalanine, the
reduction in binding energy was 1.7 kcal/mol, which is of the
magnitude expected for the loss of a single hydrogen bond to
an uncharged residue (Fersht et al., 1985). The TyrL32Phe
mutant was similar to the cavity-creating mutant (TyrH99Ala),
in that the change in binding affinity was largely due to a
large (12-fold) increase in the dissociation rate constant, with
only a small (1.4-fold) decrease in association rate constant.Substitutions in the binding surface of an antibody
Increasing surface complementarity by filling an existing
cavity
A cavity in the NC10 Fab–NA interface could be filled by
replacing residues lining the cavity wall (ThrL93 and LeuL94)
with aromatic residues (Figure 6D). ThrL93 forms extensive
contacts with NA, including five van der Waals contacts and
a single hydrogen bond between its Oγ1 and AsnN344 Nδ2
(Table I). In contrast, LeuL94 makes only limited contacts with
NA, through van der Waals contact to the side chain of
AlaN369. The effect of filling the cavity was compared between
two aromatic replacements at ThrL93Trp, Phe, two aromatic
replacements at LeuL94Trp, Tyr and two more conservative
substitutions LeuL94Val, Ala.
The replacement of ThrL93 with phenylalanine or
tryptophan had little effect on the Gibbs free energy of
binding [∆∆G(
ThrL93Phe) 5 10.1 kcal/mol and ∆∆G
(
ThrL93Trp) 5 10.3 kcal/mol, respectively]. It is likely that the
gain in binding energy as a result of filling a cavity with a
larger protein side chain compensated for the loss of the
single hydrogen bond, which agrees with the calculated
marginal contribution of the threonine side chain
[∆G(
ThrL93) 5 –0.1 kcal/mol; Tulip et al., 1994].
The replacement of LeuL94 with tyrosine or tryptophan, to
fill the cavity, or with alanine, to create a cavity, all abolished
binding affinity. Only the conservative replacement of LeuL94
with valine was tolerated, albeit with a significant (fourfold)
reduction in the Gibbs free energy [∆∆G(
LeuL94Val) 5 10.9
kcal/mol]. The apparent contribution of LeuL94 to the inter￾action with NA is significantly greater than estimated by Tulip
et al. (1994) of ∆G(
LeuL94) 5 0.0 kcal/mol.
There are four energetic effects to consider when using
aromatic residues to fill a solvent-filled cavity in a protein–
protein interface. The first is the gain in binding energy
achieved by burying a hydrophobic group instead of a hydro￾philic group in the interface. This additional hydrophobic
stabilization can be estimated by the increase in molecular
surface area: 20–30 Å2 for phenylalanine, which could result
in a decrease in ∆G of 0.5–0.7 kcal/mol and hence a three- to
fourfold increase in binding affinity. The second effect arises
from the torsional constraints on aromatic residues, which can
result in reduced loss of entropy upon complex formation,
compared with aliphatic residues or water molecules. The third
effect is the destabilization arising from the loss of hydrogen
bonds from replaced hydrophilic residues and/or ordered water
molecules. The fourth effect is the entropy gained by releasing
bound water molecules from the surface of the proteins upon
complex formation.
Malby et al. (1994) identified three fully buried water
molecules (W301, W302, W303) and four solvent-exposed
water molecules (W201, W229, W312, W317) that mediate
contacts between NC10 Fab and NA. Of the three fully buried
water molecules, two were located in the cavity in the vicinity
of ThrL93 and LeuL94. The inclusion of these water molecules
in the structure increased both the amount of the surface area
buried by complex formation and the shape complementarity
value (Sc; Lawrence and Colman, 1993) and also introduced
a solvent-mediated hydrogen bond between W302 and the
main chain nitrogen of LeuL94. In the case of mutations at
ThrL93 and LeuL94, it appears that the positive effects on
binding affinity achieved by improving shape complementarity
and increasing buried surface area by substitution with aromatic
residues were negated by the removal of these water molecules
73
in the interface. Furthermore, displacement of the water molec￾ules by filling the cavity with large hydrophobic residues
would have provided an added penalty through the loss of
solvent–protein hydrogen bonds.
It has been suggested that cavities devoid of water molecules
have a destabilizing effect on protein association (Amit et al.,
1986; Braden and Poljak, 1995). Similarly, water molecules
that fill an interface cavity may play a role in increasing the
complementarity between the two proteins (Bhat et al., 1994;
Malby et al., 1994). Studies on barnase (Serrano et al.,
1992), T4 lysozyme (Eriksson et al., 1992) and chymotrypsin
inhibitor-2 (Jackson et al., 1993) have shown that filling
interior hydrophobic cavities the size of one methylene group
can result in increases in the free energy of unfolding ranging
from 0.8 to 2.5 kcal/mol, with an average value of 1.3–1.5
kcal/mol per methylene group. Theoretically, it is possible to
stabilize a protein–protein interaction by a similar amount by
filling an interface cavity. However, since most antibody–
antigen associations are enthalpically driven (Braden and
Poljak, 1995), replacement of solvent-containing surface
cavities by larger amino acids could lead to significant energy
penalties if the loss of solvent–protein hydrogen bonds is not
compensated for by new protein–protein interactions.
The functional epitope and affinity maturation by rational
protein design
Functional studies on antibody–antigen complexes have indi￾cated that although the protein–protein interface is typically
composed of between 12 and 20 contact residues, only a few
residues (3–10) are necessary for tight binding (Novotny,
1991). The dominant role of a few key residues in the
functional epitope has also been observed in the interaction
between growth hormone and its receptor (Jin et al., 1992;
Clackson and Wells, 1995). Recently, Tomlinson et al. (1996)
speculated that the key functional residues in the centre of the
binding surface of the antibody would be selected initially
from the primary immune repertoire, followed by selection of
residues at the periphery by somatic hypermutation. Of the three
key functional residues identified in this study as accounting for
~70% of the free energy of binding, two are located at the
centre of the NC10 scFv binding surface (TyrL32 and TyrH99)
and AspH56, which participates in the only antibody–antigen
salt link, is located towards the periphery of the antibody’s
binding site (Figure 1).
Substituting residues that increase either the strength or
number of specific interactions at the interface can lead to
improved binding affinity (Roberts et al., 1987; Rees et al.,
1994). However, replacement of individual contact residues
on either the antibody or the antigen usually reduces or
abolishes affinity and this information can be used to map the
functional epitope (Denzin et al., 1993; Kam-Morgan et al.,
1993; Nuss et al., 1993; Rumbley et al., 1993). The sequential
replacement of residues by alanine, thereby removing inter￾actions beyond that of the β-carbon, has been used to determine
the functional determinants of at least ten different protein–
protein or enzyme–substrate complexes (Wells, 1991). Non￾contact residues may also provide a valuable contribution to
binding. The replacement of a non-contact residue (VH52) in
the anti-digoxin antibody 26-10 dramatically decreased its
affinity for digoxin (Schildbach et al., 1993). Hawkins et al.
(1993) showed that both contact and non-contact residues of
the antibody D1.3 affected the affinity of binding to lysozyme
and the replacement of several non-contact residues in D1.3D.A.Dougan et al.
resulted in a fivefold improvement in affinity. Replacement of
non-contact residues at the periphery of the combining site
has produced small changes in binding affinity: a threefold
increase in the affinity of an anti-2-phenyloxazolone antibody
was made by replacing a charged side chain in a non-contact
region of the antibody binding site (Riechmann et al., 1992).
Likewise, an eightfold increase in affinity was produced by
the removal of two charged residues at the periphery of the
combining site (Roberts et al., 1987). Moreover, the replace￾ment of critical framework residues of several humanized
antibodies has restored the original affinity of the murine
antibody (Tempest et al., 1991). Presumably, non-contact
residues modulate antibody affinity through their influence
upon the packing of contact residues.
Generally, the structure-based or ‘rational’ design approach
to affinity enhancement has failed to produce spectacular
improvements in affinity. There are several reasons for this
lack of success, each highlighting our limited understanding
of the rules that govern the association of proteins with each
other. More specifically, (a) increasing the affinity of murine
monoclonal antibodies is inherently difficult, as these antibod￾ies have a high affinity already and have also undergone some
degree of somatic maturation; (b) the structures of antibody–
antigen complexes may not be determined at a high enough
resolution to determine accurately important details such as
the side chain conformations, hydrogen-bonding patterns and
the positions of water molecules; (c) where mutations have
been designed using structures of free, rather than complexed,
forms of the proteins, it is difficult to predict whether a given
mutation will result in a conformational change upon complex
formation [such changes have been noticed in the binding of
antibodies to small peptides and haptens (Herron et al., 1991;
Rini et al., 1992; Stanfield et al., 1993)]. Until these factors
are addressed and understood, random mutagenesis and selec￾tion from bacteriophage display libraries will continue to be a
more effective approach for the generation of antibodies with
improved binding properties (Burton and Barbas, 1994; Winter
et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1995; Irving et al., 1996).
