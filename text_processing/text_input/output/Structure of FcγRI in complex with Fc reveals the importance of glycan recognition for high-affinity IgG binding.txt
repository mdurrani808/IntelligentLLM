Fc gamma receptor I (FcγRI) contributes to protective immunity
against bacterial infections, but exacerbates certain autoimmune
diseases. The sole high-affinity IgG receptor, FcγRI plays a signifi￾cant role in immunotherapy. To elucidate the molecular mecha￾nism of its high-affinity IgG binding, we determined the crystal
structure of the extracellular domains of human FcγRI in complex
with the Fc domain of human IgG1. FcγRI binds to the Fc in a similar
mode as the low-affinity FcγRII and FcγRIII receptors. In addition to
many conserved contacts, FcγRI forms additional hydrogen bonds
and salt bridges with the lower hinge region of Fc. Unique to the
high-affinity receptor-Fc complex, however, is the conformation of
the receptor D2 domain FG loop, which enables a charged KHR
motif to interact with proximal carbohydrate units of the Fc gly￾cans. Both the length and the charge of the FcγRI FG loop are well
conserved among mammalian species. Ala and Glu mutations of
the FG loop KHR residues showed significant contributions of His￾174 and Arg-175 to antibody binding, and the loss of the FG loop–
glycan interaction resulted in an ∼20- to 30-fold decrease in FcγRI
affinity to all three subclasses of IgGs. Furthermore, deglycosyla￾tion of IgG1 resulted in a 40-fold loss in FcγRI binding, demonstrat￾ing involvement of the receptor FG loop in glycan recognition.
These results highlight a unique glycan recognition in FcγRI func￾tion and open potential therapeutic avenues based on antibody
glycan engineering or small molecular glycan mimics to target
FcγRI for certain autoimmune diseases.

gGs and pentraxins are circulating immune components that
directly recognize pathogens. On formation of immune com￾plexes or opsonization, they activate cellular response through Fc
receptors (FcRs) (1, 2). The FcRs for IgGs include FcγRI (CD64);
FcγRII (CD32) with A, B, and C isoforms; and FcγRIII (CD16)
with two isoforms (3). Most of these are activating receptors either
containing an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based ac￾tivation motif or associated with an FcR common γ chain (4).
FcγRIIB is an inhibitory receptor that contains an intracellular
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. FcγRIIIB does
not have a cytosolic domain and is anchored to the plasma mem￾brane through glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage. The binding
affinity to IgG ranges from 10−8 M for FcγRI to 10−5
–10−7 M
for FcγRII and III (3).
FcγRI plays an important role in the protection against bac￾terial infections, but also exacerbates certain autoimmune dis￾eases (5). Owing to its high-affinity antibody binding, FcγRI is
important in antibody therapy as well (6, 7). To date, the
structure of the ligand-bound high-affinity receptor has not been
determined, however. Consequently, the mechanism of its high￾affinity antibody recognition remains to be elucidated. The role
of glycan in antibody function has been a subject of intense study.
Differential glycosylation of Fc, notably fucosylated Fc, is known
to affect Fc receptor binding (8, 9). Furthermore, sialylated IgGs
have been shown to be anti-inflammatory components of in￾travenous immunoglobulin (10, 11), and glycosylation affects
their binding to the low-affinity FcγRIIB and FcγRIII (11–13).
Structural evidence suggests that the conserved glycosylation at
Asn-297 of the constant region of IgG1 is important to maintain
the conformation of Fc for receptor binding (12, 14). Whether Fc
receptors make significant glycan contacts for their IgG affinity is
not clear, however.
Structures of the low-affinity Fcγ receptors have been de￾termined with bound IgG-Fc (15–18). Unlike the other two￾domain FcγRs, FcγRI contains three extracellular Ig-like domains,
designated D1, D2, and D3. Earlier mutational analysis suggests
that D2 and D3 domains are important to confer high-affinity
antibody binding (19). Recently, the structure of human FcγRI
showed a close packing of the FcγRI D1 and D2 domains re￾sembling that of FceRI, and mutations in the FG loop of the
FcγRI D2 domain reduced its IgG binding affinity (20). The
mechanism of the high-affinity FcγRI ligand recognition remains
unresolved. To provide further insight into the high-affinity anti￾body recognition by FcγRI, and to facilitate the development of
FcγRI-mediated immunotherapy, we determined the structure of
the extracellular domains of human FcγRIA in complex with the
Fc domain of human IgG1. Our study identifies a structural
mechanism for high-affinity IgG binding by the receptor.

Significance
Fc gamma receptor I (FcγRI) contributes to protective immunity
against bacterial infections, but exacerbates certain autoim￾mune diseases. It is the sole high-affinity receptor for IgG and
plays a significant role in immunotherapy. To date, there is no
structural information available on how the receptor recog￾nizes its antibody ligands, however. Consequently, the mech￾anism of its high-affinity IgG binding remains unclear. We
report the first structure of the high-affinity Fc receptor in
complex with IgG-Fc. The structural work reveals a direct re￾ceptor recognition of Fc glycan as a major factor in receptor
affinity. This is the first example of Fc receptor making direct
glycan contact through protein residues. The results have
implications for the use of glycan engineering in immu￾notherapy.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATIONpurified using sequential Ni-NTA and IgG1 affinity columns.
Human IgG1-Fc (residues 216–446) was expressed in stable
transfected CHO cells (7). The FcγRI and IgG1-Fc complex was
crystallized in a P1 space group and diffracted to 3.5-Å resolu￾tion. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement
method using Phaser and refined using Phenix to final R factors
of 0.245 for Rcryst and 0.295 for Rfree (Table S1).
There are two complexes in each crystallographic unit cell.
Electron densities are well defined for the two N-terminal
domains of the receptor and for both chains of Fc (Fig. S1). The
densities for the C-terminal D3 domain of FcγRI are less well
defined, indicating flexibility in the receptor D3 domain orien￾tation. The conformation of the Fc-bound FcγRI is essentially
identical to that of the ligand-free receptor, resulting a root
mean square difference (rmsd) of 0.7 Å among all Cα atoms. The
human IgG1-Fc (residues 224–446) contains the lower hinge
peptide (Cys-229–Pro-238), Cγ2 (Ser-239–Lys-338) and Cγ3
(Ala-339–Gly-446) domains. Both the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains of
Fc have well defined electron densities, including the glycosyla￾tion associated with Asn-297. The overall conformation of Fc
resembles that of FcγRIII bound Fc with a small but asymmetric
rotation induced by the bound receptor to the Cγ2 domains,
resulting in a loss of the twofold symmetry observed in the
receptor-free Fc structure.
FcγRI bound to the lower hinge region of the Fc with its D1
and D2 domains resembling the conformation of the two-domain
FcγRII, FcγRIII, and FceRI ligand complexes (15–17, 21) (Fig.
1). Except for a ∼10° rotation in the Cγ2 domains of each Fc to
accommodate receptors, the entire complexes are superimpos￾able, resulting in an rmsd of 1.0 Å between FcγRI-Fc and FcγRII
and an rmsd of 1.3 Å between FcγRI-Fc and FcγRIII. The
FcγRI-Fc complex buries a total solvent-accessible surface area
of 2,161 Å2
, significantly greater than the 1,800 Å2 buried in the
low-affinity receptor-Fc complexes (15). Previous work has sug￾gested the importance of FcγRI D3 domain in IgG binding (19).
The D3 domain is not in direct contact with Fc in the current
complex structure; however, the receptor D3 domain packs
against the D2 domain, forming a hydrophobic hinge core, sug￾gesting that the D3 domain is important for maintaining receptor
conformation and stability.
Interface of FcγRI with the Lower Hinge Fc Region Is Conserved. The
interface between the receptor and the two Fc chains can be
divided into three regions: between the FcγRI D2 domain
C-strand (Tyr-133–Leu-136), C′-strand (Lys-142–His-148),
and C′E loop (His-148–Trp-149) and the lower hinge region
from the Fc A-chain; between the receptor D1-D2 interdomain
hinge (Arg-102–Trp-104), D2 domain BC loop (Trp-127–Tyr-133),
and lower hinge from the Fc B-chain; and between the FcγRI D2
domain FG loop (Met-171–Tyr-176) and the Fc glycans.
At the Fc A-chain lower hinge region, the receptor contacts are
primarily salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Specifically, Lys-142
and Lys-145 of FcγRI form two pairs of salt bridges with Fc
residues, Glu-294 and Glu-269, respectively (Fig. 2A). Both lysine
residues are also present in the low-affinity FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB,
and FcγRIII (Fig. 2C). Two hydrogen bonds are observed, be￾tween Asn-134 of the receptor and Asp-265 of Fc and between
His-148 of the receptor and the carbonyl group of Gly-236 of Fc.
Asn-134 is replaced with a Lys in the low-affinity Fcγ receptors.
His-148 is conserved in FcγRIIA and FcγRIII, but replaced with

form van der Waals interactions with the lower hinge LLGG
motif of Fc (15). The majority of FcγRI contacts with the A chain
of Fc are preserved in the low-affinity Fcγ receptors. Likewise,
Asp-265, Glu-269, and Glu-294 are conserved among subclasses
of IgGs.
At the Fc B-chain interface, FcγRI forms primarily van der
Waals interactions with the Fc (Fig. 2B). Trp-104 and Trp-127
from FcγRI form a hydrophobic cluster with a pair of conserved
leucine and proline residues, Leu-328 and Pro-329, from the Cγ2
domain of the Fc. This cluster, also referred to as a Trp-Pro-Trp
sandwich, is present in all low- affinity receptor complexes, in￾cluding that of the IgE-Fc-FceRI complex (15, 16, 21). Unique to
FcγRI is a hydrogen bond between Arg-102 of the receptor and
the carbonyl group of Pro-329 of Fc. A second hydrophobic
cluster is observed between the side chains of Lys-130, Leu-131,
and Tyr-133 of FcγRI and the lower hinge residues Leu-234 and
Leu-235 of the Fc. This second hydrophobic cluster is smaller in
the low affinity receptor-Fc complexes as both Leu-131 and Tyr￾133 of FcγRI are replaced by smaller Pro, Ala, Val, and His
residues in FcγRII and FcγRIII. Tyr-133 also forms a hydrogen
bond with Glu-233 of Fc-B. Glu-233 is conserved in IgG1, IgG3,
and IgG4 but is replaced by a Pro residue in IgG2, suggesting
that the lack of this Glu-233–Tyr-133 hydrogen bond in IgG2
contributes to its lower receptor binding affinity. Interestingly,
this hydrogen bond is absent in FcγRIIA because the receptor
contains a Val-133 in place of Tyr, suggesting that FcγRIIA is
less discriminative against IgG2 (22–24). As noted previously,
other residues at the lower hinge of IgG2 also differ from those
of IgG1 and may affect its receptor binding affinity (15).
The FcγRI D2 Domain FG Loop Forms Unique Contacts with Fc Glycan.
The third interface is from the receptor D2 domain FG loop,
171MGKHRY176, to Fc and its associated glycan. In particular,
Lys-173 of the receptor forms a salt bridge with a conserved Asp￾265 on the B-chain of Fc (Fig. 3A). A similar salt bridge is
present between the Asp-265 on the B-chain of Fc and Lys-120
on the C-strand of FcγRIII in the low-affinity receptor complex
structure (15); however, Lys-120 of FcγRIII is not conserved in
FcγRI and is replaced by an asparagine. Instead, Lys-173 of
FcγRI serves as a surrogate salt bridge partner.
His-174 and Arg-175 of the receptor extend into the Fc
opening toward the glycans, such that their closest contacts are
the carbohydrates attached to Asn-297. The His-174 side chain is
close to the C4 hydroxyl group on a branched mannose. Both
Lys-173 and His-174 are close to the glycan attached to the
B-chain of Fc. The side chain of Arg-175 is located within hy￾drogen-bonding distance to the O3-hydroxyl of the first N-acetyl
glucosamine (GlcNAc) and to the O6-hydroxyl of the second

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATIONGlcNAc attached to the A-chain of Asn-297 (Fig. 3A). Thus, the
FG loop links glycans from both chains of Fc. Interestingly, all
three FG loop residues contact the proximal rather than distal
carbohydrate units of the Fc glycan, suggesting that the receptor
interacts with the conserved and less flexible part of the glycan.
This is also consistent with the finding that EndoS-treated IgG1,
which leaves the first GlcNac and its associated branched core
fucose, retains better FcγRI binding than IgG1 treated with
peptide-N-glycosidase F, which removes all glycan attached to
Asn-297 (23).
In comparison, the D2 domain FG loops of the low-affinity
FcγRs are 8–10 Å away from the Fc glycans and make little
contact with Fc, except for a hydrogen bond between the FcγRIII
FG loop Lys Nζ and the backbone carbonyl of the lower hinge
Gly-236 on Fc (Fig. 3B) (15, 17, 25). Whereas the FcγRI contacts
to both hinge A and hinge B of Fc are largely conserved in the
low-affinity Fcγ receptors, the contacts from the FG loop of
FcγRI are unique to the high-affinity receptor, because the FG
loop KHR motif is not conserved in other Fcγ receptors, except
for the presence of a Lys in FcγRIII in the His-174 position of
FcγRI (Fig. 2C).
Structural Mechanism for High-Affinity FcγRI Binding to Fc. Although
the overall receptor-ligand docking mode is similar in all Fcγ
receptors, FcγRI is the sole high-affinity receptor for monomeric
IgG. Two of the three FcγRI-Fc contact sites involve receptor
residues interacting with the lower hinge regions of the Fc
chains. Both the hinge A and hinge B contacts are quite con￾served in the low-affinity FcγRII and FcγRIII ligand complexes,
suggesting that they are the critical contacts to define the com￾mon FcγR receptor and IgG binding mode. Interestingly, FcγRI
forms a more extensive hydrophobic contact at hinge B, thus
favoring its binding to IgG. In contrast, the interface between the
FG loop of FcγRI and IgG is unique to the high-affinity receptor.
The equivalent receptor FG loops in the low-affinity receptor￾ligand complexes do not form significant contacts to Fc.
The importance of the FG loop to high-affinity receptor-IgG
binding was demonstrated in previous mutational work (26).
Placement of the FG loop of FcγRI into FcγRIII resulted in
a 15-fold increase in IgG binding affinity, and the mutant
FcγRIII bound to IgG only fivefold weaker than FcγRI. As noted
previously, the FG loop of FcγRI is one residue shorter than the
FG loops of other Fcγ receptors (Fig. 2); however, this affinity
increase is lost when a Val is inserted into the FG loop to match
the length of those in the low-affinity Fcγ receptors. Structurally,
this shorter FG loop of FcγRI is positioned ∼5 Å closer to the
glycan in the center of the horseshoe opening than that of
FcγRIII (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the D2 domain FG loop of
FcγRI is the most positively charged FG loop among all three
Fcγ receptors, owing to the presence of the KHR motif (Fig. 3C).
To further address the significance of a shorter but positively
charged FG loop to the high-affinity Fcγ receptor, we compared
the length and the number of charged residues present in the FG
loop sequences among homologous Fcγ receptors in mammalian
species with Lys, Arg, and His each as +1 and Asp and Glu each
as −1. The sequences of majority homologous FcγRI receptors
have six amino acid FG loops and carry +2 or +3 charges (Fig.
3D). In contrast, most of the D2 domain FG loops in all ho￾mologous low-affinity receptors are seven residues long. The FG
loop sequences of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB carry +1 or less charge,
whereas those of FcγRIII carry 0 to +2 charges, with majority +1.
Furthermore, the D1 domain FG loop of FcγRI is also longer
and carries a −1 net charge, similar to the corresponding loops in
the low-affinity receptors. Thus, the shorter and positively
charged FG loop is a unique feature of the high-affinity receptor.
Structurally, the shorter FG loop enables it to move closer to￾ward the Fc glycans and to adopt a glycan binding conformation.
Mutations in the FG Loop of FcγRI Reduce Its IgG Binding Affinity. To
further investigate the contribution of the FG loop KHR motif to
high-affinity receptor-IgG binding, we generated both single and
triple alanine mutations of the KHR motif and measured the
mutant receptor binding affinities to all three subclasses of IgGs.
K173A and H174A mutant FcγRI exhibited only minor reduc￾tions in their binding affinities (twofold to fivefold) to IgG1,
IgG3, and IgG4 (Table 1). In contrast, R175A mutation, the most
disruptive mutant, resulted in ∼20 fold reductions to IgG1, IgG3,
and IgG4 binding. The triple AAA mutant (K173A/H174A/
R175A) bound to all three IgGs with 0.18–0.3 μM affinity, sim￾ilar to that of R175A.

4 of 6 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1418812112 Lu et al.To evaluate the effect of charge contribution to FcγRI and
IgG binding, we replaced the positively charged KHR each with
a negatively charged Glu in the FG loop. K173E and R175E
resulted in mild reductions (threefold to 10-fold) in IgG affinity.
In contrast to the Ala mutants, R175E is the least disruptive
among the three mutations, and H174E is the most disruptive,
with 15- to 30-fold reductions in IgG binding affinities. The
differential mutational effects on IgG binding, in which Glu is
the most disruptive at residue 174 and Ala is the least favored at
position 175, suggest that charge interaction is more important to
H174, whereas hydrogen bond interaction is more important to
R175. Both Ala and Glu mutations showed that glycan contact
by the FG loop contributes 20- to 30-fold in receptor-IgG
binding affinity, consistent with the earlier results from the FG
loop swapping (26).
To further investigate the interaction of glycan with the FG
loop, we measured FcγRI binding to IgG1 treated with peptide￾N-glycosidase F. Removal of the Fc glycan reduced receptor
binding to 0.35 μM, a 40-fold decrease in affinity. The greater
loss in IgG1 binding affinity by FcγRI deglycosylation compared
with the R175A, H174E, and AAA mutations is likely related to
an additional conformational destabilization in Fc as the result
of glycan removal (12, 14). Thus, both the receptor mutations
and glycan removal resulted in a loss of binding affinity, dem￾onstrating the specific glycan binding by the FG loop KHR motif
of FcγRI. Given that deglycosylation reduced the IgG1 binding
affinity of FcγRI to a level comparable to that of the lower￾affinity Fcγ receptors, it is conceivable that the receptor can still
recognize aglycosylated IgG in the context of multivalent im￾mune complexes (23).
Potential Contribution of Fucosylated and Sialylated Fc Glycan to
FcγRI Binding. Even though the electron densities at the current
resolution of the complex contain significant ambiguities, there
are sufficient densities for much of the Fc glycan, although the
proximal carbohydrates are better defined than the distal car￾bohydrate units. The N-linked glycans associated with Asn-297
are fucosylated biantennaed complex glycans. Receptor glyco￾sylation on Asn-162 of FcγRIIIA was observed to interact with
nonfucosylated glycan to stabilize the receptor complex, sug￾gesting that a fucosylated glycan may inhibit such interaction (9,
18). Because Asn-162 is not present in FcγRI, the potential role
of the branched fucose associated with the Asn-297 of Fc must
be different for the high-affinity receptor. On both Fc chains, the
branched fucose units form van der Waals contacts with Tyr-296
of Fc. On both Fc chains, the glycans extend along the Fc pep￾tide, making multiple hydrogen bonds and van der Waals con￾tacts with the Cγ2 domain residues, including Phe-241, Phe-243,
Arg-301, and Lys-334 (Fig. 4). These interactions help reduce
the conformational flexibility of the glycan. The direction of the
glycan points from Asn-297 toward the Cγ3 domain of its Fc. The
terminal sialic acid is visible only on one chain (Fig. 4), and is
located close to hydrogen bonding distance to the side chain of
Ser-375 and Asp-376 from the Cγ3 domain of Fc, suggesting that
sialylated glycans may reduce glycan conformational flexibility by
contacting the Cγ3 domain of Fc.
In summary, the structure of the high-affinity human FcγRI
bound to IgG1-Fc illustrates both a conserved receptor recogni￾tion to the lower hinge region of Fc that defines the common
Fcγ receptor-IgG binding mode and a unique FcγRI FG loop
interaction with Fc and its glycans that contributes to receptor
high-affinity IgG binding. The contribution of Fc glycan to FcγRI
high-affinity ligand binding opens potential new avenues in im￾munotherapy to apply glycan engineering in targeting FcγRI to
achieve desired antibody efficacy. It also raises the possibility of
using small-molecular glycan-based compounds or mimics to tar￾get FcγRI as effective treatment for certain autoimmune diseases.
Materials and Methods
Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization. The ectodomain of FcγRI
(residues 16–289) was engineered with 19 mutations as described previously,
including T20P, T25K, T38S, L46P, T63I, S69T, R71H, V77E, N78D, I100V, F114L,
T160M, N163S, N195T, N206T, L207P, N240D, L283H, and L285Q. This engi￾neered FcγRI ectodomain was synthesized and cloned into a pET26b vector by
gene synthesis (Genscript), solubly expressed in E. coli cells, and purified via
Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by IgG affinity chromatography.
The purified FcγRI from E. coli bound to human IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 with nM
affinities similar to those from recombinant mammalian expressed FcγRI
(Table 1). Human IgG1-Fc protein (216–444) was expressed in CHO DXB-11 cells.
The human tissue plasminogen activator prepro secretion signal sequence
was used to direct secretion of the IgG1-Fc.
The recombinant Fc was purified by a protein A affinity column, followed by
a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mM sodium
phosphate and 109 mM sodium chloride pH 7.3. The final product was filtered
through a 0.22-μm syringe filter, aliquotted into polypropylene vials, and
stored at below −60 °C. Purified IgG1-Fc was verified by N-terminal sequencing,
was at least 95% pure, and contained <0.27 endotoxin units/mg. Before
crystallization, FcγRI was mixed with Fc dimer at a 1.2:1 molar ratio, and the
FcγRI-Fc complex was further purified by gel filtration chromatography in
10 mM Hepes (pH7.4) and 0.15 M NaCl. The crystals used for data collection
were grown in hanging drops at 22 °C using 1 μL of protein with a final
OD280nm of 6.7 and 1 μL of reservoir solution (10% PEG 8000, 10 mM Hepes

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATIONpH 7.5, and 50 mM Li2SO4). Human plasma IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 were pur￾chased from Athens Research & Technology.
Diffraction Data Collection and Structure Determination. The crystals were
immersed in cryoprotectant (20% PEG 8000, 10 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 50 mM
Li2SO4, and 15% glycerol) before being flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Five
X-ray datasets were collected to 3.5-Å resolution at SER-CAT beamlines,
processed, and merged with HKL2000 (27) (Table S1). FcγRI-Fc complex
crystals belong to space group P1 with a pseudomerohedral twofold twin￾ning. The structure of the FcγRI-Fc complex was solved by a molecular re￾placement method with Phaser (28) in the CCP4 package (29) using FcγRI
(PDB ID code 3RJD) and Fc (PDB ID code 3AY4), respectively, as the search
model. Model building and refinement were carried out using Coot (30) and
Phenix (31) with noncrystallography symmetry (NCS) restraints and the twin
law of (−h, −k, l). The overall electron density of the complex is of decent
quality (Fig. S1).
Carbohydrate molecules were added manually using (2Fo-Fc) electron
density maps contoured at 1.0σ (SD of the map) and refined. The residues
are numbered consistent with FCGR1_HUMAN in the Swiss-Prot entry. The
final model includes two FcγRI-Fc complexes (PDB ID code 4X4M). The
Ramachandran statistics were generated and verified by Procheck of CCP4.
Hinge angles were calculated using HINGE (32), and the buried surface area
was calculated using the CCP4 package. The electrostatic charges were
converted from atom coordinates using the PDB2PQR server with the
CHARMM force field and calculated by APBS and displayed between –50 and
50 kT/e (33). All structure figures were generated with Pymol (34).
Site-Directed Mutagenesis of FcγRI. FcγRI D2 domain FG loop (171MGKHRY176)
mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange
II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. A total of eight mutants were generated, including three single
Ala mutations (K173A, H174A, and R175A), a triple AAA mutant (K173A/
H174A/R175A), three single Glu mutations (K173E, H174E, and R175E), and
a triple EEE mutant (K173E/H174E/R175E). All mutations were confirmed by
DNA sequencing (ACGT Inc.). The mutated FcγRI proteins were expressed as
WT as described above and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography.
Surface Plasmon Resonance Solution Binding Experiments. Surface plasmon
resonance measurements were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument
and analyzed with BIAevaluation 4.1 software (GE Healthcare). Different
human IgG subclasses were obtained from Athens Research & Technology.
For measuring the affinity to WT or mutant FcγRI proteins, human IgG1,
IgG3, and IgG4 were immobilized on Biacore carboxylated dextran CM5 chips
(GE Healthcare) to 200–1,000 response units using primary amine coupling in
10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0). The analytes consisted of serial dilutions of
WT or mutant FcγRI proteins between 2 μM and 63 nM in a buffer containing
10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.15 M NaCl. The dissociation constants were
obtained by kinetic curve fitting for the binding of FcγRI to IgG, and steady￾state fitting for the binding of FcγRI mutants to IgG, using BIAevaluation 4.1
software. IgG1 (100 μg) was treated with 2,500 U of peptide-N-glycosidase F
(New England Biolabs) in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 3 h
to remove the glycan on Fc. Representative binding sensorgrams are shown
in Fig. S2.
