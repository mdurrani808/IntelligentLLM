Interaction between the mammalian cell polarity proteins mInsc
(mammalian homologue of Inscuteable) and Leu-Gly-Asn repeat￾enriched protein (LGN), as well as that between their respective
Drosophila homologues Inscuteable and Partner of Inscuteable
(Pins), plays crucial roles in mitotic spindle orientation, a process
contributing to asymmetric cell division. Here, we report a crystal
structure of the LGN-binding domain (LBD) of human mInsc com￾plexed with the N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs of
human LGN at 2.6-Å resolution. In the complex, mInsc-LBD adopts
an elongated structure with three binding modules—an α-helix, an
extended region, and a β-sheet connected with a loop—that runs
antiparallel to LGN along the concave surface of the superhelix
formed by the TPRs. Structural analysis and structure-based muta￾genesis define residues that are critical for mInsc–LGN association,
and reveal that the activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS3)-
binding protein Frmpd1 [4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) and PSD￾95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing protein 1] and its relative
Frmpd4 interact with LGN via a region homologous to a part of
mInsc-LBD, whereas nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA)
and the C terminus of LGN recognize the TPR domain in a manner
different from that by mInsc. mInsc binds to LGN with the highest
affinity (KD ≈ 2.4 nM) and effectively replaces the Frmpd proteins,
NuMA, and the LGN C terminus, suggesting the priority of mInsc
in binding to LGN. We also demonstrate, using mutant proteins,
that mInsc–LGN interaction is vital for stabilization of LGN and for
intracellular localization of mInsc.
Cell polarization plays an essential role in asymmetric cell divi￾sion, cell migration, and the proper function of various differ￾entiated cell types (1). In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,
neurons and glial cells are produced by asymmetric division of
neuroblasts that delaminate as single cells from apical-basal
polarized neuroectoderm (2). The asymmetric division requires
establishment of apical-basal polarity in neuroblasts; the Bazooka￾containing protein complex is specifically localized to the apical cor￾tex for polarity establishment. The mitotic spindle poles, normally
arranged in parallel to the plane of the neuroectoderm, are also
needed to be oriented along the apical-basal axis, which orientation
is driven by another evolutionarily conserved protein complex con￾taining Partner of Inscuteable (Pins), Mud, and the Gαi subunit of
trimeric Gi proteins. The adaptor protein Inscuteable (Insc) simul￾taneously binds to Bazooka and Pins to provide a physical link
between the two complexes; the link thereby couples cortical cell
polarity and spindle orientation for asymmetric cell division.
Homologues of both Insc and Pins are known to exist exclu￾sively in animals (from insects to mammals). The mammalian
homologue of Insc (mInsc) also appears to contribute to mitotic
spindle orientation and asymmetric cell division. Like Drosophila
Insc, mInsc is capable of simultaneously interacting with the
mammalian Bazooka-homologue Par3 and the mammalian Pins￾related protein LGN [or activator of G-protein signaling 3
(AGS3)] (3–5). In symmetrically dividing cells, mInsc is distrib￾uted to the cortical area overlying the two mitotic spindle poles
(4); LGN also localizes to the two cortical regions during mitosis
(6, 7). On the other hand, in mouse embryo, mInsc and LGN
colocalize at the apical cortex of epidermal progenitors that are
dividing asymmetrically along their apical-basal axis (3), and
mInsc modifies spindle orientation in the developing rat retina
(4). Ectopic expression of mInsc facilitates LGN localization
to the apical cortex and induces apical-basal spindle orientation
in several epithelial cell types of mice (8–10), leading to an in￾crease in asymmetric cell division (9, 10). Thus, the Insc protein
appears to function together with its partner proteins in a manner
conserved between Drosophila and mammals.
Pins and its related mammalian proteins LGN and AGS3 con￾sist of the N-terminal domain comprising eight tetratricopeptide
repeat (TPR) motifs and the C-terminal region harboring three
or four Gαi/o–Loco interaction (GoLoco)/G-protein regulatory
(GPR) motifs, each capable of binding to the Gαi subunit of
trimeric G proteins (7, 11–13); it is noteworthy that the first TPR
(TPR1) among the eight motifs has been often ignored in pre￾vious reports because TPR1 does not fit well to the TPR consen￾sus. The TPR motif comprises 34 amino acid residues that adopt
a helix-turn-helix structure; TPRs are generally packed into a
superhelical domain to mediate protein–protein interactions
(14–16). LGN binding to the Mud-related protein nuclear mitotic
apparatus protein (NuMA) via the TPR domain is also considered
to participate in mitotic spindle orientation (7). In addition, a mu￾tation in the human LGN gene has been identified as cause for
nonsyndromic deafness (17); ablation of AGS3 in mice leads to
alterations in metabolic function (18) and impaired renal tubular
regeneration after acute kidney injury (19). The mammalian Pins￾related proteins thus contribute to a variety of biological events.
Although the amino acid sequence of LGN is about 50%
identical to that of Pins, mInsc exhibits only about 20% identity
to Drosophila Insc (3–5). Human mInsc contains 532 amino acid
residues (5) with an N-terminal region highly homologous to a
central domain—the asymmetry (or asymmetric localization)
domain—of the fruit fly homologue (20, 21). Drosophila Insc of
859 residues has a long N-terminal extension that is dispensable
for the functions of this protein (20, 21) and absent from the
mammalian mInsc proteins. The central asymmetry domain of
Drosophila Insc is responsible not only for apical cortical locali￾zation and mitotic spindle orientation along the apical-basal axis
(20, 21) but also for interacting with Pins (12). In the interaction
Drosophila Pins uses its N-terminal domain comprising TPRs.
Intriguingly, mouse LGN also can bind to Drosophila Insc via the
TPR domain, especially via TPRs 4–8, and functionally substitute

does not localize to the apical cortex of neuroblasts and thus
fails to orient mitotic spindles (12), indicating that Insc–Pins
interaction plays a crucial role in asymmetric cell division. How￾ever, the structural basis of the evolutionarily-conserved interac￾tion has remained to be elucidated.
Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the LGN￾binding domain (LBD) of human mInsc (mInsc-LBD, residues
23–69), which is included in the region corresponding to the asym￾metric localization module, in complex with the N-terminal TPR
domain of human LGN (LGN-N, residues 13–414), determined by
X-ray crystallography at 2.6-Å resolution. In the evolutionarily￾conserved complex, mInsc-LBD adopts a structure containing an
α-helix and an antiparallel β-sheet linked by an extended region. By
structure-based mutagenesis, we define residues in mInsc and
LGN that are critical for mInsc–LGN association. The AGS3-
binding protein Frmpd1 [4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) and
PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing protein 1] (22) and
its relative Frmpd4 bind to LGN via a region homologous to a part
of mInsc-LBD, whereas NuMA and the C terminus of LGN recog￾nize the TPR domain differently from mInsc. mInsc binds to LGN
with the highest affinity (KD ≈ 2.4 nM) and effectively replaces not
only the Frmpd proteins but also NuMA and the LGN C terminus,
suggesting overlapping roles for the concave surface of LGN. We
further demonstrate that mInsc–LGN interaction is crucial for
LGN stabilization by mInsc and for mInsc localization to the cell
cortex over the mitotic spindle poles in mitotic cells.
Results and Discussion
Overall Structure of the mInsc–LGN Complex. In the present study,
we determined the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal
TPR domain of human LGN (LGN-N, residues 13–414) and the
LBD of human mInsc (mInsc-LBD, residues 23–69) (Fig. S1A),
the latter of which locates in a region corresponding to the asym￾metric localization domain of Drosophila Insc (20, 21). The crystal
structure contains three individual complexes per asymmetric unit
(Fig. S1 and Table S1). Because the mode of interaction among the
three complexes in the asymmetric unit is highly similar except
small differences probably due to crystal packing (Fig. S1), we dis￾cuss only one representative complex structure here. Although, in
the crystal, an LGN-N makes direct contacts with another LGN-N,
the interaction appears to be without biological relevance and thus
attributed to crystal packing. This is because analytical ultracen￾trifugation revealed that LGN-N forms a 1∶1 heterodimer with
mInsc-LBD in solution (Fig. S1), and because homotypic interac￾tion of the isolated TPR domain or that of full-length LGN was
not observed in cells coexpressing mInsc (Fig. S1).
Amino acid sequence analysis by the tool TPRpred (23) pre￾dicts the presence of eight TPR motifs in LGN-N, albeit the first
and fourth TPRs are atypical ones. In agreement with the predic￾tion, in the mInsc–LGN complex, LGN-N indeed contains eight
full TPRs with a C-terminal capping α-helix (Fig. 1A). In general,
each TPR motif comprises a pair of antiparallel α-helices, desig￾nated as Aα and Bα; successive Aα and Bα helices form a right￾handed superhelix with Aα-helices lining the inner concave
groove and Bα-helices forming the outer convex surface (14–16).
In LGN complexed with mInsc, the eight TPRs together with the
capping helix (17 antiparallel α-helices in total) adopt a solenoid￾like superhelix structure measuring about 100 Å in length and
about 40 Å in diameter (Fig. 1A and Fig. S2). The α-helices in
TPR2–8 are composed of 17 residues except those in TPR4
(Aα of 20 and Bα of 23 residues), although Aα and Bα of TPR1
compromise 13 and 14 residues, respectively, the lengths of which
correspond to those of canonical TPR motifs.
In the mInsc–LGN complex, mInsc-LBD forms an elongated
structure that runs antiparallel along the TPR groove, burying
approximately 4;200 Å2 of the surface of LGN. mInsc-LBD can
be roughly divided into three binding modules: an α-helix (resi￾dues 26–35), an extended region (residues 36–44), and an anti￾parallel β-sheet—the strands β1 (residues 45–48) and β2 (residues
62–65) are connected with a 13-residue loop (Fig. 1). These well￾ordered modules form extensive hydrophobic and electrostatic
interactions with the eight TPRs of LGN: Residues 26–35 of
mInsc-LBD hold into the α-helix and travel in the groove, packing
on the Aα helices of TPRs 6–8 of LGN; residues 36–44 continue
to travel along the groove made up of the Aα helices of TPRs
4 and 5; and the antiparallel β-sheet and the loop between the
β-strands fit into the groove formed by TPRs 1–3.
Interactions Between LGN and the α-Helix of mInsc-LBD. The N-term￾inal region of mInsc-LBD forms an α-helix spanning residues 26
to 35 (Fig. 2A). Trp31, an invariant residue (completely conserved
from insects to mammals), and three hydrophobic residues in the
α-helix, Val28, Met32, and Leu35, form a surface complementary
to the LGN groove formed by TPRs 6–8 (Fig. 2A), which may
stabilize the α-helical structure. Although Leu35 is replaced with
glutamine in Drosophila Insc, both Val28 and Met32 are conserved
between human mInsc and its Drosophila homologue: Val28 inter￾Fig. 1. Overall structure of the mInsc–LGN complex. (A) Cartoon representation of mInsc-LBD in complex with LGN-N. Three views of the complex are related

BIOCHEMISTRYacts with the invariant residues Asn283, Thr286, and Leu287 on
TPR7; and Met32 with the conserved residues Ile246 and Phe247
on TPR6. Intriguingly, Trp31 in mInsc is encircled by many resi￾dues on LGN TPRs 6–8 (Ile246, Tyr258, Tyr279, Ser280, Asn283,
Thr284, and Arg316), thereby making extensive interactions with
them (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3). These residues are all conserved be￾tween mammalian and Drosophila Pins-related proteins (Fig. S2).
Among them, LGN Asn283 may be particularly important because
it forms many direct contacts with mInsc Trp31 (Fig. 2B). The
N-terminal residue of the mInsc-LBD α-helix, Asp26, forms con￾tacts with the side chains of Trp319 and Asn323 on TPR8 (Fig. 2A);
Drosophila Insc also has an acidic residue (i.e., Glu) for the posi￾tion of Asp26. Thus, the interaction via the α-helical region is likely
conserved from Drosophila to mammals, in which the invariant
tryptophan of Insc-related protein likely plays a major role.
Interactions Between LGN and the Extended Region of mInsc-LBD. The
extended region of mInsc-LBD comprising residues Lys35 through
Met44 interacts with the positively charged region on the concave
surface of the LGN TPR superhelix (Fig. 2C). The main chains of
mInsc Glu40, Glu42, and Cys43 form hydrogen bonds with the side
chains of the LGN conserved residues Asn203, Asn200, and
Tyr139, respectively (Fig. 2D); these interactions appear to stabilize
the conformation of the mInsc extended region. The carboxy side
chain of mInsc Glu42 makes salt bridges with both Arg221 on
TPR5 and Arg236 on TPR6, whereas the side chain of Glu40 co￾ordinates with that of Arg235 on TPR6 (Fig. 2D). Both the acidic
residues of mInsc are completely conserved in LGN/Pins-binding
regions of Insc-related proteins as well as in the AGS3-binding do￾main of Frmpd1 and its corresponding region of Frmpd4 (Fig. 1C).
Consistent with this, the three basic residues Arg221, Arg235, and
Arg236 are completely conserved among the mammalian Pins￾related proteins LGN and AGS3, and Drosophila Pins (Fig. S2).
These findings suggest that the extended region of Insc-related
proteins recognizes their partners mainly via ionic interactions
in an evolutionarily conserved manner.
Interactions Between LGN and the β-Loop-β Module of mInsc-LBD.
The β-sheet formed between the strands β1 (residues 45–48) and
β2 (residues 62–65) is connected with a loop of residues 49–61. In
the loop, residues 49–52 make contacts with TPRs 1–3 (Fig. 2E),
although the subsequent region (residues 53–61) is solvent ex￾posed. In particular, the ε amino group of the invariant residue
Lys50 coordinates with the carboxy group of LGN Asp81 (Fig. 2F),
which is conserved during evolution in Pins-related proteins. On
the other hand, Ile52, an invariant residue among Insc-related pro￾teins, is buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed by TPRs 1 and 2
(Fig. 2G); the isoleucine is replaced by valine in Frmpd1 and
Frmpd4 (Fig. 1C). Residues in the region C-terminal to Ile52, in￾cluding the strand β2, are not conserved in Frmpd1 or Frmpd4.
Mutational Analysis of mInsc–LGN Interaction. Key features of the
mInsc-LBD–LGN-N structure appear to be maintained through￾out evolution of animals (from insects to mammals): Residues
involved in mInsc–LGN-N interaction are almost completely
conserved (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2). This probably explains the rea￾son why mouse LGN directly binds to Drosophila Pins and func￾tionally replaces Pins in asymmetric cell division of Drosophila
embryonic neuroblasts (13). Wild-type mInsc bound to LGN with
an apparent KD value of approximately 2.4 nM (Fig. 3A and
Fig. S4). Substitution of alanine for mInsc Trp31, an invariant
residue in mInsc-related proteins, resulted in about 200-fold de￾crease in the affinity for LGN (KD of approximately 430 nM).
Replacement of mInsc Glu42, another invariant residue, by argi￾Fig. 2. Interactions between mInsc-LBD and LGN-N. (A) Surface representation showing the binding interface between LGN and the α-helix of mInsc-LBD.

are colored as follows: the acidic residues in pink, basic residues in cyan, hydrophobic residues in yellow, or uncharged polar residues in green.
19212 ∣ www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1110951108 Yuzawa et al.nine led to a slight but significant decrease in interaction with LGN
(KD of approximately 60 nM). The combined substitutions for
Trp31 and Glu42 completely abrogated the interaction (Fig. S5A).
Thus, Trp31 in the α-helix and Glu42 in the extended region both
play a crucial role in binding to LGN. Although the K50D substi￾tution marginally affected mInsc–LGN interaction (Fig. 3A), the
E42R/K50D double substitution more effectively inhibited the
interaction than the E42R single substitution (Fig. S5B). Thus, the
invariant residue Lys50 in the mInsc β-loop-β module appears to
substantially contribute to the interaction with LGN.
We next tested the role of LGN Arg221 on TPR5 and Asn283
on TPR7, which make direct contacts with the crucial residues
Glu42 and Trp31 in mInsc, respectively. The R221E/N283R sub￾stitution abrogated LGN interaction with mInsc, although both of
the single substitutions slightly affected the interaction (Fig. 3B
and Fig. S5C). The significant role of these residues on TPR5 and
TPR7 is also in agreement with the observation that TPRs 5–8
of LGN, but not TPRs 1–4, mainly contributes to the interaction
with mInsc (Fig. S6A).
In addition, in vivo interaction between full-length mInsc and
full-length LGN was disrupted by the W31A/E42R substitution in
mInsc or by the R221E/N283R substitution in LGN (Fig. 3J). It is
known that mInsc also binds to AGS3 (5), a protein closely re￾lated to LGN. Indeed, full-length mInsc interacted not only with
ectopically expressed full-length AGS3 (Fig. S5D) but also with
endogenous AGS3 (Fig. S5E). In both cases, the W31A/E42R
substitution in mInsc led to a loss of the interaction, suggesting
that mInsc recognizes AGS3 in a way similar to that of LGN.
Comparison of Binding Mode of mInsc with Those of Other LGN-Bind￾ing Proteins. As shown in Fig. 1C, a part of mInsc-LBD exhibits a
significant homology to a part of the AGS3-binding region of
Frmpd1, a protein that may be involved in G-protein signaling by
directly interacting with the AGS3 TPR domain (22), and also to a
corresponding region of Frmpd4, an Frmpd1-related protein that is
proposed to participate in dendritic spine morphogenesis (24). In￾deed the mInsc-LBD–homologous regions of the Frmpd proteins
bound to LGN but with lower affinities than mInsc (Fig. 3C and
Fig. S4), and were effectively replaced with mInsc (Fig. 3 D and E).
The R221E substitution in LGN almost completely abrogated the
interaction with Frmpd1 or Frmpd4, whereas the N283R substitu￾tion did not affect the interaction (Fig. 3B and Fig. S5). This is in
contrast with LGN interaction with mInsc, a severe disruption of
which requires simultaneous substitution for Arg221 and Asn283
(Fig. 3B). This may be explicable by the fact that Frmpd1 and
Frmpd4 lack a region corresponding to the mInsc-LBD α-helix,
which contributes to interaction of mInsc with the C-terminal TPR
domain of LGN. On the other hand, dual substitution of arginine
for Glu922 and Glu924 in Frmpd1 resulted in a loss of the inter￾action with LGN, supporting the idea that Frmpd1 recognizes LGN
at least partly in a manner similar to that by mInsc (Fig. S5H). Less
inhibition was observed in the corresponding substitution in mInsc:
The mutant mInsc carrying the E40R/E42R substitution in the ex￾tended region is still capable of strongly interacting with LGN
probably via the N-terminal α-helix. In addition, the first β-strand
and the subsequent four residues of mInsc, which make contacts
with TPRs 1–3 of LGN, are conserved in Frmpd1 and Frmpd4
(Fig. 1C). These findings may explain why neither TPRs 1–4 nor
TPRs 5–8 fully interacts with Frmpd1 and Frmpd4 (Fig. S6).
We next compared LGN-binding modes between mInsc and
NuMA. The amino acid sequence of NuMA does not show any
similarity to that of mInsc-LBD. The C-terminal region of NuMA

BIOCHEMISTRY(residues 1808–1930) bound to LGN-N with a KD of approxi￾mately 27 nM, a value of which is about tenfold higher than that
of mInsc (Fig. 3C and Fig. S4). LGN TPRs 1–4 also interacted with
NuMA, but to a lesser extent than TPRs 1–8; on the other hand,
NuMA did not interact with TPRs 5–8 (Fig. S6D), which is in
contrast to the finding that LGN binding to mInsc is largely depen￾dent on TPRs 5–8. In addition, the R221E/N283R substitution in
LGN only slightly attenuated NuMA–LGN interaction (Fig. 3H),
although the mutation led to a complete loss of LGN binding to
mInsc, Frmpd1, and Frmpd4. Thus NuMA appears to recognize
LGN in a manner distinct from that by mInsc. On the other hand,
interaction of NuMA with LGN was inhibited by mInsc both in
vivo and in vitro (Fig. 3 F and K), indicating that the bindings of
NuMA and mInsc to LGN are mutually exclusive.
The TPR domain of LGN has been reported to interact intra￾molecularly with the Goloco-motif-containing C-terminal region,
which contributes to regulation of LGN (7). The intramolecular
interaction was abrogated by the presence of mInsc (Fig. 3G) or by
deletion of either TPRs 1–4 or TPRs 5–8 (Fig. S6). These proper￾ties are similar to those observed in LGN binding to Frmpd1 and
Frmpd4. However, although binding to the Frmpd proteins was
almost completely lost by the R221E substitution in LGN (Fig. 3B
and Fig. S5), the same substitution did not affect the intramolecu￾lar interaction of LGN (Fig. 3I). Taken together, the TPR domain
of LGN differently recognizes mInsc, NuMA, and the C-terminal
region of LGN, whereas Frmpd1 and Frmpd4 interact with LGN
via a region that exhibits homology to a part of mInsc-LBD.
Role of mInsc–LGN Interaction in Stabilization of LGN. We next ana￾lyzed the structural effects of mInsc–LGN interaction using cir￾cular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. As with other TPR proteins,
LGN-N does show the potential to independently adopt α-helical
structure (Fig. 4A). However, relative to either protein alone, the
mInsc–LGN complex showed increased helical content (Fig. 4B).
Similar CD spectra were observed in stabilization of the APC6
TPR domain, comprising eight TPR helices and a capping α-helix,
by the CDC26 N-terminal region of 29 amino acid residues (25).
Furthermore, thermal-denaturation profiles revealed that mInsc￾LBD increases in denaturing temperature of LGN-N (Fig. 4C).
The stabilizing effect was abrogated by the W31A/E42R substitu￾tion in mInsc, a mutation that leads to a loss of binding to LGN.
Thus, mInsc-LBD probably confers structural stability upon
LGN-N. Our crystallization trials of mInsc-unbound LGN-N were
unsuccessful, which may be due to the flexible nature of this TPR
domain in solution. CD spectra of the isolated mInsc-LBD suggest
a random-coil conformation (Fig. 4A), which might be expected
for a protein/domain that interacts with its binding partner in an
elongated conformation.
Coexpression of mInsc drastically enhanced the content of LGN
at the protein level in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4D), suggestive of mInsc￾mediated stabilization of LGN. On the other hand, a mutant mInsc
(W31A/E42R), incapable of binding to LGN, failed to stabilize the
LGN protein. These findings indicate that mInsc stabilizes LGN in
vivo via the direct interaction.
Role of mInsc–LGN Interaction in mInsc Localization in Mammalian
Cells. Although mInsc is reported to localize during asymmetric
cell division to the apical cortex of several cell types in mamma￾lian embryos (8–10), it is also known that mInsc is recruited to the
cortex of symmetrically dividing cells in culture (4). To analyze the
subcellular localization of mInsc during mitosis, we transfected
HeLa cells with a functional GFP-tagged form of human mInsc
that retained the ability to bind to endogenous LGN (Fig. S5I).
Although GFP–mInsc was uniformly cytoplasmic in interphase
cells, the protein translocated during metaphase to the plasma
membrane and concentrated in the cortical area overlying the
two spindle poles (Fig. 5A), which distribution is consistent with
that observed in NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts (4). mInsc (W31A/
E42R), defective in binding to LGN, failed to move to the cortical
area, indicating a crucial role of mInsc–LGN interaction.
It is also known that overexpression of the Gα subunit of the
Gi-family trimeric G proteins in Madin–Darby canine kidney
(MDCK) cells leads to a recruitment of LGN to the cell cortex
even at interphase (7). This is because LGN directly binds via the
C-terminal GoLoco/GPR motifs to the plasma-membrane-asso￾ciated protein Gαi in a GDP-bound form. Consistent with this,
in cells expressing Gαi2 (G204A), a mutant protein in a constitu￾tively GDP-bound form (26), LGN and its binding partner mInsc
were both present at the cell cortex (Fig. 5B). The localization of
mInsc was lost when mInsc–LGN interaction was disrupted by
the W31A/E42R substitution in mInsc or by the R221E/N283R
substitution in LGN. Thus, correct localization of mInsc requires
its interaction with LGN.
Concluding Remarks
Here, we report a crystal structure of the mInsc–LGN complex at
2.6-Å resolution. In the evolutionarily conserved complex, mInsc￾LBD runs along the groove formed by the LGN TPR motifs,
adopting an elongated structure comprising three distinct modules:
an α-helix, an extended region, and an antiparallel β-sheet con￾nected by a loop. Thus, mInsc-LBD, albeit intrinsically disordered,
becomes folded into a highly ordered conformation with both
α-helix and β-sheet, a structure that is not found in other targets
on the concave surface of TPR domains. Structural and mutational
analyses define residues critical for mInsc–LGN association: Resi￾dues in the α-helix and the extended region play more important
roles than those in the β-loop-β module. AGS3 appears to bind
to mInsc in a manner similar to that by LGN, which is consistent
with the almost complete conservation of residues involved in the
interaction with mInsc.

19214 ∣ www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1110951108 Yuzawa et al.The present study also reveals that the LGN TPR domain
directly binds to Frmpd1 and its related protein Frmpd4 in a man￾ner similar to but distinct from that by mInsc. The Frmpd proteins
lack the α-helix of mInsc-LBD but interact with LGN via a region
that is homologous to the extended region and a part of the β￾loop-β module, consisting of the first β-strand and its C-terminal
flanking region. Experiments using mutant proteins suggest that
NuMA and the C-terminal region of LGN bind to the LGN TPR
domain in a fashion different from that by mInsc and Frmpd
proteins. Because mInsc replaces the LGN C terminus in binding
to the TPRs, the intramolecular interaction in LGN is not ex￾pected to prevent TPR binding to mInsc; indeed, full-length LGN
is capable of associating with mInsc. It is considered that mInsc
tethers the two evolutionarily conserved complexes, one compris￾ing Par3, Par6, and aPKC and the other containing LGN and
Gαi (Fig. S6F), which agrees with the present finding that mem￾brane-bound Gαi recruits mInsc to the membrane in an LGN￾dependent manner. Entry of NuMA, a protein crucial for spindle
orientation, into the LGN–Gαi complex may lead to their release
from the mInsc–Par network, because bindings of NuMA and
mInsc to LGN are mutually exclusive. The competition may reg￾ulate spindle orientation during mitosis.
Furthermore, we show that mInsc–LGN interaction increases
heat stability of the LGN TPR domain, and it also stabilizes
LGN at the cellular level. It is known that, in symmetrically di￾viding cells, mInsc is recruited to the cell cortex overlying the two
mitotic spindle poles. The recruitment requires mInsc binding to
LGN, as clearly shown in the present study. Future studies should
be addressed to clarify the role of mInsc–LGN interaction in
other mInsc-mediated biological events thus-far unidentified.
