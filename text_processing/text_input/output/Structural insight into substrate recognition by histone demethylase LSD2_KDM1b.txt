Dear Editor,
Histone methylation is a reversible histone post￾translational modification that plays an important role in 
various chromatin-based processes, including chromatin 
structure remodeling, transcription, and DNA repair [1, 
2]. LSD1 (also known as KDM1A) is the first identi￾fied histone lysine demethylase. It converts mono- or di￾methylated histone H3 (H3K4me1/me2) to unmodified 
H3 [3]. LSD1 is highly conserved in eukaryotes and 
plays important roles in various biological processes, 
such as development and tumorgenesis. LSD2 (also 
known as KDM1B or AOF1) is the only other mam￾malian paralogue of the LSD1 family. Similar to LSD1, 
LSD2 is also a histone H3K4me1/me2 demethylase [4-
7]. LSD1 has been shown to be enriched at promoter re￾gions; in contrast, LSD2 mainly associates with the gene 
body regions of actively transcribed genes [5]. LSD2 is 
highly expressed in oocytes, and is required for de novo
DNA methylation of some imprinted genes, a function 
dependent on its H3K4 demethylase activity [4]. Thus, 
LSD2 is an important player in epigenetic regulation and 
has functions distinct from those of LSD1. 
Previous studies have shown that LSD2 can demethyl￾ate histone H3K4me2 peptide corresponding to residues 
1-21, but not the one containing only residues 1-16. The 
observation suggests that residues 17-21 of H3 might 
be important for substrate recognition and demethylase 
activity of LSD2 [6]. In our recent studies, we identi￾fied that NPAC/GLYR1 interacts with LSD2, stabilizes 
the interaction between LSD2 and H3 peptide, and thus 
enhances LSD2 activity [8]. Interestingly, in the LSD2-
NPAC-H3K4M(1-20) structure (H3 residues 1-20, re￾placing K4 with a methionine to mimic the H3K4me2 
substrate of LSD2), we found that residues Q19 and 
L20 of H3 interact with a loop region in LSD2, further 
supporting the hypothesis that residues 17-20 of H3 are 
involved in the substrate recognition of LSD2. These 
studies also suggest that LSD2 may contain a putative 
non-canonical substrate-binding site to interact with resi￾dues 17-20 of H3. In this study, we further investigate 
how LSD2 recognizes its histone substrate, and whether 
LSD2 contains an additional substrate-binding site that is 
functionally relevant.
To investigate whether LSD2 contains an additional 
substrate recognition site, we first performed an in vitro
histone demethylation assay using H3K4me2 peptides 
as substrate. As shown in Supplementary information, 
Figure S1, wild-type LSD2 demethylated about 100% 
H3K4me2 (1-21) into 100% H3K4me1, and demethyl￾ated about 100% H3K4me2 (1-26) into 50% H3K4me1 
and 50% H3K4me0, suggesting that H3K4me2 (1-26) is 
a better substrate comparing to H3K4me2 (1-21). The re￾sult also indicates that residues 22-26 of H3 are involved 
in LSD2-mediated demethylation. To study the mecha￾nism of substrate recognition by LSD2, we determined 
the crystal structure of LSD2-H3K4M(1-26) and LSD2-
NPAC-H3K4M(1-26) complexes at 2.0 and 3.1 Å reso￾lution, respectively (Supplementary information, Table 
S1). H3K4M(1-26) peptide was used as an analogue 
of H3K4me2 for crystallization. Residues 236-263 of 
LSD2 were not built in the model due to a lack of elec￾tron density, which may result from their flexibility in 
the crystals. LSD2 adopts similar conformations in both 
structures with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) 
of 0.553 Å for 666-aligned Cα atoms (Figure 1A and 
Supplementary information, Figures S2-S4). Structure of 
LSD2 alone has been described previously [8], and thus 
will not be discussed here.
Structural comparison of LSD2-H3K4M(1-26) and 
LSD1-CoREST-H3K4M (2V1D.PDB) [9] shows that 
LSD1 and LSD2 share similar folds for the amine oxi￾dase (AO) and SWIRM domains, which is consistent 
with their conserved primary sequences and our previous 
findings (Supplementary information, Figures S5 and S6) 
[8]. The most striking finding from the comparison of 
these two structures is the different fashion for substrate 
interaction. In the LSD1-CoREST-H3K4M structure, 
only residues 1-16 of H3K4M were observed, although 
the peptide used for crystallization contains residues 
1-21, suggesting that residues 17-21 are flexible in the 
crystal [9]. However, in the LSD2-H3K4M(1-26) struc-www.cell-research.com | Cell Research

ture, residues 1-26 of the H3K4M peptide were clearly 
observed. The N-termini (residues 1-16) of the H3K4M 
peptides in both complex structures adopt similar folds. 
In the LSD2-H3K4M(1-26) structure, the H3K4M pep￾tide extends away from the catalytic cavity (the “first 
binding site”) and interacts with LSD2 on the second 
binding site (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, 
Figure S4). This “second binding site” is composed of 
two loops (hereafter referred to as loop 1 and loop 2 for 
simplicity) within the linker region of LSD2. Structural 
comparison indicates that LSD1 lacks the second binding 
site, supporting that LSD1 may not bind to histone H3 
in a similar fashion as in the LSD2-H3K4M(1-26) struc￾ture.

recognition and essential for demethylation activity of LSD2. 
groove on the second binding site of LSD2. Residues 19-
22 of H3K4M mainly interact with residues from loop 
2, and residues 23-26 interact with residues from loop 1 
in the linker region (Figure 1D). In particular, the side 
chains of residues Q19, T22, and R26 of H3 form hydro￾gen bonds with side chains of residues N276, D287, and 
the carbonyl oxygen of residues S221, Y223 of LSD2. 
The side chain of residue L20 of H3K4M inserts into a 
hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Y273, R285, and 
main chains of residues 276-279 of LSD2. In addition, 
the side chain of residue A24 of H3K4M inserts into a 
hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Y223, C227, 
and D287 of LSD2. Comparing to loop 1, more residues 
from loop 2 are involved in the interaction with H3K4M. 
In the LSD2-NPAC-H3K4M(1-26) ternary structure, the 
H3K4M peptide interacts with the LSD2-NPAC complex 
in a similar fashion as described above (Supplementary 
information, Figure S7A and S7B). The existence of 
NPAC facilitates the formation of more hydrogen bonds 
and hydrophobic interactions (Supplementary informa￾tion, Figure S7C). NPAC seems to work together with 
the second binding site to facilitate LSD2-H3K4me2 
interaction, and thus enhance the enzymatic activity of 
LSD2.
As residues 1-21 of H3K4me2 are sufficient for de￾methylation by LSD2, we speculate that loop 2 plays a 
more important role in histone tail recognition for the 
demethylase activity of LSD2. Thus, we focused on loop 
2 for subsequent biochemical studies. To test whether the 
interaction between the second binding site of LSD2 and 
the C-terminus (residues 19-26) of the H3K4M peptide 
is important for substrate recognition of LSD2, we first 
performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analy￾ses using various H3K4M peptides and purified LSD2 
protein. The results show that H3K4M(1-26) binds to 
LSD2 with a binding affinity (Kd) of 0.74 µM. Using 
H3K4M peptide (residues 1-16) significantly decreased 
the binding affinity (9.52 µM) to LSD2 by approximately 
13-fold. Mutations of three residues (L20A/T22A/R26A) 
in H3K4M (residues 1-26) critical for the second bind￾ing site interaction also decreased the binding affinity 
(3.48 µM) to LSD2 by approximately 5-fold (Figure 1E). 
These results indicate that the C-terminus (residues 19-
26) of the H3K4M peptide, and in particular, residues 
L20, T22, and R26 are important for H3K4M to interact 
with LSD2, and support that the second binding site is 
important for substrate recognition of LSD2.
We further generated LSD2 mutants to test whether 
the second binding site of LSD2 is important for its 
histone demethylase activity. The mutants include M1 
(residues 273-278 replaced by GSGSGS), M2 (R285A/
D287A), and M3 (the combination of M1 and M2), in 
which residues 273-278, and R285, D287 are all from 
loop 2 (Figure 1D and Supplementary information, 
Figures S8 and S9). Two additional LSD2 mutants, M4 
(E563A) and M5 (K661A) were used as control. E563 in 
the AO domain forms hydrogen bond with residue R2 of 
H3K4M, and K661 is a conserved residue essential for 
the catalytic activity of LSD2 [5, 7, 8]. 
We first performed an in vitro histone demethyl￾ase assay with various peptide substrates, including 
H3K4me2 (1-21, wild type), H3K4me2 (1-21, Q19A/
L20A), H3K4me2 (1-26, wild type), and H3K4me2 (1-26, 
Q19A/L20A/T22A). The purified wild-type and mutant 
LSD2 proteins were used in the assay. The results show 
that mutations of Q19A/L20A in H3K4me2 (1-21) had 
a moderate effect on LSD2 activity, whereas mutations 
of Q19A/L20A/T22A in H3K4me2 (1-26) significantly www.cell-research.com | Cell Research

decreased the demethylation efficiency of LSD2 (Figure 
1F and Supplementary information, Figure S10). As a 
control, LSD2 mutant M4 (E563A) did not exhibit enzy￾matic activity towards H3K4me2 (1-21) peptide (Supple￾mentary information, Figure S10). In addition, the LSD2 
mutant M1 exhibited very weak enzymatic activity for 
both H3K4me2 (1-21) and H3K4me2 (1-26) (Figure 1F 
and Supplementary information, Figure S10A), indicat￾ing that loop 2 is important for the demethylase activity 
of LSD2. Similar results were obtained when LSD2 was 
used at a lower protein concentration (0.15 µM) (Supple￾mentary information, Figure S10B). 
Next, we performed in vitro histone demethylase as￾says using calf thymus histones or nucleosomes purified 
from HeLa cells as substrates, and the reactions were 
monitored by western blotting analyses. Wild-type LSD2 
demethylated H3K4me2 from histones or nucleosomes 
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1G). In contrast, 
equal amounts of the LSD2 mutant M1 showed signifi￾cantly decreased enzymatic activity towards H3K4me2 
from both histones and nucleosomes. As a negative con￾trol, histone H3K9me2 level did not change upon the ad￾dition of LSD2 protein, which is consistent with previous 
studies [4, 5, 7]. Together with the mass-spectrometry￾based assay, these demethylase assays indicate that for 
all three forms of substrates including peptides, histones, 
and nucleosomes, loop 2 within the second binding site 
is important for LSD2 demethylase activity.
To test whether the loop 2 within the second binding 
site is important for LSD2 demethylase activity in vivo, 
we overexpressed GFP-LSD2 in 293T cells and per￾formed immunofluorescence staining to detect the global 
H3K4me2 levels. A significant decrease of H3K4me2 
level was observed in cells expressing wild-type GFP￾LSD2. As a control, H3K4me2 level did not change in 
cells expressing the LSD2 mutant M5. As expected, 
LSD2 mutants M1, M2 and M3 lost their histone de￾methylase activity in vivo (Figure 1H), which is consis￾tent with the results from in vitro demethylase assays. 
Thus, loop 2 is required for histone demethylase activity 
of LSD2 in vivo.
In summary, the crystal structure of LSD2-H3K4M 
(1-26) reveals that LSD2 interacts with H3K4M through 
two binding sites. Further biochemical analyses indicate 
that the second binding site is important for substrate rec￾ognition and essential for demethylase activity of LSD2. 
The finding provides an example that an additional 
substrate-binding site away from the catalytic site plays 
an important role in substrate recognition and enzymatic 
activity for a histone demethylase. Based on these find￾ings, we propose a “two binding sites” model (Figure 1I), 
where the catalytic AO domain, as the first binding site, 
recognizes the N-terminus of H3K4me2, and the second 
binding site facilitates the substrate interaction and is es￾sential for demethylation activity of LSD2. Our study not 
only elucidates the structural basis of substrate recogni￾tion by LSD2 but also provides valuable information for 
designing specific inhibitors targeting LSD2 for potential 
therapeutic applications.
