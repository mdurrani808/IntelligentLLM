ABSTRACT: Tissue factor is the cellular receptor and macromolecular enzymatic cofactor for the serine 
protease coagulation factor VIIa. The ligand binding extracellular domain of tissue factor consists of two 
structural modules which fold similar to fibronectin type I11 modules, consistent with the classification of 
tissue factor as a member of the class 2 cytokine receptor family. On the basis of the three-dimensional 
structure, we here analyze the importance of tissue factor residues for binding of ligand by scanning 
alanine mutagenesis. The identified significant binding contacts account for as much as 80% of the 
calculated total free energy of ligand binding. Most residues with energetic contributions to ligand binding 
are well exposed to solvent, and the area for ligand interaction extends from the cleft formed by the two 
structural modules (residues Lys20, Ile22, LYS~~, Asp58, Arg135, Phe") to the convex-shaped edge of the 
three- and four-stranded sheets characterized by a patch of surface-exposed hydrophobic side chains in 
the amino-terminal module (residues Gln37, Asp4, Trp45, Phe76, TY~~~). The binding residues are dispersed 
over an extended surface area, indicating adaptation to the recognition of specific structural modules of 
the macromolecular ligand factor VIIa. This analysis provides detailed insight into the three-dimensional 
organization of the ligand docking structure of the initiating cofactor for the coagulation pathways. 
The coagulation pathways in vivo are initiated by the cell 
surface receptor tissue factor (TF)' (Davie et al., 1991). TF 
is thought to play a significant pathogenetic role in vascular 
and thromboembolic diseases [for review see Ruf and 
Edgington (1994)l. TF forms a catalytic enzyme-cofactor 
complex with the serine protease coagulation factor VIIa 
(VIIa) resulting in significantly enhanced proteolytic activa￾tion of the macromolecular substrates factors X and IX. 
Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the extracellular 
domain of TF has been solved (Halos et al., 1994; Muller 
et al., 1994), demonstrating folding into two fibronectin type 
111 like modules as found in other members of the cytokine 
receptor family. Binding of VIIa to the extracellular domain 
modules of TF occurs with high affinity (Waxman et al., 
1992) and involves predominantly protein-protein interac￾tions (Schullek et al., 1994). The VIIa light chain modules 
(Higashi et al., 1994; Toomey et al., 1991; Clarke et al., 1992; 
Kazama et al., 1993; O'Brien et al., 1994; Ruf et al., 1991a) 
as well as the serine protease domain (O'Brien et al., 1991; 
Higashi et al., 1994; Matsushita et al., 1994) are involved in 
the interaction with TF. Specific amino acid side chains of

TF, notably LysZo, IleZ2, Asp58, and Phe'@, have been 
identified as important for binding of ligand (Ruf et al., 
1994), and these five residues account for approximately one￾third of the calculated free energy of binding of VIIa by TF 
(Schullek et al., 1994), indicating that additional structure 
is involved in ligand docking. We here identify novel TF 
residues which contribute to binding of ligand. These 
residues not only interact with ligand independently from 
the previously characterized contact sites but also mark a 
spatial extension of the known ligand binding site in TF. 
The presented integration of the functional analysis with 
structural data provides novel insight into the organization 
of the doclung structure for the ligand VIIa. 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
Mutagenesis and Expression of Human, Full-Length TF 
(TFI-263). Mutants of TF were generated using oligonucle￾otide-directed mutagenesis, as described in detail (Ruf et al., 
1993). Multiple mutations were introduced by annealing two 
or three nonoverlapping oligonucleotides to the template 
DNA. Mutated DNA sequences were identified by newly 
introduced restriction endonuclease cleavage sites, and 
mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type 
and mutant TF were expressed in mammalian Chinese 
hamster ovary cells (CHO-Kl ) in transient transfection 
experiments. Cells were harvested after 48 h, TF concentra￾tion was determined by immunoassay (Ruf et al., 1993), and 
cell pellets were stored at -70 "C in aliquots until functional 
analysis. The expression of monoclonal antibody epitopes 
was analyzed by inhibition assay (Ruf et al., 1994) and by 
1995 American Chemical Society Tissue Factor Ligand Binding Site 
flow cytometry (Ruf et al., 1993), when stably transfected 
cell lines were available. 
KD~~~ Determination by Enzyme-Linked Functional Assay. 
The apparent dissociation Constant (KDapp) for binding of VIIa 
by TF was determined in a functional assay reporting 
proteolytic activation of the substrate factor X to quantify 
the formation of TFmVIIa complexes, as described in detail 
previously (Ruf et al., 1994; Schullek et al., 1994). Briefly, 
cells were lysed by vortexing in the presence of 15 mM octyl 
P-D-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in HBS 
(20 mM HEPES, 130 mM NaC1, pH 7.4), followed by 
incubation at 37 "C for 15 min and a final dilution of 1:3 
with HBS (Ruf et al., 1993). For determination of the KD~~~, 
TF-VIIa complexes were allowed to form at 37 "C for 10 
min in HBS, 5 mM CaC12, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 
followed by the addition of factor X (100 nM) to quantify 
TF-VIIa complex formation. Factor Xa generation was 
determined with chromogenic substrate. The maximum 
catalytic rate was calculated from linear double-reciprocal 
plots of rate versus concentration of VIIa including only 
concentrations of VIIa which are in excess of the fixed 
concentration of TF. The rates observed were converted to 
concentrations of TF-VIIa complexes based on the maximum 
catalytic rate at the fixed TF concentration in the assay. Free 
ligand was calculated by subtracting the bound VIIa from 
the initial VIIa concentration in the assay. Binding param￾eters KD~~~ and B,,, were obtained by fitting the data to the 
single-site binding equation using the program Enzfitter 
(Elsevier Biosoft). Scatchard plots demonstrated a linear fit 
of the data for the mutants characterized in this study. The 
free energy of binding was calculated from the KDapp 
according to the formula AG = -RT ln(l/KDaPp) with a 
temperature of 37 "C. 
Localization of Residues in the Structure of TF. The three￾dimensional structure of the TF extracellular domain has 
recently been solved by crystallography (Harlos et al., 1994). 
The spatial organization of the residue side chains in the 
three-dimensional structure was analyzed on a Silicon 
Graphics Personal Iris using Insight I1 (Biosym, San Diego, 
CA). Accessible surface area was calculated using the 
program DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983). The calculations 
used the van der Waals radii for all atoms with a probe radius 
of 1.4 A.

RESULTS 
Spatial Alignment of Ligand Binding Residues at the 
Module Boundary. The recently solved crystal structure of 
the TF extracellular domain (Harlos et al., 1994) provided 
an opportunity to evaluate the spatial organization of the 
binding site for the macromolecular ligand VIIa. Previous 
analysis from our laboratory has defined three major 
independent contacts which are provided by residues IleZ2, 
Ly~~~/Asp~~, and A~-g'~~/"e''''' (Schullek et al., 1994). These 
five residues are exposed to solvent (Table 1) and located at 
the module boundary with LysZo, IleZ2, and Asp58 forming a 
continuous cluster on the surface of the amino-terminal 
module (Figure 1). Leu'33 is filling space between this 
cluster and the carboxy-terminal residue PheI4O. The Ala 
double exchange mutant at the Le~'~~Na1'~~ position had 
slightly reduced affinity for VIIa [AAG < 0.5 kcal/mol (Ruf 
et al., 1994)], suggesting that the exposed Leu'33 side chain 
makes subtle contributions to a continuous area for ligand 
binding at the module boundary.

We had previously characterized a TF mutant (Trp45/ 
SeF7-Arg/Gly) which had no apparent structural alterations 
and normal function by coagulation assay (Rehemtulla et 
al., 1992). Determination of the KD~~~ by functional titration 
assay demonstrated a 10-fold decreased affinity for binding 
of VIIa (Table 2), consistent with the previous observation 
that the relatively high concentration of VI1 in plasma can 
mask reduction in TF binding function (Ruf et al., 1994). 
The loss of binding function is attributable to the Trp45 
exchange, based on individual Ala replacement mutants 
(Table 2). These data provided evidence that the ligand 
binding region extends to a fairly remote contact point on 
the surface of the amino-terminal module of the TF extra￾cellular domain (Figure 1). 
Contributions of the Hydrophobic Cluster Residues to VIIa 
Binding. Trp45 is part of a hydrophobic surface cluster which 
also includes the aromatic side chains of Phe50, TyP, Phe76, 
and Tyrg4, as well as the aliphatic side chains of Val33 and 
Prog2 (Figure 2). Previous analysis excluded Pheso as a 
contact residue for VIIa binding (Ruf et al., 1994). We 
analyzed whether additional residues in this region are 
involved in interaction with VIIa by generating individual 
Ala replacements at the respective positions. TyP, Tyrg4, 
Val33, and Prog2 exhibited normal binding of VIIa, but the 
KD~~~ of VIIa binding for Phe76 and Tyr78 was increased 6- 
and 3-fold, respectively (Table 2). There was no evidence 
for a reduction in binding of conformation-dependent mono￾clonal antibodies to the mutants, consistent with the concept 
that Ala replacements for surface-exposed residues (Table 
1) are without effect on global folding of proteins. The 
decreased binding of VIIa by the Trp45, Phe76, and Tyr7s 
exchange mutants thus likely reflects loss of ligand contact, 
suggesting extension of the ligand interface to the convex￾shaped surface area at the edge of the three- and four￾stranded sheets (Figure 2). 
Identification of Novel Binding Residues in the Amino￾Terminal Module of TF. The surface between the hydro￾phobic residues and the major docking site at the module 
boundary is predominantly shaped by the side chains of 
residues Aspu, Gln37, SeF7, L Y S ~ ~ , L Y S ~ ~ , CYS~~, Asp6', and 
Ly& (Figure 3). The Aspu-Ala exchange resulted in a 
similar loss of binding as the Trp45 replacement, whereas 
the Gl~~~-Ala substitution was compatible with normal 6312 Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 19, 1995

binding of VIIa. The double mutant of Ly~~~/Lys~l bound 
VIIa with slightly reduced affinity (AAG < 0.5 kcavmol), 
based on previous analysis (Ruf et al., 1994) consistent with 
a potential contribution of to the ligand binding site. 
We had previously characterized the Cy~~~/Cys~~--Ser mutant 
by radioligand assay (Rehemtulla et al., 1991) and concluded 
that binding of VIIa is normal. Identical results were 
obtained for the analysis of the mutant by the functional Km 
assay (Table 2), demonstrating that the disulfide bond and 
the exposed sulfur atom are not critical to maintain the 
functional conformation of the binding site. Binding of VIIa 
was reduced following Ala replacements for Gln37 but not 
when the buried adjacent residues Val36 and Ile38 were 
exchanged. The binding site further includes with an 
estimated 1 kcavmol contribution to the free energy of 
binding (Table 2), but residues Asp61 and which form 
part of the surface of the intermodule cleft have been found 
to be dispensable for VIIa binding (Ruf et al., 1994). 
Surprisingly, Ala replacement for w, which is largely 
buried under the nonfunctional Asp6' side chain (Figure 3), 
resulted in a substantial loss of binding function (Table 2). 
The binding defect of Wo mutation was completely 
independent of the Phe" contact and partially additive with 
the mutation at Lys20. Attempts to express the AS~~~/T~F' 
double mutant at measurable levels in the eukaryotic cells 
failed, indicating that the Tfl side chain may have some 
structural significance. The observed functional defect for 
the individual ThPO-Ala exchange could thus reflect 
changes in the local packing of the binding interface at the 
module boundary. However, one cannot exclude interactions 
of the ThFO side chain with ligand, if the nonfunctional Asp61 
side chain reorients during ligand assembly. Tissue Factor Ligand Binding Site Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 19, 1995 6313

the individual exchanges (Table 2), indicating a common 
reciprocal contact on VIIa. Alternatively, the Trp45 side 
chain may provide local structural support for the orientation 
of the Asp4 side chain, rather than directly interacting with 
ligand. We had not obtained evidence for global structural 
alterations of the Trp45/SeF7-Arg/Gly mutant (Rehemtulla

normally by the Asp4-Ala exchange mutant (Figure 4).

provided energetic contributions independent from the Lys20, 
AspS8, ThflO, and Phe140 side chains. Full additivity was 
further displayed by the A~p~/Lys*~/Phe'~~ triple mutant, 
clearly demonstrating that Asp4 provides a contact which 
is unrelated to previously identified binding residues. This 
supports the overall conclusion that the binding site for VIIa 
significantly extends to the convex side on the amino￾terminal module. 
DISCUSSION 
This study provides a structure-based analysis of the 
surface area of TF which is involved in interaction with the 
macromolecular ligand VIIa. Previously and newly identi￾fied ligand binding residues are found dispersed over a region 
which extends from the concave side of the elbow angle at 
the module boundary to the convex site on the amino￾terminal module at the edge of the three- and four-stranded 
P-sheet (Figure 5). Most of the identified ligand binding 
residues are well exposed to solvent (Table l), and the 
accessible surface area for the major contacts Lys20, Ile22, 
Gln37, Asp4, Trp45, Lys4*, AspS8, Phe76, Tyr7*, Arg135, and 
Phe140 is 849 A2. The residue side chains of Ty$*, Pheso, 
Sef7, LYS~~, Asp61, LYS~~, and Leu133 (Figure 3) provide 
continuity between the contact residues and have a combined 
accessible surface area of 686 A2. Under the assumption of 
continuity in the interface, in excess of 1500 A2 may be 
buried when VIIa assembles, and more than half of this area 
Cri tical residue side chains are displaved a nd I abele :d to show the 
extent of the ligand interactive region and its orientation to the structure important for activation of the macromolecular substrate marked 
by LYS'~~. Tissue Factor Ligand Binding Site 
would be involved in significant energetic contacts. This 
surface area is larger than to the buried interfaces of the 
homologous growth hormone receptor which are 900- 1230 
A* (De Vos et al., 1992). 
We here characterize the binding defect of TF mutants 
based on the KDapp determined by functional titration assay. 
The estimates for the energetic contributions based on this 
assay may deviate somewhat from the absolute change in 
the free energy of binding, because of the presence of the 
macromolecular substrate factor X which is used to monitor 
TF-VIIa complex formation. However, mutants of TF 
previously characterized by this assay had demonstrated 
similar quantitative alterations in binding of VIIa by subse￾quent analysis using other methodology (Gibbs et al., 1994; 
Muller et al., 1994), indicating that the overall conclusions 
from this analysis are valid. The ligand binding site is 
characterized by a fairly continuous cluster at the module 
interface which provides an estimated one-third of the free 
energy of binding (Schullek et al., 1994), and additional 
residues at the concave side of the elbow, such as G~u~~ (Ruf 
et al., 1994) or Gln1Io (Gibbs et al., 1994), may further 
contribute, possibly accounting for up to one-half of the free 
energy of binding. Additional contributions are provided 
by the residues in the extension of the binding site on the 
convex-shaped surface of the amino-terminal module. This 
area for ligand binding has not been appreciated in previous 
mapping of a limited number of binding residues on the 
structure of TF (Muller et al., 1994; Harlos et al., 1994). 
Antibodies directed to this region are potent inhibitors of 
VIIa binding to TF (Ruf et al., 1991b), further emphasizing 
the crucial role of this extension of the ligand binding site. 
The significant contacts of LYS~~, Aspa, Phe76, Tyr78, and 
Gln3’ account for an additional one-third of the binding 
energy, indicating that the majority of binding contacts are 
presented in this study. Although there is an apparent 
clustering of energetically significant residues at the module 
boundary, the binding residues appear to be dispersed over 
a fairly extended surface. This is in contrast to the growth 
hormone receptor in which two spatially close aromatic side 
chains provide the majority of the binding energy (Clackson 
& Wells, 1995). 
The extended character of the TF ligand binding site might 
reflect adaptation to the multidomain ligand VIIa. Light 
chain modules of VIIa (Higashi et al., 1994; Toomey et al., 
1991; Clarke et al., 1992; Kazama et al., 1993; O’Brien et 
al., 1994; Ruf et al., 1991a) and the protease domain (Higashi 
et al., 1994; O’Brien et al., 1991; Matsushita et al., 1994) 
are involved in the interaction with TF. The groove-like 
shape of the module boundary and the convex surface 
surrounding Asp44 and the hydrophobic patch could provide 
the necessary shape complementarity for interaction with 
these structurally diverse modules of VLIa. The VIIa binding 
site on TF is located mostly at the opposite side relative to 
Lys165 and (Figure 5), which are critical residues for 
activation of macromolecular substrates without affecting the 
interaction with VIIa (Ruf et al., 1992). It is presently 
unknown how VIIa docks with TF to present the active site

for efficient recognition of the macromolecular substrates 
factors X and IX. The detailed insight into the structural 
basis for function of the TF ligand binding site provided here 
will further future studies to address the more complex 
questions of macromolecular assembly of substrate with the 
enzyme-cofactor complex.
