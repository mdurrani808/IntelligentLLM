The P1 or primary speci®city residue of standard mechanism canonical
protein inhibitors of serine proteinases, inserts into the S1 primary speci-
®city cavity of the cognate enzyme upon enzyme-inhibitor complex for￾mation. Both natural evolution and protein engineering often change the
P1 residue to greatly alter the speci®city and the binding strength. To sys￾tematize such results we have obtained all 20 coded P1 variants of one
such inhibitor, turkey ovomucoid third domain, by recombinant DNA
technology. The variants were extensively characterized. The association
equilibrium constants were measured at pH 8.30, 21 (2)C, for inter￾action of these variants with six well characterized serine proteinases
with hydrophobic S1 cavities. The enzyme names are followed by the
best, worst and most speci®c coded residue for each. Bovine chymotryp￾sin Aa (Tyr, Pro, Trp), porcine pancreatic elastase (Leu/Ala, Arg, Ala),
subtilisin Carlsberg (Cys, Pro, Glu), Streptomyces griseus proteinase A
(Cys, Pro, Leu) and B (Cys, Pro, Lys) and human leukocyte elastase (Ile,
Asp, Ile). The data set was merged with Ka values for ®ve non-coded
variants at P1 of turkey ovomucoid third domain obtained in our labora￾tory by enzymatic semisynthesis. The ratios of the highest to the lowest
Ka for each of the six enzymes range from 106 to 108
. The dominant force
for binding to these pockets is the hydrophobic interaction. Excess steric
bulk (too large for the pocket), awkward shape (Pro, Val and Ile),
polarity (Ser) oppose interaction. Ionic charges, especially negative
charges on Gluÿ and Aspÿ *Corresponding author are strongly unfavorable. The Pearson pro￾Present addresses: W. Lu, Scripps Research Institute, 10666 N. Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA; I.

Introduction
Substrate and inhibitor recognition by most serine
proteinases involves inter alia the binding of the P1
residue (see Figure 1 for explanation of Schechter
& Berger, 1967 numbering) to the S1 cavity of the
enzyme. This is probably the most famous of pro￾tein-protein recognition motifs. Millions of students
learn that trypsin is speci®c for Arg and Lys P1
side-chains because of the presence of Asp189 (chy￾motrypsinogen numbering) at the bottom of its S1
pocket. Similarly, chymotrypsin prefers Tyr, Trp,
Phe, Leu and Met P1 residues because of its com￾modious S1 pocket with neutral Ser189 at the bot￾tom of it.
Ovomucoid is a major glycoprotein in avian egg￾whites whose single polypeptide chain consists of
three tandem Kazal family{ domains, each with a
single, actual or putative, reactive site for inhibition
of serine proteinases (Kato et al., 1976, 1978, 1987).
Rhodes et al. (1960) showed that ovomucoids from
various, closely related species of birds exhibit
striking variation in inhibitory activity and speci-
®city. We have found that such variation persists
when third domains (Figure 1) are examined alone
(Empie & Laskowski, 1982; S. J. Park et al., unpub￾lished results) and that it is due to much more
rapid ®xation of mutations in the enzyme-inhibitor
contact region compared to the rest of the inhibitor
molecule (Laskowski et al., 1987; 1990; Apostol
et al., 1993). We have attributed this hypervariabil￾ity to positive Darwinian selection (Laskowski et al.,
1988).
The reasons for the choice of turkey ovomucoid
third domain as the wild type are the approxi￾mately equal inhibition of all six enzymes we
study and the ready availability. Ovomucoid third
domains are among the best studied of all small
proteins and of protein inhibitors of serine protein￾ases. The three-dimensional structures of two free
ovomucoid third domains, Japanese quail (Weber
et al., 1981; Papamokos et al., 1982) and silver
pheasant (Bode et al., 1985) were determined both
in virgin (reactive site intact) and in modi®ed (reac￾tive site hydrolyzed) forms (Musil et al., 1991). The
three-dimensional structures of complexes of tur￾key ovomucoid third domain with Streptomyces
griseus proteinase B (Fujinaga et al., 1982; Read
et al., 1983), human leukocyte elastase (Bode et al.,
1986) and bovine achymotrypsin (Fujinaga et al.,
1987) were also determined. There are several
Figure 1. Covalent structure of turkey ovomucoid third
domain (Laskowski et al., 1987). The - indicate disul®de
bridges. The numbering system, now widely employed
for all avian ovomucoid third domains, starts from the
hydrolysis site by Staphyloccocus aureus proteinase V8
(Weber et al., 1981). The arrow indicates the reactive site
peptide bond, which serves as the origin of Schecter &
Berger (1967) Pn, P0
n notation. The consensus set of resi￾dues that contact the enzyme in various complexes
(Apostol et al., 1993) is darkened. The P1 residue, Leu18
is in black. All 24 substitutions discussed in this paper
are at that position. Most variants studied were third
domains proper or the ``short forms'' 6-56. The natural
``long form'' has Leu1 Ala Ala Val Ser5 in the open
cirlces; the recombinant long form has Ala1 His Phe Ala
Met
5 in these positions. Wieczorek et al. (1987) and this
paper show that the presence or absence of either 1-5
peptide is without effect on Ka.

JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]more structures that are either unpublished or now
in progress, both in Martinsried and in Edmonton.
The most relevant to this paper is that Huang,
Bateman and James intend to obtain the structures
of all 20 coded X18 OMTKY3 in complex with
SGPB. Some of these structures e.g. Gly18, Ala18
and Leu18 (short form) are already completed
(Huang et al., 1995), many others await publication
(Huang, 1995; Bateman et al., 1996), others are in
re®nement. These studies as well as the interpret￾ation of the huge volume of thermodynamic data
available at Purdue lead to the following con￾clusions (1) residue 18 always serves as the P1 resi￾due even when its binding to the S1 cavity is
locally deleterious, (2) the changes in the inhibitor
and enzyme conformation on complex formation
are very small, nearly lock and key, (3) with the ex￾ception of Pro18, the nature of X18 has little effect
on the interaction between the enzyme and the re￾maining residues of the inhibitor. Thus, for our
purposes, the inhibitor-enzyme system serves as a
molecular vise. It positions X18 into the S1 cavity
and by subtraction of Gly18 data (see below) it al￾lows us to measure just the X18 ...S1 interaction.
We have already reported Ka values for 14 variants
of ovomucoid third domain at X18 (P1 residue) in￾teracting with six serine proteinases (Bigler et al.,
1993). Of these 14 variants, nine involved coded
residues, while ®ve were non-coded. Of the nine
coded variants, six were obtained directly, while
three were calculated from other data by making
(reasonable) additivity assumptions. Most of the
variants employed were generated by semisynth￾esis (Wieczorek & Laskowski, 1983).
Here, we describe a set of techniques announced
by us earlier (Lu et al., 1992) for the production of
coded ovomucoid third domain variants. We apply
these techniques to the production of all 20 coded

Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 443
JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]                                                                                                                                                      X18 ovomucoid third domain variants. We directly
measure the Ka values for all these, interacting
with the same six serine proteinases as employed
by Bigler et al. (1993). We combine our complete
set of 20 with the set of ®ve non-coded residues
(Abu, Ape, Ahx, Ahp and Hse) provided by Bigler
et al. (1993). The non-coded set Ka values were also
all obtained by direct measurements. The com￾bined set consists of 25  6  150 Ka values. It al￾lows for a great number of comparisons both
internally and to literature values. Only some of
these are provided below.
Results and Discussion
The Ka values
Table 1 lists the Ka values for all 20 coded variants
of X18OMTKY3. We were fortunate that in spite of
the huge range of these data (see below) all the
values ®t into our dynamic range of measurements
(roughly 103 Mÿ1 to 1013 Mÿ1
, the upper bound is
lower for some enzymes e.g. HLE). As was already
pointed out by Bigler et al. (1993) the set of all
coded amino acids allows for only a few structu￾rally simple pairwise comparisons. The homolo￾gous series e.g. Gly, Ala; Asp, Glu; Asn, Gln; Val,
Ile are only two residues long. Inclusion of only a
few well selected non-coded residues allows for
many more good pairwise comparisons and for
much longer series. The clear drawback is that one
always wants to add more non-coded members.
The set is never complete. Table 1 is augmented by
the values for ®ve non-coded variants obtained by
semisynthesis. Their Ka values with the same six
enzymes (Bigler et al., 1993) were measured by the
same technique and under the same conditions as
used for the coded set.
The ranges
We call the ratio of the highest to the lowest Ka for
each enzyme, the range for that enzyme. The
ratios, or more properly, their logarithms are
shown in Figure 2. When converted to free energy
differences, they range from 8.1 to 10.8 kcal/mol.
These values are similar to the total stability of the
native forms of many globular proteins.
The ranges given in the ®rst columns of Figure 2
include all the 25 side-chains we have studied.
However, (see below) Pro binds very weakly. As
Pro is not an amino acid in a chemical sense, we
provide a range for the 24 side-chains other than
Pro (second column of each set). This affects the re￾sults for the four enzymes for which Pro is the
smallest Ka entry. The set of 25 side-chains in
Figure 2 is largely arbitrary. In sharp contrast, the
set of all coded amino acid side-chains is complete.
Therefore, we also provide the values of ranges for
the set of all coded amino acid side-chains with
(third columns) and without Pro (fourth columns).
Obviously, decreasing the size of the set decreases
the ranges in some cases but the important con￾clusion is that they remain very large.
Isofunctional residue clusters
In view of the huge ranges, plotting of the
data in Table 1 requires some compression and
the logarithmic compression seemed best. It was
implemented by converting the Ka values to
ÿ Go
(X18)a  RTlnKa, where T  294 K. The results
are plotted in Figure 3. Only coded residues are
listed in order to reduce the crowding of the
Figure. Note, however, that the entries in Figure 3
are not evenly spaced. Instead, for each enzyme
there are clusters of isofunctional residues with
nearly the same ÿ Go
(X18)a. One might expect that
the side-chains in isofunctional clusters should be
closely related. Frequently, they are related, but
often they are strikingly different. As pointed out
by Bigler et al. (1993), the value ÿ Go
(X18
)a is de￾termined by opposing in¯uences of hydrophobicity
on one hand and of steric bulk, branching, polarity
and charge on the other. The ®nding of isofunc￾tional clusters is important for at least two reasons.
One of these reasons is the study of positive
Darwinian selection (Laskowski et al., 1988) of the
contact residues in standard mechanism canonical
inhibitors of serine proteinases. In most such in￾hibitors, the residues which are in contact with the
enzyme in the enzyme ±inhibitor complex are
hypervariable. This phenomenon is especially
pronounced in the Kazal inhibitor family and par￾ticularly so among the avian ovomucoid third
domains (Laskowski & Kato, 1980; Laskowski et al.,
Figure 2. The Ka ranges expressed as the difference in
logarithms. (&) All side-chains of Table 1. (&jjj ) All but

444 Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities
JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97] 1987, 1988; Creighton & Darby, 1989). Avian ovo￾mucoid third domains from 153 species were se￾quenced. At P1 position, 11 different residues,
more than at any other position in the third
domain, were found. The composition is Leu65.5,
Met60, Ala6.5, Gln5, Val4.5, Thr3, Pro3, Lys2, Ser1.5,
Gly1 and Ile1 (Apostol et al., 1993){ Inspection of
Figure 3 shows that some of the best (Leu, Met for
PPE, CARL, SGPA and SGPB) and worst (Pro) resi￾dues are represented.{ Thus, either the target en￾zyme for the ovomucoid third domains changes
among the species examined or the equilibrium
constant for inhibition of a constant target enzyme
undergoes a very large change.
It is worth noting that for almost all of the en￾zymes, Leu and Met form an almost isofunctional
pair. Leu and Met are the two most highly popu￾lated (43% and 39%, respectively) members of the
P1 residue set. It is probable that the evolutionary
changes between Leu and Met at P1 are not
selective but neutral. A more familiar example is
the frequent variation between P1 Lys and P1 Arg
in inhibitors whose target enzyme is clearly tryp￾sin, for example, pancreatic secretory trypsin in￾hibitors (Kazal). In these inhibitors the Arg  Lys
mutations are selectively neutral. However, while
isofunctional clusters explain a part of the observed
hypervariability, they do not explain it all. Ka
values of ovomucoid third domains from closely
related species show striking variations (Empie &
Laskowski, 1982; Park, 1985; Wynn 1990; Lu,
1994). The implications of the existance of isofunc￾tional clusters upon scanning techniques of protein
engineering such as the alanine scan (Cunningham
& Wells, 1989; Clackson & Wells, 1995) have
already been discussed by Bigler et al. (1993).
Gly18 as a standard
The set of ÿ Go
a (X18
) in Figure 3 re¯ects the vari￾ation of binding free energy with the nature of the
P1 residue. However, the set lacks a zero value. It
seems natural to choose Gly18 as a reference and to
assert that side-chains, whose ÿ Go
a (X18) is greater
than ÿ Go
a (Gly18), make a positive contribution to
binding while the others are deleterious. There are
two possible objections to this choice. The ®rst is
that inhibitors with P1 Gly may not bind to the S1
subsite of some enzymes but instead place a more
favorable residue in that subsite. Huang et al.
(1995) determined the three-dimensional structure
of Gly18 OMTKY3-SGPB complex. Gly18 clearly
binds to the S1 subsite. The second objection is
Figure 3. Data for the 20 coded side-chains plotted as ÿ Go
a(X18) at pH 8.30. The strong binders are at the top, the
weak binders are at the bottom. Crowded regions are isofunctional clusters discussed in the text. The relative values
for the non-ionizable residues are expected to be unaffected by pH. For ionizable residues they change dramatically.
{ The subscripts denote the number of species in
which the P1 residue was found. The fractions arise
because for species in which the P1 residue was found
to be dimorphic each of the two dimorphic residues was
given an arbitrary weight of 0.5.
{ In these considerations we disregard Cys as it is not
present in its reduced form in any of the contact
positions in standard mechanism canonical inhibitors.
The disul®de bridged homodimer of Cys18 OMTKY3 is
inactive.
Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 445
JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]based on greater ¯exibility of glycyl residues com￾pared to all other residues, as Gly lacks a b-carbon.
There is no available three-dimensional structure
of a free, canonical protein inhibitor with Gly at P1
position. One might speculate that the main-chain
of such free inhibitors might be more ¯exible at the
P1 Gly position than the main-chains of inhibitors
with other residues at P1. Upon complex for￾mation, the main-chain would rigidify (it is known
to be normal in Gly18 OMTKY3-SGPB complex,
Huang et al. 1995). This would entail a free energy
cost and therefore the use of Gly18 as a standard
would not be fair. Huang et al. (1995) showed that
the observed ÿ  Go
a (Gly18X) values are linearly
dependent upon the buried hydrophobic surface
area and therefore, excluded this objection to Gly18
as a standard.
The large values of Ka for Gly18 variants (Table 1)
and of ÿ Go
a (Gly18
) (Figure 3) are an indication
that binding of the P1 side-chain to S1 cavity is not
the only important energetic contribution to com￾plex formation. The interaction of the remaining 11
consensus contact side-chains (Apostol et al., 1993)
and of the main-chain make a very signi®cant con￾tribution. It is this contribution that is clearly re￾sponsible for directing the P1 side-chains to the S1
subsite even when their individual interaction is
neutral (Gly18) or deleterious. The ®nding that the
Ka and the ÿ Go
a (Gly18) values are similar for the
six enzymes may be a coincidence arising from
the choice of turkey ovomucoid third domain as
the wild-type. Of the six enzymes we study, Gly18
variant is weakest for chymotrypsin. Yet, turkey
ovomucoid third domain contains Arg21 (P3
0
)
which is exceptionally favorable for chymotrypsin
(Lu, 1994). Were Arg21 changed to another resi￾due, Ka values for the Gly18 variants would no
longer be approximately equal. Chymotrypsin's Ka
would be much weaker than those of the rest.
It is interesting to note that one natural ovomucoid
third domain (tawny frogmouth, Australian bird
belonging to the goatsucker family) has Gly at P1
position (Apostol et al., 1993). It is a moderately
good inhibitor of PPE, CARL and SGPB. It is likely
that its true target enzyme has a very small or non￾existent S1 pocket.
Binding of Pro18
Pro18 is very poor and deleterious compared to
Gly18 for all the enzymes we study. It is the worst
member of the set for all but the two elastases.
Elastases have small S1 cavities. Therefore, large
and charged residues are also very deleterious.
Modeling suggests that Pro18 side-chain is dif®cult
to wedge into the S1 pocket. Furthermore, the N

JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]      atom of Pro18 cannot approach the enzyme as clo￾sely as the atoms of other P1 residues. A complex
of Pro18 OMTKY3 with SGPB has been crystallized
and a high resolution structure was obtained (K.
Huang, W. L., M. L., S. A. & M. N. G. James, un￾published results). This complex differs from the
complexes with all other residues at P1. In the
other complexes, the positions of all contact resi￾dues, other than P1, are superimposable. In the
Pro18 complex some of these residues make small
motions to aid in the wedging of P1 Pro into the S1
pocket. Since Pro is the only member of our set
that is not an amino acid in the chemical sense,
neither a strictly isosteric nor a strictly isomeric
comparison is possible. However, Ape is nearly a
Pro isomer. Comparisons of Ka values for all six
enzymes for Ape18 and Pro18 is given in the ®rst
row of Table 2.
Since Pro18 is so deleterious, it is surprising that it
was found three times among the 153 species of
birds whose ovomucoid third domains were se￾quenced (Apostol et al., 1993). The Pro18 containing
species are black night heron and the two species
of cassowaries we examined. Furthermore, in alli￾gator ovomucoid, which consists of four Kazal
domains (March, 1980), the third domain has Pro
at P1 position. Over the last 15 years we have
tested alligator ovomucoid and the P1 Pro contain￾ing avian third domains for inhibition of likely tar￾gets such as prolyl endopeptidases. None was
effective.
Effect of residue size on binding
Consider a homologous (in a chemical sense)
series of amino acid side-chains Gly, Ala, Abu,
Ape, Ahx and Ahp. The last four entries are
from Bigler et al. (1993), who also had Ala but
not Gly, an important residue. Technical pro￾blems also prevented Bigler et al. (1993) from
going beyond Ahp but they chose to add Phe to
the series. We further add Tyr and Trp and plot
the ÿ  Go
(Gly18X) values versus the number of
non-hydrogen atoms in the side-chain.
For all six enzymes ÿ  Go increases (Figure 4)
with the number of atoms in the side-chain, rises
to a maximum and then declines. The qualitative
explanation is straightforward. All six pockets are
hydrophobic. Increasing the size increases the hy￾drophobicity of the residues in this series. Thus,
binding improves with increasing size. However,
all pockets are ®nite. As the pocket size is ex￾ceeded, energy consuming changes must be made
to accommodate the oversized side-chain.
This qualitative explanation is suf®cient to empha￾size the point made by Bigler et al. (1993) that the
ÿ  Go
(Gly18X) values are frequently a result of
two large and opposing terms, exempli®ed by
hydrophobicity and inelasticity of the too small
pocket. As a result, a small and a large residue
may turn out to have the same ÿ  Go
(Gly18X)
values. As will be seen below, branching, polarity
and charge also can oppose hydrophobic bonding,
thus leading to some truly unexpected isofunc￾tional sets (Figure 3).
A good start was made in quantitative treatment
of the ascending sides of Figure 4. Huang et al.
(1995) measured the buried hydrophobic surface
area for the Gly18-, Ala18-, Abu18-, Ape18-, Ahx18-,
and Ahp18 OMTKY3 complexes{ with SGPB. Our
ÿ  Go
(Gly18X) values were then plotted versus 
(the buried hydrophobic surface area) yielding an
impressive straight line (Figure 8 of Huang et al.,
1995) with a slope of 34.1 cal/mol per AÊ 2
. As
discussed by Huang et al. (1995), this value for
hydrophobic strength is intermediate among the
Figure 4.The values of ÿ  Go (Gly18X) for 20 coded
and ®ve non-coded amino acid residues obtained at
21o
C, pH 8.3. The homologous series of residues Gly,
Ala, Abu, Ape, Ahx and Ahp is extended by hydro￾phobic Phe, Tyr and Trp and plotted against the num￾ber of non-hydrogen atoms in the side-chains. These are
a rough measure of both hydrophobicity and of steric
bulk.
{ The structures of complexes with Gly18 and Ala18
were experimentally determined. Those with the non￾coded amino acids were only modeled as the Purdue
group was unable to supply suf®cient quantity of these
variants (Bigler et al. 1993) for X-ray crystallography of
complexes.
Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 447
JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]currently proposed values in the literature.
Huang et al. (1995) modeled the same series of
complexes for SGPA and CHYM. Excellent straight
ÿ  Go
(Gly18X) versus  (buried hydrophobic
surface area) lines with slopes ranging from 34 to
40 cal/mol per AÊ 2 were obtained. The Huang et al.
(1995) straight lines arise from the  (hydrophobic
buried surface area) results increasing less than lin￾early with the number of non-hydrogen atoms of
the side-chains. This non-linearity matches the
non-linearity of the ascending sides in the plots of
Figure 4 to produce the straight lines. Therefore,
the hydrophobic contribution to binding cannot be
simply calculated from a formula with a linear de￾pendence on the number of methylene groups in
the side-chain.
The P1 side-chains of free inhibitors are highly ex￾posed and very mobile. Upon insertion in the S1
cavity of the enzyme they become highly re￾stricted. This was recently demonstrated in the SSI￾subtilisin system by deuterium NMR studies
(Tamura et al., 1996). This restriction is associated
with an entropy loss (Doig & Sternberg, 1995).
Clearly, such an entropy loss must arise in our
homologous series of side-chains. Presumably, it is
one of the many effects that are incorporated into
the   Go
(Gly18X) versus  (buried surface area)
correlation.
We know much less about the descending side of
the ÿ  Go
(Gly18X) plots. In the case of SGPB,
Phe18-, Tyr18 and Trp18- bind less well than
Leu18- in spite of greater buried hydrophobic sur￾face area. Bateman et al. (1996) obtained the
structures of these complexes and showed that
the aromatic side-chains ®t without distorting the
S1 pocket. Why then do they bind more poorly
than the less hydrophobic Leu18? In order to ®t
in without distorting the pocket, they adopt an
unfavorable w2 angle. Bateman et al. (1996) calcu￾late that this uncommon angle costs about 3kcal/
mol, somewhat more than is needed to explain
the decline in binding of the aromatic residues
compared to Leu18.
The most dramatic descents occur for the two elas￾tases, PPE and HLE. The P1 preference of both en￾zymes is very similar, as judged by Pearson
product moment correlation (see below). Their
maximal ÿ  Go
(Gly18X) residues are essentially
the same; however, the descending sides differ
strongly. The descent in PPE is much steeper than
in HLE. This extends to the more complex residues
as well. Our conclusion is that HLE pocket is much
more ¯exible than that of PPE. The conclusion that
the S1 pocket of HLE is more ¯exible than those of
the ®ve other enzymes is reached here on three
different bases. The other two are the preference
for Val and Ile, of which the other enzymes are in￾tolerant and the non-additivity seen only in HLE.
These two effects are discussed below. Further￾more, Bode et al. (1989) have already concluded on
the basis of X-ray crystallographic studies that
HLE's S1 pocket is more ¯exible than PPE's. It is
clear that more structures involving both PPE and
HLE will be needed to resolve these problems. The
sharp decline, especially for PPE, does not continue
for the largest residues. Instead, there is a levelling
out toward a relatively constant low value. It's
cause is unknown.
Other amino acid side-chains
Figure 5 provides an elementary classi®cation of
amino acid side-chains. These are ®rst divided into
two groups. The ®rst contains only carbon and hy￾drogen atoms. The second contains in addition het￾eroatoms (oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen). They are
next divided into straight and branched chains. In
analyzing the various groups above we resort
whenever possible to binary comparisons between
isomers and isosteres.
As pointed out by Bigler et al. (1993), most points
in Figure 4 fall below rather than above the solid
line consisting of hydrophobic, straight chain side￾chains. This observation, however, is now some￾what less striking than it was in Bigler et al. (1993),
since Cys is often better than Abu, and Ile is better
than Ahx for HLE. Neither side-chain was avail￾able in the earlier study. The second interesting as￾pect is that the large range for CHYM is achieved
mainly above the Gly zero line, i.e. it is the strong
improvement in binding from Gly to Tyr that ac￾counts for most of the range. The very large range
for PPE is mostly achieved below the line as some
substituents are very deleterious.

P, Proline is not an amino acid

classi®cation.
448 Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities
JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]Branching
Of the 20 coded amino acid side-chains, 13 are
branched (Figure 5). For aliphatic, hydrophobic re￾sidues, the presence or absence of branching such
as Ape/Val, Ahx/Leu and Ahx/Ile comparisons
or the position of branching (Leu/Ile) have only
small effects on the transfer free energy from
water to organic solvent (e.g. Radzicka &
Wolfenden, 1988 and references therein). Such re￾sults are simple to rationalize. The surface areas
of unbranched and variously branched isomers
are closely similar and the cavities in the solvents
readily adjust to different shapes of the side￾chains. The branching problem was also ad￾dressed for residues buried in the protein interior.
Sturtevant, Richards and their co-workers are en￾gaged in a major study of binding of X13 S-pep￾tide variants to ribonuclease S-protein to yield
X13 ribonuclease S complexes. They determine
three-dimensional structures and  Go
,  Ho and
 Cpo of binding of the variants. In a recent
paper, they write: ``substitution of wild-type
methionine at position 13, with either leucine or
isoleucine, unsurprisingly produces little or no
change in the free energy of association'' (Thom￾son et al., 1994). While we are unable to ®nd
equally strongly worded quotes in the other
papers, we believe that this quote fairly sum￾marizes the work of Kellis et al. (1988, 1989),
Matsumura et al. (1988), Shortle et al. (1990),
Sandberg & Terwilliger (1991), Eriksson et al.
(1992), Serrano et al. (1992) and Matthews (1993).
These data are rather compactly organized and
discussed by Lee (1993). Interchanges of Ahx
(when available), Met, Leu and Ile have no effect
upon the free energy of stabilization of the in￾teriors of globular proteins. These results, in turn,
are consistent with the considerable liquid-like
adaptability of the protein interiors.
In spite of considerable similarities between the
effects of side-chains on the stabilization of pro￾teins and of binding to the S1 cavity of serine
proteinases, the effects of branching are sharply
different. Grùn et al. (1992) summarize their wide
reading of the proteolytic enzyme literature by
`` . . . substrates with b branched amino acids Val
and Ile at P1 are very poor. This inef®ciency in
cleaving substrates with a b-branched P1 residue
is common to many proteolytic enzymes . . . ''.
Note that they properly extend the ®eld beyond
that of serine proteinases. They cite numerous re￾ferences and we could add many more. We are,
however, aware of at least two exceptions. One is
human leukocyte elastase, discussed below. The
other is the interaction between carboxypeptidase
A and potato chymotrypsin inhibitor, where b￾branched P1 residues are preferred to their iso￾mers (Molina et al., 1994).
The contrast between Leu and Ile being isofunc￾tional (protein thermodynamicists) and Ile being
greatly inferior (enzymologists of proteinases)
gives a strong feeling of two cultures. We assume
that the explanation lies in the far greater rigidity
of preformed cavities than of protein interiors.
The Ahx/Leu ratios in Table 2 are all relatively
small. The greatest deviations from unity (but
still less than an order of magnitude) are for the
two elastase PPE and HLE, where packing of
these side-chains into a small cavity is the over￾riding concern. The relative Ahx/Leu equivalence
aids those who wish to discuss the S1 cavity
phenomenon using only coded variants. They can
talk about the Leu/Ile ratio almost as if it were
Ahx/Ile.
Now let us turn to the Ape/Val ratio, where Val is
highly deleterious for the ®rst ®ve enzymes. It is
slightly favorable for HLE. The deleterious effects
range from 2 to 3 kcal/mol. The comparison be￾tween Ahx/Ile is a repeat; except, now the unfa￾vorable effect is an order of magnitude higher as is
the favorable effect for HLE. The Leu/Ile compari￾son restates the results; except, now in three cases
the ratio reaches 2000, a large effect indeed. The
reason seems simple. It is much easier to pack in
the Ahx and the g-branched Leu residue than the
b-branched Val and Ile.
It is easy to conclude from these data that all
b branching is highly deleterious, except for HLE.
However, this conclusion becomes tempered by
the next entry, the Hse/Thr comparison. While
Thr is deleterious for four enzymes and advan￾tageous for the two elastases: PPE and HLE, the
effects are quite modest. The relevant X-ray struc￾tures are not yet analyzed but an attractive expla￾nation is that the environment into which the
additional b-branched group is forced is some￾what polar, such as a peptide bond, thus explain￾ing the relative preference of -OH versus -CH3 at
this position. The direct comparison of isosteric
Val/Thr below con®rms this speculation, but
clearly only the structures can decide. The con￾trast between the strong aversion to Ile by ®ve of
the enzymes and a weak preference for Ile by
HLE is the second of our three arguments for
¯exibility of HLE S1 pocket.
Neutral, heteroatom containing side-chains
Whereas, some heteroatom containing side-chains
are neutral (Ser, Thr, Hse, Met, Asn, Gln) over the
whole accessible pH range, others are ionizable.
Such side-chains are involved in a pH-dependent
equilibrium between their protonated and deproto￾nated forms. For these amino acids, one of the two
forms is always neutral. We designate this form
Aspo
, Gluo
, Cyso
, Tyro
, Hiso
, Lyso and Argo
. Equili￾brium constants Ka for such forms describe the
binding of the inhibitor, in which the P1 residue is
in Xo form yielding a complex in which the P1 resi￾due remains in the Xo form. Such constants can be
readily compared to those of neutral side-chains.
A preliminary analysis suggests that Ka values at
pH 8.30 for His, Cys, and Tyr are for the Hiso
,
Cyso and Tryo forms as de®ned above. Tyr was
already treated as Tyro in the discussion of size
Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 449
JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]effects. In this section Cys is treated as Cyso
. Unfor￾tunately, we have no appropriate isostere for His
comparison.
The Abu/Ser ratio is quite large for all six
enzymes. As might have been expected, the
-CH3 * -OH replacement is deleterious. The large
effect is somewhat surprising. For example, Ser is a
poorer binder than Ala for all six enzymes. It is
also striking that Ser is particularly deleterious
for the two elastases, PPE and HLE. We offer no
explanation. The very deleterious effect of the
-CH3 * -OH replacement does not persist for the
Val/Thr substitution. In fact, Thr is better than Val
for PPE and much better than Val for CARL. It is
virtually equivalent for CHYM, SGPA and SGPB.
Only in the case of HLE is Thr signi®cantly deleter￾ious when compared to Val. In the discussion of
branching, we noted that Val was quite deleterious
compared to Ape for all of our enzymes except
HLE (see Table 2). As Thr is smaller than Val, its
steric hindrance problems might be smaller. It may
also be that b branching forces one of the g-methyl
groups in Val into a slightly polar environment.
Such an environment might be better tolerated by
the g OH group of Thr. The Val/Thr comparison is
another contrast between our rigid pocket results
and the stabilization of ¯exible interiors of globular
proteins where Val is much better than Thr
(Matthews, 1993).
Another case where the very large -CH3 * -OH
effect is not observed is the Ape/Hse comparison.
In this case, Ape is appreciably better than Hse,
but about an order of magnitude less good than
the Abu/Ser ratio. As might have been anticipated,
Leu is much better for the six hydrophobic pockets
than Asn. Note that there one oxygen and one ni￾trogen atom substitute for the two carbon atoms. It
is startling to us that Leu is very closely similar to
Aspo in the binding to SGPB. The three-dimen￾sional structures of both members of this pair
(Huang et al., 1995; Huang, 1995) are available. Be￾fore offering an interpretation, we would like to
have Leu/Aspo ratios for the remaining ®ve en￾zymes. Such work is now in progress.
In strong contrast to the -CH3 ! -OH replacement
in Abu, the -CH3 * -SH replacement in this side￾chain generally favors Cys over Abu, by relatively
large factors for SGPA and SGPB. Only the two
elastases PPE and HLE favor Abu. The strong pre￾ference for Cys over Abu makes Cys the best P1 re￾sidue for CARL and SGPB and the best coded
residue for SGPA (non-coded Ahp is better). This
®nding may be of physiological interest. It is poss￾ible that hydrolysis of P1 Cys bonds in their sub￾strates is an important role of some bacterial
enzymes provided that they act in reducing en￾vironments. The substitution of -CH3 * -SH yields
ratios that differ from the -CH2- ! -S-substitutions.
The comparison between Ahx and Met was ad￾dressed by Bigler et al. (1993). The current paper
does not offer any additional relevant data. There￾fore, only the results are given in Tables 1 and 2
and in Figures 3 and 4.
The remaining isosteric comparisons deal with the
replacement by a nitrogen atom. Both Aspo and
Gluo bind signi®cantly more strongly to the SGPB
pocket than do their amides. The Aspo
/Asn ratio
(2.8 kcal) is particularly large. In this case, the
structural comparisons based on X-ray structures
(Huang, 1995) are already available. We await the
Aspo
/Asn ratios for several more S1 pockets as the
pH dependence analysis was only completed for
SGPB (Qasim et al. 1995). The Ahx/Lyso ratio re-
¯ecting the -CH3 * -NH2 substitution seems very
small to us. This may well be true as (see below)
SGPB has a very large preference for Lys, com￾pared to the other ®ve enzymes.
pH dependence
Our data were obtained at pH 8.30. The Ka va￾lues for OMTKY3 associating with any of the six
enzymes we study are pH-dependent. An import￾ant question is whether the relative Ka values for
the various P1 variants are pH-independent and
therefore, general. For the non-ionizable P1 resi￾dues the answer seems to be that they are pH-in￾dependent for the six enzymes we study. What
about ionizable residues? For some of these, the
relative Ka values are clearly highly pH-depen￾dent. Let us consider the simplest possible situ￾ation. Because the P1 residue in the free inhibitor
is known to be highly exposed, it ionizes inde￾pendently of the other residues of the inhibitor.
Its ionization is characterized by a simple ioniz￾ation constant, Kf
, where f stands for free inhibi￾tor. Similarly, in complex with one of the six
enzymes we study here, the P1 residue is im￾bedded in a hydrophobic cavity and it does not
interact with other ionizable groups of the en￾zyme or of the inhibitor. Therefore, its ionization
is characterized by a simple constant, Kc, where c
stands for complex. Given these assumptions, we
can write (Qasim et al., 1995).
R  Kio nizable
a
Kno nio nizable

1  Kf
H
1
where R is the ratio of Ka with an ionizable P1
residue to the Ka with a non-ionizable P1 residue.
At very low pH ([H]4 Kc, [H]4 Kf
) it clearly
follows that R  Ro
. Ro is the ratio between as￾sociation constant Ka for the ionizable P1 in its
fully protonated form both in the free inhibitor
and in complex and Ka for the nonionizable P1
residue. For the uncharged amino acids Asp, Glu,
Cys and Tyr this is the Aspo
, Gluo
, Cyso and
Tyro form we have already discussed. However,
for the cationic amino acid side-chains, His, Lys
and Arg, this is the His, Lys and Arg form.
At very high pH, where [H] is very small, the
limit of R in equation (1) is Ro  (Kc/Kf
). At the
high pH limit, we are measuring the ratio of the
equilibrium constant for binding of the deproto￾nated P1 side-chain, both in the complex and in
450 Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities
JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97] the free inhibitor, to that of the non-ionizable re￾ference side-chain. Speci®cally, we deal here with
the Aspÿ, Gluÿ, Cysÿ and Tyrÿ constants for un￾charged side-chains and with Hiso
, Lyso and
Argo for the cationic side-chains.
The effect of charge
For each of the seven ionizable amino acid residues
(Figure 5), we can make an isosteric comparison
such as Aspo
/Aspÿ and Lyso
/Lys. However, va￾lues are now available only for the four cases (all
in SGPB) for which the full pH dependence of Ka
was determined (Qasim et al., 1995 and unpub￾lished; Table 2). It is seen there that the uncharged
form of each of these four side-chains binds to the
S1 cavity of SGPB much more strongly than the
charged form. This is true for both uncharged
(Asp, Glu) and cationic (His, Lys) members of the
set. We strongly expect that it would also be true if
the data were available for Cys, Tyr and Arg. Simi￾larly, we expect that it also would be true for all
seven ionizable side-chain binding not just to
SGPB but to all S1 cavities that are studied here. In￾deed, we have a signi®cant number of preliminary
data con®rming these conclusions.
The P1 side-chains in all standard mechanism cano￾nical protein inhibitors of serine proteinases are
highly exposed to solvent (Read & James, 1986;
Bode & Huber, 1992). Therefore, when the P1 side￾chain is charged, the charge resides in a high di￾electric medium. Upon transfer to the hydrophobic
S1 cavity of one of the six enzymes we study, it is
forced to reside in a much lower dielectric environ￾ment. Transfers of a charge from high to low di￾electric are strongly disfavored (Born, 1920). This
provides a satisfying qualitative explanation for
the preference for neutral over both positive and
negative charges.
However, the neutral forms of both types of ioniz￾able residues will not be favored by all S1 cavities
in all serine proteinases. We expect trypsin (with a
negative S1 pocket due to the presence of Asp189)
to strongly favor Lys over Lyso and to disfavor
Aspÿ compared to Aspo
. Similarly, we expect posi￾tive S1 cavities of enzymes such as (Glu Sgp) the
glutamic acid speci®c Streptomyces griseus protein￾ase (Yoshida et al., 1988; Komiyama et al., 1991;
Nienaber et al., 1993) to strongly favor Gluÿ over
Gluo and to disfavor Lys over Lyso
.
Returning to Table 2, we note that the Aspo
/Aspÿ
and Gluo
/Gluÿ ratios are truly huge, exceeding
four and approaching ®ve orders of magnitude.
On the other hand, the Hiso
/His and especially
Lyso
/Lys ratios, while still quite large, are much
more modest. SGPB appears to favor the cationic
residues His, Lys and Arg far more than the other
®ve enzymes (see below). However, it still appears
that the Aspo
/Aspÿ and Gluo
/Gluÿ ratios for
CHYM are much larger than the Lyso
/Lys ratio.
We tentatively conclude that while the primary
effect we are observing is the change in the dielec￾tric constant, there is a secondary effect in all six
enzymes we study, relatively favoring positive
charges and disfavoring negative charges on the
buried P1 side-chains. Clearly, more data are re￾quired.
Preliminary measurements suggest that for all six
enzymes we study, the Ka values at pH 8.3 are for
Hiso
, Cyso
, Tyro and Arg. On the other hand, we
are still awaiting pKc measurements for Asp, Glu
and Lys for enzymes other than SGPB. We were
clearly hasty to suggest (Bigler et al., 1993) that
these residues were in their charged form at pH
8.3.
Specificity of serine proteinases
We have thus far focused on the comparisons
within columns of Table 1, addressing such ques￾tions as the best and worst residues, isofunctional
clusters, Leu/Ile ratio, uncharged/charged ratio,
all for a particular enzyme. In this section, we ad￾dress questions involving within row comparison
and a related column to other columns compari￾son. We have (Laskowski et al., 1989) de®ned the
concept of the most speci®c residue for each en￾zyme. This most speci®c residue is not just a func￾tion of the target enzyme but also of all the other
members of the enzyme set under consideration. In
view of that, our set of six enzymes is so highly ar￾bitrary that it can almost be regarded as capricious.
Sets of all human serine proteinases or of all serine
proteinases from organisms likely to infect eggs
are probably much more reasonable sets to investi￾gate. Proceeding in the manner recommended by
Laskowski et al. (1989), we have selected for each
of the six enzymes a P1 residue that is the most
speci®c within our set. These are boxed in Table 1.
For CHYM, it is Trp, not the best Tyr. The reason
is that CHYM has the largest S1 pocket of the six
enzymes. Therefore, while changing Tyr18 to Trp18
is only slightly poorer for CHYM, it is appreciably
poorer for the nearest competitor, SGPA. While
Trp18 is actually better than Tyr18 for PPE, this is
without signi®cance because both Tyr18 and Trp18
are much too large for PPE and HLE. For PPE,
with a very small pocket, our choice was Ala18
(Abu18 is a close competitor). The reasoning is es￾sentially the same as for CHYM, except in reverse;
small residue for a small pocket. We found the
choice of Glu (at pH 8.3, please remember that
relative binding constants of ionizable residues de￾pend upon pH) for CARL somewhat startling. We
did not expect it. However, Glu is much better for
CARL than for any other enzyme in the set. While
SGPA and SGPB are sister enzymes with closely
similar speci®cities, for most P1 residues SGPA has
higher Ka values by about a factor of 10 or more.
Therefore, the problem of ®nding the most speci®c
residue for SGPA is largely reduced to ®nding a
moderately large residue that was better for SGPA
than for CHYM. Ahp18 ®ts the bill. Note that if a
coded residue was required Leu would also work.
Because SGPA is typically more strongly inhibited
than SGPB, dif®culty in ®nding a most speci®c P1
Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 451
JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]residue for SGPB was expected. However, we note
in Table 1 that at pH 8.30, the three ionizable, cat￾ionic variants Lys18, His18, and Arg18 inhibit SGPB
better than SGPA. Lys18 was chosen as most
speci®c for SGPB. The ®nding that all cationic side￾chains prefer SGPB to SGPA raises a question. Is
the effect due to positive charges{, to nitrogenous
substituents or to both. It seems clear that in bind￾ing to SGPB at pH 8.30 we deal with Arg and
Hiso
. Lys (pKc  8.7) is an intermediate case. Com￾parisons will become much easier when more pKc
values for the other S1 pockets are determined. The
most speci®c and also the best P1 residue for HLE
is Ile. Much of this paper was already concerned
with the abhorrence of b-branched aliphatic resi￾dues by the ®rst ®ve enzymes in Table 1. In con￾trast, HLE ®nds such residues better than their
straight chain and g-branched counterparts.
Aside from picking out the most speci®c residue
for each enzyme, we can instead think of each col￾umn in Table 1 as a vector in 25-dimensional
amino acid space. If we restrict the set to coded
amino acids only, the space reduces to the more
familiar 20-dimensional amino acid space. How￾ever, if we were to leave the entries as equilibrium
constants, the small ones (see Figures 2 and 3)
would have no measurable effect on the direction
of the vector, which would be determined by the
highest value or a few highest values. This is
avoided when logarithms of Ka(X18) or association
free energies,  Go (X18), are considered. Therefore,
Figure 3 is the appropriate reduction of data of
Table 1, as it both restricts to the coded set and
provides free energies of association. The restric￾tion to the coded set is easy to justify as protein￾ases act on substrates in which the residues are
overwhelmingly members of the coded set with
but a few post-translationally modi®ed outliers.
With the data of Figure 3 in hand, there are numer￾ous procedures for calculating the relationship be￾tween the vectors given by the columns. We are
still evaluating these procedures. The Pearson pro￾duct-moment correlation (Campbell, 1989), is very
familiar and we employ it here:

In the speci®c application in this section the index,

position 18 in X18OMTKY3, n is 20, the number of
kinds of coded amino acids. x values are
ÿ Go
a(X18) values for the interaction with one of
the enzymes and the y values are for the inter￾action with the other.
Table 3 is a list of all the possible pairwise com￾parisons for six enzymes. As expected, the closely
related SGPA and SGPB have the most positive
r value (0.96). The next closest relationship is be￾tween PPE and HLE (0.94), in spite of differences
that appear to arise from considerable rigidity of
PPE and relative ¯exibility of HLE. This high corre￾lation is a testimonial to the insight of the late
Aaron Janoff, who named HLE elastase (Janoff &
Basch, 1971). All six enzymes we have studied are
strongly inhibited by wild-type OMTKY3, whose
P1 residue is Leu18. All of them have hydrophobic
S1 cavities. Therefore, we were startled to ®nd a
negative correlation within the set. It is (ÿ0.10) be￾tween CHYM and PPE. Many proteinase chemists
are also startled when they are told this. Yet the ex￾planation seems straight forward. Phe18, Tyr18 and

{ The stronger binding of Lys18 to SGPB than to

(Park, 1985; Lin 1986) based on results with Japanese
quail ovomucoid third domain, which
has . . . CysProLys#Asp . . . sequence at the reactive site.
An explanation for the difference was advanced on the
basis of a presumed difference in the amino acid
sequence between SGPA and SGPB. The reported amino
acid sequences showed that, in SGPA residue, 191 was
Gln (Johnson & Smillie, 1974) while in SGPB (Jurasek
et al., 1974), it was Glu (Chymotrypsinogen numbering
and Fujinaga et al. (1985) alignments are employed.).
However, subsequent to our explanations, Henderson
et al. (1987) published nucleotide sequences of SGPA
and SGPB. Residue 191 is Glu in both sequences. In
order to con®rm it, we have isolated the relevant
peptide from both enzymes and obtained its amino acid
sequence. It was found to be Glu191 in both. After this
was communicated to Professor Smillie, he kindly
rechecked the original assignment of Gln191 in SGPA
and found that, along with many amide assignments of
that period in protein sequencing, it was largely a
guess. Therefore, it seems quite clear that SGPA and
SGPB both have Glu191. On the other hand, this leaves
us without molecular explanation for the SGPB
preference over SGPA for cationic side-chains.

JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]Trp18 are the best P1 residues for CHYM. They are
nearly the worst for PPE. As it lacks enzymes with
a preference for positve and negative P1 residues,
our set appears incomplete. We have already reme￾died some of these de®ciencies and a more ex￾tended publication on the use of inhibitor binding
constants to de®ne the speci®city of serine protein￾ases is in preparation.
Generality of the data
Table 1, whose data were exhaustively discussed
above, applies only to X18 OMTKY3 and to that
only at 21 (2)C and at pH 8.30. However, it is
reasonable to expect that the relative data in each
column of Table 1 may apply to a closely related
set of avian ovomucoid third domains or even to
all members of the Kazal family of serine protein￾ase inhibitors. If the data for these sets agree well,
we talk about intrascaffolding additivity as all the
members of these sets share the common Kazal fa￾mily scaffolding. We could be more venturesome
yet. As the canonical standard mechanism inhibi￾tors have a common conformation of the contigu￾ous combining region, interscaffolding additivity
might be expected. If this is true, relative values in
the six columns of Table 1 can be used to predict
or con®rm the relative Ka values of P1 variants of
BPTI, SLPI, SSI and eglin c. When this is found
to hold (approximately), we can turn even more
venturesome. As ``inhibitors are substrates''
(Laskowski & Kato, 1980) we can also seek a cor￾relation between log(kcat/Km) values for a series
of substrates that differ from one another only at
P1 and log Ka values of X18 OMTKY3.
Strict additivity criterion for avian ovomucoid

Over decades of work on avian ovomucoid
third domains, the Purdue group acquired 92
unique (Apostol et al., 1993) and 32 semisynthetic
(Wieczorek & Laskowski, 1983; Bigler, 1991; Bigler

prepared by opening the Met18 ± Glu reactive site peptide bond by cyanogen bromide cleavage followed by enzy￾matic resynthesis. SWNGOO is a chimera or residues 6 to 18 of OMSWN3 and 19 to 56 of OMGOO3 (see Wieczorek

studied in this paper were determined (Empie &
Laskowski, 1982; Laskowski et al., 1983, 1989; Park,
1985; Wynn, 1990; Lu, 1994; Park et al. unpublished
results). More strikingly, these data have been ac￾quired by the same measuring technique as that
employed for determination of data in Table 1 and
possibly even more importantly they were ac￾quired at pH 8.30 and at 21 (2)C. As pointed out
above, pH affects the relative Ka values for Asp,
Glu and Lys residues. We suspect that temperature
also affects the relative values for many residues.
However, only a subset of those data, shown in
Figure 6, can be usefully compared. This subset
consist of those inhibitor variants which differ
from another member of the subset by a single
substitution at P1{. We wish to apply the additivity
criterion (Laskowski et al., 1983; Wells, 1990;
Wynn, 1990; Horovitz et al., 1991) to these data.

454 Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities
JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97](L18S) is its non-logarithmic version: the ratio of Ka
values for the S18 and L18 variants. Therefore, iden￾tity of Ka
S(18)/KL(18)
a ratios is another measure of ad￾ditivity. For the case discussed here the six ratios
of ratios range from 1.1 to 1.8. We call such a ratio
of ratios, Fc, the additivity factor. The determi￾nation of Fc requires an experimental determi￾nation of four equilibrium constants. Frequently,
such constants differ by several orders of magni￾tude. An analysis of our data sets suggests that for
1.00 < Fc < 2.00, the deviation from unity is likely
to be caused by experimental errors. It follows that
j  Go
j dev due to experimental errors is about
400 cal/mol. Figure 7 shows the Fc and j  Go
j
dev values for the 65 cycles for which we have
data. The reader can verify that there are 12 cycles
depicted in Figure 6. This should yield six en￾zymes  12 cycles  72 cycles. However, some
data are missing and only 65 can be calculated.
With few exceptions, the agreement is excellent.
We decided to examine the two most aberrant
cases, where the Fc values are greater than 6. Both
are for HLE, and both involve comparisons be￾tween P1 Val and non-b-branched amino acid. HLE
is the only one of the six enzymes we have studied
that does not disfavor Val and Ile compared to
Ape, Ahx and Leu. We have attributed this to ex￾ceptional ¯exibility of the HLE S1 pocket. We think
that the usual non-additivity we observe for HLE
is due to the same phenomenon. Most S1 pockets
are rigid and less in¯uenced by the nature of other
contact residues, but HLE deforms easily.
Comparison with literature data
Unlike the data from our laboratory, the data of
others were not obtained at the same pH and tem￾perature as our own. Sometimes they were not
even obtained for the same enzyme. We use subti￾lisin Carlsberg (CARL), others use BPN' and savi￾nase. These are closely related but not the same.
The measuring methods also differ. Therefore, the
differences, even in relative values, are likely to be
and are large, and less strict comparisons than ad￾ditivity must be employed.
The Pearson product-moment correlation
(Campbell, 1989) which we already employed for
the examination of enzyme speci®city (equation
(2)) is such a measure. Therefore, for each of the lit￾erature data sets we calculate such a correlation.
The data are listed in Table 4. The correlation coef-
®cients for many sets are quite near to unity.
All the plots that we construct are log/log plots.
For example they are ÿ Go
a for P1 scaffold versus
ÿ Go
a of X18 OMTKY3 variants or:
lo g
kcat
Km
for a series of related substrates with only P1 resi￾due varied versus log Ka for X18 OMTKY3. The best
straight line through such plots is characterized by
a slope, s (see Figure 8). The value of s is simply
the power dependence y  axs
. In all of our plots,
X18 OMTKY3 data are the x-axis or the abscissa,
while the data of others are the ordinate or the y￾axis. The r  1.00, s  1.00 indicate direct propor￾tionality and therefore, additivity. However, s de￾viations from unity are far more common than
r deviations. All of the plots on which Table 4 is
based are in Lu (1994). Here only one of them
(Figure 8) is given as an example.
Consider ®rst the comparisons between free ener￾gies of transfer of amino acid side-chains from
water to organic solvents to the binding to S1 pock￾ets. In fact, we restricted the comparisons to
CHYM as only CHYM has a commodious enough
pocket so that global steric effects do not matter.
First, we look at the transfer of simple homolo￾gous, aliphatic side-chains to octanol and to chy￾motrypsin. The r value of 0.99 is superb but
s  0.51 not 1.00. This is a re¯ection of the well
known phenomenon that ``enzymes are more
hydrophobic than organic solvents'' (Fersht, 1977,
1985). (We feel that now it is better dealt with by
the examination of the correlation ÿ  Go
(Gly18X) to the buried hydrophobic surface area
computed from X-ray crystallographic determi￾nations and from modeling (Huang et al., 1995). As
we extend the size of the set to most of the resi￾dues, the correlation gets somewhat worse (it
would have been worse yet if His, Ile and Pro
were included) but the s value remains near one

been done for many different solvents and for
more enzymes, not just CHYM. We did not persist
as these two lines are in Table 4 only to illustrate
our analysis technique.
The next part of Table 4 deals with interscaffolding
comparisons between inhibitors which are not at
all homologous (they are members of different fa￾milies) but they share being standard mechanism
canonical inhibitors. The r values in Table 4 are
very near to unity, but s values deviate greatly. It
is not clear whether this is due to differences in ex￾perimental conditions and techniques or the re¯ec￾tion of the true situation. In order to answer this,
we recently acquired a set of seven eglin c variants
at P1 and measured them in our laboratory under
the conditions of Table 1. Both r and s values are
near unity.
The third section of Table 4 deals with log(kcat/Km)
plots versus log Ka plots (Figure 8). Here Schellen￾berger et al. (1991) combined all of the known kcat/
Km values from the world's literature and calcu￾lated their dependence on P1 (and other residue
positions). We found the agreement remarkably
good. An even better agreement is found for a re￾stricted set of acetyl methyl esters of simple hydro￾phobic amino acids reported in a classic paper by
Dorovska et al. (1972). For other enzymes the r and
s agreements are rather good but not as good as
for CHYM. The excellent agreement overall be￾tween log(kcat/Km) and our log Ka presumably im￾plies that the P1 side-chains are imbedded in the
enzyme's S1 pockets in a very similar manner in
the kinetic transition states and in the enzyme-in￾hibitor complexes. As three-dimensional structures
of the latter are already available or are being ob￾Figure 9. Schematic diagram of OM3D expression vector construction. The expression vector, pEZZ318.tky, was
assembled starting from a chicken ovomucoid cDNA clone, pOM100, as described in Materials and Methods. The
insert in pOM100 contains sequences representing the 30
-untranslated region and the coding region for amino acids
18 to 186 in the chicken ovomucoid mRNA (Stein et al., 1978; Lai et al., 1979); this insert thus contains the complete
coding information for the OM2D and OM3D domains, but the sequence for the OM1D domain is incomplete. Black
rectangles represent coding sequences for polypeptide linker regions connecting discrete protein domains. The Glu
and Met residues in the short sequence (shown) connecting the ZZ and OM3D domains, which are the sites of clea￾vage in the fusion proteins by V8 porteinase or cyanogen bromide for producing the long and short forms of OM3D
(see the text), respectively are underlined. Other symbols are as follows: PSPA, staphylococcal protein A promoter; SS,
signal sequence for secretion; Z, protein A IgG-binding domain; lacZ', E. coli b-galactosidase a fragment; ¯ ori, ¯

look at part of the transition states.
Materials and Methods
Construction of the OM3D expression vector
The steps in the construction of the expression vector for
the turkey ovomucoid third domain as a downstream
fusion to secreted IgG-binding domains of staphylococ￾cal protein A are shown schematically in Figure 9.
Brie¯y, a 0.18 kbp HincII/BamH I fragment from a plas￾mid containing a molecular clone of the chicken ovomu￾coid cDNA, pOM100 (Stein et al., 1978; Lai et al., 1979),
was purifed by gel electrophoresis and inserted into
SmaI/BamHI-digested pEZZ318 (Nilsson & AbrahmseÂn,
1990). This HincII/BamHI fragment contained the coding
region for the third domain of chicken ovomucoid
(Figure 9). Single-stranded template was obtained from
the above plasmid using the M13K07 helper phage
(Vieira & Messing, 1987). The OM3D coding region was
then fused in-frame to the coding sequences for the IgG￾binding (``Z'') domains of staphylococcal protein A via
deletion mutagenesis (Taylor et al., 1985; Nakamaye &
Eckstein, 1986) with the oligonucleotide, 50 GCA GTC
AAC CAT AGC GAA GTG AGC TTC TTT ACG 30 (pro￾tein A-OM3D fusion primer). To remove the rest of the
polylinker sequences the plasmid was cleaved with Hin￾dIII and BamHI, ®lled-in with Klenow DNA polymerase
and dNTPs and religated. The chicken OM3D sequence
was mutated to the turkey OM3D sequence and a un￾ique BamHI site introduced by site-directed mutagenesis
of single-stranded template DNA using the oligonucleo￾tide primer, 50 GTT GTC GGA TCC ACA GAG AGG
TCT GTA TTC CAG CGT GCA TGC AGG CTT AGG 30
(CHI ! TKY primer). Nucleotides that were altered in
the mutagenesis from the chicken to the turkey sequence
are underlined; the silent mutation in the codon for Gly25
that introduced the BamHI site (italics) is also under￾lined. The amino acid and codon changes were as
follows: D15A(GAC ! GCA), A18L(GCA ! CTG), and
D20Y(GAC ! TAC). The resultant expression plasmid
was termed pEZZ318.tky.
Introduction of mutations at the P1 position
Standard oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed muta￾genesis, using the phosphorothioate incorporation meth￾od (Taylor et al., 1985; Nakamaye & Eckstein, 1986), was
employed to introduce amino acid substitutions at the P1
position in the recombinant turkey OM3D gene in
pEZZ318.tky. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were also de￾signed to revert the silent BamHI site mutation in codon
25 (see above); since this BamHI site was unique in
pEZZ318.tky, mutant plasmids could be easily distin￾guished from the parental plasmid based upon their re￾sistance to BamHI digestion. Mutagenized plasmids were
transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (Strata￾gen) for selection, screening, and characterization. The
entire OM3D coding region for each candidate mutant
was resequenced by the dideoxy chain termination
method (Sanger et al., 1977) to verify the presence of
the intended mutation and the absence of adventitious
second-site mutations. Each mutant plasmid was then
retransformed into E. coli strain RV308 (Maurer et al.,
1980) for protein expression.
Protein expression and purification
The fusion protein was designed to be secreted into the
periplasmic space of E. coli to insure facile and correct
formation of disul®de bridges (see Figure 1). Having the
two IgG-binding Z domains also allowed us to use af®-
nity chromatography on IgG column as a method of
puri®cation. In brief, after inoculation on an LB plate, a
single colony of RV308 cells was grown overnight at
30C in 75 ml of 2  TY broth (16 g/l Tryptone, 10 g/l
Yeast Extract, 5 g/l NaCl, 100 mg/l amplicillin and 0.1%
(w/v) glucose). The medium then was transferred into a
2.8 liter culture ¯ask containing 1.5 liters of 2  TY broth
and was continously shaken for 24 hours at 30C. An os￾motic shock procedure (Randall & Hardy, 1986) was
used to obtain periplasmic proteins. After osmotic shock
and centrifugation, the supernatant containing the peri￾plasmic fraction was loaded onto an IgG-Sepharose 6
Fast Flow (Pharmacia) af®nity chromatography column.
The af®nity puri®cation was performed according to the
standard procedures provided by the manufacturer
(Pharmacia). The typical yield of fusion proteins is about
30 mg/l.
The fusion protein was subjected to CNBr cleavage at
the Met5 ±Val6 bond in 5% TFA. The more common 70%
formic acid was avoided as traces of formylation were
seen in many puri®ed products obtained in that med￾ium. The reaction mixture was then subjected ®rst to size
exclusion chromatography on Bio-gel P-10 to separate
third domain from the two Z domains of SPA followed
by its puri®cation by ion exchange chromatography on
S-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose columns at pH 3.6 and
9.1, respectively.
In the cases of the Cys18 and Met18 variants, Staphylococ￾cus aureus protease V8, instead of CNBr, was used to
split off the connecting peptide at the Gluÿ1 ±Ala1 bond,
which yielded third domains ®ve residues longer at their
N terminus. For the Cys18 variant, since there existed a
signi®cant amount of dimerized fusion protein cova￾lently linked by Cys18 ±Cys18 in the expression product,
an alternative cleavage by CNBr was also performed to
generate a third domain dimer. The cystine dimer was
reduced by DTT into Cys18OMTKY3 monomer without
the N-terminal extra ®ve residues. The yields of isolated
highly puri®ed X18OMTKY3 variants were remarkably
consistent (3.5 to 4.0 mg/l; nine liters were shaken at a
time).
Characterization
Probably the most decisive characterization of the var￾iants was that complexes of X18OMTKY3 with SGPB
were crystallized and their three-dimensional structures
were determined (Huang et al., 1995; Huang, Bateman &
James, personal communication). The conformation of
the inhibitor in these complexes is strikingly similar to
that found for the natural turkey ovomucoid third
domain (Fujinaga et al., 1982; Read et al., 1983). These
®ndings rule out a great number of possible folding con￾cerns, such as improper closure of disul®de bridges. A
possible objection is that only a part of the preparation,
the part that crystallized, is being tested.
All of the samples were characterized by amino acid
analysis, electrospray mass spectrometry, analytical
anion exchange chromatography (Ardelt & Laskowski,
1982, 1991), thermal denaturation studies except for
Cys18 and Met18, and in many cases, N-terminal sequen￾cing beyond the P1 position. In each, the amino acid
composition, the molecular weight, the chromatographic
Amino Acid Side-chains in Cavities 457
JMB MS 2496 [31/1/97]  behavior, the melting transition and tm value as well as
the N-terminal sequence (beyond the P1 position) all
agreed well with what was expected (Lu, 1994). It should
be pointed out that, the Cys18 and Met18 variants gener￾ated by Staphylococcus aureusV8 hydrolysis contained
trace amounts of non-covalently bound peptide frag￾ments from the SPA domains, as indicated by N-terminal
sequencing and poor amino acid analysis results. There￾fore, the identi®cation of these two variants largely relied
on mass spectral analysis and protein sequencing, which
agreed well with expectations.
The Ka values of OMTKY3 and OMSVP3 natural ma￾terials were respectively compared with the Leu18OMT￾KY3 and Met18OMTKY3 recombinant variants; in both
cases, the Ka values are well within the 20% experimen￾tal error (Lu, 1994). Note that in these comparisons for
OMTKY3, the natural long form (Figure 1) is compared
with the recombinant short form. For the OMSVP3, the
natural long form is compared to the recombinant long
form with a different N-terminal pentapeptide. The iden￾tity of the Ka values extends the earlier conclusions of
Wieczorek et al. (1987), who showed that absence of the
natural pentapeptide has no effect on Ka. We now show
that the recombinant pentapeptide (Figure 1) also has no
effect on Ka.
Ka determination
Determinations of equilibrium constants were carried
out by an extensively modi®ed procedure of Green &
Work (1953), as described by Empie & Laskowski (1982)
with later modi®cations by Park (1985) and Wynn
(1990). The sources of the enzymes are given by Bigler
et al. (1993). For most enzymes we studied, the pro￾cedure allows for the determination of Ka values over 10
orders of magnitude (Ka from about 103 to 1013 Mÿ1
)
with an accuracy of 20%. The data were collected on a
Hewlett-Packard HP8450A diode array spectropho￾tometer at 21 (2)C at pH 8.30 in 0.1 M Tris-HCI con￾taining 0.005% Triton X-100 and 0.02 M CaCl2. Most Ka
values were obtained using appropriate tetrapeptide p￾nitroanilide chromogenic substrates for the determi￾nation of the residual enzyme concentration in the incu￾bation mixture. However, for the Phe18, Tyr18 and Trp18
with CHYM, a more sensitive 7-amido-4-methylcoumar￾in-based ¯uorogenic substrate was used and the signal
change was monitored on a Perkin Elmer LS-50 ¯uorom￾eter. In addition, Ka values for Cys18 were measured in
the presence of 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol to prevent
possible dimerization.
