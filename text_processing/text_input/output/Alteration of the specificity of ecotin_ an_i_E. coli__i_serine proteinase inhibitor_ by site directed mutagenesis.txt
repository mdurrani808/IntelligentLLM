Abstract 
The gene of ecotin, an E. coli proteinase inhibitor, was cloned, and by site-directed mutagenesis the active site residue of the protein, Met@, was 
mutated to Lys, Arg and Leu. The recombinant wild-type and mutant inhibitors were overexpressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity and their 
inhibitory effects on trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase were compared. Of these serine proteinases trypsin is the most strongly inhibited by wild 
type ecotin and its mutants. According to our results the character of residue 84 of ecotin significantly but not dramatically modifies the specificity 
of the inhibitor. 
Key words: Ecotin; Serine proteinase inhibitor; Site-directed mutagenesis 
I. Introduction 
The specificity of substrate-like canonical serine pro￾teinase inhibitors, which operate according to the ‘stand￾ard mechanism’, is determined mostly by their Pl residue 
that fits well into the binding pocket of the cognate pro￾teinase [l-4]. Trypsin inhibitors usually have Lys or Arg; 
chymotrypsin inhibitors Tyr, Phe, Leu or Met; while 
elastase inhibitors Leu, Val, Met or Ala as their Pl resi￾due. These inhibitors are quite selective: strong trypsin 
inhibitors inhibit chymotrypsin or elastase weakly if at 
all, and vice versa, strong chymotrypsin and elastase 
inhibitors practically do not inhibit trypsin. On the con￾trary, ecotin, a 16 kDa serine proteinase inhibitor of E. 
coli has an unusually broad specificity: it is a potent 
inhibitor of all pancreatic serine proteinases, trypsin, 
chymotrypsin and elastase but does not inhibit subtilisin 
and the aspartyl-, sullhydryl- and metallo-proteinases 
[5]. The gene of ecotin has been cloned and the reactive 
site Pl residue has been determined to be Met84 [6]. Al￾though ecotin shows a substrate-like inhibition, on the

basis of its primary structure it does not belong to the 
major classes of other serine proteinase inhibitors. 
McGrath and coworkers [6] have suggested that the 
broad specificity of ecotin is due to the Mets4 Pl residue, 
which is well tolerated by all three pancreatic pro￾teinases. According to earlier studies, replacement of the 
PI residue of canonical inhibitors often results in the 
expected changes in their specificity [7-91. In order to 
study the role of the Met&l Pl residue in the inhibition 
and to construct ecotin variants with higher selectivity, 
the Met84 residue was replaced by Arg, Lys and Leu via 
site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type and mutant inhib￾itors were overexpressed in E. coli, purified to homoge￾neity and their inhibitory effects on trypsin, chymotryp￾sin and elastase were compared. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Bacterial strains, vectors, enzymes and chemicals 
Bovine trypsin (TPCK) and bovine chymotrypsin (TLCK) were pur￾chased from Worthington. Porcine pancreatic elastase was obtained 
from Sigma. Fractogel TSK-DEAE 650 (S) was purchased from Merck. 
Affi-Gel 10 was acquired from Bio-Rad. Reagents for oligonucleotide 
synthesis and protein sequencing were obtained from Applied Biosys￾terns. Ampli-Taq polymerase was purchased from Perkin-Elmer Cetus, 
T7 sequencing Kit from Pharmacia, other DNA modifying enzymes 
from Amersham, Boehringer and Promega. GeneClean was acquired

Blue were purchased from Novagen, Bio-Rad and Stratagene, respec￾tively. Expression vector pT7-7 was provided by Dr. Stan Tabor of 
Harvard Medical School, Boston. BlueScript vector was obtained from 
Stratagene. IPTG, N-benxoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide, N-succinyl￾Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide, MUB, the fluorescent burst titrants 
MUGB and MUTMAC [l l] were purchased from Sigma. The fluores￾0014-5793/94/$7.00 0 1994 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. All rights reserved.

cent turnover substrates N-succinyl-~a-Ala-Pro-Arg-AMC and N￾succinyl-Ala-~a-Pr~Phe-AMP were synthesized as described previ￾ously [12]. All other chemicals were reagent grade or the best commer￾cially available. 
2.2. Cloning of the ecotin gene 
The standard techniques of molecular cloning were performed essen￾tially as described [ 13,I4]. E. coli genomic DNA was prepared as tem￾plate for polymerase chain reaction. PCR primer oligonucleotid~ were 
designed using the sequence of ecotin gene [6]. Primer sequences were: 
5’-GCGAGAATTCTACCTGCAGTATTGTTTGCC-3’ 
corresponding to base 76 to 99, and 
corresponding to base 639 to 656. These two oligonucleotides allowed 
us to amplify the DNA coding ecotin, including its signal peptide. The 
signal peptide was slightly modified for correct frame fitting to the 
expression vector but this did not seem to affect the transport processes. 
EcoRI (first) and BumHI (second) restriction sites are underlined. Prim￾ers at the 5’ ends were extended by four additional nucleotides for 
efficient cutting by the restriction enzymes. 20 ng of template DNA, 100 
pmol of each primer, 100 nmol of dNTP-s and 1 U of Taq polymerase 
were in 50 ~1 final volume. 30 PCR cycles were carried out as follows: 
denaturation for 50 s at 94”C, annealing for QO s at 60°C and extension 
for 60 s at 72°C. An aliquot was run on a 0.8% agarose gel. Amplified 
DNA was collected and purified by chloroform extraction and ethanol 
pr~ipitation, digested with EcoRI and BumHI. The sample was loaded 
on a 0.8% agarose gel and the 580 base DNA fragment was isolated 
from the gel by GeneClean. The isolated fragment was ligated into the 
precut pT7-7 vector. The gene was sequenced, and found to be identical 
with the previously published result [6]. IPTG induced overexpression 
was verified by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE [15]. 
2.3. ~ite~ire~ted mutagenesis 
The oligonucleotides for mutagenesis were: 
1. S-CCCCGGTGTCGACGCCGATGGCCT-3 
2. 5’-CCCCGGTGTCGACGAAGATGGCCT-3’ 
3. 5’-CCCCGGTGTCGACGCTGATGGCCT-3 
In place of the Mets“ codon (ATG) Arg (CGG), Lys (AAG) and Leu 
codons (CTG) were synthesized (bold letters). An extra silent mutation 
was designed in order to form a new &Jl restriction site (underlined) 
to facilitate screening. The fragment containing the ecotin gene was cut 
out from pT7-7 vector with EcoRI and ZfindIII, and ligated into the 
BlueScript vector. Uracil containing template DNA for in vitro mut￾agenesis was prepared by using CJ236 (dut-,ung-) E. coli strain, and 
the mutated strand was selected in XL1 Blue (dut’ung’) strain as 
described by Kunkel [16]. Mutant genes were ligated back into the 
pT7-7 expression vector and were sequenced before use. 
2.4. Protein purification 
E. coli BL21(DE3) culture carrying the pT7-7 vector was grown in 
LB medium containing ampicillin. When the culture reached A, 0.8 
it was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested 8 h after 
induction. Recombinant wild-type and mutant ecotins were puritied 
from E. co&’ as described previously [6] with some modifications. After 
isolation of the periplasmic protein fraction and intensive dialysis 
against 1 mM HCl, precipitated proteins were removed by centrifuga￾tion (20,000 x g for 10 min) and the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with Tris 
base. The sample was centrifuged as before and the supematant was 
loaded onto a‘TSK-DEAE 6% (S) column (1.0 cm x 15 cm) equili￾brated with 10 mM Tris-HCl nH 8.0. 1 mM M&l, buffer. The flow￾through fraction was collected and the pH was adj&ted to 4.5 with 1 
N HCl. This sample was loaded onto an Affi-Gel 10 trypsin affinity 
column. Ecotin was eluted with 50 mM HCl and on the basis of SDS￾PAGE and native nondenaturing PAGE it was proved to be homoge￾nous. 
2.5. Enzyme and inhibitor ~tan~rd~zation 
Trypsin and ~h~ot~psin stock solutions were made by dissolving 
protein in 1 mM HCl containing 20 mM CaCl,. Elastase stock solution 
was made in acetate buffer pH 4.5 containing 20 mM CaCl,. Concentra￾tion of trypsin and chymotrypsin was determined by active-site titration 
[I I]. Wild-type and mutant ecotin samples were standardized by titra￾tion with trypsin at 10e7 M final concentration using 10F4 M N-benzoyl￾L-arginine-p-nitroanilide. The wild-type inhibitor was then used for 
titration of elastase using 10e4 M N-su~inyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-ni￾troanilide as substrate. 
2.6. Measurement of equilibrium dissociation constant (K?) 
K, values were determined by the method of Green and Work [ 171 
as modified by Empie and Laskowski [18]. A constant amount of 
enzyme was incubated with incremental amounts of inhibitor. After 
reaching equilibrium the quantity of the free enzyme was determined 
with the appropriate substrate. All measurements were carried out in 
50 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM CaCl, and 0.005% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 
8.3. Substrates (lOA M) were: N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Arg-AMC for 
trypsin, N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC for chymotrypsin and N￾succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide for elastase. The production of 
AMC was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths 366 and 
440 nm, respectively, by a SPEX FluoroMax spectrofluorometer. The 
production of ~nitroan~ine was measured at a wavelength of 410 nm 
as a function of time by a Shimadzu UV-2lOlPC sp~trophotometer. 
Initial elastase and chymotrypsin concentrations were within a factor 
of 10 of the Ki. When the equilibrium dissociation of the trypsin￾inhibitor complexes was studied, however, no reliable enzyme assay was 
feasible at an initial trypsin concentration lower than lo-” M. The free 
trypsin concentrations in mixtures with equimolar amounts of ecotin 
mutants Me?Leu and Mets4Arg were 2.3 x lo-l2 M and 9.5 x lo-” M, 
respectively. These con~ntrations allowed us to determine fairly accu￾rate Ki values for these complexes. On the other hand, the concentra￾tions of the remaining free enzyme in the identically prepared equilib￾rium mixtures with wild-type ecotin and ecotin mutant Mets4Lys were 
lower than 5 x lo-l3 M, too low and variable values to determine accu￾rate K, values for these complexes. Thus, on the basis of these assay 
results we can at least estimate the K values of wild type ecotin and 
mutant Mets“Lys to be comparable and lower than lo-r3 M.

of samples was 5-6 ,ug. 
ecotin genes were inserted into the pT7-7 vector. These 
constructs result in the generation of high levels of ecotin 
(Fig. 1). The slightly altered signal peptide of ecotin di￾rects the gene product into the periplasmic space of E. 
coli. The yield of production is about 50 mg ecotin/5 g 
of transformed cells that is about 500 times higher than 
that of the nontransformed cells. The last purification 
step, affinity chromatography yielded pure ecotin. Gel 
electrophoretic patterns (Fig. 2) show that the MetE4Lys 
and MetE4Arg mutants of ecotin carry an extra positive 
charge as compared to the wild type and the Metg4Leu 
mutant ecotin. 
For the first time we have determined the Ki values of 
ecotin on the three pancreatic proteolytic enzymes, tryp￾sin, chymotrypsin and elastase, known to be potently 
inhibited by ecotin (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Of the three 
serine proteinases tested, trypsin is the most strongly 
inhibited (Ki < 10-13). The inhibitory effect of ecotin on 
chymotrypsin is about two, and on elastase is about five 
orders of magnitude smaller. Since canonical serine pro￾teinase inhibitors with Met Pl residue are usually specific 
for chymotrypsin and/or elastase, and not for trypsin, 
the above finding is quite unexpected. Our results suggest 
that binding sites of ecotin other than the Pl site fit most

tightly to trypsin, moderately to chymotrypsin, and least 
to elastase. 
The Mets4Leu mutation of ecotin does not affect its 
inhibitory property on chymotrypsin and elastase but 
results in an increase of Ki on trypsin. Replacement of 
Met84 with the basic amino acid residues, Lys and Arg 
causes a significant decrease of inhibition of both chy￾motrypsin (one order of magnitude) and elastase (two 
orders of magnitude). While our equilibrium dissociation 
assay did not allow us to distinguish between the ex￾tremely strong inhibitory effects of wild type ecotin and 
mutant Meta4Lys on trypsin, ecotin mutant Me?Arg is 
a less potent trypsin inhibitor than the former ones. 
In general, our data show that in case of ecotin the 
contribution of the Pl residue to the inhibition is rela￾tively small, suggesting that residues other than the Pl 
site are intimately involved in binding. Thus ecotin seems 
to have a more extended binding site than the other 
canonical inhibitors.
