ABSTRACT: Methylated lysine 9 on the histone 3 (H3) tail recruits
heterochromatin protein 1 from Drosophila (dHP1) via its
chromodomain and results in gene silencing. The dHP1 chromodo￾main binds H3 K9Me3 with an aromatic cage surrounding the
trimethyllysine. The sequence selectivity of binding comes from
insertion of the histone tail between two β-strands of the
chromodomain to form a three-stranded β-sheet. Herein, we
investigated the sequence selectivity provided by the β-sheet
interactions and how those interactions compare to other model
systems. Residue Thr6 of the histone tail forms cross-strand
interactions with Ala25 and Asp62 of the chromodomain. Each of these three residues was substituted for amino acids
known to have high β-sheet propensities and/or to form favorable side chain−side chain (SC−SC) interactions in β-sheets,
including hydrophobic, H-bonding, and aromatic interactions. We found that about 50% of the chromodomain mutants resulted
in equal or tighter binding to the histone tail and about 25% of the histone tail mutants provided tighter binding compared to
that of the native histone tail sequence. These studies provide novel insights into the sequence selectivity of the dHP1
chromodomain for the histone tail and relates the information gleaned from model systems and statistical studies to β-sheet￾mediated protein−protein interactions. Moreover, this work suggests that the development of designer histone−chromodomain
pairs for chemical biology applications is feasible.
Post-translational modifications of histone proteins play
critical roles in controlling gene expression. Methylation of
the H3 histone protein at various lysine residues is among the
most important and complex modifications.1 For example,
trimethyllysine 9 of histone protein H3 (H3 K9Me3) is a
modification that recruits the effector protein, heterochromatin
protein 1 (HP1), via the highly conserved chromodomain.2
Once recruited to the nucleosome, HP1 is believed to prevent
gene expression by condensing DNA into tightly packed and
genetically silent heterochromatin by oligomerizing with other
HP1 proteins.3,4 Moreover, there are a number of other effector
proteins containing chromodomains that recognize unique
methyllysine marks, and each has a distinct effect on gene
expression.5 These protein−protein interactions (PPIs) have
become potential medicinal targets, with several small molecule
and peptide-based inhibitors reported recently.6−10 Thus,
understanding the factors that control sequence selectivity in
the recognition of methyllysine marks is important for gaining a
biophysical understanding of this type of cellular signaling and
developing inhibitors for this class of interaction.
Crystallography and NMR studies of the chromodomain
from Drosophila, dHP1, bound to the H3 K9Me3 tail have been
used to understand the nature of the interactions between the
chromodomain and trimethylated histone tail.2,5,11 The binding
of H3 K9Me3 by the chromodomain is mediated by two modes
of recognition. The first is a cation−π interaction between the
trimethyllysine 9 of the H3 histone tail and a three-member
aromatic cage of the chromodomain. The second is the
formation of an antiparallel three-stranded β-sheet motif with
Thr6 through Ser10 of the H3 histone tail (TAR(KMe3)S) as
the central strand and two β-strands of the chromodomain as
the edge strands (Figure 1). van der Waals contacts,
electrostatic interactions between side chains, and H-bonds
between the backbone amides of the chromodomain and
histone tail are key for selectivity and for stabilizing the
complex.12 However, while insight has been gained into how
these proteins select for mono-, di-, or trimethyllysine, few
studies have been performed beyond Ala scans and crystallo￾graphic studies that investigate the nature of the sequence
selectivity.2,13
General insights into β-sheet structure come from statistical
analyses of protein structures, which have established what
amino acids have the highest propensity in β-sheets, and
mutation studies in model proteins, which have measured those
amino acids and side chain−side chain (SC−SC) interactions
that are the most stabilizing to β-sheets (Table S1). Statistical
analyses of the PDB found that amino acids with β-branched or
aromatic side chains were shown to have the highest β-sheet
propensity, whereas small, conformationally restrictive (pro￾line) or charged amino acids have the lowest propensity.14,15

Biochemistry 2015, 54, 2314−2322analysis to determine which cross-strand amino acids are
preferred in the hydrogen-bonded (HB) or non-hydrogen￾bonded (NHB) sites. These studies found that β- and γ￾branched amino acids are most favored in NHB sites.16
Smith and Regan measured interaction energies between
cross-strand amino acid pairs by making pairwise mutations to
the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1) in a solvent￾exposed HB site.17 Their findings corroborated the initial
statistical analysis, showing that pairs composed of β-branched
and aromatic residues had the most favorable interaction
energy and that charge−charge interactions between side chain
pairs were the least stabilizing.17 Other studies involving β￾hairpins have shown that edge−face interactions between two
cross-strand aromatic residues, such as two Trp18 or two Phe
residues,19 are highly stabilizing. The cation−π interaction of
Trp or Phe with Lys or Arg is another favorable cross-strand
interaction.20
While much work has been performed to understand β-sheet
structure, very little has been done to understand β-sheets in
the context of protein−protein interactions, such as the
recognition of histone tails by chromodomains. Moreover, β￾sheet-mediated PPIs are poorly understood relative to α-helix￾mediated PPIs.21 Herein, we report a mutation study to
investigate the β-sheet interaction between the dHP1
chromodomain and H3 histone tail (Figure 1). We substituted
naturally occurring amino acids at the D62 and A25 positions
of the dHP1 chromodomain and in the T6 position of H3
K9Me3 for those with higher β-sheet propensity. We also
incorporated known favorable cross-strand pairs into the D62
and A25 sites. The purpose of this research is 3-fold: first, to
evaluate the selectivity of the recognition domain for H3
K9Me3; second, to determine whether binding can be
optimized or selectivity can be varied by mutating residues
within the chromodomain and histone tail peptide; and third,
to measure how previous studies from β-sheet models and
statistical studies compare in the context of a PPI. The dHP1
chromodomain−H3 K9Me3 complex provides a model to meet
this end with significant biological relevance. We find that the
chromodomain is quite plastic, with more than 50% of the
mutants resulting in equal or tighter binding to the wild-type
histone sequence. In contrast, only two out of the eight histone
tail mutants provided equal or better binding than the native
sequence. Lastly, measurements of mutant histone peptides
with mutant chromodomains suggest that orthogonal histone−
chromodomain pairs are possible.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Peptide Synthesis. H3 histone tail peptides (residues 1−
16) were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using a
Tetras synthesizer. Amino acids with Fmoc-protecting groups
purchased from Creosalus were used with Wang resin from
Anaspec on a 0.06 mmol scale with 4 equiv of amino acids per
step. Amino acids were activated with 4 equiv of HOBt and
HBTU with DIPEA in NMP using two cycles of 30 min. The
Fmoc protecting groups were removed using 2% piperidine and
2% DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) in DMF using
two washes for 15 min. Trimethyllysine was incorporated into
the peptides using Fmoc-Lys(Me)2-OH from Anaspec. Prior to
deprotection of the final Fmoc group, the dimethylated lysine
was reacted with MTBD (10.8 μL, 0.075 mmol) and
iodomethane (37.4 μL, 0.60 mmol) in 5 mL of DMF for 5 h
while bubbling with N2 in a peptide flask with a vented septum
to generate the trimethyllysine. After methylation and
deprotection of the N-terminal Fmoc, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein
was reacted using 2 equiv of the fluorophore, HOBt, HBTU,
and DIPEA overnight with bubbling N2. The resin was washed
twice with DMF and then once with DCM for 5 min. The
DCM was removed from the resin by vacuum for 5 min, and
the peptide was cleaved using 10 mL of 95% TFA/2.5% H2O/
2.5% triisopropylsilane for 3 h. The TFA was evaporated, and
the products were precipitated using cold diethyl ether. Peptide
products were extracted into water and lyophilized. Reverse￾phase HPLC with a Vydac C-18 semiprep column was used to
purify the peptides with a gradient of 0−100% B over 60 min
(A was 95:5 water/acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA, and B was 95:5
acetonitrile/water with 0.1% TFA). The peptide was
lyophilized and analyzed by ESI-TOF mass spectroscopy.
Chromodomain Expression. A pET11a plasmid contain￾ing Drosophila HP1 chromodomain (residues 17−76 and an N￾terminal His6-tag) was supplied the Khorasanizadeh group. The

for 30 min before the measurements were taken at 25 °C (λex =
485 nm; λem = 520 nm). Fluorescence anisotropy (A) values
were fit to eq 1 using Kaleidagraph, where Af and Ab are

■ RESULTS
Experimental Design. The β-sheet interactions between
H3 K9Me3 and dHP1 chromodomain were explored using a
number of trimethyllysine histone 3 (H3) tail peptides with
mutations to the Thr6 position and dHP1 chromodomain
proteins with mutations to either the Ala25 or Asp62 positions.
The Thr6 residue of the histone tail was chosen because alanine
scans have demonstrated its significance in binding and
sequence selectivity.2 The threonine is also solvent-exposed
and does not make significant contacts with the interior of the
protein. The Ala25 and Asp62 positions were chosen due to
their cross-strand location from Thr6. These two residues in
the chromodomain were also ideal because they are not known
to have high β-sheet propensity or to form particularly
favorable cross-strand interactions with Thr.
Side chain−side chain (SC−SC) interactions also stabilize β￾sheets, but the preference for different SC−SC interactions
depends on whether residues are in the hydrogen-bonded (HB)
or non-hydrogen bonded (NHB) positions (Figure 1).15,16 In
the NHB site, the amide backbone of two cross-strand amino
acids are not involved in H-bonds. The NHB and HB sites have
significant differences that influence which amino acids are
favored in those sites. First, the α-carbons in HB sites are
separated by 5.5 Å, whereas α-carbons in NHB are separated by
only 4.5 Å. Second, rotamer conformations differ significantly
in the two sites, which influences the preference that residues
have for either NHB or HB sites.16,22 Since the Ala25−Thr6
and Thr6−Asp62 pairs occur in NHB and HB positions,
respectively, the histone tail−chromodomain complex allows
for exploration of the interactions that are preferred in each
position. Additionally, they are solvent-exposed residues that
appear to form minimal contacts with other amino acids within
the chromodomain or histone tail. Therefore, mutations were
also incorporated to include amino acid residues known to
form favorable SC−SC interactions, including hydrophobic
packing, hydrogen bonding, cation−π, and π−π interactions.23
By incorporating amino acids known to stabilize β-sheet
structure into the dHP1 chromodomain and histone, the β￾sheet-mediated interaction between the two molecules should
be stabilized.

2316on the global structure of chromodomain. The CD spectra for
the wild-type (wt) protein exhibits minima at 208 and 222 nm,
corresponding to the α-helix, which masks the weaker signal
from the β-sheet.24 The wt chromodomain also exhibits a
maximum at 232 nm, which is likely due to exciton coupling of
the aromatic residues in the aromatic cage.25 The CD spectra of
the Ala25 chromodomain mutants are similar (Figure S1A).
The global structures of the Asp62 mutants deviate more from
the wt chromodomain, but they still have the strong minima at
208 and 222 nm and the exciton coupling peak at 232 nm
(Figure S1B). Thus, there appears to be no significant
perturbation to the global structure due to the mutations.
The melting temperatures of the dHP1 chromodomain and
the mutants were measured by CD at 222 nm to determine
how the different point mutations affect the stability of the
chromodomain. The melting temperature of the wt protein was
measured to be approximately 47 °C (Figure S2 and Table S3).
Each of the mutants had a melting temperature between 45 and
49 °C, indicating that the various point mutations resulted in an
insignificant effect on global stability. This experiment also
indicates that wt and mutant chromodomains are thermally
stable at 25 °C, the temperature at which all binding
experiments were carried out.
Binding Studies. Binding affinities of the dHP1 chromo￾domain and its mutants to a FAM-labeled histone H3 peptide
containing K9Me3 (H3 K9Me3) and its mutants were measured
by fluorescence anisotropy (Table 1). Binding affinities were
compared to that of the wt dHP1 chromodomain and the
histone tail, which was found to have a dissociation constant of
17 μM under the conditions used in this study.2
Single Mutants at Ala25 of the dHP1 Chromodomain.
Four mutations at the Ala25 position were studied, which
include A25F, A25K, A25L, and A25T (Figure 2a). These
mutations were selected for their high β-sheet propen￾sities14,15,23 or their ability to form favorable cross-strand
interactions (Table 2).17
Inspection of the binding curves in Figure 2a indicates that
binding to wt H3 KMe3 is not very sensitive to the amino acid
at position 25. A25F, A25L, and A25T all have similar binding
affinities to the wt histone tail as that of the native
chromodomain, with A25T providing slightly tighter binding,
consistent with both its β-sheet propensity and pairing
preferences (Table 1). This mutant provides a cross-strand
Thr−Thr interaction in a NHB position, which has been shown
in numerous studies to be a highly favorable interaction in this
position.16 A25F and A25L have conflicting β-sheet propen￾sities and pairing preferences, making a prediction difficult.14,23
In contrast, the A25K mutant is significantly destabilizing by
nearly 1 kcal/mol (Table 2), which is in conflict with both its β￾sheet propensity and pairing preference. Indeed, we found that
the A25K mutant was universally destabilizing with all of the
histone tails investigated (Table 1). Several possible explan￾ations can account for the decrease in binding affinity of A25K.
First, the incorporation of a basic residue into the
chromodomain may result in weakened binding to an already
basic histone tail peptide due to charge−charge repulsion. A
second possibility is that the A25K mutant changes the

2317conformation of the neighboring Y24, which makes up part of
the KMe3 binding pocket. Third, A25K may introduce a
charge−charge repulsion with the neighboring K46, which
could influence the binding pocket. A double mutant cycle was
performed to rule out this third possibility (see the Supporting
Information), but the first two possible explanations cannot be
excluded.
Single Mutants at D62 of the dHP1 Chromodomain.
The mutations made to the D62 position of the chromodomain
include D62F, D62I, D62K, and D62T (Figure 2c and Table
1). This position is in an edge strand and provides a cross￾strand interaction with Thr6 in an HB site. These mutants
exhibit a greater effect on binding affinity than the mutants at
position A25. D62F and D62K exhibit measurably tighter
binding, whereas D62I and D62T exhibit weaker binding
(Table 3).
D62F provides the greatest increase in binding affinity of any
mutant, corresponding to a 3-fold improvement in Kd.
Although statistical analyses of the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
show no preference for a Thr−Phe pair at an HB position,
double mutant studies in GB1 show that the interaction is
weakly stabilizing when the Phe is in an edge strand. In
contrast, the native Thr−Asp pair is not predicted to be
favorable based on statistical studies. Thus, the more favorable
binding affinity of D62F may be a result of a combination of a
greater β-sheet propensity in combination with a more
favorable SC−SC interaction relative to wt. Additionally, in
the chromodomain−histone tail complex, D62F is in a diagonal
cross-strand position from R8 of the histone tail and may allow
for a stabilizing cation−π interaction.20,26 Unfortunately, a
double mutant cycle to determine the interaction energy with
D62F and R8 of the histone tail was not possible due to the
importance of R8 for binding.
The D62K mutation improves binding to the native histone
tail by 2-fold compared to that of the wt chromodomain, which
is consistent with statistical studies showing a significant
pairwise correlation for Thr−Lys pairs in HB sites (Table 3).16
The finding that D62T destabilizes the binding event correlates
with pairwise preferences found in experimental studies and at
least one statistical analysis, indicating that Thr does not pair
well with Ile or Thr in HB positions despite their high β-sheet
propensities (Table 3). The destabilizing effect of the D62I
mutation, in contrast, is not predicted by β-sheet propensities
or pairing preferences.
Single Mutants at T6 of the Histone Tail. Jacobs et al.
previously reported alanine scans of H3 K9Me3 and found that
T6A hindered binding by 7-fold, which was proposed to be due
to loss of complementary interactions between the larger Thr6
residue and residues Ala25 and Asp62 in the chromodomain.2
However, no other mutations were explored to examine the
scope of the selectivity between the chromodomain and H3
K9Me3. In this study, T6 was replaced with four other amino

2318acids known to have high β-sheet propensity, including Ile, Lys,
Leu, and Phe (Figure 2c and Table 1). Since T6 is in a central
position in the β-sheet, the impact of mutations at this site must
be considered with respect to interaction with both A25 and
D62.
Changing Thr6 to Ile, Leu, and Phe had a slightly negative
effect on binding to the wt chromodomain (Table 1). Previous
statistical studies do not provide significant insight, as most
pairs did not provide statistically significant data (Table 4).16,22
Nonetheless, the small impact of these mutations is surprising
given the sequence-selective nature of histone−chromodomain
interactions and suggests that T6 plays only a minor role in
controlling sequence selectivity.
The T6K histone tail mutant is the only mutant at this
position that results in improved binding to the native
chromodomain (a Kd of 10 μM versus 17 μM, respectively,
ΔΔG = −0.3 kcal/mol; Table 4). This introduces both an Ala−
Lys interaction in the NHB position and a Lys−Asp interaction
in the HB position. Complementary charged residues in a β￾sheet are known to have a favorable side chain interaction in
the HB site of a β-sheet,17 although Ala−Lys interactions have
been found to be unfavorable in the NHB site (Table 4).16,17 In
this case, having a basic lysine cross-strand from aspartic acid,
which is an HB site, may result in a favorable electrostatic
interaction that overcomes the unfavorable Ala−Lys pair.
Double Mutants. There are some general trends between
mutant chromodomain and mutant histone tails (Figure 3).
The range of interaction energies over all mutants varies by
about 2.2 kcal/mol upon mutation of a cross-strand pair. Of
these, five of the seven most destabilizing cross-strand pairs are
attributable to A25K mutants. Fifteen mutants are equally or
more stable than the wt histone−chromodomain pair. Of those,
eight are double mutants, and five of those retain Ala in the 25
position (Table 5).
There are several double mutants that result in equivalent or
improved binding affinity relative to the wt protein−protein
interaction (Figure 3). At the A25 position, Thr, Leu, and Phe
are tolerated only when paired with T6 (Table 2) or T6K. All
of these A25 mutants have higher β-sheet propensities than Ala,
but only the A25T−T6 and A25T−T6K pairs are predicted to
give a favorable interaction in the NHB site, such as in this
case.16,22
At the T6 position, the Phe, Ile, Lys, and Leu variants all
result in more favorable interactions, depending on the flanking
residues in the chromodomain. T6F is paired favorably only
with Ala at position 25 and with Asp, Phe, or Lys at position 62
and is disfavored in the case of the D62I and D62T
chromodomain mutants. Thus, β-branched amino acids cross￾strand from T6F appear to be poorly tolerated. Favorable
binding in the case of T6F−D62F is consistent with statistical
and mutation studies that have shown that Phe−Phe
interactions are favorable in a HB site.16,22 T6F−D62K may
introduce a favorable cation−π interaction, although this is not
supported by pairwise preferences.
Five of the nine T6K binding pairs have binding affinities
that are equal to or more favorable than the wt protein−peptide
interaction. These include binding of T6K to the wt
chromodomain and A25F, A25L, A25T, and D62F mutations.
None of these mutants are predicted to be more stable based
on pairwise interactions alone.16 The A25 mutants may have
favorable binding to T6K due to β-sheet propensity at position
25 in combination with a favorable salt bridge between T6K

2319and D62. In the case of the D62F mutant (like the T6F−D62K
double mutant), a favorable cation−π interaction may be
introduced.20
At position 62, Asp, Lys, and Phe result in equivalent or
more favorable interactions than the wt chromdomain−histone
tail pair. D62K is tolerated with T6, T6L, T6I, and T6F,
suggesting that D62K is not particularly selective. D62F is
paired with T6, T6K, and T6F, of which T6−D62F and T6F−
D62F are predicted to give favorable SC−SC interactions.17
Selectivity for Histone Sequences. Interestingly, the wt
chromodomain does not exhibit significant selectivity for T6
over some of the other T6B mutants, with a variation in
binding affinity of about a factor of 3 (Kd of 10−27 μM, ΔΔG =
0.6 kcal/mol) between the best and worst histone tails (Table
1). In some ways, this is not surprising because the side chain is
on the solvent-exposed surface of the β-sheet. However,
inspection of the mutant chromodomains indicates that better
selectivity can be achieved. The A25T mutant has the best
selectivity across the five histone sequences investigated,
exhibiting a variation in binding affinity of a factor of 7 in Kd
(9−64 μM, with tightest binding to the wt histone tail),
amounting to an energetic difference of 1.2 kcal/mol (Table 1).
Even so, the A25T chromodomain mutant does not differ￾entiate between wt H3 and the T6K mutant.
Comparison of H-Bonded and Non-H-bonded Sites.
Differences in cross-strand pair preferences in HB and NHB
have been found in statistical correlation studies.16 Therefore,
comparisons were made between the NHB and HB sites of the
chromodomain−histone tail complex (A25X−T6B and T6B−
D62Z, respectively). In this case, we chose to make
comparisons in which the central T6B position is constant in
each pair. Thus, we compared A25L−T6K to T6K−D62L. In
this way, the interaction between T6B and the unvaried
position is constant. As shown in Figure S23, significant
variations of the impact of position were observed, ranging
from as little as 0.1 kcal/mol to as much as 2 kcal/mol. Only a
few key examples will be discussed in detail. Because A25K has
been found to be universally disruptive, pairs with that
mutation (the first four entries in Figure S23) will not be
discussed.
The Phe−Phe pair is favored by −1 kcal/mol in the HB
position relative to the NHB position. Phe−Phe cross-strand
interactions are common in protein structures and exhibit a
strong preference for HB sites in statistical correlations.16
Wouters and Curmi showed that Phe−Phe pairs often take a
gauche−/gauche+ conformation, which results in an offset
stacked π−π interaction.16 In addition, the GB1 mutation
studies demonstrated that a Phe−Phe pair in an HB site was
stabilizing by about −0.9 kcal/mol, which is quite similar to the
magnitude found here.17
The Thr−Thr pair is favored in the NHB position by −1
kcal/mol. Statistical analyses have demonstrated that cross￾strand Thr−Thr pairs have a preference for the gauche+
rotamer conformation, which favors inter-residue H-bonds
between the hydroxyl groups of the threonine side chains in
NHB sites.22 In an HB site, both Thr residues must be in the
unfavorable gauche-rotamer conformation to accommodate the
H-bond between the hydroxyl groups.22 Experimental results
reported by Smith and Regan in the GB1 domain are consistent
with the findings here, showing that Thr−Thr pairs in the HB
position have an unfavorable interaction energy.17
■ DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Significance to the dHP1 Chromodomain−Histone H3
Protein−Protein Interaction. Chromodomains are se￾quence-selective reader proteins for methyllysine. While insight
has been gained into how these proteins select for mono-, di-,
or trimethyllysine, minimal studies have been performed that
investigate the nature of the sequence selectivity.13 Previous
mutation studies to the TAR(K9Me3)S sequence have shown
that the R8A mutation reduces binding to dHP1 chromodo￾main by a factor of 20 and the A7M mutation reduces binding
by a factor of 25, whereas the T6A mutation reduces binding by
a factor of 7.2 S10 contributes the least to sequence selectivity,
as mutation to Ala reduces binding only by a factor of 3. The
solvent-exposed T6 does not contribute as significantly to
sequence selectivity as A7, which is buried, or R8, which forms
a salt bridge with E23 of the chromodomain. Nonetheless, T6
plays a significant role in differentiating between dHP1
chromodomain and the Drosophila polycomb (dPc) chromo￾domain, which binds to K27Me3 within the sequence
AAR(K27Me3)S. The dHP1 chromodomain differentiates
between TAR(K9Me3)S and AAR(K27Me3)S by a factor of
16.11 The human counterparts of dHP1, CBX1, CBX3, and
CBX5, also preferentially bind H3 K9Me3 over K27Me3, but
the human homologues of dPc are generally less selective.13
Thus, the small differences in the binding of mutant histone
tails to wt dHP1 chromodomain (ranging from 10 to 27 μM, a
factor of 2.7, ΔΔG = 0.6 kcal/mol) is perhaps surprising,
especially when compared to its human homologue, CBX3. On
the basis of a dot blot assay, CBX3 binds to only the native
TAR(K9Me3)S or VAR(K9Me3)S sequences, exhibiting much
higher sequence selectivity at position 6.13 Structural analysis of
CBX3 suggests this is due to a polar clasp around T6 that is not
found in the dHP1 chromodomain.
The T6K mutation, with a Kd of 10 μM versus 17 μM for T6,
may have biological relevance. One study demonstrated all
isoforms of the mammalian HP1 chromodomain, which have
70% homology to dHP1 chromodomain, recognize dimethylly￾sine 26 of histone H1.4.27 The sequence surrounding K26Me2
of H1.4 is KAR(KMe2)S, as opposed to TAR(KMe2)S,
containing a Lys at the i − 3 position instead of Thr. These
studies provide evidence that the dHP1 chromodomain can
interact with other methyllysine marks containing Lys at the i −
3 position in vitro and may also be able to do so in vivo.
The effect of mutation of the chromodomain on the binding
of the wt histone tail is more significant, ranging from 6 to 77
μM (a factor of 12.8, ΔΔG = 1.5 kcal/mol). Perhaps more
surprising is the fact that several chromodomain mutants,
including A25T, A25F, D62F, and D62T, were found that bind
more tightly to the wt histone tail than the native protein. In
particular, the D62F mutant binds the wt histone tail 3-fold
more tightly. Nonetheless, D62 is completely conserved among
Drosophila and human HP1 chromodomain isoforms (Figure
S23).13 In contrast, A25 is not completely conserved; Val is
found in the human HP1 isoforms, whereas Ala is found in the
human polycomb chromodomain isoforms (Figure S23).
Lastly, the K46A mutant, which is outside of the β-sheet but
neighbors the aromatic cage, results in the tightest binding
mutant reported, with a Kd (2 μM) nearly 10-fold stronger than
the wt chromodomain (see the Supporting Information). These
studies indicate that the dHP1 chromodomain is not optimized
for the tightest binding to the H3 histone tail; binding must be
sufficient for its biological role. This likely is a reflection of the

2320fact that the dHP1 chromodomain functions as part of a
multiprotein complex rather than in isolation. These tighter￾binding mutant chromodomains may be useful in biotechnol￾ogy applications, such as reading histone tails in a microarray
format.28−30
In conclusion, we have used the dHP1 chromodomain and
H3 K9Me3 histone tail peptide to investigate how information
gleaned from statistical and experimental studies of β-sheet
propensity and SC−SC interactions applies to protein−protein
recognition. Our studies have shown that changing residues
that are disfavored in β-sheet structures (Ala and Asp) to those
such as Leu, Thr, and Phe,23 which have high β-sheet
propensities and/or introduce favorable cross-strand interac￾tions, can have a favorable influence on binding affinity.
However, this work demonstrates that, while statistical and
experimental information from protein structures can be
informative, the complexity of β-sheets, with differences in
HB and NHB sites, edge versus internal strands, and SC−SC
interactions between multiple residues, limit the predictive
power of these tools. The higher complexity of β-sheet
interactions relative to α-helix mediated protein−protein
interactions has made them a much more challenging target,
but recent work characterizing hot spots in β-sheet-mediated
PPIs has begun to shed light on approaches for inhibiting
them.31
Additionally, these studies provided insight into the scope of
the selectivity of the dHP1 chromodomain for its intended
target, exhibiting only modest selectivity for the wt histone tail
relative to the mutants studied. Moreover, mutation to the
dHP1 chromodomain demonstrated the ability to tune the
affinity for the wt histone tail and selectivity for different
histone tail sequences, suggesting the possibility of developing
orthogonal mutant pairs for chemical biology applications.
