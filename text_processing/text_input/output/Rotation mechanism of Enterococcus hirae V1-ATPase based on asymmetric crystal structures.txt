In various cellular membrane systems, vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases)
function as proton pumps, which are involved in many processes
such as bone resorption and cancer metastasis, and these membrane
proteins represent attractive drug targets for osteoporosis and
cancer1
. The hydrophilic V1 portion is known as a rotary motor,
in which a central axis DF complex rotates inside a hexagonally
arranged catalytic A3B3 complex using ATP hydrolysis energy,
but the molecular mechanism is not well defined owing to a lack
of high-resolution structural information. We previously reported
on the in vitro expression, purification and reconstitution of
Enterococcus hirae V1-ATPase from the A3B3 and DF complexes2,3.
Here we report the asymmetric structures of the nucleotide-free
(2.8 A˚) and nucleotide-bound (3.4 A˚) A3B3 complex that demon￾strate conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding,
suggesting a binding order in the right-handed rotational orienta￾tion in a cooperative manner. The crystal structures of the nucleotide￾free (2.2 A˚) and nucleotide-bound (2.7 A˚) V1-ATPase are also
reported. The more tightly packed nucleotide-binding site seems
to be induced by DF binding, and ATP hydrolysis seems to be
stimulated by the approach of a conserved arginine residue. To
our knowledge, these asymmetric structures represent the first
high-resolution view of the rotational mechanism of V1-ATPase.
V-ATPases are thought to have originatedfrom an ancestral enzyme
in common with F-ATPases, which function as ATP synthases in
mitochondria, chloroplasts and oxidative bacteria4,5. These ATPases
possess an overall similar structure that is composed of a hydrophilic
domain (V1 and F1) and a membrane-embedded ion-transporting
domain (Vo and Fo), and they have a similar reaction mechanism
that occurs through rotation1
. The rotational catalysis of F1-ATPase
has been investigated in detail, and the molecular mechanism has
been proposed on the basis of crystal structures of the complex from
bovine6–9, yeast10–12 and bacteria13,14, and extensive single-molecule
observation of the rotation15–17. Similar V1-ATPase experiments have
been conducted using the Thermus thermophilus enzyme, which func￾tions physiologically as an ATP synthase18. The crystal structures of the
A3B3 complex at 2.8 A˚ resolution19 and the A3B3DF (V1) complex at
low resolution (4.5–4.8 A˚)
20 suggest differences in its structure and
interactions compared to F1-ATPases. Single-molecule analyses of
V1-ATPase also suggest differences in torque generation and the coup￾ling scheme of the rotation mechanism as compared to F1 (ref. 21).
Enterococcus hirae V-ATPase, which acts as a primary ion pump
similar to eukaryotic V-ATPases, uniquely transports Na1 or Li1
instead of H1 ions22–25. The enzyme is composed of nine subunits
with amino acid sequences that are homologous to those of the corres￾ponding subunits of eukaryotic V-ATPases26–28 (Supplementary
Fig. 1). In this study, we solved the first asymmetric structures of
A3B3 and A3B3DF (V1) complexes at high resolution, which enabled
the generation of a new model of the rotational mechanism.
The E. hirae A3B3 complex was purified and crystallized in the
absence of nucleotide. The crystal structure was solved at a resolu￾tion of 2.8 A˚ (Supplementary Table 1). The three catalytic A subunits
(Eh-A) and the three non-catalytic B subunits (Eh-B) are alternatively
arranged and form a hexagonal ring (Fig. 1a). The structures of these
subunits comprise the amino-terminal b-barrel domain, the central
a/b domain and the carboxy-terminal helical domain (Supplementary
Figs 2 and 3). The three Eh-A or Eh-B subunits in the A3B3 complex
were shown to have similar secondary structures, but their three￾dimensional conformations slightly differed (see Supplementary Fig. 4).
We superimposed the N-terminal b-barrel region of the three Eh-A or
Eh-B subunits to examine the conformational differences in the A3B3
complex, because this b-barrel domain should be fixed to form an
alternatively arranged ring. One of the three Eh-A subunits adopts a
closed conformation (denoted as AC), which shifts the structure into
the centre of the A3B3 ring, whereas the other two Eh-A subunits adopt
similar open conformations (denoted as AO and AO’), even though an
a-helix (residues 261–275; designated as the ‘arm’) of the three Eh-A
conformations was almost fixed (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 4).
Similarly, one of the three Eh-B subunits shows a closed conformation
(denoted as BC) compared to the others (denoted as BO and BO’)
(Fig. 1c). Thus, the A3B3 hexamer assembled asymmetrically by adja￾cent AO and BO, AO’ and BO’ and AC and BC subunits, whereas the
conserved nucleotide-binding sites were located between the three
different combinations: AOBC, AO’BO and ACBO’ pairs (Fig. 1d).
The nucleotide-binding sites, which are comprised of the phosphate￾binding loop (P-loop: GXXXXGKT(S)), the N-terminal portion of
the arm (Glu 261 and Arg 262) in Eh-A, and Arg 350 (the ‘Arg-finger’
in ATPases) in Eh-B, had three different conformations (Fig. 1i–k).
Electron density for nucleotides in the three binding sites was not
observed (Supplementary Fig. 5), consistent with the absence of nuc￾leotide contamination (ADP and ATP) detected in our sample and
nucleotide-free crystallization conditions. Thus, surprisingly, the A3B3
complex, which is formed by three identical Eh-A and Eh-B subunits,
demonstrated complete asymmetry without nucleotide binding (see
Supplementary Fig. 6 for comparison with the symmetric struc￾tures of corresponding previously reported complexes of V- and
F-ATPases). The observed asymmetric structure of nucleotide-free
A3B3 (designated as eA3B3) may provide new insights for under￾standing the cooperative nature of the rotary motor as described below.
Next, we crystallized the A3B3 complex in the presence of a high
concentration (5 mM) of the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue aden￾osine 59-(b,c-imino)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) with MgSO4, and
solved the structure of nucleotide-bound A3B3 (denoted as bA3B3) at

density peaks for AMP-PNP:Mg were found at the nucleotide-binding
pockets in two Eh-AB pairs (Supplementary Fig. 7). The other AB pair,
in which no density for nucleotide was found, was very similar to the
AOBC pair in eA3B3 (root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) 5
0.477 A˚). We designated these AOBC pairs as the ‘empty’ form on
the basis of their apparent very low affinity for AMP-PNP:Mg. The
two AMP-PNP:Mg-bound AB pairs were very similar to each other
(r.m.s.d. 5 0.511 A˚), and were also similar to the ACBO’ pair in eA3B3
(r.m.s.d. 5 0.683 A˚ and 0.719 A˚) except for the side-chain confor￾mations that directly interacted with AMP-PNP:Mg (Fig. 1k, l and
Supplementary Fig. 8). This finding suggests that the ACBO’ pair of
eA3B3 takes the ATP-bound form even in the absence of nucleotide; we
designated these ACBO’ pairs as the ‘bound’ form. Furthermore, the
more open AO’BO pair of eA3B3 seemed to bind AMP-PNP:Mg and to
change to the bound form of bA3B3; that is, binding of AMP-PNP:Mg
induced the conformational change of A3B3 from the AO’BO pair to
the ACBO’ pair (see Supplementary Video 1). We designated this
unique AO’BO pair of eA3B3 as ‘bindable’ form.
The reason that the empty form cannot bind AMP-PNP:Mg
whereas the bindable form can is discussed here. The binding sites of
empty and bindable forms are very similar except for the topologies of
the Arg-fingers (Arg 350): the Arg-finger of closed Eh-B (BC) in the
empty conformation was closer to Arg 262 than that of open Eh-B (BO)
in the bindable conformation (Fig. 1i, j, red and blue boxes), which may
prevent AMP-PNP:Mg binding. The conformation of Eh-B may regu￾late ATP-binding affinity by the Arg-finger (Arg 350) at the binding
sites. Thus, these asymmetric structures suggest that the formation of
the A3B3 hexamer ring imposes a restriction (stress) on the Eh-AB pair
to induce conformational changes (strains) that cooperatively generate
one empty (ATP-unbound form), one bindable (ATP-accessible form)
and one bound (ATP-bound form) conformation, which in turn deter￾mines the order of nucleotide binding in the ring in the right-handed
rotational orientation viewed from the top of the V1 complex.

©2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reservedNext, we crystallized and solved the crystal structure of the
nucleotide-free V1-ATPase (denoted as eV1) at 2.2 A˚ resolution (see
Supplementary Figs 9–11 and Supplementary Discussion for details).
Eh-A and Eh-B assembled asymmetrically, similar to the A3B3 com￾plex, and a central axis composed of Eh-D and Eh-F penetrated into
the cavity of the A3B3 hexamer (Fig. 2a). Eh-D demonstrated a straigh￾ter conformation compared with that of the crystal structure of the
DF complex3
, but other features were very similar (Supplementary
Fig. 12). The coiled-coil a-helices of Eh-D interacted with several
residues inside the A3B3 complex by forming 19 polar interactions
and 101 non-polar (van der Waals) interactions (Fig. 2c–h and
Supplementary Fig. 13).
The structural differences between eA3B3 and eV1 that should have
been induced by interaction with the DF complex are compared in
Fig. 2. The eV1 had an empty form (AOBC) (r.m.s.d 5 0.544 A˚) and
a bound form (ACBO’) (r.m.s.d. 5 0.699 A˚), but the eV1-bound form
was positioned as the site of the eA3B3-bindable form when both
empty forms were superimposed (Figs 1d and 2b and Supplemen￾tary Fig. 14). Therefore, the DF binding seemed to induce a change
from the bindable form (AO’BO) of eA3B3 to the bound form (ACBO’),
similar to the conformational changes of the eA3B3 induced by AMP￾PNP binding (see Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). The remaining AB
pair of eV1 represented a more tightly packed conformation composed
of closer Eh-A and -B conformations approaching the centre of the
A3B3 ring, and this was not observed in the structure of the A3B3
complex (Fig. 2g, h). We designated these new conformations of closer
Eh-A and -B subunits and the tightly packed Eh-AB pair as the ACR
and BCR subunits and ‘tight’ form, respectively. Therefore, DF complex
binding seemed to change the bound form (ACBO’) of eA3B3 to the
tight form (ACRBCR) by interacting with several Eh-A and -B residues
(Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Video 2).
These observations raise an intriguing question about the nature
of the tight form, which occurs from the bound form by interaction
with the DF complex. Figure 3a shows the nucleotide-binding site of
the tight form (ACRBCR) of eV1, which was compared with that of
the bound form (ACBO’) of eA3B3. In particular, the Arg-finger
(Arg 350) of BCR approached 1.7 A˚ closer to Arg 262 relative to that
of BO’ (Fig. 3a, blue dotted line). Thus, obtaining the structure of the
nucleotide-bound V1-ATPase is essential to understanding the effect
of Arg-finger movement to the nucleotide. Crystals of eV1were soaked
in crystallization buffer with 200 mM AMP-PNP:Mg (a concentration
sufficient to inhibit activity), and the crystal structure of the nucleo￾tide-bound V1-ATPase (denoted as bV1) was solved to a resolution of
2.7 A˚ (Supplementary Table 2). The overall structure was very similar
to that of eV1 (r.m.s.d. 5 0.913 A˚). A strong electron density peak
for AMP-PNP:Mg was observed in the binding site of the bound
and tight forms, but not in the empty form (Supplementary Fig. 15),
indicating that the empty form has a low affinity for AMP-PNP:Mg,
consistent with the observation of the empty form in bA3B3.
The c-phosphate of AMP-PNP and Mg21 were fixed by the Eh-A
side chains of Lys 238, Thr 239 and Arg 262 and theArg-finger (Arg 350)
of Eh-B, similar to those of bA3B3 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Video 3).
Superimposition of the binding site of the tight form onto that of the
bound form in bV1 revealed small but significant differences between
the two sites (Fig. 3b–e). In the tight form, movement of the Arg-finger
(Arg 350) 1.6 A˚ closer to the c-phosphate relative to the bound
form (Fig. 3d, blue dotted line) caused the rotation of the AMP-PNP
c-phosphate. Subsequently, the c-phosphate moved 0.7 A˚ closer to the
conserved Glu 261 (see Supplementary Video 4), which is a crucial
residue for hydrolysis of yeast V1-ATPase29; the corresponding residue
of F1-ATPase interacts with the c-phosphate oxygen of ATP via a water
molecule and is assumed to cleave the b-c bond of ATP directly6,9,10,30.
These findings suggest that hydrolysis of ATP is stimulated by this
approach triggered by movement of the Arg-finger, which is induced
by extensive protein–protein interactions between the DF com￾plex and the C-terminal domains of Eh-A and Eh-B. To confirm the
importance of the Arg-finger of Eh-B in ATP hydrolysis, we con￾structed three site-directed mutants of the Arg-finger and examined
their biochemical properties (see Supplementary Table 3). The bio￾chemical findings are consistent with the structural findings, in which
hydrolysis of ATP is predicted to occur in the tight form induced by
the Arg-finger approaching towards ATP. Therefore, we concluded
that the obtained structure of bV1 represents an intermediate state of
waiting for ATP hydrolysis in the catalytic cycle of V1-ATPase.
The structures and conformational differences of the three Eh-A or
B subunits are apparently different from those of the F1-ATPases,
although the nucleotide-binding-site structures of these ATPases are
highly conserved (see Supplementary Figs 16, 17 and Supplementary
Discussion). Here we summarize a possible model of the rotation
mechanism of V1-ATPase based on the asymmetric crystal structures
in this study. Figure 4a shows the structure of the C-terminal domain
surface of bV1 viewed from the top, in which two ATP:Mg molecules
are bound in the bound and tight forms. Bound ATP in the tight form
is awaiting ATP hydrolysis as described above. Hydrolysis of ATP
seems to initiate the reaction as a trigger. New ATP molecules are
unable to bind to the empty form because of its low affinity for
ATP. Therefore, to continue the reaction, certain structural changes
in the tight form should be induced by the conversion to ADP and Pi. If
the effects of DF binding are ignored, the conformation of A3B3 in V1-
ATPase may change (return) to eA3B3 (ground structure of A3B3
complex) in a cooperative manner, as shown in Fig. 4b: the bound
form remains stabilized by the bound ATP:Mg, the empty and tight
forms in V1 may change to the bindable form able to bind ATP and the
empty form with low affinity for ATP, respectively. However, the
extensive protein–protein interactions between the DF and ACRBCR
pair (tight form) may prevent this conformational change within the
A3B3, indicating that an intermediate state should exist in place of the
state of Fig. 4b. In the next step, the rotation of the DF complex seems

its Arg-finger, seems to adopt an open conformation similar to BO to
enable ATP binding. Subsequently, the conformation changes to
bA3B3, which binds ATP:Mg molecules in two bound forms, and
the DF complex rotates (Fig. 4c). Finally, the older bound form
changes to the tight form, induced by DF binding (Fig. 4d and

enhanced by the approach of the Arg-finger caused by the confor￾mational change, and the enzyme reverts to its initial state, as in
Fig. 4a. To understand the rotational mechanism of V1-ATPase more
precisely, further investigations should be undertaken, such as addi￾tional structural studies, molecular simulations and single-molecule
observation of the rotation.
METHODS SUMMARY
Sample preparation. The A3B3 and DF complexes of E. hirae were expressed
using an Escherichia coli cell-free protein expression system and purified as previ￾ously described2,3. Eh-V1 (A3B3DF) was purified by gel filtration after incubation
of Eh-A3B3 with an excess concentration (fivefold) of Eh-DF.
Crystallization, data collection and structure determination. Crystals of
nucleotide-free A3B3 (eA3B3), nucleotide-bound A3B3 (bA3B3), nucleotide-free
V1 (eV1) and nucleotide-bound V1 (bV1) were grown by sitting drop vapour
diffusion method under the conditions described in the Methods. Diffraction data
were collected from a single cryo-cooled crystal on BL41XU at SPring-8 (Harima,
Japan) and NW12A, NE3A and BL1A at Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The
structures of eA3B3, bA3B3 and bV1 were solved by molecular replacement using
the crystal structures of T. thermophilus A3B3 complex (PDB accession 3GQB)19,
A3B3 part in eV1, and whole eV1 as search models. The structure of eV1 was solved
by molecular replacement with single-wavelength anomalous diffraction using the
structures of eA3B3 and Eh-DF (PDB accession 3AON), which were superimposed
onto T. thermophilus V1-ATPase (PDB accession 3A5C)20. Data collection and
refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Protein preparation. An Escherichia coli cell-free protein expression system, as
described elsewhere31, was used to synthesize the Eh-A3B3 and DF complexes
using a mixture of plasmids containing the corresponding genes. The expressed
complexes were purified as previously described2,3. Selenomethionine-labelled
Eh-A3B3 and DF complexes were also prepared to facilitate X-ray structure deter￾mination. The sum of ATP and ADP contamination in 0.5 mM purified Eh-A3B3
and DF complexes (denatured with 0.6 M perchloric acid) was estimated with a
luciferin–luciferase assay32, after conversion of ADP to ATP using an ATP regene￾ration system3 for 30 min at room temperature; ATP and ADP contamination was
undetectable (less than 0.1 nM). The V1-ATPase (Eh-A3B3DF) was reconstituted
and purified as follows: purified Eh-A3B3 and Eh-DF in buffer A (20 mM Tris￾HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) were mixed at a 1:5
molar ratio with the addition of MES (100 mM final concentration; pH 6.0), and
were incubated with and without 0.2 mM AMP-PNP and 5 mM MgSO4 for 1 h.
Reconstituted V1-ATPase with and without AMP-PNP:Mg was purified using a
HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with buffer B
(20 mM MES, pH 6.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4 and 2 mM
DTT), respectively. Purified complexes were concentrated with an Amicon
Ultra 30 K unit (Merck Millipore).
Protein crystallization. All crystallization trials were performed using the sitting￾drop vapour diffusion method at 296 K. The crystals were soaked in cryoprotec￾tant by incrementally increasing the glycerol concentration to 20%. The crystals
were then mounted on cryo-loops (Hampton Research), flash-cooled and stored
in liquid nitrogen.
(1) Eh-A3B3 without nucleotide (eA3B3): Eh-A3B3 crystals were obtained by
mixing 0.5 ml protein solution (12 mg ml21 protein in buffer A) with 0.5 ml reser￾voir solution (0.1 M MES-Tris, pH 8.5, 24% PEG-3350 and 0.2 M ammonium
acetate).
(2) Eh-A3B3 with AMP-PNP:Mg (bA3B3): Eh-A3B3 crystals were obtained by
mixing 0.5 ml protein solution (11 mg ml21 protein in buffer A) supplemented
with 5 mM AMP-PNP and 5 mM MgSO4 with 0.5 ml reservoir solution
(0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 26% PEG-3350, and 0.2 M sodium chloride).
(3) V1-ATPase with AMP-PNP:Mg (eV1): V1 crystals were obtained by mixing
0.5 ml protein solution (12 mg ml21 protein in the presence of 0.2 mM AMP-PNP
in buffer B) with 0.5 ml reservoir solution (0.1 M Bis-Tris propane, pH 6.5, 19%
PEG-3350 and 0.2 M sodium fluoride).
(4) V1-ATPase without nucleotide (eV1(L)): V1 crystals were obtained by
mixing 0.5 ml protein solution (10 mg ml21 protein in buffer B) with 0.5 ml res￾ervoir solution (0.1 M Bis-Tris propane, pH 6.5, 20% PEG-3350 and 0.2 M sodium
fluoride).
(5) V1-ATPase soaked with AMP-PNP:Mg (bV1): V1 crystals that were
obtained in (3) were soaked for 5 h in 0.1M Bis-Tris propane, pH 6.5, 21%
PEG-3350, 0.2 mM AMP-PNP (a concentration sufficient to inhibit the activity),
3 mM MgSO4, 0.2 M sodium chloride (replaced for sodium fluoride) and 20%
glycerol.
Structure determination. All X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single
crystal at a cryogenic temperature (100 K).
(1) Eh-A3B3 without nucleotide (eA3B3): X-ray diffraction data were collected
on beamline BL41XU (l 5 1.0000 A˚) at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan). The collected
data were processed to 2.8 A˚ using iMosflm33 and then scaled by Scala from the
CCP4 program suite34. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with
MOLREP35 using the poly-Ser model of A3B3 complex from T. thermophilus(PDB
accession 3GQB)19 as a search model.
(2) Eh-A3B3 with AMP-PNP:Mg (bA3B3): X-ray diffraction data were collected
on beamline BL41XU (l 5 1.0000 A˚) at SPring-8. The collected data were pro￾cessed to 3.4 A˚ using iMosflm33 and then scaled by Scala34. The structure was
solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP35 using the structure of Eh￾A3B3 in eV1 as a search model.
(3) V1-ATPase with AMP-PNP:Mg (eV1): X-ray diffraction data were collected
on beamline NW12A (l 5 0.97919 and 1.0000 A˚) at Photon Factory (Tsukuba,
Japan). The collected data were processed and scaled to 2.6 and 2.2 A˚ using XDS36.
The structure was solved by MR–SAD (molecular replacement with single￾wavelength anomalous diffraction) using Phaser37. The partially refined A and B
subunits from the structure of Eh-A3B3 without nucleotide and the DF complex
from E. hirae (PDB accession 3AON) were superimposed onto the V1-ATPase
from T. thermophilus (PDB accession 3A5C)20. The superimposed model was
used as an initial search model. The overall figure of merit (FOM~
SP(a) exp (ia)=SP(a), in which P(a) is the probability distribution for the
phase(a)) was 0.45 using combined phases of SAD from selenium and molecular
replacement at 3.0 A˚.
(4) V1-ATPase without nucleotide (eV1(L)): X-ray diffraction data were collected
on beamline NE3A (l 5 1.0000 A˚) at Photon Factory. The collected data were
processed to 3.9 A˚ using XDS. The structure was solved by molecular replacement
with Phaser using the crystal structure of eV1 as a search model.
(5) V1-ATPase soaked with AMP-PNP:Mg (bV1): X-ray diffraction data were
collected on beamline BL1A (l 5 1.0000 A˚) at Photon Factory. The collected data
were processed to 2.7 A˚ using HKL2000 software (HKL Research). The structure
was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP using the crystal structure of
eV1 as a search model.
The atomic models were manually built using Coot38 and iteratively refined
using REFMAC539 (REFMAC5 and PHENIX40 were used for refinement of eV1).
The refined structures were validated with PROCHECK41 and RAMPAGE42. The
crystallographic and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2. The r.m.s.d. values of superimpositions for each Eh-A, Eh-B or
Eh-AB pair in the crystal structures of A3B3 and V1-ATPase are listed in Sup￾plementary Tables 4 and 5. Figures were prepared using PyMOL (The PyMOL
Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3, Schrodinger, LLC.)
Characterization of the Arg-finger mutants. Mutagenesis of the Arg-finger
(Arg350Ala/Glu/Lys) of Eh-B was performed using the QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The Arg350Ala Eh-B mutant could not be
purified as a complex with Eh-A. The other mutants were purified as described
above. Binding affinities between the Eh-A3B3 mutants and the DF complex
were measured using the Biacore T100 system (GE Healthcare) as described
previously3
. The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined using BIAevaluation
software (version 1.1), which uses the Langmuir isotherm model that assumes a 1:1
binding stoichiometry. ATPase activity was measured according to a previous
report using the ATP-regeneration system3
