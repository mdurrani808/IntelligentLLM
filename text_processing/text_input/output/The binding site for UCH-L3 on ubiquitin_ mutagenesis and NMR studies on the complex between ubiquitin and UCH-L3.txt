The ubiquitin fold is a versatile and widely used targeting signal that is
added post-translationally to a variety of proteins. Covalent attachment
of one or more ubiquitin domains results in localization of the target pro￾tein to the proteasome, the nucleus, the cytoskeleton or the endocytotic
machinery. Recognition of the ubiquitin domain by a variety of enzymes
and receptors is vital to the targeting function of ubiquitin. Several paral￾lel pathways exist and these must be able to distinguish among ubiquitin,
several different types of polymeric ubiquitin, and the various ubiquitin￾like domains. Here we report the ®rst molecular description of the bind￾ing site on ubiquitin for ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3 (UCH-L3).
The site on ubiquitin was experimentally determined using solution
NMR, and site-directed mutagenesis. The site on UCH-L3 was modeled
based on X-ray crystallography, multiple sequence alignments, and com￾puter-aided docking . Basic residues located on ubiquitin (K6, K11, R72,
and R74) are postulated to contact acidic residues on UCH-L3 (E10, E14,
D33, E219). These putative interactions are testable and fully explain the
selectivity of ubiquitin domain binding to this enzyme.

Introduction
The targeting of proteins to speci®c cellular
locations or fates requires that speci®c binding pro￾teins recognize cognate targeting signals (Bukau
et al., 1996; Mellman, 1996; Scott & Klionsky, 1997).
One such targeting signal is generated by the
covalent attachment of the ubiquitin domain to
proteins (Jentsch & Ulrich, 1998). Once ``marked'',
these proteins can undergo a variety of fates,
including: localization to the nucleus, to the cyto￾skeleton, or to endocytotic vesicles; modulation of
the enzymatic activity; changes in protein-protein
interactions; or further ubiquitination and proteo￾lysis (Ciechanover & Schwartz, 1998; Hershko,
1997; King et al., 1996; Riezman, 1998; Wilkinson,
1997). Thus, the attachment of the ubiquitin
domain to proteins serves many of the same func￾tions as modi®cations such as phosphorylation.
Targeting of proteins for degradation by the pro￾teasome is the prototype of this form of modi®-
cation (Hershko & Ciechanover, 1998). Ubiquitin
must ®rst be activated by adenylation of the C ter￾minus by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Ubiqui￾tin is then transferred to an active-site thiol residue
on a family of proteins known as ubiquitin conju￾gating enzymes. Finally, ubiquitin is attached to an
epsilon amino group of lysine on the target protein,

called ligases. In the case of proteolysis, a polyubi￾quitin chain is the targeting signal. These ubiquiti￾nated proteins must then be speci®cally bound by
subunits of the proteasome in order to sequester the
ubiquitinated protein for degradation (Pickart,
1997). In addition, deubiquitinating enzymes must
recognize mono- and polyubiquitinated proteins
and intermediates in order to metabolize them and
keep such intermediates from accumulating to det￾rimental levels (Amerik et al., 1997).
There are thought to be at least three additional
targeting pathways in mammalian cells, all utiliz￾ing the ubiquitin fold (Casteels et al., 1996; Johnson
& Hochstrasser, 1997; Mahajan et al., 1998; Matunis
et al., 1998). A 15 kDa interferon-induced protein
has been shown to contain two ubiquitin-like
domains, to be covalently attached to a variety of
cellular proteins, and to target those proteins to the
cytoskeleton (Loeb & Haas, 1994; Narasimhan et al.,
1996). Nedd8, a mammalian ubiquitin-like protein
with about 60 % identity to ubiquitin, is largely
nuclear and conjugated to a variety of different
proteins (Kamitani et al., 1997). The yeast homolog
is a protein called rub1 (Liakopoulos et al., 1998).
Finally, SUMO-1, a protein with 15 % identity to
ubiquitin is covalently attached to several proteins
including RanGAP, the activating protein of the
Ran GTPase involved in nuclear import. Modi®ed
RanGAP is localized at the nuclear membrane
where it apparently functions in nuclear import
(Mahajan et al., 1998; Matunis et al., 1998). There
are three closely related mammalian sequences that
are known, as well as a yeast homolog, Smt3
(Johnson & Blobel, 1997).
Each of these four ubiquitin domains is recog￾nized by a unique set of conjugating enzymes,
receptors and, probably, deconjugating enzymes
(references above). A more complete description of
the ubiquitin binding interactions will be necessary
to understand and target the speci®city of ubiqui￾tin receptors and enzymes. A number of ubiquitin
binding proteins have been at least partially
characterized, including: yeast rpn10/mammalian
S5a, a regulatory subunit of the proteasome with
speci®city for binding polymeric ubiquitin contain￾ing four or more subunits (Young et al., 1998);
yeast Ufd2, which binds to ubiquitin dimers and
trimers bound to a fused ubiquitin in model sub￾strates (Koegl et al., 1999); yeast YUH1/mamma￾lian ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases that bind
ubiquitin with micromolar binding constants
(Larsen et al., 1996); and yeast ubp14/mammalian
isopeptidase T, the ubiquitin-speci®c protease
responsible for disassembling the polyubiquitin
chain after degradation of the target protein
(Wilkinson et al., 1995). All of these sites exhibit
different selectivity, and none has been described
at a molecular level.
Recently, we reported the ®rst X-ray crystal
structure of a ubiquitin-binding protein, the human
ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3 (Johnston et al.,
1997). This deubiquitinating enzyme has speci®city
for hydrolysis of the ester or amide bond at the C
terminus of ubiquitin when the leaving group is
small or disordered (Larsen et al., 1998). Thus, it
appears to have a role in processing the polypro￾tein ubiquitin gene products and salvage of ubiqui￾tin intermediates and derivatives that could
otherwise accumulate. This protein binds ubiquitin
tightly, with an estimated binding constant of
300 nM (Dang et al., 1998). Here we report a var￾iety of experiments to identify and describe the
binding interactions between ubiquitin and this
deubiquitinating enzyme. The results help to
explain the mechanisms of speci®city that allow
receptors and enzymes to distinguish between the
different ubiquitin family proteins.
Results and Discussion
The goal of this work is to describe the nature of
the binding site for ubiquitin and learn more about
the af®nity and selectivity of proteins that bind
ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like domains. As no co￾crystal containing ubiquitin has been reported, we
have initiated a series of experiments to examine
the solution structure of the complex between ubi￾quitin and UCH-L3.
The site on ubiquitin
NMR of ubiquitin bound to UCH-L3
Both the X-ray crystal and NMR structures of
ubiquitin were reported more than a decade ago
(Di Stefano & Wand, 1987; Vijay-Kumar et al.,
1987; Weber et al., 1987). In the ®rst series of exper￾iments, we used NMR to determine which face of
ubiquitin is involved in binding to UCH-L3 in sol￾ution. This was determined by quantifying the
chemical shift perturbations of the main-chain
nuclei of ubiquitin upon binding to UCH-L3. Isoto￾pically labelled ubiquitin was bound to excess
UCH-L3 and the chemical shift changes relative to
free ubiquitin were determined.
NMR assignments (1
HN, 15N, 13Ca
, 13CO) were
determined for 2
H, 13C, 15N-labeled human ubiqui￾tin bound to UCH-L3. Because of the high molecu￾lar mass of the complex (34 kDa), the
correspondingly short 13C T2 relaxation times, and
the limited solubility of the complex, it was advan￾tageous to use deuterated ubiquitin for the assign￾ment studies, combined with deuterium
decoupling during 13
Ca evolution (Grzesiek et al.,
1993; Yamazaki et al., 1994). While the NMR
assignments for free ubiquitin are known (Di
Stefano & Wand, 1987; Schneider et al., 1992; Wand
et al., 1996), deuteration perturbs some of the
chemical shifts necessitating reassignment in order
to quantify accurately the chemical shift changes
upon UCH-L3 binding. Thus, the 1
HN, 15N, 13Ca
,
and 13CO chemical shifts of free 2
H, 13C, 15N￾labeled ubiquitin were assigned. The 1
H and 15N
chemical shifts of the deuterated protein map faith￾fully to those reported previously for ubiquitin.
1068 Binding Site for UCH-L3 on UbiquitinThe 13Ca shifts and 13CO shifts were then corre￾lated using HNCa
/HN(CO)Ca and HNCO spectra
as described above.
Next we quanti®ed the change in chemical shift
induced upon binding of ubiquitin to UCH-L3.
While almost all of the chemical shifts for the N￾terminal 70 amino acid residues of 2
H, 13C, 15N￾labeled ubiquitin bound to UCH-L3 were assigned,
some resonances remained unassigned, including
1
H and 15N of residues 1, 19, 24, 37, 38, 53 and 69, 13Ca of residue 37, and 13CO of residues 18, 23, 36,
37, 52 and 68. Also, the resonances of the C-term￾inal six amino acid residues of ubiquitin (71-76)
could not be assigned in the complex. It is likely
that the six C-terminal amino acid residues of ubi￾quitin are either structurally, or dynamically, per￾turbed by binding of UCH-L3.
The chemical shifts of many of the main-chain
nuclei of ubiquitin are perturbed upon binding,
including those for amide proton and nitrogen,
alpha carbon and carbonyl carbon atoms (see
Supplementary Material). The extent of the
chemical shift changes induced by UCH-L3 bind￾ing can be visualized by plotting the weighted
average perturbation as a function of the residue
number (Figure 1). This representation suggests
that three areas on the surface of ubiquitin are
perturbed upon forming the ubiquitinUCH-L3
complex; residues 4 to 14, 39 to 50, and 67 to
76. When these residues are mapped onto the
surface of ubiquitin (magenta in Figure 2(a)),
they de®ne a contiguous surface encompassing
the basic face of the molecule. We have pre￾viously noted that the interaction between
ubiquitin and UCH-L3 was ablated by high salt
(Larsen et al., 1996), suggesting that the
interactions were primarily electrostatic. This
would suggest that upon forming the complex,
basic residues on the basic face of ubiquitin are
in intimate contact with acidic residues on the
surface of UCH-L3.
Site-directed mutagenesis
To determine if these electrostatic interactions
contribute signi®cantly to the stability of the ubi￾quitinUCH-L3 complex, we mutated a number of
basic residues on the surface of ubiquitin and
measured the effect on the binding of ubiquitin to
UCH-L3. Binding constants were determined by
measuring the ef®ciency of these derivatives to act
as competitive inhibitors of the hydrolysis of Y77-
ubiquitin. Table 1 shows that mutation of R74,
R72, R54 and K6 to remove the charge had the lar￾gest effect on binding, while removing the charge
at K27 and H68 had little effect on binding. The
mutation of R42 to L actually increased the af®nity
of UCH-L3 for ubiquitin. With the exception of
R54L, all of the mutations that severely affected
binding were also implicated by the NMR exper￾iments described above.
Arginine 54 is spatially removed from all of the
other important residues, and it is not immediately
obvious why mutation at this position had such a
profound effect. We noted however, that in the
published ubiquitin X-ray structure, the guanidino
group of R54 forms a favorable salt-bridge with
the side-chain carboxylate of E51 of ubiquitin. In
agreement with this prediction, the E51A mutation
also weakened the apparent binding, while
mutation of other acidic residues near this residue
had no effect (Table 1). Thus, it appears that
mutation at R54 or E51 results in a folding defect
and that, as a consequence, this protein is largely
unable to bind to UCH-L3. This assumption is cur￾rently being tested by NMR studies of the mutant
proteins. The available evidence suggests that the
effect of mutation at R54 is an indirect effect, and
there is no evidence of a direct interaction with
UCH-L3.
Finally, a number of conservative mutations
were also illustrative, including L8A and K11R,
which give rise to large decreases in binding af®-
nity. This region has been shown to be important
in binding of polyubiquitin chains to the protea￾some subunit S5a (Beal et al., 1996, 1998).
Figure 2(a) shows the surface of ubiquitin with
these putative binding surfaces highlighted. The
magenta color represents those residues that
undergo a signi®cant change in chemical shift in
the NMR upon binding to UCH-L3, while the resi￾dues shown in yellow represent those where
mutation signi®cantly decreased the binding af®-
nity. With the exception of the R54 mutant, these
two sets are internally consistent, strongly
suggesting that these are the residues on ubiquitin
involved in binding to UCH-L3.

Binding Site for UCH-L3 on Ubiquitin 1069The site on UCH-L3
Having de®ned the surface of ubiquitin that
interacts with UCH-L3, we next sought to identify
candidate residues on UCH-L3 that interact with
ubiquitin. Two lines of evidence are considered
here: similarities to other papain family thiol pro￾teases and evolutionary similarities among several
known UCH family enzymes.
Similarity to other papain-like proteases
Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases are related to
the papain family of thiol proteases (Johnston et al.,
1997). Both possess very similar core domains, con￾sisting of an alpha helix, ®ve anti-parallel beta
sheets, and two extended structures. The catalytic
residues of UCH-L3 and other papain-like thiol
proteases, including the active site cysteine, histi￾dine aspartate and glutamine, superimpose with a
root-mean-squared deviation of approximately
1 AÊ . There can be no doubt that these family mem￾bers evolved from a common precursor in spite of
the lack of apparent primary sequence homology.
The catalytic residues in this family of proteases
all lie at the bottom of a shallow cleft running from
front to back at the top of the UCH-L3 molecule
shown in Figure 2(b). Peptide substrates and
inhibitors orient in this grove with the peptide run￾ning in an N to C orientation as one progresses
through the cleft from the active site cysteine (top,
front, Figure 2(b)) to the histidine and ultimately
the aspartate or asparagine (top, back, Figure 2(b)).
Thus, the P-site of the enzyme (Schechter & Berger,
1967) is at the end of the cleft nearest the viewer in
Figure 2(b) and is the site where the C-terminal
glycine of ubiquitin would bind. The P0 site is at
the far end of the active site cleft shown at the top
of Figure 2(b) and is the site where the leaving
group would be bound. When these constraints are
applied to UCH-L3, it is apparent that ubiquitin
must approach from the face of UCH-L3 nearest
the viewer in Figure 2(b). This geometry is con￾sidered below in de®ning constraints on the dock￾ing algorithms.
Highly conserved regions
A second set of constraints can also be suggested
by considering the surface of UCH-L3 contributed
by residues that are highly conserved in this gene
family. That is, it is expected that residues on these
enzymes that contact the highly conserved regions
on ubiquitin would also be highly conserved. A
number of UCH sequences are now known, and
all have a highly conserved 220 amino acid residue
catalytic domain. Thus, we next sought to identify
the most highly conserved residues and to map
them on the surface of UCH-L3 crystal structure
(see Methods). When these values were mapped
on the surface of the known UCH-L3 structure,
two patches of invariant residues (red) are
Figure 2. The surfaces involved
in the complex between UCH-L3
and ubiquitin. Surfaces shown are
MolCad surfaces generated in
SYBYL (Tripos Inc.). Ribbon
diagrams are also shown for these
orientations. (a) The surface of
ubiquitin involved in binding to
UCH-L3 is shown in magenta
(based on NMR shifts) or yellow
(based on site-directed mutagen￾esis). (b) The conserved surfaces of
UCH-L3. Seven UCH family
sequences (accession numbers
O01391, P09936, P15374, P35122,
P35127, Q10171, and Q00981) were
identi®ed and aligned using the
Pileup algorithm of the GCG pack￾age (Genetics Computer Group,
Madison WI). Next, the aligned
sequences were analyzed by the
Plotsimilarity routine of the GCG
package. This analysis returns a
single number at each position of
the aligned sequences that
represents the degree of conserva￾tion of sequence at that position.
Similarity values at each aligned position were used to color the surface of UCH-L3. The degree of similarity is color
coded, with red > orange > yellow > green > purple > blue.
1070 Binding Site for UCH-L3 on Ubiquitinobserved. These lie on opposite sides of the mol￾ecule and are connected by the active site cleft.
Only one of these patches, that nearest the P-site,
is in a position to interact with ubiquitin if it
approached as described above (i.e., from the front
of Figure 2(b)). The patch nearest the P0
-site is not
visible in Figure 2(b) and may be in a position to
interact with the underside of a loop whose
sequence is somewhat variable in these enzymes
and that is disordered in the original crystal struc￾ture (Johnston et al., 1997). It was previously
argued that this loop is too variable to be packed
underneath ubiquitin as it binds. We speculated
that this loop would form part of the peptide leav￾ing group site at the P0
-end of the substrate cleft
(Johnston et al., 1997). This is consistent with other
members of the papain family that contain ``block￾ing'' peptide loops that limit the size of the S0 leav￾ing groups (i.e., the peptides which are hydrolyzed
from the C terminus of ubiquitin derivatives) that
can be accommodated.
Thus, it is likely that the patch of conserved resi￾dues nearest the P-site (red in Figure 2(b)) is the
binding site for ubiquitin. In agreement with this
assessment, we note that three conserved acidic
residues, E10, E14, and D33, form part of the
patch. These residues are thus in a position to form
ionic interactions with the basic face of ubiquitin as
it binds to UCH-L3 and these interactions are likely
to be important. For instance, E10 is next to L9 and
participates in forming a loop that occludes the P
site in the active site cleft (Johnston et al., 1997).
This loop must be repositioned upon binding of
ubiquitin in order to allow binding of the substrate
in a productive fashion. The binding of ubiquitin
near this residue may result in ionic interactions
between the basic face of ubiquitin and this acidic
residue, and causes the obligate substrate-induced
conformational change that is necessary to form
the active enzyme substrate complex.
Docking of ubiquitin into the UCH-L3 site
The above constraints suggest that the patch of
conserved sequence nearest the P-site of UCH-L3
forms the binding site for ubiquitin. It was next of
interest to attempt docking of ubiquitin and UCH￾L3 to investigate the detailed nature of the protein￾protein interactions. It was assumed that the faces
of ubiquitin and UCH-L3 involved in the binding
interactions were nearest the viewer in Figure 2.
Thus, these faces were juxtaposed with the C-term￾inal residues of ubiquitin constrained to the region
of the active site C95. The two molecules were then
manually positioned to minimize the distances
between them and to eliminate any steric clashes
using the Flexidock module of SYBYL (Tripos,
Inc.).
Figure 3 illustrates the best ®t obtained manu￾ally. Figure 3(a) shows that surface of UCH-L3,
with the highly conserved residues colored red.
Superimposed in front of that is a ribbon rep￾resentation of the docked ubiquitin molecule
oriented to interact with the binding face on
UCH-L3. Note that the two strands of ubiquitin
beta-sheet implicated by NMR as being in the
interface (residues 40-49 and 67-72) are partially
occluded in this orientation and align perfectly
with the stripe of highly conserved residues on
the face of UCH-L3. This was not factored into
the docking, but is a gratifying con®rmation of
the hypothesized docking mode. Figure 3(b)
shows the converse orientation and rendering.
That is, the surface representation of ubiquitin is
shown in the background (with magenta signify￾ing the NMR perturbations and yellow showing
those residues that are implicated by the site￾directed mutagenesis data). Superimposed on
this is the ribbon representation of UCH-L3 as
described above. Figure 3(c) shows the space-
®lling view of the complex obtained by this
manual docking. Figure 3(c) is derived by rotat￾ing the structures shown in Figure 3(a) by 90
degrees around the Y-axis. In general, there is
very good agreement between the experimental
data and the ®nal structure proposed. There is
extensive complimentarity between the surfaces,
particularly between a ``knuckle'' formed by resi￾dues 6-13 of ubiquitin and a ``cleft'' on UCH-L3.
Residues 10-14, 33-36, 167-168 and 219-223 on
UCH-L3 (see below) all form close interactions
with ubiquitin.
This manually docked structure was based on
only the ®rst 73 residues of the ubiquitin structure,
since the last three residues have a great deal of
conformational ¯exibility and cannot be assigned
to a unique conformation. Similarly, the disordered
loop of UCH-L3 (residues 147-166) has been
ignored in this model, as we cannot specify its

Binding Site for UCH-L3 on Ubiquitin 1071location either. Nonetheless, the docked structure
is reasonable, on the basis of several criteria. First,
more than 1100 AÊ 2 of protein surface is buried on
forming this complex. This is somewhat low com￾pared with the average protein-protein binding
interaction (1600(400) AÊ 2
) but is consistent with
the few measurements on enzyme/substrate inter￾actions (Bogan & Thorn, 1998; Jones & Thornton,
1996; Lo Conte et al., 1999). Almost a third of this
occluded area is comprised of polar atoms, well
within the range observed in other proteins.
Second, most of the surface involved in binding (as
judged by the NMR measurements) is occluded in
this complex. Third, the distance from the carboxyl
group of L73 of ubiquitin to the active site cysteine
of UCH-L3 is 12 AÊ , well within the distance
required to position G76 at the active site. Finally,
several electrostatic interactions are apparent upon
inspection. Small rotations of the side-chain of K6,
K11, and R72 are all that are necessary to bring
these positive charges within 4 AÊ of compensating
negative charges on UCH-L3. It is important to
note that these interactions were only revealed
after the proteins were docked according to strictly
steric constraints. Finally, K48 is ``free'' and in a
position such that it could be anticipated that K48-
linked diubiquitin could bind. This is in good
agreement with the known substrate speci®city of
UCH-L3 (Larsen et al., 1998).
Several close contacts between ubiquitin and
UCH-L3 are apparent in the putative docked struc￾ture (Figure 3(c)). Residue K6 on ubiquitin is
within 4 AÊ of Y35 and L41 on UCH-L3, and only
slightly farther from D33. L8 on ubiquitin forms
close contacts with V34, Y35, N223, and A224 on
UCH-L3. The methyl group of T9 makes close con￾tacts with alkyl groups on L220 on UCH-L3. The
side-chain methylene groups of K11 of ubiquitin
pack closely with the hydrophobic side-chain of
L220 on UCH-L3, while the charge on this lysine
may be neutralized by an intramolecular inter￾action with E34 of ubiquitin. Finally, a hydro￾phobic core is formed upon binding and involves
L71 and L73 and the methylene groups of K11 of
ubiquitin and L9, L168, L220, and the methylene
groups of R221 on UCH-L3.
More distant interactions can be easily converted
to closer interactions by modest rearrangements of
several other side-chains. These include R72 on
ubiquitin and E10 on UCH-L3, R42 on ubiquitin
and E14 on UCH-L3, H68 on ubiquitin and D33
and Y35 on UCH-L3, and K6 on ubiquitin and D38
on UCH-L3. The importance of interactions invol￾ving R42 and H68 of ubiquitin is not clear, how￾ever, since the mutation of the corresponding
residues leads to little weakening of the ubiquitin
binding (see above).
The substrate-induced conformational change
The unliganded conformation of UCH-L3 is inac￾tive. Peptide substrates corresponding to the C￾terminal sequence of ubiquitin are not cleaved
(Dang et al., 1998) and the crystal structure shows
that L9 of UCH-L3 must be moved in order to
allow access of the substrate to the active-site
groove (Johnston et al., 1997). The putative docked
structure described here suggests the nature of this
conformational change. Speci®cally, an ionic inter￾action between R72 on ubiquitin and E10 on UCH￾L3 would likely alter this region of UCH-L3. The
Figure 3. Manual docking of ubiquitin and UCH-L3.
(a) The surface of UCH-L3 is shown with the active site
at the top and the P site closest to the viewer. Highly
conserved residues colored red. Superimposed in front
of that is a ribbon representation of the docked ubiqui￾tin molecule oriented to interact with the binding face
on UCH-L3. (b) The converse orientation and rendering
are shown. That is, the surface representation of ubiqui￾tin is shown in the background (with magenta signify￾ing the NMR perturbations and yellow showing those
residues that are implicated by the site-directed
mutagenesis data). Superimposed on this is the ribbon
representation of UCH-L3, as described above. (c) Both
molecules rendered as MolCad surfaces. The color
scheme is the same as that in Figure 3.
1072 Binding Site for UCH-L3 on Ubiquitinside-chain of L9 is also poised to interact strongly
with a hydrophobic core at the interface of the
two proteins (see above). As mentioned, R42 on
ubiquitin and E14 on UCH-L3 may also interact to
complete this conformational change.
How is selectivity achieved?
Each of the members of this ubiquitin-like pro￾tein family appears to be activated and conjugated
by unique, but evolutionarily related, enzymes
(Hochstrasser, 1998; Johnson & Blobel, 1997;
Johnson et al., 1997; Liakopoulos et al., 1998). Like￾wise, it seems likely that one or more of the deubi￾quitinating enzymes process the pro-protein
precursors of the ubiquitin-like proteins. For
example, it has recently been reported that pro￾NEDD8 is ef®ciently processed by UCH-L3 (Wada
et al., 1998). However, no deubiquitinating enzyme
has been reported to recognize and process pro￾SUMO-1 or proUCRP. One of the tests of this
model is its utility in explaining this selectivity.
Figure 4 shows an alignment of several ubiquitin
sequences, along with those of a number of ubiqui￾tin-like proteins that are reversibly conjugated to
and deconjugated from cellular proteins. Also indi￾cated in red on this Figure are the regions of the
ubiquitin domain involved in binding to UCH-L3.
The UCH enzymes may exert such speci®city
because of differences at the surface of the ubiqui￾tin domain. Most closely related to ubiquitin are
the viral ubiquitins. These proteins are virtually
identical in the regions that interact with UCH-L3
and, as expected, viral ubiquitin inhibits the
hydrolysis of ubiquitin derivatives by UCH-L3.
The next most closely related ubiquitin-like protein
is Nedd8. It is about 50 % identical to ubiquitin
and adopts the same fold (Whitby et al., 1998). This
protein shows only four differences between it and
ubiquitin in the L3 binding domains. It too is a
good substrate for UCH-L3 (Wada et al., 1998).
In contrast, the interferon-induced protein
(UCRP) and the members of the SMT3/SUMO-1
family are much more distantly related, although it
has been shown that SUMO-1 adopts the ubiquitin
fold (Bayer et al., 1998). The signi®cant sequence
differences extend into the regions that interact
with UCH-L3, including: F4K, T7G/A, L8Q,
K11N/S, Q41I/L, A46D, H68D/E, R72Q/E/H,
L73Q, and R74T/I/L. Many of these changes rep￾resent dramatic changes in the properties of this
face of the molecule. As predicted by our model,
UCH-L3 fails to bind or process the interferon￾induced ubiquitin-like protein that targets proteins
to the cytoskeleton, or the SMT3 family members
(unpublished observations).

shaded gray. From top to bottom: the SUMO-1/SMT3 family, the interferon-induced UCRP (ubiquitin cross-reacting
protein, ISG15) family, the Nedd8/Rub1 family, the viral ubiquitin family, and the ubiquitin family. Also indicated
are the regions interacting with the UCH-L3 binding site.
Binding Site for UCH-L3 on Ubiquitin 1073Recently, a new protease family has been
reported to cleave yeast SMT3p fusion proteins
and this family has been called the ULP (ubiquitin￾like protease) family (Li & Hochstrasser, 1999).
Nothing is known about how these proteins recog￾nize their substrates but ubiquitin derivatives are
not substrates. Strictly on the basis of steric con￾straints, it is likely that some of the same surface
on the ubiquitin-like proteins will be important for
recognition by these processing enzymes.
Clearly, the level of structural detail described
here offers an opportunity to test this model. There
is no experimental data describing the proposed
site on UCH-L3 and the proposed site must be con-
®rmed by NMR, mutagenesis or crystallography.
This detailed knowledge will be necessary to
develop selective and generic inhibitors of the
binding of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins to
a variety of cellular receptors, and to thereby learn
more about the roles of such targeting in cellular
regulation and protein homeostasis.
Methods
NMR studies
UCH-L3
UCH-L3 was expressed in Escherichia coli and puri®ed
as described (Larsen et al., 1996).
2
H,13C,15N-labeled ubiquitin
The details describing the genetic construct, the cell
line and general conditions for human ubiquitin
growth and overexpression have been described
(Wand et al., 1996). The 2
H,13C,15N-labeled ubiquitin
was expressed by growth on minimal medium (M9
salts) containing 2.0 g/l 15NH4Cl, 1.0 g/l [13C-6]glucose
in 80 % 2
H2O/20 % H2O. Puri®cation of the ubiquitin
ensued as described (Wand et al., 1996). The 15
NH4Cl,
[
13C-6]glucose, and 2
H2O were from Isotec Inc., Mia￾misburg, OH.
Formation of a [2
H,13C,15N]ubiquitin/UCH-L3 complex
for NMR
The UCH-L3 used for the NMR experiments was dia￾lyzed against 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer con￾taining 10 mM DTT and 0.02 % sodium azide, which had
been depleted of O2 by sparging with N2. It was then
concentrated under N2 using an Amicon stirred cell and
YM-10 membrane. The buffer was exchanged in the stir￾red cell for an identical one in 90 % H2O/10 % 2
H2O. The 2
H,13C,15N-labeled ubiquitin was dialyzed against H2O,
lyophilized, dissolved in a minimal quantity of the O2-
depleted phosphate buffer in 90 % H2O/10 % 2
H2O
described above, and added to the concentrated UCH￾L3. The complex was transferred to an NMR tube and
the headspace ®lled with argon before sealing. The ®nal
sample used for NMR (in 600 ml) contained 1.0 mM ubi￾quitin and 1.5 mM UCH-L3. An identical sample with
no UCH-L3 was also prepared.
Main-chain NMR assignments
Assignment of the 1
HN, 15N, and 13Ca resonances of 2
H,13C,15N-labeled human ubiquitin complexed to UCH￾L3 was accomplished primarily using deuterium￾decoupled versions (Yamazaki et al., 1994) of HNCa and
HN(CO)Ca (Grzesiek & Bax, 1992; Kay et al., 1990) exper￾iments. The chemical shifts of the 13CO nuclei were sub￾sequently correlated using a recent version of the HNCO
(Grzesiek & Bax, 1992; Kay et al., 1990) experiment. 1
H,15N-HSQC spectra were recorded as described
(Zhang et al., 1994). All experiments utilized gradient
sensitivity-enhancement (Cavanagh & Rance, 1990; Kay
et al., 1992; Palmer et al., 1992) and minimal dephasing of
the H2O resonance, and gradient and H2O ¯ip-back
pulses for H2O suppression (Grzesiek & Bax, 1993;
Zhang et al., 1994).
Some weak resonances observed in the 1
H,15N-HSQC
spectrum are not observed in the HNCa
/HN(CO)Ca
spectra. The chemical shifts of these unassigned reson￾ances are signi®cantly different than those of the C-term￾inal six residues of free ubiquitin. It is not unlikely that
these residues correspond to the C-terminal amino acid
residues of ubiquitin in the complex. If so, the chemical
shifts are severely perturbed relative to free ubiquitin. It
is also possible that binding of UCH-L3 affects the
dynamics of the C-terminal domain such that slow con￾formational exchange broadens the resonances signi®-
cantly.
All spectra were recorded at 25 C with a Varian
INOVA spectrometer operating at 750 MHz (1
H)
equipped with the necessary deuterium-decoupling
hardware. The 1
H chemical shifts were referenced to
external NaDSSÿ in 2
H2O (0.00 ppm), while the 13C
and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly
assuming reported absolute frequency ratios (Wishart
et al., 1995). Data processing and visualization were
accomplished using Felix (Biosym Technologies, San
Diego, CA, USA).
Site-directed mutants
Human ubiquitin point mutants were generated by
PCR-based overlap extension as described (Baboshina &
Haas, 1996). The PCR product harboring the designed
amino acid mutation was digested with NdeI and EcoRI,
then ligated into the similarly digested pPLhUB vector
(Burch & Haas, 1994). Addition of Y77 to the C terminus
of ubiquitin utilized the cassette mutagenesis technique
as described (Ecker et al., 1987). Brie¯y, the last module of
pPLhUB plasmid was excised by digesting with A¯2 and
KpnI. A synthetic double-strand oligonucleotide coding
for the desired change was then ligated into these sites.
All constructs were con®rmed by sequencing. The result￾ing vectors were transformed into the Escherichia coli
AR58 host, protein expression was induced by heat and
the proteins were puri®ed as described (Burch & Haas,
1994). The concentration of ubiquitin and all mutants was
determined spectrophotometrically using the experimen￾tally obtained extinction coef®cient of 0.16 l/g.
Inhibition of UCH activity by mutant ubiquitin
The af®nity of UCH-L3 for different mutants was
measured by determining the inhibition constant for
competitive inhibition of substrate hydrolysis. The sub￾strate used in these assays was 125I-labeled Y77 ubiquitin
prepared by iodination of Y77 ubiquitin and had a ®nal
1074 Binding Site for UCH-L3 on Ubiquitinspeci®c activity of 1.2  104 cpm/pmol with respect to
the Y77 labeling. Initial rates of UCH-L3 catalyzed
hydrolysis of 125I-labeled Y from 125I-labeled Y77 ubiqui￾tin were determined by measuring the rate of accumu￾lation of TCA-insoluble radioactivity. Duplicate
incubations (30 ml, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
10 mM DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 3.5 pg UCH-L3 and the
indicated concentrations of 125I-labeled Y77 ubiquitin
and ubiquitin mutants) were quenched after ®ve minutes
at 37 C. After ten minutes, the quenched reaction
mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 g for ten minutes.
TCA-soluble 125I-labeled Y was measured by counting an
aliquot of the supernatent. Binding of mutant ubiquitin
to UCH-L3 was by determining the inhibition constant
of the mutant as a competitive inhibitor of 125I-labeled
Y77Ub processing. For these assays, the substrate was
held constant at 0.3 mM and the concentration of mutant
protein was varied. Data were analyzed by Lineweaver￾Burke and Dixon plots.
Docking of ubiquitin and UCH-L3
A putative docked structure was de®ned by manu￾ally docking the molecules using the Flexidock mod￾ule of SYBYL. The surface on ubiquitin that is de®ned
by the NMR studies was oriented facing UCH-L3 and
with the C terminus of the molecule at the top. Simi￾larly, UCH-L3 was oriented with the active site cleft
at the top and with the putative binding site facing
ubiquitin. The two structures were manually rotated
and translated to minimize the distance between the
centers of gravity of the two proteins. Steric clashes
were avoided by minimizing the steric energy factor
calculated by the Flexidock module. Electrostatic ener￾gies were ignored in this modeling, since they were
much larger than the steric energies, since no waters
of hydration were utilized, and since the faces being
docked had diffuse and opposite charge distributions.
The optimal docked structure was de®ned as one that
resulted in appropriate distances between the C termi￾nus of ubiquitin and the active site cysteine of ubiqui￾tin, that minimized distance and steric con¯icts, and
that was chosen as the optimal initial docked struc￾ture. When this docking was repeated several times
from different starting positions, very similar struc￾tures were obtained. A representative one is discussed
here.
The program ACCESS (Richmond, 1984) was used to
evaluate the solvent-accessible areas of the free and the
docked molecules and to calculate the surface area bur￾ied upon docking.
