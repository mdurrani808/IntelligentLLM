The plant cell wall degrading apparatus of anaerobic bacteria
includes a large multienzyme complex termed the “cellulo￾some.” The complex assembles through the interaction of
enzyme-derived dockerin modules with the multiple cohesin
modules of the noncatalytic scaffolding protein. Here we report
the crystal structure of the Clostridium cellulolyticum cohesin￾dockerin complex in two distinct orientations. The data show
that the dockerin displays structural symmetry reflected by the
presence of two essentially identical cohesin binding surfaces. In
one binding mode, visualized through the A16S/L17T dockerin
mutant, the C-terminal helix makes extensive interactions with
its cohesin partner. In the other binding mode observed
through the A47S/F48T dockerin variant, the dockerin is
reoriented by 180° and interacts with the cohesin primarily
through the N-terminal helix. Apolar interactions dominate
cohesin-dockerin recognition that is centered around a
hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the cohesin, formed by
Leu-87 and Leu-89, which is occupied, in the two binding
modes, by the dockerin residues Phe-19 and Leu-50, respec￾tively. Despite the structural similarity between the C. cellu￾lolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum cohesins and dock￾erins, there is no cross-specificity between the protein
partners from the two organisms. The crystal structure of the
C. cellulolyticum complex shows that organism-specific rec￾ognition between the protomers is dictated by apolar inter￾actions primarily between only two residues, Leu-17 in the
dockerin and the cohesin amino acid Ala-129. The biological
significance of the plasticity in dockerin-cohesin recognition,
observed here in C. cellulolyticum and reported previously in
C. thermocellum, is discussed.
The microbial degradation of the plant cell wall is an impor￾tant biological process that is central to the cycling of carbon
between microorganisms, plants, and herbivores. Furthermore,
the enzymes that catalyze the hydrolyses of plant structural
polysaccharides are deployed in several biotechnological pro￾cesses (for review see Ref. 1), although there is currently con￾siderable interest in the application of these biocatalysts in the
conversion of lignocellulose, an abundant renewable source of
organic carbon, into biofuels such as ethanol and butanol (2, 3).
The plant cell wall is an insoluble highly recalcitrant macromol￾ecule consisting mainly of interlocking polysaccharides. Sapro￾phytic microorganisms that utilize the plant cell wall as a major
nutrient synthesize enzyme consortia in which the biocatalysts
act in synergy to degrade the composite substrate. A common
feature of the plant cell wall apparatus synthesized by both
eukaryotic and prokaryotic anaerobic microorganisms is that
the component enzymes assemble into large complexes, which
are referred to as cellulosomes (for review see Ref. 4). The cel￾lulosome is assembled by the binding of the catalytic subunits,
comprising glycoside hydrolases, esterases, and lyases, to a non￾catalytic protein scaffold (hereafter referred to as Cip) (5). The
integration of the plant cell wall hydrolases into the cellulo￾some has been proposed to potentiate the synergistic inter￾actions between the enzymes and contributes to substrate
targeting through the cellulose binding capacity of most Cip
molecules (6, 7). The Cip molecules of Clostridium cellulo￾lyticum and Clostridium thermocellum (designated CipC
and CipA, respectively) can bind eight and nine enzymes,
respectively (8), although the cellulosomes of other anaero￾bic bacteria deploy multiple Cip and adapter molecules in
assembling as many as 96 catalytic subunits into a single
complex (9). In Clostridia the Cip contains multiple type I
cohesin modules that bind tightly to the type I dockerins
present on the catalytic subunits and thus assemble these
enzymes into the cellulosome (10). In general, within a single
organism, cohesin modules of the Cip display a very high
level of sequence identity, and the type I dockerins appear to
display little if any discrimination between their receptors in
the cellulosome scaffold (11, 12). Similarly, the type I dock￾erin modules also display extensive sequence identity con￾sistent with the lack of specificity for the type I cohesins
(4, 13).

18422 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 283•NUMBER 26•JUNE 27, 2008
 at Univ of St Andrews on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from The crystal structures of type I C. thermocellum cohesin￾dockerin complexes have provided insight into the mechanism
of cellulosome assembly (14, 15). Within the dockerin there is a
tandem duplication of a 22-residue sequence that contributes
an -helix and an EF-hand calcium-binding motif and displays
remarkable structural conservation. Indeed the structure of the
first duplicated segment, which contains the N-terminal helix,
can be superimposed precisely over the structure containing
the second segment containing the C-terminal helix (helix-3).
This symmetry, coupled with several mutagenesis studies (16,
17), indicates that the C. thermocellum type I dockerin contains
two equivalent ligand-binding sites, which have been main￾tained during evolution. This view is entirely consistent with
the crystal structure of the complexes. Thus in one complex
helix-3 dominates cohesin recognition with Ser-45 and Thr-46
playing a central role in the polar interactions between the two
protein partners (14). In the second crystal structure the dock￾erin is rotated 180° relative to the cohesin, and helix-1, rather
than helix-3, plays a central role in complex formation (15).
Thus, the equivalent residues to Ser-45 and Thr-46 in the
N-terminal helix, Ser-11 and Thr-12, dominate the hydrogen￾bonding interactions between the dockerin and its cohesin
partner in this second binding mode.
Although the sequences of C. cellulolyticum type I cohesins
and dockerins are very similar to the corresponding C. thermo￾cellum modules, there is no cross-specificity between the pro￾teins derived from the two organisms (8, 13, 16). Significantly
the Ser-Thr dyad in the C. thermocellum dockerins is replaced
with hydrophobic residues in the corresponding C. cellulolyti￾cum protein modules. Mutagenesis studies have shown that
replacing the Ser-Thr dyad with hydrophobic residues in the C.
thermocellum dockerin, and similarly substituting the Ala-Leu
and Ala-Phe motifs with hydroxyl amino acids in the C. cellu￾lolyticum dockerin, extends ligand specificity (16). Thus the
mutant C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum dockerins gain
the capacity to recognize the C. thermocellum and C. cellulo￾lyticum cohesins, respectively, while retaining a diminished
affinity for their original protein target (16).
Currently it is unclear whether the dual binding mode dis￾played by the C. thermocellum type I dockerins is a generic
feature of cellulosome assembly, whereas the mechanistic basis
for the organism-based specificity displayed by cohesin-dock￾erin partners remains essentially unknown. Here we report the
crystal structure of the C. cellulolyticum dockerin-cohesin
complex. The data show that the dockerin displays dyad sym￾metry and is able to interact with its cognate cohesin through a
dual binding mode. Cohesin-dockerin recognition is domi￾nated by hydrophobic interactions, which are centered around
a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the cohesin, formed by
Leu-87 and Leu-89, which is occupied in the two binding modes
by the dockerin residues Phe-19 and Leu-50, respectively.
Intriguingly, organism specificity is dictated primarily by apolar
interactions between only two residues, Leu-17 in the dockerin
and the cohesin amino acid Ala-129.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cloning and Expression—DNA encoding the dockerin mod￾ule of the GH5 C. cellulolyticum cellulase CcCel5A (residues
410– 473; note that the proline at position 473 in the published
sequence is a glutamate) from C. cellulolyticum was amplified
by PCR from pJFAc (18), and the resulting product was ligated
into NdeI/XhoI-digested pET22b (Novagen), to generate
pHF1. The dockerin gene under the control of the pET22b T7
promoter and terminator was amplified by PCR from pHF1
using the forward primer T7f (5-CACGATGCGTCCGGCG￾TAGAGGAT-3) and the reverse primer T7br (5-GGGGGG￾AGATCTATCCGGATATAGTTCCTCCTTTCA-3) that
incorporated 5 and 3 BglII sites. To express C. cellulolyticum
dockerin and cohesin genes in the same plasmid, the resulting
PCR product was digested with BglII and subcloned into the
BglII site of plasmid pET-coh1B, which encodes the first cohe￾sin module (residues 277– 439) of C. cellulolyticum scaffoldin
CipC (19). The resulting recombinant plasmid, termed pHF2,
contained both genes organized in tandem and was sequenced
to ensure that no mutations had occurred during PCR. In the
wild type cohesin-dockerin complex, derived from the co-ex￾pression of the cohesin and dockerin genes from pHF2, only the
cohesin contained a C-terminal His6 tag. The construction of
the plasmid encoding the mutated dockerins of Cel5A and the
first cohesin from CipC was performed by the overlap-exten￾sion PCR method. The regions encoding the N-terminal and
C-terminal parts of the dockerin were amplified by PCR from
pHF2 using mutagenic primer pairs. The resulting overlapping
fragments were mixed, and a combined fragment was synthe￾sized using the external primers. The fragment was subse￾quently cloned into BglII linearized pHF2, thereby generating
pHF3. Positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing. To
study cohesin-dockerin binding, the dockerin was also
expressed independent of its cohesin partner but fused to thi￾oredoxin, encoded by pET32a, to ensure higher levels of protein
expression. DNA encoding the dockerin of the cellulase Cel5A
(residues 410– 475) was amplified by PCR from pHF2 and
cloned into EcoRI- and XhoI-restricted pET32a to generate
pHF5.
Protein Expression and Purification—The pET22b deriva￾tives encoding the cohesin-dockerin complexes and discrete
cohesins and the pET32a plasmids encoding C. cellulolyticum
dockerins were transformed into Escherichia coli strains BL21
(DE3) and Origami, respectively. To express the clostridial pro￾teins, recombinant E. coli strains harboring the appropriate
recombinant plasmids were cultured in LB containing 100
g/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase (A550 0.6).
Isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final
concentration of 1 mM, and the cultures were incubated for a
further 16 h at 19 °C. The cohesin-dockerin A16S-L17T and
cohesin-dockerin A47S-F48T complexes were purified by met￾al-ion affinity chromatography, buffer exchanged into 20 mM
Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mM CaCl2, and then further
purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Source
30Q column and a gradient elution of 0–1 M NaCl (Amersham
Biosciences) to separate the complexes from unbound cohesin.
Fractions containing the protein complexes were buffer
exchanged and then concentrated in 2 mM CaCl2 to a final con￾centration of 20 and 10 g/liter for the A16S-L17T and A47S￾F48T complexes, respectively. Discrete His-tagged cohesins

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration cal￾orimetry (ITC)5 was deployed to measure the affinity of native
and mutant forms of the C. cellulolyticum cohesin for its dock￾erin partner essentially as described previously (14). Briefly the
wild type and mutant forms of the dockerin (7–119 M), fused
to thioredoxin, were stirred at 300 rpm in the reaction cell,
which was injected with 25  10 or 48  5-l aliquots of a
70–1715 M solution of cohesin at 300-s intervals. The buffer
consists of 50 mM NaHepes, pH 7.5, containing 2 mM CaCl2,
and titrations were carried out at 308 K unless otherwise stated.
Integrated heat effects, after correction for heats of dilution,
were analyzed by nonlinear regressing using a single site model
(Microcal ORIGIN version 7.0, Microcal Software, Northamp￾ton, MA). The fitted data yield the association constant (KA)
and the change in enthalpy associated with binding (H). Other
thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the standard
equation RTlnKA  G  H  TS. The c values (product
of the molar concentration of binding sites  KA) were 2.6.
Crystallization of the C. cellulolyticum Cohesin-Dockerin
Complexes and Structure Resolution—Crystals of the cohesin￾dockerin A16S-L17T complex grew over a period of 10–12
days, in 0.2 M potassium sulfate and 20% w/v polyethylene gly￾col 3350, and were cryoprotected with 20% (v/v) of glycerol.
Crystals of the cohesin-dockerin A47S-F48T complex grew
over a period of 4–5 days, in 0.2 M lithium sulfate and 25% w/v
polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000, and were cryopro￾tected with 20% (v/v) of glycerol. The crystals were harvested in
rayon fiber loops and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Data were collected, for both constructs, using single crystals
at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on station
ID14-2 at 100 K using an ADSC Q4 charged-coupled device
detector and at a wavelength of 0.9330 Å. All diffraction data
were indexed and integrated in MOSFLM (CCP4) or DENZO/
SCALEPACK (20). All other computing was carried out using
the CCP4 suite unless otherwise stated. Crystals of the A16S￾L17T complex belong to the space group P212121 with cell
dimensions a  39.3 Å, b  60.5 Å, and c  100.7 Å and one
complex in the asymmetric unit. In contrast, crystals of the
cohesin-dockerin A47S-F48T complex belong to the space
group P3221 with approximate cell dimensions of a  b  76.42
Å and c  111.09 Å and two independent complexes in the
asymmetric unit. Both cohesin-dockerin complex structures
were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (21) with
the search model being the structure of the previously reported
apo-form of the type I C. cellulolyticum cohesin module (PDB
accession code 1g1k (22)). Initial building of the dockerin sub￾units into the electron density was performed using ARP/wARP
(23), and the remaining residues were built by hand using
COOT (24). Refinement was carried out with REFMAC (25)
with 5% of the data set aside for cross-validation purposes. A
summary of the refinement statistics is shown in Table 1. Coor￾dinates and observed structure factor amplitudes have been
deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB codes 2vn5 and 2vn6).
Figures were drawn in MOLSCRIPT (26) and BOBSCRIPT
(27).
RESULTS
Thermodynamics and Stoichiometry of Cohesin-Dockerin
Recognition—The binding of a CipC-derived C. cellulolyticum
type I cohesin to its dockerin partner was assessed by ITC. The
data show that at 308 K the KA is 6.50  108 M1 with a H of
19.3 kcal mol1 and a TS of 6.84 kcal mol1 (Table 2).
There was a negative direct relationship between temperature
and both H and S, although G was not sensitive to changes
in the experimental temperature (Fig. 1). At 284 and 299 K,
respectively, H and S were 0. The heat capacity (Cp) of
cohesin-dockerin binding was 822 cal1 mol1K1
. The ITC
data also showed that the stoichiometry of ligand binding was
1, the significance of which is discussed below.
Protein Expression and Crystallization Strategy—To deter￾mine the crystal structure of the C. cellulolyticum cohesin￾dockerin complex, the two proteins were co-expressed in
E. coli. Initial attempts to crystallize the purified C. cellulolyti￾cum dockerin-cohesin complex were unsuccessful. As with past
work on C. thermocellum, we postulated that the failure to crys￾tallize the complex likely reflected the dynamic interaction of
the two potential ligand-binding sites in the dockerin with the
cohesin. It has been suggested that the C. cellulolyticum dock￾erin has two ligand-binding sites in which residues dAla-16 and
dLeu-17 at site 1 and dAla-47 and dPhe-48 in site 2 (C. cellulo￾lyticum dockerin residues henceforth are prefaced with d and
cohesin residues with c) play a key role in cohesin recognition
(8, 13, 16). To encourage a single binding mode between the

C. cellulolyticum Cohesin-Dockerin Complex
18424 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 283•NUMBER 26•JUNE 27, 2008

the functions of site 1 and site 2 were disrupted through the
introduction of the mutations A16S/L17T and A47S/F48T,
respectively. Diffracting crystals of the cohesin in complex with
either mutant of the dockerin mutants were then obtained.
Structure of the Type I Cohesin-Dockerin C. cellulolyticum
Complex—The structure of the cohesin-dockerin A16S/L17T
(Coh-DocA16S/L17T) and the cohesin-dockerin A47S/F48T
(Coh-DocA47S/F48T) complexes were solved to 1.49- and
1.9-Å resolution, respectively, by molecular replacement using
the crystal structure of the apo-form of the C. cellulolyticum
type 1 cohesin (PDB code 1g1k (22)) as the search model. The
two complexes in the asymmetric unit overlay with an r.m.s.d.
of 0.18 Å (C- atoms) for the cohesin residues and 1.0 Å for the
dockerin amino acids.
The individual components of the two protein complexes are
extremely similar to each other (Fig. 2) with an r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å
for the C- atoms of the cohesins and 1.0 Å for the C- atoms of
the dockerins (treated independently). The structure of the
cohesin either unliganded or in complex with either dockerin
variant was essentially identical (r.m.s.d. 0.8 Å). Thus, similar
to the type I C. thermocellum cohesin, the corresponding C.
cellulolyticum protein does not undergo significant conforma￾tional changes upon binding to its dockerin ligands.
Structure of the C. cellulolyticum Type I Cohesin in Complex
with Its Cognate Dockerin—The type IC. cellulolyticum cohesin
in complex with its cognate dockerin has an elliptical structure
comprising a 4-residue -helix and 10 -strands, which forms 2
-sheets aligned in an elongated -sandwich and displays a
classical jelly roll fold (Fig. 2). The two sheets include
-strands 10, 1, 2, and 7 on one face (sheet A) and -strands
5, 6, 3, and 9 on the other face (sheet B). The two sheets are
connected by -strand 8 that makes hydrogen bonds with
both -strand 9 on sheet A and -strand 3 on sheet B. The
cohesin also displays striking similarity to type I C. thermo￾cellum cohesins (r.m.s.d. 0.8 Å).
Structure of the C. cellulolyticum Type I Dockerin—The dock￾erin, in both complexes, has an identical structure that consists
of two parallel helixes, comprising residues dAla-16 to dMet-27
and dAla-46 to dLeu-58, respectively, whereas the extended
loop connecting these structural elements contains a 3-residue
310 helix (Fig. 2). The overall structure of the C. cellulolyticum
dockerin is very similar to the C. thermocellum Xyn10B type 1
dockerin (r.m.s.d. 0.76 Å). The C. cellulolyticum dockerin, in
both complexes, contains two Ca2 ions coordinated by several
amino acid residues in canonical EF-hand loop motifs. The
coordination of the two calciums is identical to the metal ions

C. cellulolyticum Cohesin-Dockerin Complex

complex with its cognate cohesin (14).
The N- and C-terminal helices of the C. cellulolyticum type I
dockerin display significant sequence and structural conserva￾tion, with an r.m.s.d. for the internally repeated segments of 1.9
Å for the main chain atoms. This structural conservation
includes the two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs and, signifi￾cantly, results in a near-perfect 2-fold dyad symmetry within
the dockerin module. Thus, if helix-1 is rotated 180°, it can be
superimposed over helix-2 and vice versa. The functional sig￾nificance of this structural symmetry is described in detail
below.
C. cellulolyticum Type I Coh-DocA16S/L17T and Coh￾DocA47S/F48T Interfaces—The dockerin in both complexes
interacts mainly with one face (sheet B) of the cohesin barrel.
Superimposition of Coh-DocA16S/L17T with Coh-DocA47S/
F48T reveals that the structure of the cohesin (r.m.s.d. of 0.5
Å for 141 C- atoms) and dockerin (r.m.s.d. of 1.0Å for 57
C- atoms) modules are very similar in the two crystal struc￾tures. Indeed, the dockerin in Coh-DocA16S/L17T presents
the symmetry observed in Coh-DocA47S/F48T, with helices 1
and 2 rotated 180° and overlapping almost perfectly (Fig. 2). It is
recognized that the analysis of electron density maps of pro￾teins that display dyad symmetry can be difficult; however, the
following differences in residues that are in equivalent positions
in the two heterodimers enabled the orientation of the dockerin
mutants A16S/L17T and A47S/F48T, respectively, to be deter￾mined: dMet-60/dHis-31, dIle-52/dGly-21, dLeu-50/dPhe-19,
dAsn-43/Gly-12, dVal-39/dTyr-8, and dLeu-17/dPhe-48. The
crystal structure of the complexes is entirely consistent with
the view that helix-1 and helix-2 of the dockerin play equiv￾alent roles in the recognition of its protein partner in the two
heterodimers. Thus, in Coh-DocA16S/L17T helix-2 is the
major region of the dockerin that interacts with its cohesin
partner, whereas helix-1 dominates protomer recognition in
Coh-DocA47S/F48T.
In the two structures hydrophobic interactions play an
important role in complex assembly, consistent with the nega￾tive heat capacity of cohesin dockerin association. Thus, cTyr￾49, cLeu-87, cLeu-89, cIle-93, cAla-129, and cMet-135 interact
with the following residues in the dockerin mutants A16S/L17T
and A47S/F48T, respectively: dPhe-19/dLeu-50, dAla-29/
dVal-61, dLeu-58/dMet-27, dPhe-48/dLeu-17, dLeu-50/dPhe￾19, dAla-51/dAla-20, dLeu-58/dMet-27, and dMet-60 (no
equivalent apolar residue in the two dockerins), which are
located in both helix-1 and 2 of the two protein modules (Fig. 3).
However, dMet-27 in the A16S/L17T dockerin mutant and
dLeu-58 in the A47S/F48T mutant also make hydrophobic con￾tacts with a shallow pocket formed by the -carbons of cSer-76,
cSer-78, and cSer-85, and these interactions may also contrib￾ute to overall affinity. The heterodimer also associates through
four direct and numerous solvent-mediated polar interactions,
which are described in detail in Table 3. The direct hydrogen
bonds are between O-1 of cAsn-47 and N of dAla-16/dAla-47,
-O of cThr-45 and O of dAla-16/dAla-47, OH of cTyr-49 and
both O of dLeu-57/dIle-26 and dN-2 of His-31 (the side chain
of the equivalent residue in the dockerin mutant A16S/L17T,
dMet-60, is nonpolar), -O of cSer-75 and O of dLeu-58/
dMet-27 (Fig. 3). Although only the C-terminal region of dock￾erin helix-2 interacts with the cohesin, the whole length of
dockerin helix-1 contacts its protein partner in Coh-DocA47S/
F48T. Conversely, in Coh-DocA16S/L17T only the N-terminal
region of helix-1 contacts the cohesin, whereas all of helix-2
interacts with its protein partner.
Site-directed mutagenesis data (Table 2) show that alanine
substitution of the three hydrophobic cohesin residues cLeu￾87, cLeu-89, and cMet-135 results in a substantial decrease in
affinity (9–130-fold), whereas the cI93A mutation reduces the
KA 3-fold. Although the cN47A and cY49A mutations also
cause an 5-fold decrease in the KA, the amino acid substitu￾tions cT45A, cS76A, cS85A, cN91A, and cK137G had little
influence on the affinity of the cohesin for its C. cellulolyticum
dockerin partner. Thus, the only significant polar interactions
between the protomers in Coh-DocA16S/L17T are the hydro￾gen bonds between the side chain carbonyl of cAsn-47 and the
main chain amide of dAla-47 and between the phenolic

C. cellulolyticum Cohesin-Dockerin Complex

is therefore apparent that hydrophobic interactions play a dom￾inant role in the assembly of this complex.
The most significant hydrophobic interaction at the pro￾tomer interface is between the apolar pocket, formed by
cLeu-87 and cLeu-89, which is occupied by the aromatic side
chain of dLeu-50 in Coh-DocA16S/L17T and dPhe-19 in Coh￾DocA47S/F48T. Indeed, the affinity of the cL87A/cL89A cohe￾sin mutant for its cognate dockerin
is 104
-fold less than the wild type
protein. The reciprocal dockerin
mutations, dF19A/dL50A, also
caused a significant reduction in KA
(3000-fold), although this loss in
affinity was less dramatic than in the
corresponding cohesin mutant.
This is consistent with the observa￾tion that cLeu-87 and cLeu-89, in
addition to interacting with dPhe￾19/dLeu-50, also make van der
Waals contacts with dAla-20/
dAla-51 and dAla16/dAla-47. The
modest decrease in affinity dis￾played by the I93A mutant is rather
surprising as C-1 and C-1 make
hydrophobic contacts with dMet￾27/dLeu-58, whereas C-2 interacts
with dMet-60. The contribution of
cMet-135 to dockerin recognition is
through weak hydrophobic interac￾tions with the aliphatic side chains
of dLys-24/dLys-55, and strong van
der Waals contacts with the C- of
dAla20/dAla51. The methionine
may also contribute, indirectly, to
dockerin recognition by making
strong hydrophobic interactions with cLeu-89 and cIle-93 and
thus play a role in optimizing the position of these residues for
dockerin recognition. The hydrophobic interaction that
appears to play a central role in the specificity of the C. cellulo￾lyticum cohesin-dockerin interaction is between dLeu-17 and a
shallow hydrophobic pocket of which cAla-129 is the major
contributor (see below).
In addition to the direct polar interactions described above,
the protomers in both cohesin-dockerin heterodimers appear
to make numerous solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds.
Although the importance of these bridging water molecules in
the protein complex is unclear, the mutation of the cohesin
residues cSer-76, cSer-85, cAsn-91, and cLys-137, whose side
chains make water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the dock￾erin, had little influence on affinity (Table 2). These data sug￾gest that indirect polar interactions do not play a key role in
cohesin dockerin recognition. However, it is possible that
water-mediated hydrogen bonds between main chain polar
groups contribute to the formation of the heterodimer. Indeed,
in the C. thermocellum type I cohesin-dockerin complex, an
indirect hydrogen bond between ctAsp-39 (C. thermocellum
cohesin and dockerin residues are preceded with ct and dt,
respectively) and the main chain polar groups of four dockerin
residues contributes 4 kcal mol1 of binding energy (8).

C. cellulolyticum Cohesin-Dockerin Complex

180 eq C- atoms (of both cohesin and dockerin), whereas
comparison of the C. cellulolyticum Coh-DocA47A/F48T het￾erodimer with C. thermocellum Coh-DocS45A/T46A yields an
r.m.s.d of 1.2 Å for 183 equivalent C- atoms. The location of
the interface between the two protomers within the het￾erodimer is identical (Fig. 4), although there is little cross-spec￾ificity between the two complexes (8, 13, 16). Inspection of the
cohesin-dockerin interactions in the C. thermocellum and C.
cellulolyticum complexes provides insight into the molecular
basis for the distinct specificities displayed by these protein
pairs. Thus, the hydrophobic residues of the C. cellulolyticum
cohesin that interact with the dockerin are clustered toward the
C-terminal region of -strand 6, whereas in the C. thermocel￾lum protein the ligand binding apolar residues extend across
the full length of -strand 3 and also include amino acids in
-strands 5 and 6 (14, 15). There is, however, some conserva￾tion in these key aliphatic residues. Thus, the following pairs of
C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum cohesin residues occupy
equivalent positions in their respective complexes: cLeu-87/
ctLeu-83, cLeu89/ctAla-85, and cTyr-49/ctVal-41. Several C.
cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum hydrophobic dockerin res￾idues that interact with the cognate cohesin are also highly con￾served and include the following pairs: dMet-27/dtLeu-56,
dIle-26/dtLeu-55, dLeu-50/dtLeu14, dPhe-19/dtLeu-48, dLeu￾58/dtLeu-22, and d-Met-60/dtAla-24. It is therefore not sur￾prising that many of the hydrophobic interactions at the pro￾tomer interface are conserved in the two protein complexes.
For example, the key hydrophobic pocket in the C. cellulolyti￾cum cohesin, formed by cLeu-87 and cLeu-89, would be occu￾pied by the C. thermocellum dockerin amino acid dtLeu-14.
Conversely, the hydrophobic pocket in the C. thermocellum
cohesin, formed by ctAla-72, ctVal-81, and ctLeu-83, would be
occupied by the C. cellulolyticum dockerin residue dMet-27.
In contrast to the hydrophobic
interactions, there are significant
differences in the polar interactions
between the protomers in the C. cel￾lulolyticum and C. thermocellum
heterodimers. The only similar
polar cohesin residues that interact
with the cognate dockerins are
cAsn-47/ctAsp-39 and cAsp-87/
ctAsn-91, although mutagenesis
studies have shown that the D39N
mutation in a type I C. thermocel￾lum cohesin reduces affinity for the
C. thermocellum dockerin 1000-fold
indicating significant differences in
the role of similar residues in the
two complexes (8). It has been sug￾gested that the dramatic effect of the
D39N reflects the capacity of both
O-1 and O-2 to act as hydrogen
bond acceptors in polar interactions
with the dockerin. The lack of cross￾species recognition between the
protein partners may also reflect
steric clashes, particularly when the C-terminal helix of the
dockerin dominates cohesin binding; in this orientation
dPhe-48 of the C. cellulolyticum dockerin will clash with the C.
thermocellum cohesin residue ctAsn-127, whereas dtArg-53 of
the C. thermocellum dockerin will clash with the C. cellulolyti￾cum cohesin residue cIle-93.
The structure of the C. cellulolyticum complex provides
insight into the mechanism by which the T12L mutation in the
C. thermocellum dockerin leads to recognition of the C. cellu￾lolyticum cohesin and how the A16S/L17T/A47S/F48T C. cel￾lulolyticum dockerin mutant binds to the C. thermocellum
cohesin (16). Thus, the side chain of the leucine introduced into
the C. thermocellum dockerin makes several hydrophobic
interactions with the C. cellulolyticum cohesin, most notably
with the C- of cAla-129 but also with the C- of cThr-45
(equivalent to ctGly-123 and ctAsn-37, respectively, in the C.
thermocellum cohesin), while also making weak hydrophobic
contacts with the aliphatic region of the cLys-137 side chain
and the -carbon of Gly-131. In contrast, the introduction of
the corresponding Ser to Ala and Thr to Leu substitutions into
the C-terminal binding site of theC. thermocellum dockerin did
not confer specificity for the C. cellulolyticum cohesin. This
may reflect the energetic penalty imposed by the predicted
steric clashes discussed above. The capacity of the A16S/L17T/
A47S/F48T C. cellulolyticum dockerin mutant to bind the C.
thermocellum cohesin likely reflects the capacity of the intro￾duced polar residues to make hydrogen bonds with ctAsn-37,
ctAsp-39, and ctGlu-131. An intriguing feature of these
“change in specificity” mutations (or substituting these amino
acids with alanine) (Table 2) is that the engineered dockerins
retain significant affinity for their original cohesin partners.
This likely reflects the retention of the extensive hydrophobic
interactions between the engineered dockerins and their native
protein partners, exemplified by the functional importance of
FIGURE 4. Overlap of the C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum cohesin-dockerin complexes in both

C. cellulolyticum cohesin (see above).
DISCUSSION
Previous studies showed that the type I C. thermocellum
dockerin domains contain two near identical type I cohesin￾binding sites (14–16). The observation that the corresponding
C. cellulolyticum system displays a similar binding mode, even
though there is little cross-specificity between clostridial het￾erodimers, indicates that there is a strong evolutionary driver
for the retention of two identical cohesin-binding sites in the
dockerin domains. The reasons for the retention of two, appar￾ently equivalent, binding modes is unclear. It could be argued
that the two binding modes may enable the catalytic subunits to
bind to multiple cohesins leading to polycellulosome assembly,
as observed in C. thermocellum (28). The observed stoichiom￾etry of one, where measured, however, indicates that both
ligand-binding sites on the dockerin cannot be occupied simul￾taneously. Indeed, overlaying the two C. cellulolyticum com￾plexes shows that the cohesin -helix, extending from cAsn-70
to cAsn-74, will make steric clashes precluding the formation of
a trimolecular complex.
The high degree of sequence conservation in the two cohe￾sin- and calcium-binding sites of the C. cellulolyticum dock￾erins (13), leading to the retention of dyad symmetry, indicates
that the observed dual binding mode is a general feature of the
cellulosome of the bacterium. Indeed, the lack of sequence con￾servation in the regions linking the two helices/EF-hand motifs
again points to how retention of both cohesin-binding sites
represents a strong evolutionary driver. Furthermore, the
structures of the protein complex, in combination with
mutagenesis data, show a high degree of sequence conservation
of the dockerin recognition residues displayed by the cohesin
domains of C. cellulolyticum (8), indicating that there is little, if
any, specificity between specific cohesin-dockerin partners in
the cellulosome of the bacterium.
Thus, the biological significance of the dual binding mode
displayed by C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum dockerins is
an intriguing question. One possibility, which may merit fur￾ther exploration, is that dual binding confers flexibility in cel￾lulosome assembly (for review see Refs. 4 and 29). It could be
argued that steric constraints imposed by the appended cata￾lytic modules might restrict the combination of enzymes that
can be assembled into a cellulosome complex. The dual binding
mode displayed by dockerins could overcome these spatial lim￾itations and thus increase the range of enzymes that can be
integrated into discrete cellulosome molecules. There is a very
large number of possibilities for cellulosomal organization, and
the flexibility provided by dual binding may contribute to the
plasticity required for correct incorporation of different
enzyme combinations. Indeed the different binding modes dis￾played by the dockerins may allow optimal placement of the
enzymes on the complex substrate, which is more easily accom￾plished in the plant cell wall degrading apparatus of aerobic
microorganisms as the free enzymes of these organisms do not
physically associate (30).
It should be emphasized, however, that the linker sequences
that join the dockerin and catalytic modules may contribute
significant conformational flexibility to the cellulosome quater￾nary structure, questioning the proposed requirement for the
dual binding mode reported here for C. cellulolyticum dock￾erins. However, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experi￾ments have demonstrated that when Cel48F binds to its cog￾nate cohesin, the rigidity of the linker that connects the
catalytic module of the enzyme to its dockerin increases and the
cellulase becomes more compact (31). The SAXS data also
showed that the possible motions of the catalytic module of
Cel48F with respect to the cohesin/dockerin interface are
highly restricted, compared with the free enzyme. Thus, the
enzyme linker is not likely to generate the flexibility, which may
be required for plant cell wall degradation, once the enzyme is
bound within the cellulosome (31). It should also be acknowl￾edged that another source of flexibility may stem from the link￾ers that connect the cohesin modules in the scaffoldins. Similar
SAXS studies have indeed shown that the linker joining the two
cohesins of divergent species in the hybrid scaffoldin Scaf4
remains flexible, even when large enzymes (Cel48F) are
anchored to both cohesin modules (32). It is apparent, however,
that the 49 residue hybrid linker is longer than typical C. cellu￾lolyticum and C. thermocellum scaffoldin linkers, comprising
10 and 39 residues, respectively. Indeed short linkers is a
generic feature of mesophilic clostridial scaffoldins exemplified
by the corresponding proteins produced by Clostridium cellu￾lovorans and Clostridium josui (33, 34). It is unclear why nature
should select a dual binding mode between cohesins and dock￾erins, in at least some species. Indeed if, as we propose, it is to
confer conformational flexibility, it would seem facile for evo￾lution to impose a selection for longer linker sequences. It is
possible that extended flexible linkers may be more prone to
proteolytic attack than short inter-module sequences, and thus
evolution may have selected a dual binding mode to introduce
structural plasticity. In any event, the biological rationale for
the dual binding mode remains opaque, and there is clearly an
urgent need to investigate its biological significance.
This study, in conjunction with previous studies on the C.
thermocellum cellulosome (14, 15), shows that the flexibility in
cohesin recognition appears to be a general feature of the type I
dockerin modules that recruit the catalytic subunits into the
clostridial cellulosome. In nonclostridial cellulosomes there are
examples of sequence divergence in the duplicated regions of
dockerins exemplified by the Ruminoccocus flavefaciens sys￾tem, suggesting that the dual binding mode reported here may
not be a universal feature of cellulosomes. This study also pro￾vides a mechanistic understanding of how the C. cellulolyticum
cohesins recognize their cognate dockerins, and how subtle
changes to the structure at the interface leads to significant
changes in specificity, providing a template for engineering
novel specificities into these highly efficient nanomachines.
