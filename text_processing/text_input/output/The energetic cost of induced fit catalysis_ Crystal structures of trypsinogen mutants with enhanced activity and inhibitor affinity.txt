Abstract
The contribution of induced fit to enzyme specificity has been much debated,although with little experi￾mental data. Here we probe the effect of induced fit on enzyme specificity using the trypsin(ogen) system.
BPTI is known to induce trypsinogen to assume a trypsinlike conformation. Correlations are observed
between BPTI affinity and the values of kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of two substrates by eight trypsin(ogen)
variants. The slope of both correlations is −1.8. The crystal structures of the BPTI complexes of four variant
trypsinogens were also solved. Three of these enzymes,K15A, I16V17/D194N,and I16V17/Q156K
trypsinogen,are 10- to 100-fold more active than trypsinogen. The fourth variant, I16V17 trypsinogen,is
the lone outlier in the correlations; its activity is lower than expected based on its affinity for BPTI. The S1
site and oxyanion hole,formed by segments 184A–194 and 216–223,are trypsinlike in all of the enzymes.
These structural and kinetic data confirm that BPTI induces an active conformation in the trypsin(ogen)
variants. Thus,changes in BPTI affinity monitor changes in the energetic cost of inducing a trypsinlike
conformation. Although the S1 site and oxyanion hole are similar in all four variants,the N-terminal and
autolysis loop (residues 142–152) segments have different interactions for each variant. These results
indicate that zymogen activity is controled by a simple conformational equilibrium between active and
inactive conformations,and that the autolysis loop and N-terminal segments control this equilibrium.
Together,these data illustrate that induced fit does not generally contribute to enzyme specificity.

induced fit
Koshland (1958) first proposed that induced fit provides a
mechanism for substrate discrimination,namely,that a good
substrate can induce an enzyme to adopt an active confor￾mation,whereas a poor substrate cannot facilitate this con￾formational change. This idea has been much debated and
refined over the years,albeit with a remarkable absence of
experimental data. Specificity is determined by the ratio of
the values of kcat/Km for good and poor substrates. Fersht
(1974,1985) has argued that induced fit does not provide
specificity in the simple case in which chemistry is rate
limiting in the enzymatic reaction. As shown in Figure 1A,
the values of kcat/Km for both a good substrate and a poor
substrate will be reduced by the factor 1/Kc*,where Kc* is

Fersht 1974,1985). Thus,an induced fit enzyme is no more
specific than its rigid counterpart. However,induced fit can
provide specificity in other cases: (1) The conformational
change encloses the substrate within the enzyme,thus pro￾viding binding interactions with a good substrate that would
not be available with a poor substrate (Wolfenden 1974);
and (2) chemistry is rate limiting for the poor substrate,
whereas substrate binding or product release limits the re￾action of the good substrate (Herschlag 1988). In addition,
Post and Ray (1995) noted that induced fit can decrease
specificity if the two substrates induce different active con￾formations.
The trypsin/trypsinogen system presents an opportunity
to experimentally test these ideas. The active site of trypsin
has a relatively rigid structure that does not appear to un￾dergo a significant conformational change during catalysis.
The trypsin active site is an exact complement to the in￾hibitory loop of BPTI (Huber and Bode 1978). However,
although 85% of the trypsinogen structure is identical to
trypsin,the active site is disordered,rendering the zymogen
inactive (Fig. 2; Fehlhammer et al. 1977; Kossiakoff et al.
1977). The active site of trypsinogen assumes an ordered
trypsinlike structure when BPTI binds,although the struc￾ture displays higher B factors than the trypsin-BPTI com￾plex and still contains some disordered sections in the case
of the rat trypsinogen-BPTI complex (Huber and Bode
1978; Pasternak et al. 1999). Nevertheless,the energetic
cost of ordering the active site of trypsinogen can be esti￾mated by comparing the BPTI affinities of trypsinogen and
trypsin. Because the interface between BPTI and trypsin is
very similar to the interface between BPTI and trypsinogen,
the total binding energy of BPTI must also be similar.
Therefore,the difference in BPTI affinity of trypsin and
trypsinogen must correspond to the energy required to
change the conformation of trypsinogen and can be used to
determine Kc (Fig. 1B; Bode and Huber 1976). If the
conformation induced by BPTI is similar to the conforma￾tion required for substrate hydrolysis (i.e.,E is similar to
E*),then Kc should approximate Kc* (Fig. 1B). The tryp￾sinogen/trypsin system,therefore,permits experimental
tests of the relationship between induced fit and specifi￾city. Mutations can be introduced which perturb Kc*,
both by destabilizing the active conformation of trypsin
and by stabilizing the active conformation of trypsinogen.
BPTI affinity provides a measure of Kc,and hence Kc*. If
E and E* are similar,then the values of kcat/Km for sub￾strate hydrolysis should correlate with the values of Ki
for BPTI inhibition. If the scheme in Figure 1A is correct,

The disordered region of trypsinogen is termed the acti￾vation domain and is comprised of four segments: the N
terminus to Gly19,7 Gly142 to Pro152 (the autolysis loop),
Gly184A to Gly193,and Gly216 to Asn223 (Fig. 2). These
latter two segments form the S1 binding site and oxyanion
hole,whereas the autolysis loop forms part of the S2 site
(nomenclature of Schechter and Berger 1967). Trypsinogen
is converted to trypsin by proteolytic cleavage of a peptide
from its N terminus. The amino group of the new N-termi￾nal Ile16 binds in a pocket,forming a salt bridge with the
carboxylate of Asp194 (Fig. 3). These interactions stabilize
the segments that form the S1 binding site and the oxyanion
hole of the trypsin active site,as well as part of the S2 site.
Not surprisingly,destabilization of this structure by the sub￾stitution of Ile16 with smaller residues or by the substitution
of Asp194 with Asn impairs the protease activity of trypsin
(Hedstrom et al. 1996). However,the Asp194Asn mutation
increases the activity of trypsinogen constructs (Pasternak et
al. 1998). K15A trypsinogen (Pasternak et al. 1998) and
I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen (reported herein) also appear
to be more active than trypsinogen.8
We have previously reported that a correlation is ob￾served between BPTI affinity and kcat/Km for these tryp￾sin(ogen) variants (Pasternak et al. 1998). However,one
outlier was identified, I16V17 trypsinogen,where the
value of kcat/Km is lower than would be predicted from the
value of Ki (Pasternak et al. 1998). Interestingly,the rate of
BPTI binding to I16V17 trypsinogen is much slower than
that to the other variants. This observation suggests that the
interconversion of I16V17 trypsinogen conformations is
slow. A kinetic barrier may prevent the formation of E*
during catalysis but would not prohibit the formation of the
BPTI complex. Alternatively,the enzyme-BPTI interface
may be different for I16V17 trypsinogen.
Here we report the crystal structures of the BPTI com￾plexes of three trypsinogen variants possessing increased
activity (I16V17/D194N trypsinogen, I16V17/Q156K
trypsinogen,and K15A trypsinogen),as well as the outlier
I16V17 trypsinogen. These structures confirm that BPTI
induces a trypsinlike active site conformation in all of the
trypsin(ogen) mutants,including I16V17 trypsinogen.
These results validate the use of BPTI affinity to deter￾mine the value of Kc,as well as provide valuable insight
into the structural elements that control zymogen activity
in the trypsin family of serine proteases. In addition,we
extend the correlation of Kc and kcat/Km to a second

Unfortunately,rat anionic trypsinogen rapidly autoactivates. Since tryp￾sin is approximately 107
-fold more active than trypsinogen,a minute
amount of trypsin contamination will dominate an activity measurement,so
that it is impossible to determine the activity of trypsinogen directly. There￾fore we estimate the activity of trypsinogen based on the activity of I16G,
I16 and I16V17 trypsinogens (Hedstrom et al. 1996).

trypsinogen has not been solved. Nevertheless,several lines of experimen￾tation suggest that the activation domain of rat trypsinogen is disordered as
observed in bovine trypsinogen (Pasternak et al. 1999). The four segments
of the activation domain that are disordered in bovine trypsinogen (and
presumably in rat trypsinogen) are shown in dark gray.

chain of Ile16 interacts with Ile138,Gln156,Leu158,and Ser190. The
carboxylate of Asp194 also forms hydrogen bonds to the amide nitrogens
of Gly142 and Cys191.

Results
Substitution of Lys at position 156 increases
the activity of I16V17 trypsinogen
The zymogen of t-PA is active because of the formation of
a salt bridge between Asp194 and a Lys at position 156
(Renatus et al. 1997). This alternative salt bridge is also
observed in the crystal structure of bovine trypsinogen and
PSTI (Bolognesi et al. 1982). Interestingly,rat trypsinogen
contains a Gln at position 156 and appears to be less active
than bovine trypsinogen (Pasternak et al. 1999). These ob￾servations suggested that Gln156Lys mutation might in￾crease the activity of trypsinogen. To avoid complications
associated with autoactivation of rat trypsinogen,the
Gln156Lys mutation was constructed in the I16V17 tryp￾sinogen framework (Hedstrom et al. 1996; Pasternak et al.
1998). The activity of I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen is in￾creased 10-fold relative to I16V17 trypsinogen as mea￾sured by kcat/Km (Table 1). This increase in activity was
accompanied by a corresponding increase in BPTI affinity
(Table 1).
Correlations of the values of kcat /Km for
substrate hydrolysis with Ki for BPTI
We have previously reported a linear correlation of the val￾ues of kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC
and Ki of BPTI for nine trypsin(ogen) variants,including
wild-type and I16V trypsin. This correlation has a slope of
−1.56 with r  0.98. However,the induced fit treatment
requires that Kc* is <1 (see Introduction). The value of Kc*
is 100 for wild-type and I16V trypsins (Hedstrom et al.
1996). Therefore,these variants have been removed from
the correlations of Figure 4,as has the previously identified
outlier I16V17 trypsinogen.
Trypsin prefers P1 residue Arg over Lys by a factor of ∼7
in amide hydrolysis (Hedstrom et al. 1996). This specificity
is maintained in the variants (Fig. 4). Parallel linear corre￾lations are observed for the values of kcat/Km versus Ki of
BPTI for the hydrolysis of both Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC and
Tos-Gly-Pro-Lys-AMC,with slopes of −1.78 (r  0.977)
and −1.79 (r  0.995),respectively.

1334 Protein Science, vol. 10       Structures of the BPTI complexes of mutant trypsinogens
We have solved the X-ray crystal structures of the BPTI
complexes of K15A trypsinogen, I16V17/D194N tryp￾sinogen, I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen,and I16V17 tryp￾sinogen to confirm that a trypsinlike active site conforma￾tion is formed and to gain further insight into the structural
basis of zymogen activity. All of the structures were solved
to a resolution of at least 1.7 Å. Table 2 summarizes the
crystallographic statistics. These structures were compared
with the BPTI complexes of trypsin and S195A trypsinogen
solved previously (see below; Pasternak et al. 1999). The
general features of all the structures are identical,that is,the
two  barrel domains of trypsin(ogen),BPTI,and most of
the enzyme/BPTI interface,as expected given the similarity
of the BPTI complexes of trypsin and S195A trypsinogen.
The N terminus is disordered before residue 14 in all cases.
In particular,the S1 sites and oxyanion holes have the same
conformation as trypsin (Fig. 5). The autolysis loop is more
ordered and/or trypsinlike in these mutants than in S195A
trypsinogen. However,each mutant uses the autolysis loop
(residues 142–153) and N-terminal segments differently to
support the S1 site and oxyanion hole. The differences in
autolysis loop structure change the S2 interactions in some
cases. To put these structures into context,we will first
review the structures of the BPTI complexes of rat trypsin
and S195A trypsinogen.
Structures of rat trypsin and S195A trypsinogen
The structure and kinetic properties of anionic rat trypsin
are very similar to those of cationic bovine trypsin,with the
exception of BPTI affinity. The value of Kd for bovine
trypsin is 10−13 M versus 4 × 10−10 M for rat trypsin (Vin￾cent and Lazdunski 1972; Hedstrom et al. 1996). Neverthe￾less,BPTI can induce a trypsinlike conformation in rat tryp￾sinogen as observed in bovine trypsinogen. Overall,the rat
trypsin and S195A trypsinogen BPTI complexes are very
similar (Pasternak et al. 1999). However,striking differ￾ences are observed in the N terminus (residues 15–19; the
residues before Lys15 are disordered) and the autolysis loop
(residues 142–153). Ile16 occupies a very similar position
in both rat trypsin and S195A trypsinogen (unlike bovine
trypsinogen; Huber and Bode 1978). However,in S195A
trypsinogen,the remainder of the N terminus prevents for￾mation of the Ile16-Asp194 salt bridge. Instead,the amide
nitrogen of Ile16 is interacts with Asp194 via a water-me￾Table 2. Crystallographic statistics for BPTI complexes of rat trypsin and trypsinogen mutants

formed as observed in trypsin. However,the side chain of
Lys15 pushes Gly142 and Asn143 away from their posi￾tions in trypsin and disrupts the hydrogen bond between the
Asp194 carboxylate and the amide nitrogen of Gly142. In
addition,Pro152 and Asp153 are moved to new positions.
Thus,although the remainder of the autolysis loop is dis￾ordered,it clearly can not be in a trypsinlike orientation.
The changes in the autolysis loop create a new interface at
the S2 site. Two hydrogen bonds are formed between BPTI
and trypsin at this subsite: the amide nitrogen of Arg17I and
the carbonyl oxygen of Phe41 and NE of Arg17I and OE2
of Glu151. The formation of the Arg17I-Glu151 salt bridge
requires an adjustment of the Arg17I side chain of BPTI;
this salt bridge is solvent exposed and has high B factors
(Perona et al. 1993). The interaction between Arg17I and
Glu151 is lost in S195A trypsinogen and is replaced with a
hydrogen bond between NH1 of Arg17I and the carbonyl
oxygen of His40.
K15A trypsinogen
The substitution of Ala for Lys15 increases the activity of
trypsinogen by ∼100-fold relative to I16G trypsinogen (a
model for wild-type trypsinogen; Table 1; Pasternak et al.
1998). The crystal structure shows that removal of the
Lys15 side chain permits the autolysis loop to assume a
more trypsinlike conformation (Fig. 6). The hydrogen bond
between the amide nitrogen of Gly142 and the carboxyl
group of Asp194 is restored,holding Asp194 in the active
conformation. These interactions are expected to stabilize
the active trypsinlike conformation. The remainder of the
autolysis loop is disordered to Asp153. No interactions are
observed between the enzyme and the side chain of P2
residue Arg17I.
I16V17/D194N trypsinogen
I16V17/D194N trypsinogen is ∼100-fold more active than
I16G trypsinogen and I16V17 trypsinogen (Table 1; Pas￾ternak et al. 1998). The crystal structure shows that a hy￾drogen bond forms between the OD1 oxygen of Asn194 and
the amide nitrogen of Cys191 as observed with Asp194 in
Fig. 5. Active site structure of trypsin and mutant trypsin(ogens). The S1
site and oxyanion hole residues are shown. Lys15,the P1 residue of BPTI,
is shown in black. The following color scheme is used: wild-type,purple;

 carbon of Lys15,whereas electron density is not observed for Ala15 in
K15A trypsinogen. The autolysis loop is disordered in both structures,with
electron density observed only for Trp141-Gly142 and Asp153. Neverthe￾less,it is clear that the autolysis loop has different conformations in the two
structures as seen by the position of Gly142. The side chain of Lys15

1336 Protein Science, vol. 10trypsin. A hydrogen bond also forms between the ND2 am￾ide of Asn194 and the carbonyl oxygen of Trp141 (Fig. 7).
To accommodate this new hydrogen bond,the  angle of
Trp141 is rotated nearly 180° relative to its position in
trypsin. This movement displaces residues 139–141 slightly
outward from the Ile16 pocket,forcing the autolysis loop
into a new conformation. The autolysis loop is more ordered
than in S195A or I16V17 trypsinogen; residues 142,143,
and 149–153 are visible. The S2 site resembles that of
S195A trypsinogen: A hydrogen bond is observed between
NH1 of Arg17I and the carbonyl oxygen of His40. On the
other side of the Ile16 pocket,residues 18–26 move an
average of 0.5 Å inward. The Ile16 pocket contains five
water molecules. Water 561 makes a hydrogen bond to the
side chain amide of Asn194. A cluster of three weakly
bound water molecules (waters 641,642,and 676) occupy
the place where the main chain of Ile16 resides in wild-type
trypsin.
I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen
As described above,the Gln156Lys mutation was designed
to provide an alternate cation for Asp194. However,the
Lys156-Asp194 salt bridge is not observed in the crystal
structure of I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen. Instead,the
-amino group of Lys15 moves into the Ile16 pocket and
forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate of Asp194. A water
molecule also forms a hydrogen bond with the -amino
group of Lys15. These interactions are made possible by the
deletion of Ile16Val17 and are also observed in the
I16V17 trypsinogen-BPTI complex (see below). The
Gln156Lys mutation appears to stabilize the autolysis loop
via a hydrogen bond between the -amino group of Lys156
and the hydroxyl group of Thr21 (Fig. 8). A water-mediated
hydrogen-bonding network forms between Asn143 and the
carbonyl oxygen of Leu154. These interactions lock
Gly142,Pro152,and Asp153 into trypsinlike conformations
and order residues Asn143 and Glu 151. Thus,the autolysis
loop appears more ordered and trypsinlike in I16V17/
Q156K trypsinogen than in S195A trypsinogen. In addition,
a water-mediated salt bridge forms between the -amino
group and the carboxylate of Asp153. This salt bridge does
not appear to be required for stabilizing the autolysis loop
because Asp153 is also found in alternate conformation that
cannot form this salt bridge. The S2 site resembles that of
S195A trypsinogen,with a hydrogen bond between NH1 of
Arg17I and the carbonyl oxygen of His40.
I16V17 trypsinogen
In the BPTI complex,the autolysis loop of I16V17 tryp￾sinogen also assumes a more trypsinlike conformation than
S195A trypsinogen (Fig. 9). This conformation is stabilized
by the formation of a salt bridge between the -amino group
of Lys15 and Asp194 as observed in I16V17/Q156K
trypsinogen. The autolysis loop has a conformation very
similar to that of trypsin and is one residue more ordered
(Asn143) than S195A trypsinogen. Gly142 and Asn143
move inward to conform to the Lys15 side chain,whereas
residues 152–156 shift away from the Ile16 pocket. The S2
site resembles that of S195A trypsinogen,with a hydrogen

between the carbonyl oxygen of Trp141 and the ND2 nitrogen of Asn194
is shown by the dotted lines.

Å; Lys156-water 633,3.0 Å; and water 633-Asp153,2.6Å. As in I16V17
trypsinogen,Lys15 forms a salt bridge with Asp194 and can be seen
overlaying Ile16 of S195A trypsinogen. The autolysis loop of I16V17/
Q156K trypsinogen assumes a trypsinlike conformation and is more or￾dered than in S195A trypsinogen,with electron density visible for Trp141-
Gly142-Asn143 and Pro152-Asp153. Asp153 has two conformations (only
one is shown for clarity) in the I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen structure.
Although only the  carbon of Lys15 is visible in S195A trypsinogen,it is
clear that the side chain of Lys15 would clash with Asn153 in the tryp￾sinlike conformation of I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen.

Discussion
BPTI affinity calibrates the energetic cost of
ordering the active site
As expected,BPTI induces a trypsinlike active site confor￾mation in all of the mutant trypsinogens,ordering the S1 site
and oxyanion hole. Although the S2 site interactions are
variable,they seem unlikely to contribute a significant
amount of binding energy because the P2 residue Arg17I is
solvent accessible and very mobile in all of the complexes.
Therefore,we believe that BPTI affinity provides a quanti￾tative measure of the energetic cost of organizing the active
sites. However,as observed in the structures of the BPTI
complexes of bovine trypsinogen and S195A rat trypsino￾gen (Huber and Bode 1978; Pasternak et al. 1999),the B
factors of the active site residues appear to be significantly
higher than for the trypsin-BPTI complex (Table 3). The
active sites of the zymogen complexes attain the general
architecture of the trypsin but lack the rigidity of the mature
enzyme (although this conclusion can not be rigorous given
the different resolutions of the structures). If this additional
rigidity is important for activity,then BPTI affinity will
underestimate the cost of organizing the active site for ca￾talysis.
BPTI complexes recapitulate 55% of the active complex
A correlation is observed between Ki for BPTI inhibition
and kcat/Km for substrate hydrolysis for a series of trypsin(o￾gen) variants. This correlation indicates that the binding
energy of BPTI is related to the binding energy of the sub￾strate in the transition state,and suggests that E is similar
to E* (Fig. 1B). However,the slopes of these correlations
are −1.8,not −1 as expected if BPTI induced a perfect
trypsinlike conformation. Simply,this slope suggests that
55% of the structural requirements of E • S‡ are manifest in
the BPTI complexes. The remaining 45% represents struc￾tural features that are not required for BPTI binding. Ca￾talysis may require more precise organization of the active
site,as discussed above. A more rigid active site and au￾tolysis loop may be required to shield the active site from
solvent. Alternatively,catalysis may require a slightly dif￾ferent conformation than the one induced by BPTI,or dy￾namic motions that might not be relevant to BPTI binding.
As with any correlation of this nature,more examples are
more convincing and such work is underway.

Ile16 pocket of trypsin (white bonds) and I16V17 trypsinogen (dark

Water molecule 560 resides in this cavity. Although the N terminus is not
shown beyond residue 15 for Ile16Val17 trypsinogen-BPTI,electron den￾sity is observed for residue 14.

1338 Protein Science, vol. 10Contribution of induced fit to specificity
Fersht’s (1974,1985) treatment indicates that induced fit
should not change the specificity in the case in which the
chemical transformation is rate limiting. Serine proteases
operate via a three-step mechanism consisting of substrate
binding,acylation of the active site serine,and deacylation
(Fig. 10). Acylation is most likely rate limiting for the
hydrolysis of both Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC and Tos-Gly￾Pro-Lys-AMC by the trypsin(ogen) variants (with the ex￾ception of wild type and I16V,in which deacylation is
limiting; Hedstrom,et al. 1996). Parallel lines (slope 
−1.8) are obtained when the values of kcat/Km are plotted
against Ki (Fig. 4),which shows that induced fit does not
change specificity with respect to these two substrates.
However,both of these substrates are good substrates of
trypsin,with values of kcat/Km in the range of 106 to 107
M−1s
−1. It is possible that the discrimination between good
and poor substrates will be altered. Unfortunately,data for
poorer substrates is unavailable—the activity of the tryp￾sinogen variants can not be assayed with such substrates.
However,previous characterization of D194N,I16A,and
I16G trypsin variants shows that these mutations have
equivalent effects on good and poor substrates (Hedstrom et
al. 1996).
Value of Kc for wild-type trypsin
The data of Figure 4 can be used to estimate the value of Kc
for wild-type trypsin. The values of kcat/Km for wild-type
and I16V trypsin lie below the correlation,as expected
given that when Kc  1,the value of kcat/Km is reduced by
a factor of Kc/(1 + Kc). This relationship indicates that the
value of Kc; is 50 for wild-type trypsin,which agrees
well with the previous estimate of 100 (this estimate is
only a lower limit because acylation is not rate limiting for
wild-trypsin; Hedstrom et al. 1996).
Meaning of transition state analogy
A correlation between kcat/Km and Ki for a series of sub￾strate/inhibitor pairs has been used to show that an inhibitor
is a transition state analog (Bartlett and Marlowe 1983;
Hanson et al. 1989; Brady and Abeles 1990). This conclu￾sion has also been put forth when a correlation is observed
for a series of mutant enzymes and a single substrate/in￾hibitor pair (Phillips et al. 1992; Hedstrom et al. 1996; Kerr
and Hedstrom 1997). However,such conclusions unduly
emphasize the relationship between I and S‡
. This bias is
inconsequential if the enzyme has a rigid structure comple￾mentary to S‡
,as in the case of trypsin—the structure of the
enzyme does not change during the course of the reaction.
However,the transition state of an enzymatic reaction
clearly must include the enzyme. Therefore,in reality such
correlations imply that the structure of the E • I complex
recapitulates the structure of the E • S‡ complex. In the case
of an enzyme that undergoes conformational changes during
a reaction,a correlation will be observed if the inhibitor
induces the enzyme conformation found in the transition
state. Such is the case for the correlation reported here:
BPTI induces the active conformation of the trypsin(ogen)
variants,so a correlation is observed between kcat/Km
and Ki
.
In addition,transition state analogy tends to be narrowly
defined based on the geometry and electrostatic properties
at the immediate site of chemical transformation,ignoring
longer range interactions. For example,peptide aldehydes
are readily accepted as transition state analogs of protease
reactions because they form tetrahedral adducts similar to
the structure of S‡
. Although BPTI does not contain such a
tetrahedral center,the P3-P1 residues of BPTI are con￾strained to the canonical conformation that is also an im￾portant feature of S‡
. Therefore,we believe that BPTI
should be considered a transition state analog.
Stability of an enzyme active site is an important
component of catalytic power
An enzyme active site presents an electrostatic surface
complementary to the charge distribution of S‡
. Warshel
(1998) and others have argued that the catalytic power of
enzymes originates in the preorganization of this electro￾static surface (Cannon and Benkovic 1998). In the uncata￾lyzed reaction,solvent interactions can also stabilize S‡
.
However,solvent dipoles must be oriented appropriately.
This organization of solvent molecules has an enormous
energetic cost. In contrast,the energetic cost of preorganiz￾ing the dipoles of the enzyme active site is paid by the
favorable energy of protein folding. Thus enzyme catalytic
power is “not stored in the enzyme-substrate interaction but
in the enzyme itself” (Warshel 1998). This view suggests
that catalytic efficiency should be directly related to the
folding energy of the enzyme active site. However,the sta￾bility of an enzyme active site is difficult to determine. The
active site is frequently less stable than the enzyme structure
as a whole (Tsou 1993) and can be further obscured if an
enzyme undergoes large conformational changes. However,
BPTI affinity calibrates the stability of the active site of
trypsin(ogen),and the correlation between BPTI affinity
and kcat/Km illustrates that catalytic power is stored in the
Fig. 10. The serine protease reaction (Bartlett and Marlowe 1983). folding energy of the enzyme active site.
Structures of active trypsinogen variants
www.proteinscience.org 1339    Conformational changes must be kinetically competent
to contribute to enzyme catalysis
I16V17 trypsinogen is the lone mutant to date in which the
correlation between BPTI affinity and activity does not
hold: Activity is less than predicted from BPTI affinity
(Pasternak et al. 1998). The structure of the BPTI complex
of I16V17 trypsinogen does not suggest a reason for this
discrepancy; the contacts between BPTI and enzyme are
similar to other mutant trypsinogens. The formation of the
I16V17 trypsinogen-BPTI complex is much slower than
other trypsinogen mutants (Pasternak et al. 1998),which
indicates that a kinetic barrier prevents equilibration of the
E and E; a similar kinetic barrier in the formation of E* • S
would impair activity.
Implications for the structural determinants of zymogen
activity and enzyme specificity in the trypsin family
Serine proteases and their zymogens possess varying de￾grees of activity depending on their particular physiological
functions. For example,rat trypsinogen is 108 times less
active than trypsin,whereas the zymogen form of t-PA has
activity comparable to the mature enzyme form (Boose et al.
1989; Pasternak et al. 1999). The correlation between BPTI
affinity and kcat/Km for the mutant trypsin(ogens) also in￾dicates that zymogen activity can generally be described as
a relatively simple problem of conformational equilibrium.
In all four structures reported here,the S1 site and oxyanion
hole assume a conformation similar to trypsin,and the re￾mainder of the activation domain is more ordered than in
S195A trypsinogen. However,the autolysis loops assume
different conformations depending on the variant,as do the
N-terminal segments. The plasticity of the autolysis loop
and N-terminal peptide appear to be key structural determi￾nants of zymogen activity. Manipulating these regions,ei￾ther by changing their structures or by providing interac￾tions with other cofactors,will regulate enzyme activity.
The redesign of the S1 site of trypsin has proven a dif￾ficult task (Hedstrom et al. 1992,1994). Trypsin can be
converted into an enzyme with chymotrypsinlike activity,
but this conversion requires substitutions that extend be￾yond the S1 site. The stability of the S1 site is clearly one
of the obstacles to redesign efforts. Therefore the autolysis
loop is also likely to be an important structural determinant
of protease specificity. The correlation of BPTI affinity with
kcat/Km indicates that BPTI variants can be used to screen
for proteases with new protease specificity.
Materials and methods
Materials
Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC and Tos-Gly-Pro-Lys-AMC were pur￾chased from Bachem Biosciences. SBTI-Sepharose was obtained
from Sigma Chemical Co. BPTI was obtained from Boehringer.
Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Technologies.
Construction of rat trypsinogen mutants
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange
method (Stratagene). Mutants were completely sequenced to en￾sure that only the desired mutations were introduced.
Expression and purification of trypsinogen
and trypsin mutants
Recombinant rat trypsinogen II was produced as an -factor fusion
protein in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system and pu￾rified as previously described (Hedstrom et al. 1992; Pasternak et
al. 1998). Trypsinogens were stored in 1 mM HCl. Trypsinogen
concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm
(e  34,800 M-1 cm-1).
Activity of trypsinogens
Substrate stock solutions were prepared in dimethylformamide.
The final concentration of dimethylformamide in the assays was
<2%. Assay mix contained 100 mM NaCl,10 mM CaCl2,and 50
mM Hepes,pH 8.0. Hydrolysis of the AMC substrates was moni￾tored fluorimetrically,with excitation wavelength at 380 nm and
emission wavelength at 460 nm. Assays were performed in 0.1 mL
of assay mix containing substrate at 25°C in a PerSeptive Biosys￾tems Cytofluor II multi-well plate reader. The values of kcat, Km,
and kcat/Km were determined with KinetAsyst software,and
the reported values are the average of at least two experiments.
Crystallization
The mutant trypsinogens were concentrated to 10 to 15 mg/mL in
1 mM HCl and mixed with 1.1 equivalents of BPTI. CaCl2 was
added to a final concentration of 10 mM. Crystals were obtained
via hanging drop vapor diffusion at room temperature. Drops con￾tained 5 L of the protein solution and 5 æL of the well solution.
A crystal of I16V17/D194N trypsinogen-BPTI was grown from
24% PEG 3350,0.2 M LiSO4,and 0.1 M Tris,pH 8.5. A crystal
of I16V17 trypsinogen-BPTI was grown from 35% PEG 4000,
0.2 M LiSO4,and 0.1 M Tris,pH 8.5. K15A trypsinogen-BPTI
complex was grown in 26% PEG 3350,0.2 M LiCl,0.1 M Tris,pH
8.0,at 4°C. I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen-BPTI was grown from
22% PEG 3380,0.3 M ammonium acetate,0.1 M sodium citrate,

Structure determination
Data on a single I16V17/D194N trypsinogen-BPTI crystal were
collected at 4°C with a scan width of 0.5° per frame and an ex￾posure time of 30 min per frame for 40° on an R-AXIS IIC image
plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-200B X-ray generator run￾ning at 45 kV and 120 mA. Data on a single I16V17 trypsinogen￾BPTI crystal were collected similarly for a total of 90°. Data on a
single crystal of K15A trypsinogen-BPTI complex were collected
at 4°C with a scan width of 0.5° per frame and an exposure time
of 20 min per frame for 75° on an R-AXIS IV image plate system
mounted on a Rigaku RU-300B,run at 40 kV and 30 mA. Data on

1340 Protein Science, vol. 10  a single crystal of I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen-BPTI complex
were collected at 4°C with a scan width of 1° per frame and an
exposure time of 15 min per frame for a total of 80° on a R-AXIS
IV image plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 X-ray gen￾erator running at 38 kV and 28 mA and 1.5418 Å wavelength. For
all of the structures,frames were integrated and the data were
scaled and merged together using the HKL package (DENZO and
SCALEPACK) from Molecular Structures Corp. (Table 3).
All of the crystals were isomorphous to structures of other rat
trypsin and trypsinogen-BPTI complexes (Perona et al. 1993; Pas￾ternak et al. 1999). The initial model for the I16V17 trypsinogen￾BPTI complex was the Ser195Ala trypsinogen-BPTI complex
(PDB code 3TGJ; Pasternak et al. 1999). The initial model for the
I16V17/D194N trypsinogen-BPTI complex was the I16V17
trypsinogen-BPTI complex (PDB code 1FY8). The initial model
for the K15A trypsinogen-BPTI complex was the wild-type trypsin
plus BPTI complex (PDB entry 3TGI; Pasternak et al. 1999). The
initial model for the I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen-BPTI complex
was the I16V17 trypsinogen-BPTI complex (PDB code 1FY8).
The I16V17 trypsinogen-BPTI and I16V17/D194N trypsino￾gen-BPTI structures were refined using the X-PLOR package
(Brünger et al. 1987),with 10% of the data set aside to compute
Rfree (Brünger 1992). Initially,an overall temperature factor of 20
Å2 was used. Rigid body refinement was performed,treating tryp￾sinogen and BPTI as separate rigid bodies. Positional refinement
and B-factor refinement were monitored by the Rfree to prevent
overrefinement (Brünger 1992). Water molecules were added in
three rounds using the waterpick script in X-PLOR,keeping waters
for which electron density was seen both in the difference Fourier
electron density map with coefficients Fo-Fc,and in the difference
Fourier electron density map with coefficients 2Fo-Fc. In addition,
after refinement the waters were required to be within hydrogen
bond distance (3.4 Å) from hydrogen bond donors or acceptors,
and waters with temperature factors greater than 60 Å2 were de￾leted from the models. Disordered residues were omitted from the
structure factor calculation. Simulated annealing omit maps (1000
K to 300 K; Hodel et al. 1982) were calculated in attempts to locate
the autolysis loop and the N-terminus,and were also used in po￾sitioning the residues at the boundaries of these regions. These
residues were included in structure factor calculations for the sub￾sequent refinement. Examination of and manual adjustments to the
structure were performed between rounds of refinement using the
program O (Jones et al. 1991) on a Silicon Graphics workstation.
Ramachandran plots generated by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al.
1993) on the final coordinates indicated that all residues in both
structures fell into the “most favored” or “allowed” regions. The
I16V17/Q156K trypsinogen-BPTI structure was refined using
the CNS package (Brunger et al. 1998),with 10% of the data set
aside to compute Rfree. The starting overall temperature factor was
15.0 Å2
. Rigid body refinement was performed treating trypsino￾gen and BPTI as separated rigid bodies. Examination and manual
adjustment of the structure were performed between rounds of
refinement using the program O on a Silicon Graphics work sta￾tion. The K15A trypsinogen-BPTI complex structure was refined
using the CNS package (Brunger et al. 1998) with 10% of the data
set aside to compute Rfree. The starting overall temperature factor
was 15.0 Å2
. Rounds of refinement were alternated with manual
adjustments using the program O (Jones et al. 1991) on a Silicon
Graphics workstation. Water molecules were added as described
above for the I16V17 trypsinogen-BPTI and I16V17/D194N
trypsinogen-BPTI structures. Figures were created using the pro￾grams MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis 1991) and Insight.
