Three insect peptides showing high sequence similar￾ity and belonging to the same structural family incorpo￾rating a cysteine knot and a short three-stranded anti￾parallel b-sheet were studied. Their inhibitory effect on
two serine proteases (bovine a-chymotrypsin and hu￾man leukocyte elastase) is reported. One of them,
PMP-C, is a strong a-chymotrypsin inhibitor (Ki 5 0.2
nM) and interacts with leukocyte elastase with a Ki of
0.12 mM. The other two peptides, PMP-D2 and HI, inter￾act only weakly with a-chymotrypsin and do not inhibit
leukocyte elastase. Synthetic variants of these peptides
were prepared by solid-phase synthesis, and their action
toward serine proteases was evaluated. This enabled us
to locate the P1 residues within the reactive sites
(Leu-30 for PMP-C and Arg-29 for PMP-D2 and HI), and,
interestingly, variants of PMP-D2 and HI were con￾verted into powerful inhibitors of both a-chymotrypsin
and leukocyte elastase, the most potent elastase inhibi￾tor obtained in this study having a Ki of 3 nM.
In the last decade, naturally occurring serine protease inhib￾itors (1) have been the focus of many studies, mainly for two
reasons: first, the target proteins control functions in a variety
of fundamental proteolytic processes in humans and mammals
(blood clotting, digestion, inflammation, fibrinolysis), in inver￾tebrates such as insects (immune system, digestion, protection
against their predators) or worms (protection against their
host), and plants (protection against insect attack); second, low
molecular weight inhibitors of serine proteases have been at￾tractive tools for studying the general aspects of protein con￾formation and protein-protein interactions (2). In the present
study, we report the inhibitory properties of three homologous
peptides (primary and tertiary structures) toward a-chymo￾trypsin, trypsin, and human leukocyte elastase.
We have previously isolated two peptides, PMP-C and PMP￾D2, from the brain and the fat body of the insect Locusta
migratoria (3). These peptides are composed of 36 and 35 res￾idues, respectively, and are cross-linked by three disulfide
bonds. The Thr-9 of PMP-C has an uncommon O-glycosidic
linkage to a single fucose moiety. There is 40% strict identity
between PMP-C and PMP-D2 with conservation of the Cys
positions (3). Moreover, they are located on the same peptidic
precursor, and, by Northern blot analysis, it has been shown
that the gene encoding this precursor is mainly transcribed in
the fat body (4). In this paper, we describe the isolation and
characterization of HI, a novel locust peptide.
Because the isolation from insect extracts is time-consuming
and yields only small amounts of peptides, we have prepared,
at a reasonable scale (5–10 mg), by solid-phase synthesis,
PMP-D2 (5) and PMP-C with and without the fucose moiety.1
Although they are small peptides with a high disulfide content,
no sequence similarities could be found when comparing them
with small toxins or small protease inhibitors. However, the
milligram quantities of PMP-D2 obtained by solid-phase syn￾thesis enabled us to study its tertiary structure by two-dimen￾sional nuclear magnetic resonance, which showed interesting
similarities with the tertiary fold of both v-conotoxin GVIA, a
calcium channel blocker, and the Ascaris chymotrypsin/elas￾tase inhibitor (6). This prompted us to evaluate their protease
inhibitory activity.
In the present paper, we report on the inhibitory activity of
PMP-C, PMP-D2, and HI toward serine proteases (bovine
a-chymotrypsin, human leukocyte elastase, and porcine tryp￾sin) using the natural and synthetic peptides. Since the P1
residue (7) within the reactive site of serine protease inhibitors
determines the specificity for the cognate enzyme, mutational
or synthetic changes of the P1 residue and/or replacement of
active site residues should greatly influence both the specificity
and the potency of the inhibition. For that reason, we have
prepared by solid-phase synthesis variants2 of PMP-C, PMP￾D2, and HI, in which one or two residues within the reactive
site have been changed, and we have evaluated their inhibitory
properties toward HLE,3 a-chymotrypsin and trypsin.

reagent (benzotriazolyl-N-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexa￾fluorophosphate) and trifluoroacetic acid were from Neosystem
Laboratoire.
Enzymes
Human leukocyte elastase (HLE) was isolated from purulent sputum
(8) and active site-titrated using acetyl-Ala2-AzaAla-p-nitrophenyl es￾ter (9) from Enzyme System Products (Livermore, CA). Porcine trypsin
and bovine chymotrypsin were purchased from Biosys (Compie`gne,
France) and active site-titrated using p-nitrophenyl p-guanidinobenzo￾ate (10) and N-trans-cinnamoylimidazole (11) from Sigma, respectively.
Substrates
Suc-Ala3-pNA, MeO-Suc-Ala2-Pro-Val-pNA, glutaryl-Phe-pNA, Suc￾Ala2-Pro-Phe-pNA, and benzoyl-Arg-pNA were from Bachem (Buben￾dorf, Switzerland). Suc-Ala3-pNA stock solutions were prepared in N￾methylpyrrolidone. All other substrate stock solutions were prepared in
DMF.
Methods
Isolation of the Natural Peptides (PMP-D2, PMP-C, and HI) from
the Hemolymph of the Insect L. migratoria and Primary
Structure Determination of HI
The hemolymph of fifth instar larvae (1800) of the African locust L.
migratoria (kindly supplied by the Laboratoire de Biologie Ge´ne´rale de
l’Universite´ Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France) was collected directly
into Eppendorf tubes and was centrifuged at 900 3 g for approximately
30 s at 4 °C to separate the hemocytes from the plasma and was kept on
ice. Plasma samples were pooled (70 ml) and applied (3 ml per car￾tridge) onto C18 Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters). The elution was per￾formed with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in water (18, 36,
and 60%). The 36% acetonitrile fractions were purified by C18 RP￾HPLC using an analytical column (0.46 3 25 cm) packed with 5-mm￾wide pore (30 nm) Vydac particles. A linear gradient from 0 to 60%
acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min, at a flow rate of 1
ml/min was used. The peaks were collected manually and, if necessary,
repurified on the same column with a shallower gradient (a stepwise
gradient from 5 to 11% (or 15%) acetonitrile over 10 min and from 11%
(or 15%) to 35% (or 39%) acetonitrile over 40 min). They were estimated
to be 95% pure on analytical RP-HPLC, and the amount of natural
PMP-D2, PMP-C, and HI obtained from 70 ml of hemolymph was 1 mg,
1 mg, and 60 mg, respectively.
The authenticity of the PMP-C and PMP-D2 was assessed by elec￾trospray mass spectrometry on a VG BioTech BIO-Q mass spectrometer
and by coelution with PMP-C and PMP-D2 obtained after isolation from
the brain and the fat body of the same insect (3).
The peptide referred to as HI was reduced and alkylated by 4-vi￾nylpyridine (as described in Ref. 3) and was then subjected to auto￾mated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Sequencer, model
471A in the liquid pulse mode, which yielded a 35-amino acid sequence
(Fig. 1). The molecular mass of HI, as determined by electrospray mass
spectrometry, was 3716.43 6 0.18 Da, which is in excellent agreement
with the sequencing data (deduced mass M 5 3722.28 Da minus 6 for 3
disulfide bridges).
Solid-phase Peptide Synthesis
The synthesis of PMP-D2 (5) and PMP-C1 was performed as de￾scribed elsewhere. HI and all the synthetic variants of PMP-C and
PMP-D2 were synthesized manually, via Fmoc chemistry, starting with
approximately 0.25 mmol of Wang (p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol) resins.
Amino acids were coupled as Na-Fmoc derivatives with the following
side chain protections: trityl for Asn, Cys, and Gln; t-butyl for Asp, Glu,
Ser, and Thr; t-butoxycarbonyl for Lys, and Trp; 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl
chroman-6-sulfonyl for Arg; and Met was coupled unprotected. The
coupling reactions were achieved in DMF using 3 eq of BOP to activate
the carboxyl function, 3 eq of protected amino acid, and 9 eq of DIEA.
The completion of the couplings was assessed by a qualitative ninhy￾drin test. If necessary, double couplings were achieved with 5 eq of
amino acids. The removal of the Fmoc protecting group was achieved
with 25% piperidine in DMF. The side chain deprotection and the
cleavage of the peptide from the resin (100 mg) was done with the
standard trifluoroacetic acid procedure: trifluoroacetic acid/ethanedi￾thiol/thioanisol/H2O/phenol (10 ml/0.25 ml/0.5 ml/0.5 ml/0.75 g) at room
temperature for 2 h. The trifluoroacetic acid solution was vacuum￾filtered into cold methyl tert-butyl ether (30 ml). The methyl tert-butyl
ether suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 3 g at room
temperature. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was
resuspended in methyl tert-butyl ether (30 ml). This procedure was
repeated twice, and the precipitate was finally dissolved in 10% acetic
acid and lyophilized.
Disulfide Bond Formation and Purification of the Synthetic
Peptides
The crude peptides (1 mg/ml) were air-oxidized in water (pH 8 –9
adjusted with DIEA) without preliminary purification. The completion
of oxidation (usually 18 h) was checked by HPLC, and the reaction was
acidified with trifluoroacetic acid before application on a semi-prepar￾ative C18 RP-HPLC column (2.2 3 25 cm) packed with 10-mm-wide pore
(300 nm) Vydac particles. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 10
ml/min with a linear gradient of 0 – 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoro￾acetic acid over 60 min. The collected fractions were pooled, concen￾trated by lyophilization, and repurified using a shallower gradient (a
stepwise gradient from 5–11% (or 15%) acetonitrile over 10 min and
from 11% (or 15%) to 35% (or 39%) acetonitrile over 40 min).
Peptide purity was estimated to be 95% by analytical RP-HPLC
using a stepwise gradient as for the purification of HI. Overall yields,
based on resin, were usually between 2 and 3%. The authenticity of the
synthetic peptides was checked by electrospray mass spectrometry.
Table I shows the deduced mass from Edman degradation and the
measured mass of the different variants (the 6-Da difference between
the mass deduced from amino acid sequence and that measured by
electrospray mass spectrometry is due to the involvement of the 6 Cys
in 3 disulfide bonds).
Determination of the Net Peptide Content in Peptide Inhibitors
Peptide concentrations were deduced from the molecular mass and
the extinction coefficient, a parameter measured as described by Van
Iersel et al. (12).
Serine Protease Inhibition
Protease concentrations mentioned in this article refer to the con￾centration of active enzymes. The Michaelis constants Km were deter￾mined using standard procedures. Unless otherwise stated, all kinetic
experiments were performed at 25 °C in 50 mM Tris containing 20 mM
CaCl2, pH 8.0, a solution that will be referred to as “the buffer” through￾out the text.
Measurement of Equilibrium Dissociation Constant Ki
—Ki was cal￾culated from equilibrium titration experiments. 990-ml reaction mix￾tures containing constant amounts of enzyme and increasing amounts
of inhibitor in the buffer were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min, an incu￾bation time that was sufficient to ensure maximum enzyme inhibition
under our experimental conditions. Reactions were started by the ad￾dition of 10 ml of substrate stock solution, and the release of p-nitro￾anilide was followed at 410 nm using a Uvicon 941 spectrophotometer
(Kontron) and recorded until the rate of substrate breakdown remained
constant.
Trypsin inhibition was assessed by reacting 4 mM enzyme with 16 mM
peptide for 30 min at 25 °C and measuring the enzyme activity with 1
mM benzoyl-Arg-pNA.
Measurement of Association (kass) and Dissociation (kdiss) Rate Con￾stants—Kinetics of HLE and chymotrypsin inhibition by the native and
synthetic peptides were measured using the progress curves method
(13). Enzyme was dropped into a spectrophotometer cuvette containing
substrate and inhibitor in the buffer. Pseudo-first order conditions, [I]0
$ 10 3 [E]0 ([I]0 is the initial inhibitor concentration and [E]0 the initial
enzyme concentration), were used. The release of p-nitroanilide was
followed at 410 nm using a Cary 2200 spectrophotometer (Varian) on
line with an IBM PS2 Model 30 microcomputer. Nonlinear regression
analysis of progress curves was done using the Enzfitter software
(Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).

Isolation and Primary Structure Determination of a Novel
Peptide, HI, from the Hemolymph of L. migratoria—While pu￾rifying from the hemolymph PMP-C and PMP-D2 as reference
compounds, a novel peptide, named HI, was isolated. The se￾quencing of HI, carried out by automated Edman degradation,
showed a 72% strict identity with PMP-D2 (Fig. 1). The molec￾ular mass, measured by electrospray mass spectrometry, was
3716.43 Da. This value differs by 6 Da from the data obtained
by Edman degradation (3722.28 Da), thus suggesting that the
6 Cys are all involved in 3 disulfide bonds. Moreover, because of
its high homology with PMP-D2, it is likely that the disulfide
pairing is the same as in PMP-D2 (6).
Protease Inhibition by Natural and Synthetic PMP-C, PMP￾D2, and HI—Preliminary experiments have shown that only
PMP-C inhibits HLE. By contrast, chymotrypsin was found to
interact with the 3 peptides. Interestingly, none of the peptides
was found to inhibit porcine trypsin in our experimental
conditions.
Fig. 2 shows the effect of increasing quantities of synthetic
PMP-D2 on constant quantities of chymotrypsin. Substrate
was added to equilibrium mixtures of enzyme and inhibitor.
The release of p-nitroanilide versus time was stable after 20 –30
s indicating that E, I, S (enzyme, inhibitor and substrate,
respectively), and their complexes have reached their equilib￾rium. Calculation of the best estimate of the substrate-depend￾ent equilibrium constant Ki(app) was performed by nonlinear
regression analysis of the experimental data based on Equation
1 (13):
a 5 1 2 ~@E#0 1 @I#0 1 Ki~app!! 2 Î~@E#0 1 @I#0 1 Ki~app!!
2 2 4@E#0@I#0
2@E#0
(Eq. 1)
where a, the enzymic fractional activity, is the ratio of the
velocity in the presence of inhibitor to that in its absence. The
true Ki (Table II) was deduced from Ki(app) using the following
relationship: Ki 5 Ki(app)/(1 1 [S]0/Km), where[S]0 is the initial
substrate concentration. The Ki value for natural PMP-D2
was shown to be identical with that of the synthetic peptide
(Table II).
Equilibrium dissociation constants governing the interac￾tions between chymotrypsin and synthetic HI and between
HLE and PMP-C (natural and synthetic nonfucosylated) were
determined using similar equilibrium titration experiments
(Table II).
Since PMP-C (natural and synthetic nonfucosylated) binds
chymotrypsin very tightly, Ki was obtained through kass and
kdiss. These parameters were determined using the progress
curves method (13, 14). A typical curve illustrating chymotryp￾sin inhibition by nonfucosylated PMP-C is shown in the inset of
Fig. 3A. The curve is biphasic, i.e. the pre-steady state release
of product is followed by a steady state, confirming that PMP-C
reversibly interacts with chymotrypsin. Since no significant
decrease of the initial substrate concentration occurred during
the progress of the reaction and, since I0 $ 10 3 E0, product
accumulation versus time can be described by the following
equation:
P 5 vst 1 vz 2 vs
k ~1 2 e2kt! (Eq. 2)
where P is the product concentration, vz is the rate of substrate
hydrolysis at t 5 0, vs is the steady state velocity. k, the
apparent first order rate constant governing the pre-steady
state was calculated from the experimental data by nonlinear
regression analysis using Equation 2. Chymotrypsin inhibition
was studied using synthetic nonfucosylated PMP-C concentra￾tions varying from 0.14 to 0.72 mM. Fig. 3A shows the effect of
[I]0, the initial inhibitor concentration on the apparent rate
constant k; the linear increase of k strongly suggests that no
reaction intermediate accumulates (within the range of inhib￾itor concentrations used) and that E and I interact according to
a simple bimolecular and reversible mechanism.
Fig. 3B shows the effect of the initial substrate concentration
on k; the linear increase of k with 1/F (F 5 1 1 [S]0/Km)
indicates that inhibitor and substrate compete for the binding
to the enzyme. Hence, k and I0 are related as follows (15):
k 5 kass@I#0
1 1 @S#0/Km
1 kdiss (Eq. 3)
where Km is the Michaelis constant. kass, the second order rate
constant was calculated from the slope of the linear curve
shown in Fig. 3A using Km 5 23 mM. kdiss, the first order
dissociation rate constant, is given by the intercept of the curve
with the ordinate. The values of kass, kdiss, and Ki (Ki 5 kdiss/
kass) of fucosylated and nonfucosylated PMP-C are shown in
Table II; these kinetic constants are similar, indicating that the
fucose moiety does not affect chymotrypsin inhibition.
The inhibition properties (toward chymotrypsin and HLE) of
the variants of PMP-C, PMP-D2, and HI were examined using
similar methods, and the results are given in Table II.
Determination of the P1 Amino Acid by Synthetic Replace￾ment of the Amino Acid at the Presumed Site—It is well docu￾mented that a-chymotrypsin inhibitors usually have bulky and
aromatic amino acid residues such as Tyr, Phe, Leu, or Met as
their P1 residue, while elastases have moderately large hydro￾FIG. 1. A, amino acid sequence of the peptide named HI and compar￾ison with the sequence of PMP-D2 (72% identity); B, sequence compar￾ison between PMP-C and PMP-D2 (a gap is introduced to maximize the
homology between the two sequences).
FIG. 2. Inhibition of a-chymotrypsin by PMP-D2. A constant
a-chymotrypsin concentration (6 mM) was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min
with increasing concentrations of PMP-D2 (5.2 to 52 mM). After addition
of glutaryl-Phe-pNA (1.4 mM, final concentration), the release of p￾nitroanilide was followed at 410 nm. Fractional activity (a) is defined in
the text. Experimental points (1) and theoretical line (2) generated
using Equation 1 and the best estimate of Ki(app).
25516 Serine Protease Inhibition by Insect Peptides
 at Carleton Univ - OCUL on May 5, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from phobic residues such as Leu, Met, Ala, Val as P1, but never Phe
(1). Therefore, we hypothesized that the most likely P1 residue
in PMP-C is Leu-30, which could account for its inhibitory
effect toward both a-chymotrypsin and HLE. Leu-30 was in￾deed the most probable location for the P1 amino acid, since it
is the only Leu residue in the sequence of PMP-C (Fig. 1) and
since it is located in an exposed and accessible region of the
peptide, immediately after the third strand of the b-sheet. To
test this hypothesis, we prepared a synthetic variant of PMP-C
in which Leu-30 was replaced by a Val residue. The choice of
Val was based on the following considerations. Val has never
been reported as the P1 amino acid in chymotrypsin inhibitors;
the change of Leu to Val should has little if any effect on the
tertiary fold of PMP-C; small peptidic inhibitors are supposed
to react in a substrate-like manner, and Val is a P1 residue
found in the substrates of HLE (16).
As shown in Table II, the L30V variant lost most of its ability
to inhibit a-chymotrypsin. However, it retained its weak activ￾ity toward HLE (Table II). The spectacular change in the inhi￾bition of a-chymotrypsin observed with the L30V variant indi￾cated that it was possible to lose specifically the inhibitory
activity toward chymotrypsin, while retaining the anti-elastase
property. Therefore, we concluded that the changed amino acid
Leu was the P1 residue, the decrease in affinity being due to an
inappropriate P1 residue and not to the misfolding of the
PMP-C variant.
Confirmation of the Determined P1 Residue by Conversion of
PMP-D2 and HI into Powerful a-Chymotrypsin Inhibitors—
The comparison of PMP-C with PMP-D2 and HI sequences
enabled us to locate the reactive site of PMP-D2 and HI
by simply superimposing them: C28TLKAC33, PMP-C;
C27TRKGC32, PMP-D2; C27TRKAC32, HI.
Thus, the most probable reactive sites P1-P91 in PMP-D2 and
HI are Arg-29-Lys-30. To confirm this hypothesis, the pre￾sumed P1 residues (Arg) were replaced by Leu in PMP-D2 and
HI in order to have the same reactive site Leu-Lys as in
PMP-C. The potency of both R29L variants toward a-chymo￾trypsin inhibition was increased significantly, and they were
both converted into HLE inhibitors. The PMP-D2 variant was
found to be the strongest inhibitor of HLE obtained in this
study (Table II).
When comparing the amino acids within the reactive site
P3-P93 of PMP-C and the R29L variants of HI and PMP-D2,
one can notice the strict identity of the recognition site between
PMP-C and the HI variant (CTLKAC), whereas PMP-D2 vari￾ant has a Gly in the P92 position (CTLKGC) instead of Ala;
these results are indicative of an Ala in position P92 which may
be preferable to Gly for a-chymotrypsin inhibition, while the
contrary is true for elastase inhibition.
Design of a Better Elastase Inhibitor—Several elastase in￾hibitors have been reported to have a Met residue at P91; for
instance, mucous proteinase inhibitor (17) and Ascaris chymo￾TABLE II

Serine Protease Inhibition by Insect Peptides 25517
 at Carleton Univ - OCUL on May 5, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from trypsin/elastase inhibitor (18) have Leu-Met as P1-P91 reactive
site. Therefore, considering the strongest elastase inhibitor
obtained in this study (PMP-D2 variant R29L), a double vari￾ant R29L/K30M (with Met as P91) was designed in order to
improve the binding to HLE. Indeed, the variant R29L/K30 M is
4-fold stronger than the previous one with a Ki of 3 nM, con￾firming the importance of the Met in position P91.
To investigate the role of the residues beyond the P1-P91
bond, we have prepared a double variant of PMP-C: K31M/
A32G (which has the same P3-P93, CTLMGC, as the most
powerful elastase inhibitor R29L/K30M variant of PMP-D2)
and examined its inhibitory activity; this variant is still 7- to
8-fold weaker HLE inhibitor than the double variant of
PMP-D2 (a Met as P91, in this case, does not increase the
potency toward HLE). In contrast, the double variant of PMP-C
is more effective toward a-chymotrypsin than the PMP-D2
double variant. Thus, the residues beyond the P1-P91 bond
seem to have an effect on the specificity toward proteases, and
variants of PMP-D2 seem to be more specific toward elastases
than the variants of PMP-C.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study clearly show that PMP-C and
PMP-D2 differ significantly with respect to their selectivity
toward serine proteases, even though they exhibit a high se￾quence homology (45%) and are structurally related.4 It seems
reasonable to hypothesize that a common ancestor might have
adapted for specific and diverse biological functions by punc￾tual mutations that do not affect the overall three-dimensional
structure. In that respect, it is remarkable that a unique sub￾stitution in the reactive site of PMP-D2 (from Arg to Leu) is
sufficient to restore the serine protease inhibitory activity.
Since PMP-C is a tight-binding reversible inhibitor and has
a small and compact shape and an exposed binding loop, we
propose to include it in the large group of the “small canonical
tight-binding serine protease inhibitors.” This group of prote￾ase inhibitors consists of 16 different families and includes
peptides ranging from 29 to 120 amino acids (2). Interestingly,
the peptides of this group are structurally unrelated, but share
some properties such as hydrophobic cores (often maintained
by disulfide bonds), stability toward unfolding, and, more re￾markably, an exposed binding loop (containing the scissile P1-
P91 bond) that fits into the active site cleft of the serine prote￾ase. The specificity of serine protease inhibitors is significantly,
but not exclusively, determined by the nature of the P1 residue
in the reactive site. Although in most families of proteins, the
active regions are highly conserved, in the serine protease
inhibitors, there is no consensus sequence for the reactive site
emerging yet. Indeed, retention of activity in these proteins
exists even though the P1 residue has been changed (1). In
some cases, substitutions lead to a predictable change in the
inhibitory specificity (17, 19 –21).
Taking into account the variability of the P1 region, we have
designed “variants” of PMP-C, PMP-D2, and HI by targeting
precisely the amino acid replacement. The aim of this study
was to determine the P1 residue of the peptides and to increase
the affinity toward HLE, since a variety of elastase inhibitors
have been shown to be effective in animal models of emphy￾sema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, rheumatoid arthri￾tis, cystic fibrosis, bronchitis, or acute pancreatitis.
We have proved that Leu-30 is actually the P1 position by
modulating successfully the inhibitory properties of PMP-C
(maintaining its activity toward HLE and decreasing it toward
a-chymotrypsin) with the L30V variant. This result is unam￾biguously confirmed in the case of PMP-D2 and HI, where
Arg-29 (equivalent to Leu-30 in PMP-C) was replaced by a Leu;
the R29L variants are potent a-chymotrypsin inhibitors and
they present a reasonable affinity toward HLE.
Surprisingly, the replacement of the P1 5 Leu-30 (in PMP-C)
by Val increased the affinity toward HLE by a factor of 3 only.
Indeed, several novel elastase inhibitors were obtained by re￾placing the P1 for Val (19 –21). Our results highlight the sig￾nificant role of the nature of the amino acids within the reac￾tive site other than the P1 side chain for elastase inhibition. We
therefore evaluated the effect of the P91 residue (large and
basic side chain) by replacing the Lys-30 in the R29L variant of
PMP-D2 (which was presently the most effective HLE inhibi￾tor) by a Met (often found in P91 position of HLE inhibitors),
and the increased affinity of this double variant for HLE con￾firmed our previous observation. Up to now, the most appro￾priate P3-P93 sequence for elastase inhibition is CTLMGC;
however, it should be noticed that the double variant of
PMP-D2 is more powerful than the equivalent double variant of
PMP-C K31M/A32G; this is indicative of a sequence and/or
conformational effect which influences the reactive site binding
loop.
It is noteworthy that although PMP-C, PMP-D2, and HI
have several Lys residues in their sequences, and PMP-D2 and
HI have an additional Arg, none of these peptides inhibits
porcine trypsin. This result is surprising, considering that
many natural trypsin inhibitors have a Lys as P1 residue and
that most synthetic substrates of trypsin have an Arg as P1
residue.
While this work was in progress, Boigegrain et al. (22) have
isolated from the hemolymph of L. migratoria two peptides
with sequences identical with PMP-C and PMP-D2. They have
shown that both PMP-C and PMP-D2 are powerful inhibitors of
a-chymotrypsin (Ki of 0.25 nM and 0.12 nM, respectively) and
weak to medium inhibitors of HLE (Ki . 0.1 mM and of 18 nM,
respectively). These values are significantly different from
ours. We have shown in this work that PMP-D2 interacts only
weakly with a-chymotrypsin (Ki of 1.5 mM) and does not inhibit
HLE, and, similarly, PMP-C has a Ki of 0.12 mM instead of a
Ki . 0.1 mM toward HLE. We have no explanation for this
discrepancy.
It will be interesting to further characterize which amino
acid(s) outside the reactive site and which part(s) of the frame￾work are essential for the protease inhibitory activity. This
should help to design more affine and smaller peptidic ana￾logues or peptidomimetics, which are required for a therapeutic
use of these peptides.
