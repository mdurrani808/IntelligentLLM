Engineered antibody paratopes with limited sequence diversity permit
assessment of the roles played by different amino acid side chains in creating
the high-affinity, high-specificity interactions characteristic of antibodies.
We describe a paratope raised against the human ErbB family member
HER2, using a binary diversity tryptophan/serine library displayed on
phage. Fab37 binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 with sub-nanomolar
affinity. An X-ray structure at 3.2 Å resolution reveals a contact paratope
composed almost entirely of tryptophan and serine residues. Mutagenesis
experiments reveal which of these side chains are more important for direct
antigen interactions and which are more important for conformational
flexibility. The crystal lattice contains an unprecedented trimeric arrange￾ment of HER2 closely related to previously observed homodimers of the
related epidermal growth factor receptor.

The hallmarks of antibody/antigen interactions are
high affinity and high specificity. Among the many
thousands of known natural antibody sequences, a
wide diversity of amino acids is present in positions
capable of contacting an antigen, but some amino
acids appear in such roles more than others.1 An
interest in roles played by various amino acids in
presenting an antigen-binding surface (paratope) has
inspired us to categorize amino acids according to
their size, polarity, and flexibility into their primary
apparent functions, for instance, antigen contact and
conformational permissiveness. We have previously
shown that amino acid diversity in synthetic anti￾body libraries could be restricted to simple Tyr/Ser
combinations to generate specific, high-affinity anti￾gen-binding sites.2 We have now extended this work
to show that other binary amino acid combinations
can also form tight and specific interactions.3 One of
the most extreme binary combinations proven to be
capable of normal antibody binding functions is that
of tryptophan and serine (Trp/Ser).
Our study of restricted-diversity antibodies has
also enabled production of useful reagents. We have
been attracted to the use of antibody fragments
[antigen-binding fragments (Fabs)] for stabilizing
flexible proteins during crystallization.4 Fab37 was
selected from a Trp/Ser binary library displayed on
phage for binding to HER2.3 HER2 is one of four
members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs), which also includes epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR). X-ray structures of
the extracellular domains (ECDs) of all four ErbB
receptors have been reported, but only for EGFR has
a ligand-stabilized homodimer been isolated and
crystallized successfully. We were interested in
learning whether a new HER2 structure with
Fab37 might reveal a homodimer of the HER2
ECD. Two structures of HER2 ECD in complex
with a Fab have been reported, but both studies used
Fabs from antagonistic antibodies (trastuzumab and
pertuzumab), which may derive some of their
activity from blocking HER2 dimer formation. In
both of these structures, no significant contacts were
observed between HER2 molecules.5,6 Fab37 binds
to HER2 with high affinity3 (Kd = 0.79 nM), and
binding is not inhibited by Fabs from either
trastuzumab or pertuzumab. Also, unlike pertuzu￾mab, Fab37 does not affect ligand-mediated HER2/
HER3 signaling. Thus, we reasoned that Fab37 must
recognize a novel epitope on HER2 and we
hypothesized that Fab37 might facilitate crystalliza￾tion of the HER2 ECD in an arrangement resembling
the ligand-bound EGFR dimer.
Herein, we report the structure of Fab37 in
complex with HER2. Together with extensive muta￾genesis data for Fab37, the structure provides
insights into the molecular basis for high-affinity
antigen recognition by the minimalist Trp/Ser
antigen-binding site and further extends our under￾standing of the basic principles of molecular recog￾nition. The structure of the HER2/Fab37 complex
reveals an unexpected trimeric arrangement among
the HER2 ECDs. The HER2 trimer bears strong
kinship to the dimer arrangement seen for EGFR
dimers stabilized by EGF binding. Nonetheless,
small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) shows that the
trimer complex is not present in solution prior to
crystallization, and mutations introduced in HER2 to
disfavor trimer formation do not alter cellular
behavior.
Results
X-ray structure of the HER2/Fab37 complex
To facilitate analysis of Fab37 side-chain contribu￾tions to HER2 binding and to learn whether the
crystallization of HER2/Fab37 would chaperone an
intimate association between HER2 ECDs, we
determined the X-ray structure of the HER2/Fab37
complex at 3.2 Å resolution (Table 1). The complex is

218 HER2/Fab37 Complex Structureformed by interactions between the Trp/Ser-rich
Fab37 paratope and a HER2 epitope primarily on
domain III (Fig. 1). This interface sequesters 1125 Å2
from solvent on each side.8 The Fab37 paratope
has 73% contributed by the heavy-chain variable
domain (VH) and 27% by the light-chain variable
domain (VL). Only the four complementarity￾determining region (CDR) loops subject to the
binary Trp/Ser phage library diversity (L3, H1,
H2, and H3) are within 4 Å of HER2 (Fig. 1a). All
Fab37 side chains within 4 Å of HER2 are either Trp
or Ser, with the single exception of Arg94 from VH.
The guanidinium of the Arg94 side chain is within
H-bonding distance to the side chain of HER2
Ser396. Main-chain atoms from heavy-chain Gly26
and Phe27 (CDR-H1) are also within 4 Å of HER2.
The CDR loop conformations are similar to those
observed for the trastuzumab Fab in complex with
HER2.5 The loop conformation of CDR-H3 is best
described as a distorted Type II′ β-turn, but this
conclusion is tenuous considering the resolution of
the data.
The HER2 epitope is on domains III and IV,
remote from the binding sites for therapeutic anti￾HER2 antibodies pertuzumab and trastuzumab on
domain II or IV, respectively (Fig. 2a). The Fab37
binding site on domain III is almost opposite the
region of domain III contacted by domain I and
similar to the epitope contacted by a three-helix
protein (affibody) developed using phage display.9
As a result, it does not include residues homologous
to the EGFR domain III ligand-binding residues,
which are also the target of the therapeutic anti￾EGFR antibody cetuximab (Fig. 2b). The first
cysteine-rich module of domain IV is also part of
the HER2 epitope. Consistent with the predomi￾nance of Trp and Ser in the Fab37 paratope, the
HER2 epitope lacks concentrated net electrostatic
charge (Fig. S1).
The domain organization of the HER2 ECD
observed in the HER2/Fab37 complex is essentially
unchanged from previously reported structures of
rat HER2 ECD domains I–IV,5 human HER2 ECD
domains I–III,10 and complexes of human HER2
ECD domains I–IV with Fabs binding to domain
IV5,11 or domain II.6 The “dimerization” arm in
domain II is incomplete due to disorder (Ala248-
Tyr252) and otherwise is dissimilar to the previous

HER2/Fab37 Complex Structure 219structures; N-terminal sequencing of dissolved
crystals showed that no internal cleavage existed in
HER2 (data not shown). Root-mean-square devia￾tions (RMSDs) of Cα atoms from previously reported
structures after superposition of domains I–III are
∼0.5 Å. The final model includes domain IV up to
residue 620 but the final Fo−Fc map is noisy for
residues after Cys608. As seen among previously
reported HER2 structures, the orientation of domain
IV relative to the other domains is the least well
conserved due to a hinge bend near the domain III–
IV boundary that produces a shift of 7 Å at residue
550, which is halfway between the beginning and the
end of the elongated domain IV and before the start
of less reliably fit (noisy) electron density.
The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a
simple 1:1 complex (Fig. 2a). Despite the very high
solvent content of the HER2/Fab37 complex crystals
(79%), the structure also contains interesting crystal
packing contacts (Fig. 3). Opposite sides of HER2
domain IV contact different symmetry-related cop￾ies of Fab37, but at nonequivalent sites distant from
the Fab37 CDR loops. Also, HER2 domain I contacts
a 2-fold-axis-related neighbor involving carbohy￾drate attached to Asn165. Together, these three
crystal packing contacts obscure 2360 Å2 of HER2
from solvent. No prior crystal structure reported
among ErbB family ECDs shares analogues of these
contacts, although a domain I:domain I contact of a
different nature is present in crystals of Drosophila
EGFR.12 Contacts between symmetry-related Fab37
proteins are restricted to a 2-fold-axis-derived
contact centered near Arg19 of VH and with closest
contacts between Lys57 and Thr115, which obscures
520 Å2 from solvent on each side.
An additional and much larger crystal packing
contact is both unique among the ErbB family
member crystal structures and suggestive of biolog￾ical relevance. Three copies of the HER2 ECD are
arranged around a crystallographic 3-fold axis and
thereby sequester 1400 Å2 from solvent, twice for
each HER2, for a total of 8400 Å2 sequestered HER2
surface area for the crystallographic trimer (Fig. 4a).
This arrangement does not permit the HER2 domain
II “dimerization” arm to retain the conformation
seen previously. Nonetheless, a vestige of the
homodimeric arrangement observed only for the
EGFR ECD, and more recently for Drosophila EGFR,
is retained.12–14 HER2 Phe257 is homologous to
Tyr251 of EGFR, which is found at the tip of the
EGFR dimerization arm and most deeply associated
with its partner in the EGFR dimer. HER2 Phe257
is found in an analogous position in a trimer partner
(Fig. 4a). The pockets into which these homologous
side chains project are also analogous, a region
where domains I, II, and III are closest together

colored by domain organization. HER2 domains I–IV (D1–D4) are colored orange, light green, tan, and dark green,
respectively; Fab37 heavy chain is dark blue and light chain is cyan. Binding sites for therapeutic anti-HER2 antibodies
trastuzumab (red spheres) and pertuzumab (magenta spheres) are indicated. (b) A comparison of the cetuximab Fab
binding to EGFR relative to Fab37 binding to HER2 is modeled by overlaying domain III (D3) of HER2 (tan semi￾transparent surface) from the HER2/Fab37 complex with EGFR domain III (D3) (purple ribbon) from the EGFR/
cetuximab Fab complex structure (PDB ID: 1YY9) to illustrate distinct domain III binding epitopes for cetuximab (gray
ribbon) and Fab37 (dark blue and light blue surfaces).
220 HER2/Fab37 Complex Structure(Fig. 4b). Thus, the observed HER2 trimer interac￾tions are related to EGFR dimer interactions by a
shift of a protomer within an EGFR-like dimer
rotated about a point near Phe257 by 60°. The
observed crystallographic trimer orients domain IV
of each protomer in the same direction, as would be
expected on the cell surface (Fig. 4a).
SAXS analysis of the HER2/Fab37 complex
To help judge the relevance of the trimeric
arrangement of HER2/Fab37 complexes observed
in the crystal lattice, we performed SAXS analysis,
which provides information about the size and
overall shape of macromolecules in solution.15,16
The sample conditions used for the SAXS experi￾ments were very similar to those of solutions that
produced crystals, including similar sample buffer
and protein concentration. Guinier approximation
of the radius of gyration (Rg) of six acceptable
experimental scattering curves yielded an average
Rg value of 46 ± 3 Å. The back-calculated Rg
values for the simple HER2/Fab37 complex and
the crystallographic trimeric arrangement using
CRYSOL17 are 42 and 61 Å, respectively, clearly
showing that Fab37 and HER2 form a 1:1 complex in
solution without higher-order oligomeric states. In
agreement, an optimized fit of a calculated intensity
curve of the 1:1 HER2/Fab37 complex to the
averaged experimental curve produced a low χ
2
value of 2.1. Conversion of an averaged intensity
curve to a distance distribution function allowed
determination of a molecular envelope, the calcula￾tion of which presumed, based on the Rg result, a
simple 1:1 HER2/Fab37 complex (Fig. 4c). Super￾position of the envelope with the 1:1 complex from
the crystallographic asymmetric unit produced a
normalized spatial discrepancy (NSD) of 1.2 Å.
Overall, the SAXS data show that HER2 and Fab37
form a 1:1 complex and that there are no high-order
oligomers present under the experimental condi￾tions used in these solution experiments.
Tests for functional effects of mutations in the
HER2 trimer interface
The structure of the HER2/Fab37 complex sug￾gested that Fab37 is unlikely to interfere with the
formation of HER2 homodimers and heterodimers
with other ErbB family members. Consistent with
this, we found that Fab37 does not inhibit transphos￾phorylation of HER3 (Fig. 5a). To investigate
whether the HER3 trimer observed in the crystal
structure had biological relevance, we used cell￾based assays to test the effects of mutations designed
to disrupt the putative trimer. The HER2/Fab37
X-ray structure was inspected for HER2–HER2
contact surfaces that could be altered to disfavor
trimer formation. In order to allow assignment of
any functional effect to mutation-derived influences
on trimer formation, we restricted changes to
residues that could not reasonably be considered
potential contact residues in an EGFR-like dimer.
HER2 residues 154 to 159 (NNQLAL) form a short
helical segment in domain I and contact the top of
domain II from the neighboring copy of HER2. Two
quadruple mutants of HER2 [N154Y/N155R/
A158E/L159Y (HER2-YRQLEY) and N154Y/
N155R/A158Y/L159Y (HER2-YRQLYY)] were
designed to preserve the short helix but to project
large side chains into the symmetry-related neigh￾boring HER2, creating an untenable steric clash
(Fig. 5c). These mutants were expressed in MCF10A
cells, which express endogenous HER3. Upon
addition of the HER3 ligand heregulin (HRG), the

subsequently activate downstream signaling mole￾Fig. 3. Crystal packing of HER2/Fab37 in space group

shown in Fig. 5b, wild-type (WT) HER2 and both
HER2 mutants had equivalent effects on phosphor￾ylation of HER3 and AKT, suggesting that these
mutant HER2 proteins remain fully functional to
activate HER3 signaling.
Mutational analysis of Fab37
To test how Trp/Ser residues in the Fab37
paratope contribute to HER2 binding, we utilized
a phage display quantitative saturation (QS) scan￾ning method to analyze the ability of all 20 amino
Fig. 4. The HER2 trimer. (a) HER2 ECDs (purple, gray, and tan semi-transparent surfaces) are arranged around a 3-
fold symmetry axis and are in intimate contact, burying a total of 8400 Å2 of surface area. Fab37 is shown as dark blue/
light blue surfaces. The “dimerization” arm of HER2s is shown as a dark worm that reaches into the neighboring HER2
(left). This arm is incompletely traced due to disorder. The long axis of HER2 is parallel with the 3-fold axis (right). (b)
Relatedness of HER2/HER2 and EGFR/EGFR interactions via the domain II dimerization arms. HER2 (left) in the trimer
has Phe257 at a spot in a neighboring HER2 that is analogous to where EGFR has Tyr251 in the dimer-related neighboring
EGFR. The reference molecules shown as surfaces are oriented similarly. The 120° relation between HER2 ECDs in the
trimer brings more of HER2 domain II into this view than then 180° relation in the EGFR dimer. (c) Correspondence of the
HER2/Fab37 1:1 complex (colored as in Fig. 2a) with the ab initio molecular envelope from SAXS studies (black spheres).
HER2 domain IV lies outside the SAXS envelope, perhaps caused by a relatively high level of flexibility between domains
III and IV as seen among X-ray structures of ErbB-family extracellular regions. (d) Observed (red) and calculated (black)
SAXS scattering curves, after scaling. The calculated curve was produced using the simple 1:1 HER2/Fab37 complex.
222 HER2/Fab37 Complex Structureacids to function at each randomized CDR
position.18 Phage display libraries were designed
such that each library covered one of the four
paratope CDRs and randomized Trp and Ser
residues with all 20 amino acids. Each library was
separately cycled through functional binding selec￾tions against HER2 and display/control selections
against Protein A. The normalized fraction of amino
acids occurring at each randomized position was
used to calculate, first, the transformed Shannon
entropy (TH), which measures the degree of
randomness at each CDR position, and, second,
the specificity index (SI), which provides a measure
of the additional constraints applied to a CDR
position for antigen binding (see also Materials and
Methods). Data are presented in Supplemental Fig.
S2 and represented graphically as sequence logos in
Fig. 6a.
SI values derived from the QS scanning experi￾ments are generally highest for heavy-chain Trp
residues, indicating strong preferences for specific
amino acids at these positions, suggesting that these
residues are most important for HER2 binding.
These results are consistent with Trp generally
having a role as a residue that can make direct
antigen contacts through its large hydrophobic
surface, as opposed to contributing to conforma￾tional diversity in CDR loops. Interestingly, while
Fig. 5. Tests for function of Fab37 and HER2 mutants. (a) Fab37 has no effect on ligand-dependent transpho￾sphorylation of HER3. Serum-starved MCF-7 cells were pre-incubated with excess amounts of the intact antibody with
Fab37 (1 μM), pertuzumab (0.5 μM), or RPMI media alone for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated with 2 nM HRG for 10 min as
indicated and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting. (b) HER2 trimer interface mutations do not affect ligand￾dependent transphosphorylation of HER3 or HER2 autophosphorylation. MCF-10A cells stably expressing HER2 WT, the
trimer mutants HER2-YRQLEY and HER2-YRQLYY, or vector-transfected cells were stimulated with 10 nM HRG for
10 min as indicated. Top panel: Cell lysates were immunoblotted to detect indicated proteins. Lower panel:
Immunoprecipitation of HER2-expressing cells. Immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-HER2 antibody and
immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting. (c) Residues chosen for mutation form an intermolecular contact
uniquely found in the HER2 trimer. The four residues subject to mutation (purple sticks) are in close proximity to a
neighboring HER2 (tan, with disulfide links shown as sticks). The different amino acid side chains introduced by
mutation were intended to create an untenable steric clash between the purple and tan copies of HER2. The sites of
mutation are far from the neighboring molecule in an EGFR-like dimer.
HER2/Fab37 Complex Structure 223Trp was replaced at specific positions, it was often
replaced by the other large hydrophobic residues
Phe or Tyr (e.g., CDR-L3 Trp91Phe and Trp94Tyr,
CDR-H1 Trp31Phe, CDR-H2 Trp56Tyr, and CDR￾H3 Trp96Phe). The exception to this was substitu￾tion of CDR-H1 Trp30 by Lys or Arg, where a
positive charge could enhance binding by establish￾ing electrostatic interactions between Fab37 and
HER2, possibly by using Glu379 on HER2 (see also
below). CDR-H1 Trp30 also sits at the periphery of
the Fab37 paratope, is less extensively buried than
other residues (Fig. 6b), and is found in at least two
distinct conformations, suggesting that the Trp is
suboptimal at this position.
In contrast to the Fab37 Trp positions, the Ser
residues were generally more readily substituted,
and therefore had a lower SI value (Fig. 6a and
Supplemental Fig. S2). When substitutions did
occur, Ser was often replaced by Gly or Ala, and
in the case of CDR-H2 Ser50, Gly was strongly
preferred over Ser. The small side chains of Ser resi￾dues make them better able than Trp to permit con￾formational diversity in CDR loops. Surprisingly,
two Ser residues, CDR-H1 Ser32 and CDR-H2
Ser52, were preferentially replaced by Tyr residues,
suggesting that new contacts to HER2 could be
established at these positions. In fact, CDR-H2
Ser52 loses only 20% of its surface to HER2 in the
complex, suggesting that room exists for the Tyr
substitution at this position.
The phage selection system employed here should,
in principle, select clones that either maintain or
improve the affinity of WT Fab37, allowing us to test
the effect of mutations discovered in the QS scanning
experiments above. To test affinities of Fab37
variants, we generated selected point mutants in
purified Fab proteins, and kinetics for HER2 binding
were characterized by surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) (Table 2). Trp positions that showed substitu￾tion by Phe or Tyr maintained the affinity of WT
Fab37 (Kd ∼0.8 nM), while both CDR-H1 Trp30Lys
and Trp30Arg increased the affinity of Fab37 for
HER2 ∼3- to 4-fold, supporting the hypothesis that a
new electrostatic interaction may enhance the Fab37-
HER2 affinity. Ser positions substituted by Ala or
Gly conformational residues, such as CDR-H1
Ser32Ala, maintained the Fab37 affinity for HER2
or slightly decreased the affinity, as in CDR-H2
Ser50Gly. As noted above, CDR-H1 Ser32 and CDR￾H2 Ser52 were both substituted by Tyr. Consistent
with our hypothesis that Tyr substitution could
generate new HER2 contacts to increase the binding
affinity, the CDR-H2 Ser52Tyr mutant Kd is ∼4-fold
better than that of WT Fab37, but CDR-H1 Ser32Tyr

Discussion
The HER2/Fab37 structure and mutagenesis
results presented here provide a detailed look at the
interface of the binary Trp/Ser diversity of the Fab37
paratope. The structure of Fab37 is the first structure
of a synthetic antibody with a Trp/Ser paratope and
the first structure of an antibody derived from binary
diversity beyond previous structures of antibodies
built on Tyr/Ser diversity. We have previously
shown that synthetic antibodies and other protein
scaffolds can utilize restricted amino acid diversity to
recognize antigens with high specificity and
affinity,19 and we have performed extensive analysis
of antibodies derived from CDR repertoires employ￾ing a minimal Tyr/Ser diversity.2,20–23 These struc￾tures highlighted the role of Tyr in establishing direct
contacts to the antigen and the role of Ser in allowing
conformational diversity in the CDR loops. We have
now shown that Trp/Ser binary diversity in Fab37
can function in a similar manner, with Trp residues
providing the primary contacts to HER2 and Ser
residues acting as conformational residues. Addition￾ally, we established the ability of all other amino acids
to substitute for Trp or Ser and so determined the
extent to which the restricted diversity was, in effect,
limiting the discovery of a higher-affinity paratope.
Mutational analysis showed that substitutions at
Trp and Ser positions in Fab37 were relatively
conservative, with Trp residues generally being
replaced by similarly large, hydrophobic residues
(e.g., Tyr and Phe), while similarly small, conforma￾tional residues replaced Ser. The exceptions to these
trends, as noted above, appear to generate new
contacts to HER2. These results suggest not only that
the Fab37 Trp/Ser paratope selected a compatible
HER2 epitope, as expected, but also that the Trp-rich
surface of Fab37 is set and cannot generally be
altered except by similarly shaped residues. Future
designs of synthetic antibody libraries could incor￾porate these characteristics into the CDR repertoire
by combining various conformational residues (Gly,
Ala, and Ser) with limited contact residues (e.g., Tyr,
Trp, and Phe) to enhance antigen interactions
through increased conformational diversity in the
context of limited chemical diversity.
The unusual arrangement of HER2 receptors in
our X-ray structure led us to inquiries regarding its
relevance to a biological context. Many cell surface
receptors form associations when bound by extra￾cellular ligands, resulting in changes to the receptor
intracellular domains that trigger downstream
signaling events. Structural and biochemical studies
of diverse classes of receptors have shown that a
common response to ligand binding is receptor
oligomerization. For instance, tumor necrosis factor
receptor forms a homotrimer through ECD interac￾tions upon binding the trimeric tumor necrosis
factor ligand.24 Structural studies of RTK ECDs
(e.g., EGFR and VEGFR2) have shown that a
common response to ligand binding is receptor
dimerization.13,25,26 The detailed molecular view
revealed by crystallographic analyses of stoichio￾metric RTK/ligand complexes contrasts with the far
less precise information available for high-order
oligomers (e.g., Ephrin receptors27) and for RTKs in
membrane microdomains.28,29
Within the ErbB family, crystallographic analysis
has shown that the EGFR ECD adopts a ligand￾stabilized conformation that allows purely EGFR￾mediated interactions across a homodimeric inter￾face.30 Sequence and structural homology among
ErbB family members suggests that analogous
arrangements exist among known heterodimeric
combinations, including EGFR/HER3 and HER2/
HER3,31 but crystallographic analysis of such
arrangements has proven elusive. Among arrange￾ments lacking structural information, the HER2/
HER2 homodimer is of particular interest, because
this putative arrangement has been implicated in the
association of HER2 overexpression with aggressive
breast and other human cancers.32–34
The dearth of structural reports for dimers of ErbB
family ECDs other than EGFR suggests a limit to the
ErbB dimerization paradigm. Indeed, there have
been reports of high-order oligomers of both HER335
and HER436 ECDs in solution and of heterotrimers of
HER2, HER3, and the IGF-1 receptor in cell
membranes.37 In addition, because HER3 has long
been considered to lack an active kinase domain
based on key sequence defects, no simple hetero￾dimeric model could explain the phosphorylation
(presumed to be in trans) of HER2 intracellular
residues seen in engineered cells expressing only
HER2 and HER3.38 Shi et al. have recently shown
weak HER3 kinase activity for intracellular domains
aggregated on synthetic vesicles,39 but the relevance
of this result to intact HER3 receptors in cell
membranes is not certain.
For these reasons, we sought evidence that the
HER2 trimers we observe are something other than
an artifact of the crystalline state. We found that each
of the three ECDs direct their domain IV in the same
direction, as they might on a cell surface. Their
contacts with each other are large, of a mixed polar/
non-polar character and not mediated directly by
Fab37. However, our solution experiments using
SAXS reveal only simple 1:1 HER2/Fab37 complexes
in the crystallization buffer, and mutations of HER2
designed to disfavor the trimeric arrangement had
no discernable effect in cellular assays. Additionally,
no other solution measurement35,36 or single
HER2/Fab37 Complex Structure 225crystal5,10,11 containing the HER2 ECD has shown
strong evidence for dimers or higher-order oligo￾meric species. In their recent analysis of the close
HER2 homologue from Drosophila, Alvarado et al.
have proposed that a specific conformational ar￾rangement among the small cysteine-rich “modules”
in domain II is required for receptor signaling.12 To
the extent that this proposal applies to human HER2,
the trimer characterized herein is in a non-signaling
state. Taken together, these observations argue
against biological relevance for the trimer.
Materials and Methods
HER2/Fab37 crystal structure determination
The isolation of Fab37 is described in Birtalan et al.3 in
which it is referred to as “Fab-H-WS”. Fab37 was
expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Protein G
affinity followed by SP Sepharose cation exchange
chromatography. Human HER2 ECD (residues 1–624)
was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified
by affinity chromatography using HERCEPTIN® linked to
controlled pore glass beads, diethylaminoethyl anion
exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography, as previ￾ously described.6 The complex between Fab37 and HER2
ECD was purified by size-exclusion chromatography and
formed plate-like crystals during 1.5 months in sitting
drops using equal parts of protein at 10 mg/mL in 0.15 M
NaCl, 0.1 M Mops, pH 7.3, and reservoir [1.8 M Na/K
(H2PO4) and 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5]. Crystals were treated
briefly with 2 M LiSO4 prior to preservation by immersion
in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data extending to 3.2 Å
resolution were collected at 110 K in a hexagonal lattice at
beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). Data
reduction40 revealed the space group to be P6322. The
structure was solved by molecular replacement41 using a
previously obtained isomorphous 4.5-Å data set (ALS
beamline 5.0.1) and employing as probe structures the
domains I–III HER2 fragment from the HER2/pertuzu￾mab complex [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 1S78] and a
Fab with high level of homology to trastuzumab (PDB ID:
1FVD). It was necessary to truncate some loops in the
probe structures to pursue a solution with high Z-scores
but untenable intermolecular contacts. No molecular
replacement calculation offered support for more than
one complex in the asymmetric unit, and the final
structure occupies only 21% of the crystal volume. Large
voids ∼100 Å in diameter are present. The final model was
informed by the much higher-resolution structure of
Fab37 alone (1.8 Å, data not shown).
The structure was refined using REFMAC542 and
electron density was inspected and models were manually
altered using Xfit.43 The use of TLS refinement had a large
beneficial effect on the R values of the HER2/Fab37
complex (∼6% on Rfree), and several clear features in the
electron density maps were assigned as sulfate ions based
on their environment. The final models reflect adjustments
suggested using PROCHECK44 and WHATCHECK.45
Representative electron density from the HER2/Fab37
structure appears in Fig. 7.
HER2/Fab37 SAXS
SAXS data were collected from HER2/Fab37 and
corresponding buffer-only solutions at beamline 4-2 at
the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL).
Experiments were conducted with 1.24 Å wavelength
X-rays, a Rayonix 225 ccd detector, and sample-to-detector
distance permitting collection of data up to s= 0.49 Å−1
(s= 4πsinθ/λ, where the scattering angle is 2θ and λ is the
X-ray wavelength). Ten successive exposures were collect￾ed for either 2 or 5 s each for corresponding buffer or
buffer +HER2/Fab37 samples held in a quartz capillary
tube at room temperature. HER2/Fab37 sample concen￾trations between 0.7 and 5 mg/mL were employed to test
for concentration effects. The samples with protein
concentration 5 mg/mL contained the same components
at the same concentrations as were present in hanging
drops that led to crystallizations (see above), except that
we found a greater number of the 10 exposures met
similarity criteria when 1 mM oxidized glutathione was
present in the samples as a radical scavenger. Scattering
data from a single sample were averaged azimuthally,
scaled, buffer subtracted, tested for evidence of radiation￾induced aggregation, and averaged using the program
SasTool.46 Radii of gyration (Rg) were determined by the
Guinier approximation in the low-angle region. For ab
initio molecular envelope calculations, a single scattering
curve was constructed by averaging the scaled curves from
two experiments with HER2/Fab37 concentrations of 5
and 4 mg/mL, the principal effect of which was improving
the curve at very low Q. The apparent maximum particle
dimension Dmax and a distance distribution function p(R)
were determined with the program GNOM.47 The GNOM￾derived Dmax of 140 Å was marginally smaller than the
150 Å evident in atomic coordinates from the crystal
structure. Low-resolution envelopes of the simple HER2/
Fab37 complex were produced in 15 runs of the program
GASBOR48 using direct fitting of the reciprocal space
scattering profile. These calculations were initiated using
our expectations that 1050 amino acids would form a
prolate envelope and employed data up to s= 0.245.
Program DAMAVER49 was used to align and average
the 15 envelopes, and reported NSD values that averaged
Fig. 7. Representative 2Fo−Fc electron density at the
end of refinement, contoured at 1 SD. HER2 is tan, Fab37

alignment between the averaged envelope and the
atomic coordinates from the crystal structure, yielding
NSD = 1.2 Å. The program CRYSOL17 was used to
optimize the fit between the experimental scattering
curve and the curve calculated from the atomic model,
yielding a χ2 value of 2.1, experimental Rg of 44.6 Å, and
Rg for the atomic model of 42.7 Å.
Fab37 QS scanning mutagenesis
The QS scanning phage libraries were designed by
using three oligonucleotides that each encoded one of
three Fab37 CDRs and a fourth oligonucleotide for
mutating the fourth CDR that contained NNK degenerate
codons to allow for all 20 amino acids at each Trp or Ser
position. Additional limited randomization was allowed
at buried CDR positions in CDR-H3, as has been utilized
previously.20 CDR-H1 and CDR-H3 were mutated by a
single oligonucleotide, while CDR-L3 and CDR-H2 were
mutated by two oligonucleotides to create two libraries for
each of these CDRs in order to increase the diversity of
clones recovered during sorting. The following oligonu￾cleotides were used for NNK mutagenesis:
L3-1 [ACTTATTACTGTCAGCAANNKTGGNNKTGG￾CCGNNKACGTTCGGACAGGGTACC],
L3-2 [ACTTATTACTGTCAGCAATGGNNKTGGNN￾KCCGAGCACGTTCGGACAGGGTACC],
H1 [TGTGCAGCTTCTGGCTTCNNKATTNNKNNK￾NNKNNKATTCACTGGGTGCGTCAGGCCCCG],
H2-1 [GGCCTGGAATGGGTTGCANNKATTAGCCC￾GNNKAGCGGCNNKACCAGCTATGCCGATAG￾CGTCAAG],
H2-2 [GGCCTGGAATGGGTTGCAAGCATTNNKCC￾GAGCNNKGGCTGGACCNNKTATGCCGATAG￾CGTCAAG],
and H3 [GTCTATTATTGTGCTCGCNNKNNKNNK￾NNKGSTWTKGACTACTGGGGTCAAGGA].
Phage libraries representing diversity at each CDR were
sorted against HER2 and Protein A and analyzed
independently. Sequence data from each selection were
analyzed by calculating the normalized fraction of each
amino acid type at each CDR position for selections
against both antigens.51 The transformed Shannon entro￾py (TH) and SI were calculated as previously described,18
where SI=THProtein A −THHER2. The normalized amino
acid fraction at each Trp or Ser CDR position was plotted
graphically as a sequence logo.52
Protein purification and SPR binding kinetics
measurement
Fab37 mutants were generated by standard oligonucle￾otide-directed PCR mutagenesis. Mutant proteins were
expressed from the phage display phagemid engineered
with a stop codon between the Fab and pIII proteins. Fab
proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as
previously described.20 The binding affinities and kinetic
parameters for interactions between Fab37 variants and
HER2 were measured by SPR using a BIACORE3000
instrument. HER2 was immobilized on a CM5 chip by
standard amine coupling chemistry and serial dilutions of
Fab37 in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.01%
Tween were injected over the HER2 or blank surface (for
reference subtraction) for 2 min at a flow rate of 30 μL/
min, followed by 10 min of monitoring Fab dissociation.
The chip surface was regenerated with 10 mM glycine,
pH 1.7, prior to a new HER2 injection. Kinetic parameters
were determined by globally fitting a reference cell￾subtracted concentration series to a 1:1 binding model.
Expression constructs, stable cell lines,
and cell culture
Full-length HER2 and HER2 mutants were subcloned
into the PLPCX retroviral vector (BD Biosciences). The
retroviral constructs were transfected into the Phoenix
amphotropic packaging cell line using Lipofectamine Plus
reagent according to the recommendation of the manu￾facturer (Invitrogen). Viral particles were harvested 48 h
after transfection and MCF10A cells were infected. Cell
pools expressing HER2 or HER2 mutants were selected
using puromycin. MCF10A cells and derivatives were
grown in Mammary Epithelial Cell Basal Medium
(Cambrex) containing 5% horse serum, 100 ng/mL
cholera enterotoxin, and growth supplements.
Western blot and immunoprecipitation
MCF10A cells were plated in 24-well plates. Following
serum starvation, cells were stimulated with 10 nM HRG
at room temperature for 10 min, the supernatant aspirated
off, and cells were immediately lysed in Laemmli sample
buffer (Bio-Rad).
For immunoprecipitation experiments following serum
starvation, cells were stimulated with 10 nM HRG at
room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis in RIPA buffer
and protein concentrations were determined by bicincho￾ninic acid assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was per￾formed with equal amounts of protein and anti-HER2
antibody (Dako). Immunocomplexes were purified by
absorption on protein A/G beads (Pierce) and samples
were analyzed by Western blotting. Western blots were
probed with anti-pHER3 (Cell Signaling Technology),
anti-pAKT (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-HER2 (Neo￾marker), anti-HER3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti￾tubulin (Sigma), and anti-pTyr (Calbiochem).
