Background: BLIP-II is a potent inhibitor of class A -lactamases.
Results: BLIP-II residues contributing to binding are near the center of interface and influence off rates for inhibition.
Conclusion: BLIP-II uses common core residues to bind to several class A -lactamases.
Significance: BLIP-II -lactamase interaction domains could lead to -lactamase inhibitors.
The interactions between -lactamase inhibitory proteins
(BLIPs) and -lactamases have been used as model systems to
understand the principles of affinity and specificity in protein￾protein interactions. The most extensively studied tight binding
inhibitor, BLIP, has been characterized with respect to amino
acid determinants of affinity and specificity for binding -lacta￾mases. BLIP-II, however, shares no sequence or structural
homology to BLIP and is a femtomolar to picomolar potency
inhibitor, and the amino acid determinants of binding affinity
and specificity are unknown. In this study, alanine scanning
mutagenesis was used in combination with determinations of on
and off rates for each mutant to define the contribution of resi￾dues on the BLIP-II binding surface to both affinity and speci￾ficity toward four -lactamases of diverse sequence. The resi￾dues making the largest contribution to binding energy are
heavily biased toward aromatic amino acids near the center of
the binding surface. In addition, substitutions that reduce bind￾ing energy do so by increasing off rates without impacting on
rates. Also, residues with large contributions to binding energy
generally exhibit low temperature factors in the structures of
complexes. Finally, with the exception of D206A, BLIP-II ala￾nine substitutions exhibit a similar trend of effect for all -lac￾tamases, i.e., a substitution that reduces affinity for one -lacta￾mase usually reduces affinity for all -lactamases tested.
Cellular processes function through specific pathways that
are mediated by protein-protein interactions. Therefore,
understanding of the principles of binding specificity and affin￾ity are essential to manipulate these interfaces to create diag￾nostics and disease treatments (1–3). Alanine scanning
mutagenesis is a common approach to uncover the “hot spots”
and specificity determinants of binding interfaces (4– 6). Hot
spots are interface residues that, when substituted with alanine,
result in at least a 2.0 kcal/mol loss in binding energy as deter￾mined from the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) (4, 7, 8).
In addition, contact residues have also been identified as spec￾ificity determinants if the substitution of the residue changes
the binding affinity for one binding partner relative to another
(8, 9). The relationship between specificity and affinity is an
active area of research and requires model systems, such as the
human growth hormone-receptor, barnase-barstar, and BLIP-
-lactamase, to provide insights (4, 5, 10, 11).
-Lactamases are bacterial enzymes that provide resistance
to -lactam antibiotics, i.e., penicillins and cephalosporins, and
constitute a major clinical threat (12). There are four classes of
-lactamases (classes A–D) with class A -lactamases being the
most prevalent among clinically relevant bacteria (12). The rep￾resentative class A -lactamases used in this study include the
TEM-1, Bla1, KPC-2, and CTX-M-14 enzymes (13, 14). These
enzymes share the same overall structure but have limited
amino acid sequence identity (30–50%) and exhibit signifi￾cantly different -lactam substrate hydrolysis profiles (Fig. 1A).
-Lactamase inhibitory proteins (BLIPs),2 including BLIP
and BLIP-II, are inhibitors of class A -lactamases and are pro￾duced from the soil bacterium Streptomyces (15–18). BLIP
inhibits class A -lactamases with a wide range of affinities
(subnanomolar to micromolar) and has been the focus of many
structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic investigations (8, 11,
19–23). However, the interactions between BLIP-II and class A
enzymes are relatively poorly understood. BLIP-II exhibits no
sequence or structural homology to BLIP but rather has a sev￾en-bladed -propeller fold, which is a common domain that
typically functions as a scaffold or protein-protein interaction
adaptor (Fig. 1B) (24–26). Despite the lack of sequence and
structure homology, both BLIP-II and BLIP bind to a loop-helix
region common to all class A -lactamases (Fig. 1B) (20, 27).
BLIP-II utilizes the numerous -turns of the seven-bladed
-propeller structure to bind the loop-helix region and to steri￾cally block the -lactamase active site (27, 28).
BLIP-II is a more potent tightly binding inhibitor of -lacta￾mases than BLIP, withKi values in the femtomolar to picomolar

exhibits a much narrower range of binding affinity for -lacta￾mases (range of 2 orders of magnitude) when compared with
BLIP (range of 6 orders of magnitude) (8, 27, 29). Pre-steady
state kinetic experiments demonstrated that association rate
constants for BLIP-II and BLIP binding to TEM-1 -lactamase
are similar to each other and to most protein-protein interac￾tions, but it is the exceptionally slow dissociation rate constants
of BLIP-II that make it one of the tightest protein-protein inter￾actions known (27). This slow dissociation rate is not associated
with significant changes to the structure of BLIP-II as shown by
crystal structures of BLIP-II monomer and in complex with
-lactamase (27). However, the binding contributions of the
individual BLIP-II contact residues to affinity and specificity of
binding to class A -lactamases remain largely unknown (8, 11,
22, 30, 33).
In this study, alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to
examine the functional contribution of the individual BLIP-II
residues at the binding interface with class A -lactamases.
Because of the tightly binding inhibition of the BLIP-II--lac￾tamase interactions, kinetic analysis was used to measure the
association and dissociation rate constants for wild-type and
each alanine mutant to calculate the Kd. This approach allowed
for a detailed examination of the contributions to binding
kinetics of each residue to a collection of four diverse
-lactamases.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Construction of Alanine Mutants—The BLIP-II residues cho￾sen for alanine substitutions were based on the previously per￾formed cluster analysis of the BLIP-II-TEM-1 and BLIP-II-Bla1
interfaces (27). The BLIP-II interface residues were mutated to
alanine by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange
method (Stratagene). The Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene)
was used to replicate the pET-BLIP-II plasmid to introduce the
desired point mutations. The DpnI restriction enzyme was then
added to the solution to remove the parental strands. The prod￾uct of the QuikChange reaction was introduced into XL-1 Blue
Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene) by electroporation. DNA
sequencing was used to confirm the presence of the designed
mutations and to ensure that no extraneous mutations were
present in the BLIP-II gene (Lonestar Labs).
Protein Purification—The BLIP-II wild-type and alanine￾substituted proteins were purified as previously described (27,
29). In short, the BLIP-II variants were purified using Talon
metal affinity resin (Clontech) using a C-terminal His6 tag. The
class A -lactamases used in the study were purified as previ￾ously described (14, 27, 29, 35). The protein concentration of
-lactamases and BLIP-II were determined by a Bradford assay,
the results of which were compared with a -lactamase stand￾ard curve calibrated by quantitative amino acid analysis. In
addition, the concentrations of BLIP-II variant proteins were
also determined using 280-nm UV absorbance using an extinc￾tion coefficient of 66,920 M1 cm1 for the wild-type, N50A,
D52A, T57A, F74A, L91A, N112A, D131A, D167A, S169A,
D170A, D206A, F209A, I229A, F230A, E268A, R286A, and
N304A variant proteins; an extinction coefficient of 61,420 M1
cm1 for the W53A, W152A, and W269A variant proteins; and
an extinction coefficient of 65,430 M1 cm1 for the Y73A,
Y113A, Y191A, Y208A, and Y248A variant proteins. Both
methods (Bradford and UV absorbance) gave highly similar
results (within 5%).
Enzymatic Determination of the Association Rate Constants—
The association rate constants (kon) were determined using an
enzymatic activity assay that has been described previously

alignment of the loop-helix region (residues 99 –114 based on the -lactamase ambler numbering scheme) is shown (13). The sequence alignment was
performed, and the identities were determined using ClustalW (34). The amino acid identity was determined when compared with TEM-1. However, all of the
-lactamases used in this study are not more than 52% identical to one another. B, the BLIP-II-TEM-1 (red; Protein Data Bank code 1JTD) and BLIP-II-Bla1 (cyan; Protein

for all experiments except the KPC-2-BLIP-II association
experiment, where it was added at a concentration of 0.03
mg/ml to reduce background. Aliquots (0.3 ml) were taken
along the time course to measure the initial velocities of nitro￾cefin hydrolysis observed at optical density 482 nm. The initial
velocities were used as readouts of free enzyme with the time 0
point being the maximum initial rate without BLIP-II addition.
Nitrocefin was added at a concentration that yielded the max￾imum initial velocity of each enzyme. The nitrocefin concen￾trations in these experiments were 400, 200, 200, and 200 M
for TEM-1, Bla1, KPC-2, and CTX-M-14, respectively. The Km
values of TEM-1, Bla1, KPC-2, and CTX-M-14 are 84, 19, 52,
and 25 M, respectively (14, 36–38). The -lactamase concen￾trations were 0.5, 5, 1, and 1 nM for TEM-1, Bla1, KPC-2, and
CTX-M-14, respectively. The BLIP-II concentration used was
3-fold higher than the -lactamase concentration, allowing for
the association rate constants to be determined by second order
kinetics. We previously demonstrated that the association rate
constants can be determined with different BLIP-II--lacta￾mase ratios and different curve fittings to either pseudo-first
versussecond order kinetics with minimal differences (27). The
difference between processing the data by pseudo-first or sec￾ond order kinetics was small, but the errors for curve fitting
were slightly better when the association rate constants were
determined by second order kinetics. Therefore, the inhibition
of -lactamase activity over a time course was fitted to the fol￾lowing second order kinetic equation,

concentration in the reaction, C is a fitting constant represent￾ing the background rate of nitrocefin hydrolysis, t is the time

interaction that is extrapolated from the data fitting. The back￾ground rate of nitrocefin hydrolysis was 10% of the total
-lactamase activity measured for each BLIP-II--lactamase
pair.
For a few BLIP-II--lactamase variant combinations, com￾plete inhibition was not observed because the BLIP-II substitu￾tion weakened the affinity to -lactamase to the point that the
equilibrium between the various components, BLIP-II--lacta￾mase complex, free -lactamase, and free BLIP-II, was reached.
In these situations, the rate constants were determined by fit￾ting the inhibition of -lactamase activity over a time course
to the following bimolecular binding differential equation
accounting for a second order association and first order
dissociation,

and of bound BLIP-II/-lactamase complex at time (t), respec￾tively. [E]t was experimentally determined as described above.
[B]t and [E/B]t were then calculated based on known total con￾centrations of BLIP-II and -lactamase proteins. The analytical
solution (Equation 3) was derived using Maple 12 software
(Maplesoft, Waterloo, Canada). Numerical fitting of the solu￾tion to the differential equation (Equation 3) yielded the kon and

are determined by fitting Equation 3 to the data. The data pro￾cessing was carried out using an Excel spreadsheet and the fit￾ting of Equation 3 to the data utilizing the solver add-in of the
Excel program. The experiments to determine the association
rate constant were repeated in at least triplicate. The replicate
experiments, however, did not utilize the exact same time
points, and therefore all of the data sets were used to obtain
the rate constant with an associated standard error, which was
always less than 20%, through nonlinear regression.
Enzymatic Determination of the Dissociation Rate Constants—
The dissociation rate constants were determined as previously
described (27). The very slow dissociation rate constants (koff)
were determined by measuring the recovery of the wild-type
-lactamase activity in the presence of an excess of an inac￾tive TEM-1 variant (E166A) (27). This mutation prevents the
deacylation step of the catalytic mechanism rendering the
enzyme essentially inactive after one round of acylation. This
allows for the mutant enzyme to remain in large excess and
available to bind BLIP-II upon its dissociation from the wild￾type -lactamase being tested and also allows the amount of
free, wild-type -lactamase generated upon dissociation from
BLIP-II to be measured by monitoring nitrocefin hydrolysis.
We have shown previously that the TEM-1 Glu-166 residue is
not at the binding interface with BLIP-II and that the E166A
substitution does not affect binding affinity for BLIP-II as indi￾cated by stopped flow tryptophan fluorescent spectrometric
measurements (27). Therefore, the TEM-1 E166A enzyme
binds tightly and sequesters BLIP-II to prevent the rebinding of

were then diluted into the 200 molar excess of TEM-1 E166A
solution. The dissociation reaction was monitored by mea￾suring initial velocities of nitrocefin hydrolysis at various time
points to determine the amount of free wild-type enzyme. The
concentrations of nitrocefin used were the same as those for the
association rate experiments. The final enzyme concentrations
were 50, 2.5, 50, and 10 nM for KPC-2, TEM-1, Bla1, and CTX￾M-14, respectively. The buffer used in these experiments was
50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, supplemented with 1 mg/ml

Because of the long duration of the experiment, positive and
negative controls of the -lactamase being tested and the inac￾tive TEM-1 E166A alone, respectively, were used to assess the
stability of the -lactamases during the assay. The background
rate of nitrocefin hydrolysis, including the TEM-1 E166A back￾ground hydrolysis, was less than 10% of the total -lactamase
activity measured for each BLIP-II--lactamase pair. The
experiments to determine the dissociation rate constant were
repeated in at least triplicate. The replicate experiments, how￾ever, did not have the exact same time points, and therefore all
of the data sets were combined into a single data set to obtain
the rate constant with an associated standard error, which was
always less than 20%, through nonlinear regression.
RESULTS
Association Rate Constants—To examine the contributions
of BLIP-II interface residues for binding to -lactamase, wild￾type BLIP-II and 25 BLIP-II mutants were expressed and puri￾fied from E. coli. To date, crystal structures of BLIP-II bound to
TEM-1 and to Bla1 -lactamases have been determined (BLIP￾II-TEM-1 and BLIP-II-Bla1) (Fig. 1) (27, 28). Previously, we
used cluster analysis to computationally compare these inter￾faces (27, 40). The cluster analysis allowed for the identification
of BLIP-II residues that formed H-bonds, electrostatic interac￾tions, van der Waals contacts, and/or noncanonical interac￾tions (such as cation-) with -lactamase. Altogether, 26
BLIP-II residues were identified to contact either TEM-1
and/or Bla1. However, the analysis of only 25 BLIP-II mutants is
shown because the N51A BLIP-II mutant was unstable, and the
binding data obtained was not reproducible.
Because of the tightly binding nature of BLIP-II and -lacta￾mase, traditional equilibrium-based determination of the dis￾sociation constant (Kd) is not possible (27). Therefore, kinetic
experiments were used to determine the association rate (kon)
and dissociation rate (koff) constants to define the Kd of each
BLIP-II variant and thereby assess the effect of each alanine
substitution on binding toward each of the TEM-1, Bla1,
KPC-2, and CTX-M-14 -lactamases tested.
Association rate constants were determined for wild-type
BLIP-II and 25 BLIP-II alanine mutants toward all four -lac￾tamases. This experiment was performed by following -lacta￾mase hydrolytic activity toward a chromogenic -lactam sub￾strate (nitrocefin) over a time course after the addition of 3-fold
excess BLIP-II. These reactions were treated as irreversible
under these conditions, and the data were fitted to the second
order rate equation allowing for the determination of the asso￾ciation rate constant for wild-type BLIP-II and each of the
BLIP-II variants toward these -lactamases (Fig. 2). Overall, the
BLIP-II alanine substitutions had a marginal effect on the asso￾ciation rate constants for binding to these -lactamases. All of
the alanine-substituted BLIP-II variants exhibited association
rates that were within 10-fold of wild-type BLIP-II and each
other for each -lactamase. The association rates of the BLIP-II
variants toward each -lactamase ranged from 2.1 to 13.7  106
M1 s
1 for TEM-1, from 0.8 to 2.4  106 M1 s
1 for Bla1, from
2.5 to 21.2  106 M1 s
1 for KPC-2, and from 1.7 to 6.7 
106 M1 s
1 for CTX-M-14 (Table 1).
Although the BLIP-II alanine substitutions do not greatly
affect the association rate constants, these experiments did pro￾vide an early indication as to which variants greatly reduced the
overall binding affinity. Some of the BLIP-II variants never
achieved complete, 100% inhibition of the -lactamase activity
including W53A, F74A, W152A, and W269A toward CTX￾M-14 and W269A toward TEM-1 and KPC-2. This indicates
that the alanine substitution raised the overall Kd of the inter￾action near the protein concentrations at which the assay was
performed. In these cases, as noted in Table 1, the association
rate constant was determined using the bimolecular binding
differential equation where the binding reaction is treated as
reversible and reaches the steady state.
Impact of Alanine Substitutions on BLIP-II Dissociation Rate
Constants and Kd—To examine the effects of the alanine sub￾stitutions on the dissociation rate constants and to determine
the overall Kd of these BLIP-II variant interactions, an enzy￾matic recovery assay was used to measure BLIP-II--lactamase
complex dissociation (27). The method involved first forming a
BLIP-II--lactamase complex and then diluting the complex in
a large excess of a deacylation deficient variant of TEM-1
(E166A) -lactamase (27). This TEM variant exhibits very low
levels of -lactam hydrolysis but still binds to BLIP-II with sim￾ilar affinity as wild-type TEM-1. These characteristics allow the
dissociation reaction to be followed by determining the activity
of the wild-type -lactamase because as BLIP-II dissociates
from the active -lactamase, it binds to the large excess of inac￾tive TEM -lactamase and therefore does not rebind to the
active enzyme. The data obtained were fit to the first order rate
equation to determine the dissociation rate constant (Fig. 3).
Kinetic Analysis of BLIP-II--Lactamase Alanine Scan Mutants
JUNE 14, 2013•VOLUME 288•NUMBER 24 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 17159
 at York University - OCUL on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from            Unlike the modest effects observed for the BLIP-II alanine
substitutions on the association rate constants toward the four
class A -lactamases, the variants exhibited dramatically
altered dissociation rate constants.Wild-type BLIP-II exhibited
similar (within a 10-fold range) dissociation rate constants for
the four -lactamases tested with values ranging from 0.6 
106 to 3.7  106 s
1
. However, when the alanine substitu￾tions were examined, the off rates changed by orders of magni￾tude depending on the residue position substituted (Table 1).
Therefore, it is the dissociation rate constants that were more
drastically affected by the alanine substitutions than the asso￾ciation rate constants. These dissociation rate constants (koff),
together with the association rate constants (kon), were used to
calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for each
BLIP-II alanine mutant and -lactamase combination. Taken
together, these values allowed for the determination of the
functional epitopes of BLIP-II binding to class A -lactamases.
A residue is considered a part of the functional epitope of
BLIP-II binding to -lactamase when the alanine substitution
results in a 	100-fold decrease in binding affinity as defined by
the calculated Kd values. By this definition, the functional
epitope for BLIP-II binding to TEM-1 consists of seven resi￾dues: Tyr-73, Trp-152, Tyr-191, Ile-229, Phe-230, Trp-269, and
Asn-304 (Fig. 4). Seven additional residues result in a 10–100-
fold decrease in binding affinity upon mutation (Table 2).
Eleven residues make up the functional epitope for BLIP-II
binding to Bla1 by resulting in a 	100-fold decrease in binding
affinity upon mutation. These residues include Trp-53, Tyr-73,

Trp-269, and Asn-304 (Fig. 4). Six additional residues result in a
10–100-fold decrease in binding affinity for Bla1 upon muta￾tion (Table 2). The functional epitope for BLIP-II binding to
CTX-M-14 consists of nine residues: Asp-52, Trp-53, Tyr-73,
Phe-74, Trp-152, Tyr-191, Ile-229, Trp-269, and Asn-304 (Fig.
4). Five additional residues result in a 10–100-fold decrease in
binding affinity for CTX-M-14 upon substitution (Table 2). In
contrast to the other -lactamases, the functional epitope for
BLIP-II binding to KPC-2 consists of only four residues: Trp￾53, Tyr-73, Phe-74, and Trp-269 (Fig. 4). Six additional residues
result in a 10–100-fold decrease in binding affinity for KPC-2
upon substitution (Table 2).
The results of the binding experiments identified several res￾idues that decrease the BLIP-II--lactamase affinity by 	100-
fold depending on which -lactamase was tested. The Y73A-,
F74A-, and W269A-substituted inhibitors, however, exhibited
a 	100-fold decrease in affinity for all four -lactamases tested,
and the W53A inhibitor displayed 	100-fold decreased affinity
for three of the four -lactamases tested. These BLIP-II resi￾dues are located near the center of the BLIP-II binding surface,
suggesting that this region provides the largest contribution to
binding energy (Fig. 4). This observation becomes more strik￾ing when the impact of the alanine substitutions on binding
energy is mapped onto the BLIP-II surface (Fig. 4).
Amino Acid Residue Determinants of Binding Specificity—A
specificity determinant is defined here as a residue that exhibits
significantly different effects on binding affinity for different
-lactamases upon mutation to alanine. A striking feature of
the comparison of binding affinities of BLIP-II alanine mutants
is the relative lack of large effects on binding specificity. Most
BLIP-II alanine substitutions exhibit a similar trend of effect for
all -lactamases, i.e., a substitution that reduces affinity for one
-lactamase usually reduces affinity for all -lactamases tested
(Fig. 5A). However, there are differences in the extent of reduc￾tions in affinity. For example, BLIP-II W53A exhibits a much
larger reduction in binding affinity relative to wild type for
binding to Bla1, KPC-2, and CTX-M-14 -lactamases than it
does for TEM-1 -lactamase (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the BLIP-II
N50A and D131A substitutions result in significant losses in
binding affinity for the TEM-1, Bla1, and CTX-M-14 enzymes
but have only a minimal effect on affinity for KPC-2 -lacta￾mase (Fig. 5A).
Two BLIP-II residue positions where alanine substitutions
did result in a switch in direction of affinity (i.e., the substitution
increased affinity for one enzyme while decreasing affinity for
another) are Asp-170 and Asp-206. The BLIP-II D206A substi￾tution had the most dramatic effect because it increased bind￾ing affinity for TEM-1 by 6-fold, had no significant effect on
binding affinity toward KPC-2 or CTX-M-14, but resulted in a

DISCUSSION
Although protein-protein interactions govern the majority
of the processes of the cell, the ability to manipulate these large
surfaces for disease treatment remains elusive (1, 41, 42). How￾ever, the concept that hot spots provide the majority of the
driving force for an interaction presents a more tractable prob￾lem (4, 7, 43). The alanine scanning approach taken here iden￾tified the hot spot residues for the interaction of BLIP-II with
four diverse class A -lactamases where the association rate
constants (kon) were only modestly affected in comparison with
the dissociation rate constants (koff).
The protein-protein association rate consists of a diffusion
step for the partners to form a transient complex followed by
rearrangement of the complex to the final state (44, 45). Protein
association reactions that occur extremely rapidly (108
–109
M1 s
1
), such as barnase-barstar, utilize long range comple￾mentary electrostatic interactions to orient the protein surfaces
relative to one another to speed up formation of the transient
complex (46). Most protein interactions have been estimated

–106 M1 s
1 (47, 48). The asso￾ciation rate constants for the BLIP-II--lactamase interactions
described in Table 1 are at the upper end of this range with
values ranging from 1.9 to 10.1  106 M1 s
1
. The observation
that alanine substitutions of BLIP-II residues do not greatly
alter the association rate is consistent with the idea that the
BLIP-II--lactamase interactions reflect basal or diffusion limit
range of association and do not make extensive use of long
range electrostatic steering interactions to orient the encounter
complex. This suggests that residue substitutions utilizing long
range electrostatic attraction could further improve the BLIP-II
affinity for -lactamases and overcome the diffusion-limited
process.
Hot spot residues are commonly defined by a 	2.0 kcal/mol
loss in binding energy caused by the alanine substitution (7, 49).
The composition of hot spots is biased toward aromatic resi￾dues and, in particular, tryptophan and tyrosine residues (7). In
addition, hot spot residues are most often located at the center
of the protein-protein interaction interface, and the residues
surrounding them have been proposed to form an “O-ring” (4,
7). The O-ring hypothesis is based on observations from alanine
mutagenesis that hot spots are often surrounded by hydrophilic
residues that do not significantly impact binding when mutated
and are suggested to enhance the strength of interactions by
excluding bulk water from the interface (4, 7).
The structure of the seven-bladed -propeller fold of BLIP-II
consists of concentric rings of amino acid residues consistent
with the O-ring model of a binding surface (Fig. 4). In addition,
the BLIP-II residues that constitute the hot spots share several
features with previously characterized hot spots. First, the
BLIP-II residues that comprise the hot spots are biased toward
aromatic residues, in particular, tryptophan and tyrosine, with
Trp-53, Tyr-73, Phe-74, Trp-152, Tyr-191, and Tyr-191 mak￾ing large contributions to binding affinity for all of the -lacta￾mases tested (Table 2). Upon examination of the BLIP-II--
lactamase structures, it is apparent that BLIP-II hot spot
residues Tyr-73 and Phe-74 could contribute significantly to
the stability of the complex because they bind with numerous
residues on the -lactamase (Fig. 6A). The BLIP-II W269A sub￾stitution resulted in dramatic reductions in binding affinity for
all of the -lactamases tested. This interaction is at the center of
the interface, and the alanine substitution would result in an
unfavorable cavity in the interface (Fig. 6B). Trp-53 is located
on a BLIP-II loop that sterically blocks the -lactamase active
site with the help of BLIP-II residues Asn-50 and Asp-52. Trp￾53, however, makes only limited side chain contacts with one or
two residues of -lactamase, and yet the BLIP-II D53A substi￾tution exhibits greatly decreased binding affinity for -lactama￾ses (Fig. 6C). Second, as seen in Fig. 4, the BLIP-II residues
making the largest contributions to binding energy for all four
-lactamases are largely clustered near the center of the bind￾ing interface with less important residues found in the outer
ring of the BLIP-II binding surface, which is consistent with the
O-ring hypothesis for organization of the interface (7). In fact,

difference in binding energy between wild-type BLIP-II and the alanine mutant (G  RT ln(Kd,wt/Kd,mut)). The upper significance control line is set at 2.7

model in that the outer rim is indeed an O-shaped ring of
largely hydrophilic residues. Thus, the structure of BLIP-II and
related proteins seems an ideal scaffold for mediating protein￾protein interactions. This organization of the BLIP-II scaffold
may explain why BLIP-II binds class A -lactamases 100–1000-
fold tighter than BLIP, despite the fact that BLIP-II has a smaller
interface size (2187 Å2 for TEM-1) than BLIP (2636 Å2 for
TEM-1).
The results of this study also indicated that residues near the
center of the interface that contribute strongly to binding gen￾erally possess lower temperature factors in the BLIP-II-TEM-1
and BLIP-II-Bla1 -lactamase x-ray structures than residues at
the periphery of the binding interface (Fig. 5, B and C). The
relative lack of motion of residues at the center of interface may
be indicative of a favorable entropic contribution of these resi￾dues to binding, which could also partially explain why these
positions form the hot spot. A plot of the temperature factors
for the alanine-substituted residues versus the change in bind￾ing energy for the mutants reveals a correlation (Fig. 5, B andC).
The correlation is weakened, however, by a few outlier points.
For example, the W269A substitution is well off of the linear
regression fit line for both BLIP-TEM-1 and BLIP-II-Bla1
because of the very large drop in binding energy for the W269A
mutant. In addition, the D206A substitution falls well below the
regression line for BLIP-II-TEM-1 but well above the line for
BLIP-II Bla1 (Fig. 5, B and C). This is interesting in that the
D206A substitution exhibits the largest change in -lactamase
binding specificity among all of the mutants studied. It is pos￾sible that differences in binding specificity for BLIP-II D206A
could be due to differences in entropic contributions to binding
TEM-1 versus Bla1 -lactamases.
As described above, the BLIP-II hot spot residues for binding
-lactamases are dominated by aromatic amino acids. In con￾trast, the residues that alter binding specificity, Asp-170 and
Asp-206, are charged. This finding is similar to observations
made with other protein-protein interactions (23, 31, 50, 51). In
the BLIP--lactamase system, the BLIP Glu-73–Lys-74 motif
has been shown to be a specificity determinant for interactions
with several different -lactamases (8, 32, 35). Another example
is the cross-reactivity between bovine and human growth hor￾mone and the human growth hormone receptor that occurs
when the human growth hormone Arg-43 and receptor Asp￾171 salt bridge is eliminated (50). These examples support the
notion of aromatic and charged residues in providing overall
binding energy and specificity to protein-protein interactions,
respectively.
Because alanine scanning mutagenesis has now been per￾formed on both tightly binding inhibitors, BLIP and BLIP-II, it
is of interest to compare their interactions with -lactamase.
BLIP-II is a femtomolar to picomolar affinity binder to all class
A -lactamases tested. The broad specificity of BLIP-II is also
reflected in the finding that alanine substitutions, with the
exception of BLIP-II D206A, do not greatly alter binding spec￾ificity. In contrast, BLIP contains three specificity-determining
regions (8). The fact that BLIP displays a wide range of binding
affinities for class A -lactamases and that its specificity can be
altered readily suggests the BLIP scaffold is highly malleable for
altering binding specificity for class A -lactamases, whereas
the BLIP-II scaffold is well suited for binding the entire class A
-lactamase family.
Detection and inhibition of -lactamases are of great clin￾ical interest. It seems unlikely BLIP-II could be used as a
therapeutic agent because it would likely elicit an immune
response. A BLIP-II-based peptide is possible, but it would
be significantly less potent than wild-type BLIP-II. Never￾theless, such a peptide could serve as a starting point for
further development. BLIP and BLIP-II, however, could be
used as diagnostic reagents to detect -lactamases in bacte￾rial strains. For example, the tightly binding characteristics
of BLIP-II could be used to determine whether a class A
-lactamase is present, and engineered versions of BLIP with
narrow binding specificity could be used to distinguish
among class A enzymes. BLIP and BLIP-II are potent binders
of -lactamases and could detect the low concentrations of
these enzymes in clinical samples.
