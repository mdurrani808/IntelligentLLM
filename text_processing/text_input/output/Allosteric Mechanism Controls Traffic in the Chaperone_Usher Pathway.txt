SUMMARY
Many virulence organelles of Gram-negative bacte￾rial pathogens are assembled via the chaperone/
usher pathway. The chaperone transports organelle
subunits across the periplasm to the outer mem￾brane usher, where they are released and incorpo￾rated into growing fibers. Here, we elucidate the
mechanism of the usher-targeting step in assembly
of the Yersinia pestis F1 capsule at the atomic level.
The usher interacts almost exclusively with the chap￾erone in the chaperone:subunit complex. In free
chaperone, a pair of conserved proline residues at
the beginning of the subunit-binding loop form a
‘‘proline lock’’ that occludes the usher-binding
surface and blocks usher binding. Binding of the
subunit to the chaperone rotates the proline lock
away from the usher-binding surface, allowing the
chaperone-subunit complex to bind to the usher.
We show that the proline lock exists in other chap￾erone/usher systems and represents a general
allosteric mechanism for selective targeting of
chaperone:subunit complexes to the usher and for
release and recycling of the free chaperone.
INTRODUCTION
Many biological functions depend on the precise assembly of
larger complex structures from smaller protein subunits. This
requires accurate control over each biogenesis step from
synthesis of subunits to targeting, often membrane transloca￾tion, and finally assembly of the supramolecular structure. The
assembly of fibrillar adhesive surface organelles from pilin
subunits via the chaperone/usher (CU) pathway in Gram-nega￾tive bacteria represents one of the best studied examples of
a biological assembly process (Waksman and Hultgren, 2009;
Zav’yalov et al., 2010; Zavialov et al., 2007) (Figure 1). These
organelles consist of linear fibers of noncovalently linked immu￾noglobulin (Ig)-like modules (Sauer et al., 2002; Zavialov et al.,
2003b). The Ig-like modules are made by combining two protein
subunit chains. The first six strands of the Ig-like fold, the bulk of
the module, all come from a single chain. The seventh (G) strand
is provided in trans by the N-terminal ‘‘donor strand’’ region of
the preceding subunit in the fiber. Since this region substitutes
for the G strand that is present at the C terminus of Ig domains,
but missing in pilin subunits, thereby completing the Ig-like fold
of the module, this type of interaction was termed donor strand
complementation (Choudhury et al., 1999; Sauer et al., 1999).
Depending on the subunit type(s) and composition, the fibers
coil into structures of different architecture. The number of
different subunit types assembled and the complexity of surface
organelle morphology inversely correlate with the length of
subunit-binding motifs in chaperones (Zav’yalov et al., 2010).
This enables the classification of CU machineries and corre￾sponding organelles into FGS and FGL systems (Hung et al.,
1996; Zav’yalov et al., 1995; Zavialov et al., 2007). Escherichia
coli Pap and Type-1 (Fim) CU systems have been used as proto￾types of the FGS family, while the Yersinia pestis Caf CU system
is the best-studied FGL system (Zavialov et al., 2007). The Caf
CU pathway (Caf1M/Caf1A) assembles F1 fibers that consist
of only one type of subunit (Caf1). The thin and flexible F1 fibers
tend to curl up and agglomerate into a dense amorphous struc￾ture with the appearance of a capsule (F1 capsular antigen).
In isolation, fimbrial subunits have poor stability and in vivo
either aggregate or are rapidly degraded (Chapman et al.,
1999; MacIntyre et al., 2001). The periplasmic chaperones
bind fimbrial subunits as they enter the periplasm, thereby pro￾moting their rapid folding and stabilizing them in a high-energy,
assembly competent conformation (Sauer et al., 2002; Yu
et al., 2012; Zavialov et al., 2003b, 2005). They do so by providing
a folding platform consisting of the A1 and G1 strands of the
first Ig-like domain of the chaperone, with the G1 (‘‘donor’’)
strand acting as a ‘‘stand-in,’’ completing the Ig fold of the
subunit (Yu et al., 2012).
Subunit assembly takes place at the usher and occurs via
a donor strand exchange (DSE) mechanism, in which the chap￾erone capping the subunit at the base of a growing fiber is dis￾placed by the N-terminal donor strand of an incoming subunit.
The usher consists of four soluble periplasmic domains and
a transmembrane b-barrel that forms a channel for secretion of
the fiber (Dubnovitsky et al., 2010; Nishiyama et al., 2005;
Phan et al., 2011; Remaut et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2009) (Figure 1).
Structure 20, 1861–1871, November 7, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1861Two of the periplasmic usher domains, the N-terminal domain
(UND) and the middle domain, are involved in initial binding of
chaperone:subunit complexes and ‘‘plugging’’ the translocation
pore, respectively. The plug domain of the Caf1A usher shows
structural similarity to the Caf1 subunit (Yu et al., 2009). Two
tandem Ig-like C-terminal domains (UCD1 and UCD2) (Dubnovit￾sky et al., 2010; Phan et al., 2011; Remaut et al., 2008) bind to
the chaperone capping the base of a growing fiber. Recent
structural characterization of assembly complexes in the type 1
system led to the following general model for assembly (Phan
et al., 2011). In FGS systems, such as P or type-1 fimbriae, the
complex of the two-domain adhesin subunit with chaperone
must be added first to the UCDs to trigger release of the plug
domain and open the channel. The next and following chapero￾ne:subunit preassembly complexes bind to the UND, which is
tethered to the N-terminus of the barrel domain by a relatively
long flexible linker. Modeling (Phan et al., 2011) suggests that
the free UND would be able to capture a new preassembly
complex from the periplasmic pool and position it with its free
N-terminal donor strand in close proximity to the P5 DSE initia￾tion site (Remaut et al., 2006) of the acceptor cleft of the UCD￾bound subunit, aligning the system for DSE. Addition of the
new subunit to the base of the fiber through DSE is thought to
be accompanied by release of the chaperone from the acceptor
subunit, transfer of the attacking complex from the UND to the
UCDs, and translocation of one subunit through the usher
pore. The detailed mechanism of this process, in particular, the
specificity of binding and release, is not yet understood.
The ushermust be able to distinguish the preassembly complex
from free chaperone or free chaperone would compete for and
inhibit assembly (Figure 1). Indeed, chaperone-subunit com￾plexes were found to bind to the usher, whereas no binding of
free chaperone to the usher was detected in vitro (Dodson
et al., 1993; Saulino et al., 1998). Structural studies on the
classical FGS CU Fim system for assembly of type-1 fimbriae sug￾gested a possible basis for such discrimination (Nishiyama et al.,
2005). The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of the FimD
usher (FimDN) bound to the complex of the FimC chaperone and
pilin domain of subunit FimH revealed that the usher-chaperone
contact contributes most of the interactive binding area, while
the contact between the usher and subunit is small. Nevertheless,
it was proposed that usher-subunit contacts might contribute
sufficient binding energy to ensure the selective recognition of
the complex. However, a more recent structure of the FimDN:
FimC:FimF complex from the same system revealed a signifi￾cantly smaller interactive area between the usher and subunit
(Eidam et al., 2008), weakening this hypothesis.
Here, we investigate the basis for discrimination between
the free chaperone and preassembly complex in the Caf CU
system. We determined the X-ray structure for the monomeric
Caf1M chaperone, the N-terminal domain of the Caf1A usher,
and the Caf1M:Caf1 preassembly complex bound to this domain.
By comparison of these and previously obtained structures,
together with protein engineering and binding studies, we show
that the affinity between chaperone and usher is allosterically
regulated by the subunit through a mechanism that is most likely
conserved and commonly used in CU systems.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Preassembly Complex Binding Domain in Caf1A
We began our study with identification of Caf1M:Caf1-binding
segments in Caf1A. Based on the sequence homology between
Caf1A and FimD, we introduced deletions in the N-terminal
region of the mature sequence of Caf1A. The deletion of
residues 12–27 and 12–40 did not significantly affect Caf1A
insertion into the outer membrane (Figure S1A available online).
However, they completely abolished F1 capsule formation (Fig￾ure S1B) and resulted in accumulation of Caf1M:Caf1 complexes
in the periplasm (Figure S1C). These results indicate that Caf1A
binds chaperone:subunit complexes via a domain located at the
N-terminus of the protein, as does FimD. Indeed, overexpression
of an N-terminal fragment (residues 1–158, including signal
sequence) of the Caf1A precursor in E. coli resulted in high-level
accumulation of a soluble protein in the periplasm. The isolated

thermodynamic stability (Figure S1D). To highlight the N-terminal
localization of the domain, we have denoted it Caf1AN.
Caf1AN was purified from periplasmic extracts and crystal￾lized, and its 2 A˚ crystal structure was solved (Figure S1E;
Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains four Caf1AN molecules
with very similar structures. None of the molecules have electron
density for the N- and C-terminal parts of Caf1AN before Asp18
and after Phe124, respectively, suggesting that these sequences
are not structured in Caf1AN. The core structure of the domain is
made of a small five-stranded pseudobarrel sealed at the top
and bottom with connective loops and helices a1 (bottom) and
a2 (top) (Figure S1E). This structure is similar to that of the
N-terminal domain of the FimD usher (Nishiyama et al., 2005).
Superpositioning of these domains aligns 88 Ca atoms with
a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) value of 1.3 A˚ (Figures
S1E and S1F). The high degree of structural similarity between
N-terminal domains of Caf1A and FimD ushers, representing
ushers from the FGL and FGS CU pathways, respectively,
suggests that the mechanism of chaperone:subunit complex
binding by ushers is highly conserved and is likely to be similar
in all CU systems.
Caf1AN Binds to Caf1-Loaded, but Not Free Caf1M
To quantitatively characterize binding between Caf1AN and
Caf1M:Caf1, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used.
Caf1AN was covalently immobilized to a sensor chip, and the
binding of the Caf1M:Caf1 complex was measured by
recording the SPR signal after addition of the complex in the
liquid phase. As binding was too dynamic to follow accurately
in real time, we analyzed the reaction only at equilibrium (Fig￾ure S1G), allowing accurate estimation of the dissociation
constant (2.42 ± 0.24 mM; Table 2). The value obtained is similar
to that previously determined for binding of FimDN to FimC
loaded with tip fibrillum subunits FimH or FimF and higher
than that of FimDN binding to FimC loaded with the pilus rod
subunit, FimA (Nishiyama and Glockshuber, 2010; Nishiyama
et al., 2003).
No binding between Caf1AN and free Caf1M was detected in
similar experiments at concentrations of Caf1M as high as
400 mM (Table 2). Binding of Caf1M:Caf1 to Caf1AN was not in￾hibited by Caf1M, even at a 500-fold excess of Caf1M over the
Caf1M:Caf1 complex (Figure S2). Thus Caf1A is able to specifi￾cally recognize Caf1-loaded Caf1M and selectively bind to it,
even at high excess of free Caf1M.

Recognition by Caf1A
To elucidate how Caf1A selectively recognizes the Caf1M:
Caf1 complex, we determined a crystal structure of the Caf1AN:
Caf1M:Caf1 complex. The structure of Caf1AN:Caf1M:
Caf1 was solved by molecular replacement using the crystal
structure of Caf1M:Caf1 and refined at 1.8 A˚ resolution to R =
18.3% and Rfree = 23.7% (Table 1; Figure 2A). To facilitate the
following discussion, we have labeled residue numbers for
Caf1A and Caf1M in the complex with ‘‘a’’ and ‘‘m’’ superscripts,
respectively.
The structures of Caf1M:Caf1 and the core of Caf1AN remain
essentially unchanged after binding. The largest conformational
change occurs in the N-terminal 1-17 amino acid sequence of
Caf1AN, which becomes ordered in Caf1AN:Caf1M:Caf1 (Fig￾ure 2A; Figure S1E). This sequence, together with the following
helix a1 makes up the largest part of the domain’s binding
surface (626 A˚ 2

and Pro104m at the beginning of the F1G1 loop, and the aliphatic
part of the side chain of Arg69m. Together, these residues form
a hydrophobic usher-binding surface (UBS). All the interface
residues are highly conserved, in particular, Pro103m (invariant),
Pro104m, and Phe4a (Figure 2C). In addition, there are a number
of residues contributing Caf1A-Caf1M contacts, which are not
arranged in binding clusters.
Caf1 contributes only 3% (36 A˚ 2
) to the usher-binding area
of the preassembly complex (1,069 A˚ 2
), largely attributed to
Ala141. The side chain of Met8a and atom Cd2 of Thr7a are
located within 3.9–4.4 A˚ from the Ca and Cb atoms of Ala141
in Caf1, thus providing weak van der Waals interactions. In
addition, a weak interaction is formed between the Cε atom
of Met8a and the C atom of Val142 of Caf1. Such a small
Caf1AN-Caf1 interactive area is surprising in view of the hypoth￾esis proposed by Nishiyama and coauthors (Nishiyama et al.,
2005) that contacts between the usher and the subunit are
responsible for the selective recognition of preassembly
complexes. How could such a small interface influence the
binding specificity?
Changing Ala141 to Gly (essentially halving the interactive
area) had no effect on Caf1M:Caf1 binding to Caf1AN (Table 2)
and F1 assembly (Figure 3). Similarly, mutation of Met8a to Ala
did not significantly affect binding. In contrast, substitutions of
Leu43m or Phe4a to Ala residues, decreasing the Caf1A-Caf1M
interactive area by 7.4% and 11.6%, respectively, dramatically
reduced both the affinity between Caf1AN and the Caf1M:Caf1
preassembly complex and the efficiency of F1 capsule
assembly.
In conclusion, both the structural and functional studies clearly
demonstrate that the Caf1A-Caf1 contact is not important for
binding of Caf1M:Caf1 to Caf1AN, and it cannot serve as the
main determinant for selective recognition of the subunit-loaded
chaperone by the usher. So, which mechanism is responsible
for this?
Role of Caf1M Tetramerization in the Selective Binding
of Caf1-Loaded Caf1M by Caf1A
Caf1M equilibrates between the active monomeric and inactive
tetrameric forms (Zavialov and Knight, 2007). Caf1M tetrameriza￾tion might inhibit Caf1A-Caf1M binding and favor binding
between Caf1A and Caf1M:Caf1 by reducing the concentration
of free Caf1M. To study the possible contribution of this effect
on Caf1M:Caf1 targeting to Caf1A, we probed the binding
between Caf1A and Caf1M, carrying a deletion of residues 2–12
at the N-terminus and/or 113–129 in the F1G1 loop. The deleted
sequences are apparently not involved in Caf1A binding, but their
deletion completely abolishes Caf1M tetramerization, resulting in
accumulation of monomers (Zavialov and Knight, 2007).
In contrast to wild-type Caf1M, these mutants bound to
Caf1AN at high concentrations (Table 2). However, binding was
not saturated, suggesting an apparent dissociation constant of
more than 260 mM, at least 100 times higher than the dissociation
constant for binding of Caf1AN to Caf1M:Caf1 (Table 2). Indeed,
these mutants inhibited the Caf1AN-(Caf1M:Caf1) binding to only
40% at 500-fold excess over the Caf1M:Caf1 complex (Fig￾ure S2). Hence, Caf1M tetramerization is unlikely to represent
a decisive controlling mechanism. The finding of such a low
affinity of monomeric Caf1M to Caf1AN suggests that regulation
may depend on conformational differences between free and
loaded Caf1M.
Caf1M Binding to Caf1A Is Allosterically Controlled
by Caf1
To investigate the hypothesis that monomeric Caf1M takes on
a conformation that prevents it from efficiently binding to
Caf1AN, we determined the 1.5 A˚ crystal structure of the
Caf1M-D2-12, D113-129 mutant.
The asymmetric unit contained two Caf1M monomers (Fig￾ure S3). They had nearly identical structures, except for small
differences in some loops, most likely caused by crystallo￾graphic contacts. Importantly, the UBS and its surroundings
were not affected by crystallographic contacts. The structure
had almost no electron density for residue 13 and poor density
for residue 14 at the N-terminus and no electron density for the
sequence from residue 105 to 134 in the F1G1 hairpin. This
supports partial proteolysis data for diluted (monomeric) wild￾type Caf1M (Chapman et al., 1999) that suggests that sequences
up to residue 14 and between residues 105 and 134 are unstruc￾tured in the Caf1M monomer.
Structural comparison of free and Caf1-bound Caf1M re￾vealed significant conformational differences, in particular, in
the N-terminal domain (Figure 4A). In Caf1-bound Caf1M, resi￾dues 8–13 and 125–133 form the A1 and G1 Caf1-binding
strands. In total, Caf1 binding causes structuring of about 10%
of the residues in domain 1 of Caf1M. Not surprisingly, this
change distorts the DCFG b sheet in this domain. The extended
G1 donor strand, which is firmly docked in the subunit acceptor
cleft, forms additional hydrogen bonds to the end of the F1
strand, pulling its end closer to the G1 strand and simultaneously
causing the F1 strand to twist, affecting positions of several resi￾dues, including the UBS residue Ile102m (Figures 4A and 4B).
However, the most striking difference is observed in the posi￾tions of Pro103m and Pro104m at the beginning of the F1G1
loop (Figure 4B). In free Caf1M, Pro104m occupies a hydrophobic

and the aliphatic part of the side chain of Arg69m, which all
belong to the UBS. Hence, in free Caf1M, the UBS is in a closed
or collapsed conformation that prevents binding to the usher
(Figures 4B and 5A). In contrast, in Caf1-bound Caf1M,
Pro103m and Pro104m are rotated to move Pro104m out of the
UBS. We will refer to this second conformation as an open
UBS (Figures 4B and 5B).
In the closed UBS, the distance between Ca atoms of Pro104m
and Leu43m is about 2.5 A˚ shorter than that in the open UBS
(Table S3). Not surprisingly, structural comparison of free
Caf1M and Caf1AN:Caf1M:Caf1 revealed that the closed UBS
conformation cannot form optimal interactions with the binding
residues of Caf1AN. Most strikingly, Phe4a
, which is essential
for binding (Table 2; Figure 3), cannot insert into its local binding
pocket, because in the closed UBS conformation, this is occu￾pied by Pro104m (Figure 4C).
Caf1M has the same open UBS conformation in the preas￾sembly complex and the complex bound to the usher. This is re￾flected in similar values for the distances between Ca atoms of
Pro104m and Leu43m (8.1–8.3 A˚ ) in all structures determined
so far that include Caf1M:Caf1 (Caf1M:Caf1, Caf1M:Caf1:Caf1,
and Caf1AN:Caf1M:Caf1) (Table S3). Hence, the open UBS
conformation in the Caf1-bound chaperone is predesigned for
optimal binding to Caf1A.
To confirm the role of the proline lock in regulating the affinity
of Caf1M to Caf1A, it would be logical to break the lock in
Caf1M and demonstrate Caf1M-Caf1A binding. However,
because the residues comprising the lock also participate
directly in Caf1M-Caf1A binding, simple substitution mutagen￾esis of the lock residues would not provide a clear answer.
Hence, we chose a different approach. The proline lock resi￾dues mark the beginning of the subunit-binding F1G1 hairpin
loop. We hypothesized that shortening this loop may generate
a stretching force pulling on the loop, including the proline
lock, thus forcing it to disengage and allow the UBS to open.
We created a series of Caf1M mutants with shorter F1G1 loops
(Table 2; Table S1). As we predicted, the affinity of free Caf1M to
Caf1AN gradually increased with the length of deletion (Table 2).
Caf1M 106-129 bound to Caf1AN with a dissociation constant of
9.8 ± 1.0 mM and efficiently inhibited Caf1AN-(Caf1M:Caf1)
binding (Figure S2).
In conclusion, our structural-biochemical study suggests an
allosteric mechanism, in which Pro103m and Pro104m act in
concert as a ‘‘proline lock’’ that prevents or allows usher binding,
depending on whether the subunit is bound or not (Figure 6;
Movie S1). In free Caf1M, the lock keeps the UBS closed, pre￾venting Caf1M from binding to Caf1A. Caf1 binding unlocks
the proline lock and opens the UBS, allowing the Caf1M:Caf1
complex to target and bind to Caf1A.
Communication between the Caf1 and Caf1A Binding
Sites in Caf1M
How does Caf1 binding switch the UBS conformation from
closed to open? As Caf1 does not form direct interactions with
the UBS residues, we considered possible mechanisms for
communication between the Caf1 and Caf1A binding sites in
Caf1M.
Upon Caf1M:Caf1 complex formation, the 11-residue-long
C-terminal part of the F1G1 loop (residues 124–134) forms
a donor beta strand that binds in the acceptor cleft of the subunit
to compensate for the lacking G b strand (Figures 4A and 6A). As
the extended structure of the donor strand forms, the F1G1 loop
is shortened, considerably reducing its conformational freedom.
We hypothesized that this might result in a stretching force pull￾ing on the loop that might be sufficient to open the proline lock,
as we observed for artificially short F1G1 loops. To investigate
this hypothesis, we created a series of Caf1M mutants with
longer F1G1 loops (Table 2; Table S1). We expected that the

UBS in the closed conformation. Such mutant Caf1M:Caf1
complexes should not bind to Caf1A. Indeed, we found that all
mutants with the F1G1 loop extended by at least two residues
at two different sites (Ala114m and Asp123m) bind about two
times weaker to Caf1AN than the wild-type complex. However,
our crystal structure of the Caf1M:Caf1 complex carrying the
insertion KDKDTN at Ala114m reveals an open UBS (Figure S4A).
Hence, at least in Caf1M, with its exceptionally long F1G1 loop,
a stretching force alone is not sufficient to switch the UBS
from the closed to the open conformation.
Caf1 binding changes the local environment of the lock (Fig￾ure 5B). In the Caf1M:Caf1 complex, Tyr12m and Ala133m from
the A1 and G1 donor strands, respectively, form van der Waals
interactions with Pro103m. In addition, the side chain of
Tyr40m, which in Caf1M:Caf1 is linked to the main chain of the
A1 donor strand via a hydroxyl-amide hydrogen bond, forms
extensive interactions with both Pro103m and Pro104m. These
interactions are absent in free Caf1M, because the concerned
Caf1-binding segments are unstructured.
To examine whether these interactions are sufficient to main￾tain an open UBS, we replaced Tyr12m by Gly and Tyr40m by Ala
residues and analyzed the effect of these mutations on the
affinity of the Caf1M:Caf1 complex to Caf1AN (Table 2) and effi￾ciency of F1 capsule assembly (Figure 3). Both single mutations
decreased the affinity, in particular Tyr40mAla, which also clearly
inhibited surface assembly. Combined, the mutations led to
a dramatic effect: both Caf1AN-(Caf1M:Caf1) binding and
assembly were practically abolished.
We hypothesized that mutations that disrupt the Pro103m
Pro104m binding pocket Tyr12m-Tyr40m-Ala133m would favor
the collapsed proline lock conformation and keep the UBS
closed. Indeed, our crystal structure of the Caf1M:Caf1 complex
carrying the Tyr40mAla mutation revealed the closed conforma￾tion (Figure S4A), demonstrating that the local environment
around the proline lock in the preassembly complex maintains
its extended conformation and is critical for keeping the UBS
open. Tyr12m and Tyr40m occupy highly conserved positions in
multiple sequence alignments of FGL chaperones, suggesting
that they all employ a similar allosteric communication
mechanism.
In the absence of pocket Tyr12m-Tyr40m-Ala133m (formed
only after Caf1 binding), Pro104m can instead insert into a hydro￾phobic pocket formed by Pro41m, Leu43m, and Ile102m, closing
the UBS (Figure 5A). A strong tendency to attain this conforma￾tion is suggested by our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
(Figure S4B). The Caf1M model with the open UBS (taken from
the crystal structure of the Caf1M:Caf1 complex) was subjected
to MD simulations in an aqueous environment. The UBS became
substantially closed within a 20–25 ps time interval, which is re￾flected in the change of the distance between Ca atoms of
Pro104m and Leu43m from 8.3 to 6.5 A˚ . MD simulations with
the Leu43Ala mutant of Caf1M showed a somewhat interme￾diate conformation between closed and open UBS with a 7.4 A˚
distance between Ca atoms of Pro104m and Ala43m, suggesting
that the switch is driven not only by the hydrophobic effect. The
twist in the F1 strand may also facilitate opening the UBS, as it
contributes to rotation of the proline lock residues (Figure 5C).
Control of Subunit Trafficking in Other
Chaperone/Usher Systems
To investigate if binding of preassembly complexes to the usher
may be controlled through a similar allosteric proline lock mech￾anism in other chaperone/usher systems, we examined available
structures of subunit-free and bound chaperones (Table S3).
Currently, structures for two FGL (Caf1M and SafB) and four
FGS chaperones (FimC, PapD, FaeE, and SfaE) have been
deposited in the protein data bank (PDB). With exception for
SfaE, all these chaperones have been cocrystallized with corre￾sponding organelle subunits, providing a wealth of structural
information on the subunit-bound chaperone conformation.

Structure 20, 1861–1871, November 7, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1867with that of Caf1M in Caf1M:Caf1 demonstrates that, regardless
of the type of the chaperone, all of them have an open UBS (for
superposition of prototypical FGL and FGS chaperones, see Fig￾ure 7A). The distance between Ca atoms in residues corre￾sponding to Pro104 and Leu43 of Caf1M in subunit-bound
FimC, PapD, and SafB is universally long (7.7–8.1 A˚ ) and is prac￾tically independent of the type of the bound subunit. Only in the
FaeE:FaeF complex, this distance is slightly shorter (7.3 A˚ ). This
is probably due to the absence of a bulky side chain at the usher￾binding position (e.g., Leu43 in Caf1M and Gly32 in FaeE).
As is the case for the Caf system, the structure of the Fim
system UBS is almost identical in the free chaperone:subunit
preassembly complex and in the usher-bound complex. This
confirms that the open conformation of the UBS, which is
present in all chaperone:subunit complexes, is optimal for usher
binding.
The subunit-free chaperone conformation is best studied for
FimC and PapD (Table S3). For PapD, several crystal structures
were determined (Holmgren and Bra¨ nden, 1989; Hung et al.,
1999; Pinkner et al., 2006), while FimC was solved by nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) (Pellecchia et al., 1998). Although
Caf1M and PapD or FimC belong to different chaperone families,
the structures of their UBSs can be nicely superimposed (Fig￾ure 7A), which clearly demonstrates that, as for Caf1M,
subunit-free FimC and PapD have a closed UBS. This is reflected
in a 2 to 3 A˚ shorter distance between Ca atoms of Leu32-Ser92
and Leu32-Pro95 in FimC and PapD, respectively (Table S3).
Whereas part of the F1G1 strand remains invisible in all of the
crystal structures, the entire F1G1 loop is seen in the NMR struc￾ture of FimC. The loop region is highly flexible and is represented
by quite different NMR traces. Nevertheless, in the majority of the
representative NMR traces, the loop is positioned above the
closed UBS, thus creating an additional steric obstacle for chap￾erone-usher binding.
Unfortunately, not all crystal structures of subunit-free chaper￾ones can provide information about the conformation of the
UBS. The complication arises from the fact that chaperones
tend to form ‘‘self-capping’’ dimers or, in the case of wild-type
Caf1M, tetramers, in which the subunit binding motifs are
engaged in oligomerization. This self-capping mechanism
mimics chaperone-subunit interactions and hence may directly
affect the structure of the UBS. Self-capping is observed in
crystal structures of the FaeE and SfaE chaperones, causing
an unusually open UBS in these structures (Table S3).
Classical FGS CU machineries systems typically assemble
complex structures consisting of several different subunits. In
the Pap system, the order of assembly of subunits in the fiber
apparently correlates with the affinity of the corresponding chap￾erone-subunit complexes to the usher (Dodson et al., 1993), and
in both Pap and Fim systems, the chaperone:adhesin subunit

1868 Structure 20, 1861–1871, November 7, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reservedcomplexes bind to the usher tighter and faster than structural
subunits (Nishiyama and Glockshuber, 2010; Saulino et al.,
1998). How does the usher detect the type of subunit loaded
to the chaperone in these systems? Nashiyama et al. (2005) sug￾gested that the usher discriminately recognizes subunits by es￾tablishing direct binding contacts with them. Indeed, the interac￾tive area between FimDN and FimH is significantly larger than
that between FimDN and FimF in the corresponding usher do￾main:chaperone:subunit complexes (Eidam et al., 2008; Nish￾iyama et al., 2005), which positively correlates with the affinity
between the usher and corresponding preassembly complexes
(Nishiyama et al., 2003). However, in view of the very limited
usher-subunit binding area in the FimD:FimC:FimF complex (Ei￾dam et al., 2008), it is difficult to explain why FimDN binds tighter
to FimC:FimF than to FimC:FimA (Nishiyama et al., 2003). Our
discovery of regulation of the affinity of the chaperone to the
usher by subunit binding suggests an alternative mechanism.
Different subunits might differently affect the UBS conformation,
resulting in different affinities of the same chaperone to the
usher. Interestingly, the conformation of the A1A2 loop in
subunits in chaperone:subunit complexes that bind poorly to
the usher (PapA, PapH, and FimA) is different from that in
subunits in chaperone:subunit complexes that bind tightly to
the usher (e.g., PapG, FimH, and FimF) (Choudhury et al.,
1999; Crespo et al., 2012; Verger et al., 2006, 2007; Volkan
et al., 2012). The A1A2 loop directly interacts with the lock and
closely positioned residues of the chaperone, affecting their
positions. These conformational changes could potentially be
involved in modulating the affinity of the complexes to the usher.
Conclusions
In this study, we discovered that trafficking through the Caf CU
pathway is allosterically controlled. We show that the Caf1M
chaperone contains a structural lock that blocks binding of the
free chaperone to the Caf1A usher and that Caf1 binding to
Caf1M disengages the lock by allosterically inducing conforma￾tional changes in the Caf1AN binding surface of Caf1M (UBS).
This dramatically increases the affinity of Caf1M for Caf1AN and
thus enables selective binding of Caf1-loaded Caf1M to Caf1AN.
The generality of thismechanism is strongly supported by analysis
of available structures of subunit-free chaperones and chapero￾ne:subunit and usher:chaperone:subunit complexes from other
systems, as well as by the high conservation of involved residues.
The switch between a closed UBS in free chaperone and an
open UBS capable of binding to the usher in a subunit-loaded
chaperone involves a conformational change affecting the posi￾tioning of two highly conserved proline residues at the beginning
of the F1G1 loop. In contrast to the ‘‘proline switches’’ found in
a number of proteins, e.g., (OuYang et al., 2008; Sarkar et al.,
2011; Vogel et al., 2006), the switch between open and closed
UBS conformations does not involve Pro cis-trans isomerization.
Instead, subunit binding leads to formation of an extended beta
strand interaction between the G1 (donor) and F1 strands that
twists the F1 strand and rotates the proline lock to the open posi￾tion, where it is stabilized by a pocket created only after subunit
binding.
The subunit-induced changes in the UBS may control not only
usher targeting by the chaperone:subunit complexes, but also
other steps of subunit trafficking. Thus, the step of subunit incor￾poration into the growing fiber almost certainly relies on this
mechanism. At this step, the newly incoming chaperone:subunit
complex replaces the fiber-capping chaperone, allowing chap￾erone recycling. According to our results, this should be accom￾panied by the closure of the UBS of the released chaperone. As
a consequence of this conformational change, the chaperone
would lose its affinity to the UND, preventing free chaperone
from inhibiting the capture step by rebinding to the UND. Since
the UND and UCD2 domains bind to overlapping sites in the
chaperone, rebinding to the UCD might also be prevented. This
model is consistent with the levels of energy involved in the
process. The Caf1M-Caf1 binding is at least 10 times tighter
(Yu et al., 2012) than Caf1AN-(Caf1M:Caf1) binding (Table 2).
Hence, Caf1M-Caf1 association could generate sufficient energy
to open the UBS and thus allow Caf1AN-(Caf1M:Caf1) binding.
The assembly of type 1 and P pili can be blocked by a specially
designed organic molecule called pilicide, which has been shown
to specifically inhibit binding of the chaperone:subunit complex
to the usher (Pinkner et al., 2006). The crystal structure of a PapD:-
pilicin complex shows that pilicide binds to the UBS. One of the
major contacts is mediated by the pyridone ring of pilicide, which
inserts into the subpocket between Leu32, Ile93, and Pro95. Not
surprisingly, this binding causes opening of the UBS, increasing
the Leu32-Pro95 Ca distance by 3 A˚ (Figure 7B; Table S3). The
better fit of the pilicide to the open UBS explains why it has
higher affinity to the chaperone:subunit complex than to the
subunit-free chaperone (Pinkner et al., 2006). Hence, to target

the closed conformation of the UBS. This alternative approach
may help to design inhibitors with binding affinities higher than
that of pilicide, which is active only at high (mM) concentrations.
Such inhibitors could be used as a starting point for development
of novel drugs targeting Gram-negative pathogens.
Many biological pathways are controlled through allosteric
mechanisms. Most known cases involve metabolic or signaling
pathways, where allosteric control is exerted though key
enzymes or signal receptors. Our results extend the concept of
allosteric control by providing the example of its use to control
trafficking through a protein assembly and secretion pathway
assisted by a chaperone.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization
All proteins were expressed in the periplasm of BL21 Star (DE3) cells carrying
expression plasmids (see plasmid construction and mutagenesis in Supple￾mental Experimental Procedures) and extracted by osmotic shock, as
described before (Chapman et al., 1999).
Caf1AN and its mutants were precipitated from the periplasmic fraction by
ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation on ice for over 1 hr. Precipitated protein
was collected by 20 min centrifugation at 20,000 3 g and dissolved in water.
After dialysis against 5 mM Bis-Tris propane buffer, pH 6.5, protein was loaded
onto a MonoQ 10/100 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Bis￾Tris propane buffer, pH 6.5 (AEX buffer). Proteins bound to the column were
eluted using a linear gradient of 0–150 mM NaCl. Caf1M and its mutants
were precipitated from the periplasmic fraction as above, dissolved in
20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, dialyzed against the same buffer, and purified by cation
exchange in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, on MonoS 10/100 or HR 5 columns (GE
Healthcare) using a linear gradient of 0–200 mM NaCl. The binary complex
Caf1M:Caf1-His6 was expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described
(Zavialov et al., 2003b). The tertiary complex Caf1AN:Caf1M:Caf1 was formed
in vitro by mixing Caf1AN with 1.5 time molar excess of the purified binary
complex Caf1M:Caf1. The latter was obtained by enzymatic cleavage of the
N-terminal His6 tag from the Caf1M:Caf1-His6 complex using the TAGzyme
protease (QIAGEN). After incubation overnight at 37C, the tertiary complex
was purified using anion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ 10/100
column in the AEX buffer using a linear gradient of 20–175 mM NaCl. To obtain
highest purity samples, proteins were subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex￾75 or 200 16/60 HiLoad column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM
HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl.
Proteins were crystallized by the hanging or sitting drop vapor-diffusion
method at 293 K, except for the Caf1AN:Caf1M:Caf1 complex, which was
crystallized at 279 K. Caf1AN, Caf1AN:Caf1M:Caf1, and Caf1M-D2-12,
-D113-129 formed crystals in drops containing 20% PEG 3350, 0.2 M ammo￾nium nitrate, pH 6.3; 15% PEG 3350, 0.1 M Na-cacodylate, pH 6.4; and 40%
PEG 600 and 0.1 M citrate, pH 5.5; respectively. Crystallization of Caf1M:Caf1
complexes carrying mutations in Caf1M (Y40A and A114-insKDKDTN) were
performed as described in Zavialov et al. (2003a).
Structure Determination and Refinement
X-ray diffraction data were collected at the ESRF beamlines ID14-1, ID 14-4,
and ID 29 at 100 K. The structure of the Caf1AN:Caf1M:Caf1 complex was
solved by molecular replacement using our crystal structure of the binary
Caf1M:Caf1 complex (PDB code 1P5V). The structure of the Caf1AN domain
was built manually in the electron density. The crystal structure of the N-terminal
domain from the FimD usher (PDB code 1ZE3) was used as a reference in the
initial building cycles. The structure of free Caf1AN was solved by molecular
replacement. The search model included residues 30–120 of the Caf1AN model
from the Caf1AN:Caf1M:Caf1 complex structure. Structures of Caf1M tetramer
and the Caf1M:Caf1 complex (PDB accession numbers 2OS7 and 1P5V,
respectively) were remodeled to place missing Pro104 and Lys105 into the
available electron density. Structures of Caf1M:Caf1 complexes carrying muta￾tions and Caf1M-D2-12, -D113-129 were solved by molecular replacement
using structures of the wild-type complex and a monomer from the Caf1M
tetramer structure as search models, respectively. PHASER (McCoy, 2007),
REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997), and O (Jones et al., 1991) programs were
used to perform molecular replacement, structure refinement, and model
building, respectively. Data collection and refinement statistics are presented
in Table 1. Figure S5 illustrates electron density in the proline lock region.
Plasmon Resonance Binding Assay
A Biacore X100 system (GE Healthcare) was used for all biosensor experi￾ments. Caf1AN (approximately 800 resonance units (RU)) was immobilized
on flow cell 2 of a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling using an Amine Coupling
Kit (GE Healthcare). To record the association and dissociation curves,
samples of Caf1M:Caf1 or Caf1M at varying concentrations were injected
into flow cell 2 of the chip for 1 min followed by flushing of the cell with running
buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20)
for 3 min at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Identical samples were injected over
a control flow cell to determine nonspecific binding, which was subtracted
from the experimental curves. After each data acquisition cycle, the chip
was fully regenerated by an additional 1 min buffer flow.
Surface Immunofluorescence Assay
DH5a cells transformed with the p12R plasmid carrying wild-type or mutated
Caf operon (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) were grown to
optical density (OD) 1 at 600 nm. 0.1 OD600nm ml cells were incubated succes￾sively with rabbit anti-Caf1SC antibody and goat antirabbit IgG fluorescein
conjugate (Sigma) diluted 500 and 50 times with phosphate saline buffer,
respectively, followed by measuring fluorescence on a Varian CARY Eclipse
fluorescent spectrophotometer (Varian). E. coli DH5a/pUC19 was used as
a background control.
