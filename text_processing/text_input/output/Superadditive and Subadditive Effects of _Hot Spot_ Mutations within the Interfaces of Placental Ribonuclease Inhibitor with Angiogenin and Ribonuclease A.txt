ABSTRACT: Previous single-site mutagenesis studies on the complexes of ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) with
angiogenin (Ang) and RNase A suggested that in both cases a substantial fraction of the binding energy
is concentrated within one small part of the crystallographically observed interface, involving RI residues
434-438. Such energetic “hot spots” are common in protein-protein complexes, but their physical meaning
is generally unclear. Here we have investigated this question by examining the detailed interactions within
the RI‚ligand hot spots and the extent to which they function independently. The effects of Phe versus
Ala substitutions show that the key residue Tyr434 interacts with both ligands primarily through its phenyl
ring; for Tyr437, the OH group forms the important contacts with RNase A, whereas the phenyl group
interacts with Ang. Kinetic characterization of complexes containing multiple substitutions reveals striking,
but distinctive, cooperativity in the interactions of RI with the two ligands. The losses in binding energy
for the RNase complex associated with replacements of Tyr434 and Asp435, and Tyr434 and Tyr437, are
markedly less than additive (i.e., by 2.4 and 1.3 kcal/mol, respectively). In contrast, the energetic effects
of the 434 and 435, and 434 and 437, substitution pairs on binding of Ang are fully additive and 2.5
kcal/mol beyond additive, respectively. Superadditivities (0.9-2.4 kcal/mol) are also observed for several
multisite replacements involving these inhibitor residues and two Ang residues, Arg5 and Lys40, from
this part of the interface. Consequently, the decreases in binding energy for some triple-variant complexes
are as large as 8.5-10.1 kcal/mol (compared to a total ∆G of -21.0 kcal/mol for the wild-type complex).
Potential explanations for these functional couplings, many of which occur over distances of >13 Å and
are not mediated by direct or triangulated contacts, are proposed. These findings show that the basis for
the generation of hot spots can be complex, and that these sites can assume significantly more (as with
Ang) or less (as with RNase) importance than indicated from the effects of single-site mutations.
The formation of tight, specific complexes between
heterologous proteins is critical for most biological processes.
The physicochemical basis for this molecular recognition has
been investigated extensively in recent years, and substantial
progress has been made (see refs 1-4). Nonetheless, a
predictive understanding of protein-protein interactions has
not yet been achieved. The limits of our comprehension are
perhaps most evident in those instances (some 20 to date;
see the list in ref 5) where binding epitopes have been defined
both by crystallography and by detailed mutational studies.
The structural epitopes in these complexes are invariably
large and include 10-33 residues from multiple discontinu￾ous segments on each protein. However, the functional
epitopes assigned by mutagenesis are usually more restricted;
replacements of a small number of amino acids (typically
two to five on each protein) weaken the complex dramati￾cally, and substitutions of most other interface residues,
including many which appear to form highly favorable
contacts, produce little or no loss in binding affinity.
No reliable method has been devised to pinpoint these
energetic “hot spots” (6) by structural analysis. Indeed, these
sites do not seem to share any universal characteristics that
would facilitate their identification. Moreover, their physical
meaning is generally unclear. For example, in most cases it
is not known whether the effects of replacing critical residues
can be attributed entirely to the loss of the specific interac￾tions made by them, nor is it known whether these residues
work in a cooperative manner among themselves or with
other amino acids. The answers to such questions are of
practical as well as theoretical interest, since they have
important implications for the design of small molecules that
can disrupt protein-protein interactions or functionally
substitute for one of the protein components.
The complexes of RNase inhibitor (RI),1 a 50 kDa leucine￾rich repeat protein, with the ∼14 kDa members of the
mammalian pancreatic RNase superfamily provide an excel￾lent system for investigating these issues. Binding is extra￾ordinarily tight; e.g., Ki values for the interactions of human
placental RI (hRI) with human angiogenin (Ang), a ribo-

Published on Web 07/01/1999nucleolytic enzyme that induces neovascularization (7, 8),
and bovine pancreatic RNase A are <1 and 40 fM,
respectively (9). Consequently, losses of binding free energy
of as much as ∼12-13 kcal/mol can be quantitated, i.e.,
7-8 kcal/mol beyond those which can be measured for most
hormone-receptor or antigen-antibody complexes, and it
is possible to accurately determine the effects of replacing
multiple key residues simultaneously. The interaction of RI
with Ang is of particular interest because of the essential
role Ang has been shown to play in the formation of human
tumors in athymic mice (10, 11). Full-length hRI inhibits
Ang-induced angiogenesis (12) and the growth of syngeneic
tumors in mice (13), but is unlikely to be useful as an
anticancer drug because of its lability, large size, and broad
specificity. Knowledge of the detailed structural basis for
hRI-Ang recognition might enable the development of RI
derivatives with properties more suitable for therapeutic
applications.
Crystal structures have been determined for the complexes
of hRI with Ang (14) and porcine RI (pRI) with RNase A
(15, 16). In each case, 24 enzyme residues interact with 26-
28 residues distributed widely over the inhibitor structure,
which adopts a horseshoe shape formed by symmetrical
arrangement of its 15 tandem repeat units (Figure 1A). The
hot spot paradigm seems to apply in both instances;
individual substitutions within one part of each interface
decrease affinity substantially, whereas numerous replace￾ments outside this region have no appreciable impact (17-
19).
The RI residues identified as most important for interacting
with Ang and RNase A are located primarily on the same
short loop segment, residues 434-438 (panels B and C of
Figure 1). In this study, we have explored further the roles
of intermolecular contacts of these residues and the extent
to which they function independently. We find that the
energetic effects of various replacements within this segment
on affinity for RNase A are less than additive [“subadditive”
(20)], indicating that the binding energy within the hRI‚
RNase A interface may not be as concentrated as suggested
by studying the single-site variants. In contrast, the effects
of eliminating contacts of residues 434-438 with Ang are
largely additive or beyond additive (“superadditive”). Thus,
this segment may assume even greater importance for Ang
binding than was first apparent. These results show that the
basis for the generation of hot spots can be varied and
complex, and emphasize the need to move beyond single￾site mutagenesis in determining the distribution of binding
free energy within protein-protein interfaces.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Materials. Primers were synthesized by Genosys or
Promega. CpA and CpG were purchased from Sigma. RNase
A (type RAF) and bovine serum albumin (RNase-free) (BSA)
were obtained from Worthington. Human Ang (both the
native <Glu1 form and the Met-1/Gln1 derivative), [14C-
(U)]Ang (2700 cpm/µg), the Ang variants R5A, K40G, and
W89M, hRI, and the hRI variants Y434A, D435A, and
Y437A were produced in Escherichia coli as described
previously (18, 19, 21, 22). <Glu1 and Met-1/Gln1 Ang
have identical rate constants for dissociation from hRI (23)
and were used interchangeably for dissociation experiments.
Association rate constants for the two proteins differ
somewhat; only the <Glu1 form was employed for measur￾ing this parameter. RNase A- and Ang-Sepharose were
prepared by the method of Blackburn et al. (24). Buffers
used for kinetic experiments were degassed prior to being
used.
Determination of Protein Concentrations. Concentrations
of RNase A, Ang, and the Ang variants R5A and K40G were
determined spectrophotometrically [for RNase A, 278 ) 9800
M-1 cm-1 (25); for Ang, 280 ) 12500 M-1 cm-1
]; W89M￾Ang was quantitated by amino acid analysis. Concentrations
of hRI and all single-residue hRI variants were based on
measurements of inhibition of RNase A activity (26). The
hRI double mutants Y434A/D435A and Y434A/Y437A were
quantitated by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad); the standard
was a sample of hRI [in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.6)] which was
itself quantitated spectrophotometrically [281 ) 45 000 M-1
cm-1 (F. S. Lee and R. Shapiro, unpublished)].
Site-Directed Mutagenesis and Production of Variant
Proteins. Fragments of hRI cDNA containing the desired
mutations were generated by overlap extension PCR (27)
with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The template was
the expression plasmid pTRP-PRI (21); the external flanking
primers were 5′-GGTGTGACATCAGACAACTGC-3′ [nu￾cleotides 749-769 in the hRI cDNA sequence (28)] and 5′-
TCGACGGATCCCCGGGAATTC-3′ (from the 3′-noncod￾ing region of the plasmid), and the internal mutagenic primers
were 5′-GCTGGTCCTGTTTGACATTTACTGG-3′ and 5′-
AGTAAATGTCAAACAGGACCAGCTG-3′ (Y434F), 5′-
GTACGACATTTTTTGGTCTGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCT￾CAGACCAAAAAATGTCGTACAG-3′ (Y437F), 5′-CTGGT￾CCTGGCTGCTATTTACTGGTCTGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-
CCAGTAAATAGCAGCCAGGACCAGCTGCTCCAGG￾3′ (Y434A/D435A), and 5′-GCTGGTCCTGGCTGACAT￾TGCTTGGTCTGAGGAGATGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCAGACC￾AAGCAATGTCAGCCAGGACCAGCTGCTCC-3′ (Y434A/
Y437A). The final PCR products were digested with StuI
and EcoRI and ligated into pTRP-PRI that had been cleaved
with the same enzymes. DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified
regions in all cases confirmed the presence of the intended
mutations and the absence of any spurious changes. Variants
were expressed in E. coli strain W3110 cells transformed
with the mutant plasmids and were purified by ammonium
sulfateprecipitationandchromatographyonRNaseA-Sepharose
(29) or Ang-Sepharose (19). The final products were
dialyzed into 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.6) containing 50 mM KCl,
8 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 50% glycerol and stored at
-20 °C. Yields were ∼200 µg per liter of culture. SDS￾PAGE analysis revealed that all variants were >95%
homogeneous and were the same size as the native proteins.
The amino acid compositions of all proteins were consistent
with their proposed structures.
Kinetics. (A) Assays. The enzymatic activity of RNase A
was measured spectrophotometrically with 75 µM CpA or
CpG as the substrate (30) in buffer A [0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0)
containing 0.1 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA] and 10 µg/mL

and 3 nM for assays with CpA and CpG, respectively.
(B) Dissociation Rate Constants. Dissociation rate con￾stants for Y434F-hRI‚ and Y437F-hRI‚ligand complexes
were determined by adding to the complex a scavenger for
free inhibitor and then measuring the amount of free ligand
present at various times (9, 19). Incubations were performed
at 25 °C in buffer A, DTT (5 mM with RNase A and 120
µM with Ang), and 100 µg/mL BSA. For incubations with
RNase A (20 nM), the scavenger was Ang (10 µM), and
quantitation of free RNase A was based on the activity of
10-15 µL aliquots toward CpA. The activity of Ang in this
assay is undetectable. For Ang‚inhibitor complexes, 14C￾labeled ligand (0.9-1.4 µM) was used and the scavenger
was unlabeled Ang (20 equiv). Bound and free [14C]Ang in
70-140 µL aliquots of these mixtures were separated by
Mono S cation-exchange chromatography and quantitated
by scintillation counting. Elution was achieved with a 15
min linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.6 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris
(pH 8) at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. As for previous
complexes (see ref 19), dissociation was biphasic, with a
relatively rapid release of some ligand (16-20% for RNase
A and 2-3% for Ang), followed by a slower dissociation
of the remainder. Data for the slower phase (six to nine points
per complex) were fitted to a single-exponential decay
process with SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS) to obtain kd. Dissociation

Nonadditive Effects of “Hot Spot” Mutations Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 9275of RNase A complexes was followed for one or two half￾lives; experiments with Ang complexes were conducted over
8 days, during which 7-10% dissociation occurred.
Dissociation of other Ang complexes and all complexes
of Ang variants was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy
(see below). Incubations were performed in buffer A at 25
°C. Ten minutes after formation of the complex (each
component at 0.1 µM), 1-2 µM W89M-Ang was added as
a scavenger for free hRI or the hRI variant, and the decrease
in Trp fluorescence (see the Results) was followed for at
least six half-lives. Data were fitted to a single-exponential
decay as described above.
(C) Association Rate Constants. Association of hRI and
its derivatives with Ang and Ang variants was assessed by
using the stopped-flow fluorimeter to monitor the enhance￾ment in Trp fluorescence that accompanies complex forma￾tion (26). The conditions were the same as for dissociation
experiments, except that the DTT concentration was 25-50
µM and BSA was not added. The inhibitor concentration
was 50 nM. Association of wild-type Ang complexes was
assessed at four or five concentrations of Ang ranging from
0.25 to 1.5 µM (i.e., under pseudo-first-order conditions in
all cases); between seven and eleven replicates were recorded
at each concentration, and more than five half-lives of the
reaction were used for analysis. Association of the complexes
of Ang variants was examined at a single concentration (100
nM for R5A and 150 nM for K40G); five or six replicate
measurements were taken, and only the first half-life was
used for data analysis to minimize any error due to ligand
depletion. The fluorescence increases were fitted to a single￾or double-exponential decay equation to obtain values of kobs;
for biphasic association, kobs represents the faster rate constant
(see the Results). Data for complexes of wild-type Ang were
plotted as 1/kobs versus 1/[Ang] and fitted by linear regression;
the slope equals 1/ka, where ka is the apparent second-order
rate constant of association (26). The ka values for complexes
of Ang variants represent kobs divided by the ligand concen￾tration. Values of ka for RNase A-inhibitor complexes were
determined from the rate constants for the corresponding Ang
complexes by measuring the competition between the two
ligands for inhibitor in a spectrophotometric assay of RNase
A activity toward CpG (26).
(D) Dissociation Constants. Ki values for all Ang and Ang
variant complexes and for the complexes of RNase A with
Y434F-hRI and Y437F-hRI were calculated from the rate
constants for dissociation and association (Ki ) kd/ka). Ki
values for the complexes of RNase A with the hRI double
mutants Y434A/D435A and Y434A/Y437A were obtained
by measuring enzymatic activity toward CpA in the presence
of five to seven concentrations of inhibitor and performing
nonlinear fits of the data to the equation Vi ) V0/(1 + [I]/Ki)
with SigmaPlot 4.0, where Vi and V0 are initial velocities in
the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively, and [I]
is the inhibitor concentration; the concentration of CpA was
well below Km. A Ki value for the complex of Y434A/
D435A-hRI with Ang was also determined from that for the
RNase A complex by measuring the competition between
the two ligands fluorimetrically. This method is based on
the 1.5-fold difference in the Trp fluorescence emission level
between the Ang‚RI and RNase A‚RI complexes (26).
Spectra of mixtures of 100 nM inhibitor, 150 nM Ang, and
4.5 or 12.4 µM RNase A in buffer A were recorded after
incubation for 45 min at 25 °C; this amount of time is >10
half-lives of dissociation for the two complexes and is
therefore sufficient for reaching equilibrium. The distribu￾tions of inhibitor between the two enzymes were then
determined by reference to spectra of mixtures of 100 nM
inhibitor with either 150 nM Ang or 8.9 µM RNase A using
the emission intensity at 360 nm. The Ki value for the Ang
complex equals the Ki value for the RNase complex
multiplied by [A]F[R]B/[R]F[A]B, where A and R refer to Ang
and RNase A, respectively, and B and F refer to bound and
free, respectively.
(E) Propagation of Standard Error. Standard errors (SEs)
for Ki values equal Ki times the square root of the sum of
the squares of fractional SEs for kd and ka. SEs for values of
∆G ()RT ln Ki) equal RT times the fractional SE for Ki.
SEs for values of ∆∆G [the difference between ∆G values
for wild-type (wt) and variant (var) complexes] are the square
root of the sum of the squares of SEs for ∆Gwt and ∆Gvar.
SEs for values of ∆∆∆G (the difference between the sum
of the ∆∆G values for the single-residue variants and the
observed ∆∆G value for a multiple-residue variant) are the
square root of the sum of the squares of SEs for ∆∆G values
for the multiple-residue variant complex and the single￾residue variant complexes. The calculated SEs in ∆∆G for
all complexes examined here are <0.2 kcal/mol, and in all
but three instances are <0.1 kcal/mol; errors for earlier
complexes (not reported previously) are e0.1 kcal/mol. SEs
for all ∆∆∆G values are e0.2 kcal/mol.
Fluorescence Measurements. Fluorescence spectra were
measured with a Jobin Yvon-Spex FluoroMax-2 fluorimeter.
Excitation was at 285 nm, and emission was recorded from
300 to 400 nm, except in the competition experiment where
excitation was at 295 nm to minimize any contribution of
RNase A tyrosines, and emission was monitored between
340 and 400 nm. Time-based data acquisition on this
instrument was performed at 2.5 s intervals with excitation
at 285 nm (0.7 nm slit) and emission at 365 nm (25 nm
slit). Stopped-flow measurements were performed with an
Applied Photophysics instrument. Excitation was at 285 nm
(2 nm slit), and emission was monitored with a 340 nm band￾pass filter; 2000 data points were collected for each experi￾ment.
RESULTS
Rationale for the Mutational Studies. In the crystal
structure of the hRI‚Ang complex, the side chains of hRI
residues Tyr434, Asp435, and Tyr437 and the main chain
of hRI Trp438 contact Arg5, Lys40, Ala106, Glu108, His114,
and Gln117 of Ang (Figure 1B and Table 1). Replacements
of Asp435 and Arg5 with Ala and Lys40 with Gln were
shown previously to decrease affinity markedly; these effects
can potentially be understood as consequences of eliminating
the H-bonds of Asp435 with Lys40 and Trp438 with Arg5.
The relatively minor change associated with the substitution
of Tyr437 with Ala also seems reasonable, since this residue
only makes five van der Waals contacts with Ang. In
contrast, replacement of Tyr434 by Ala, which also removes
only a relatively small number of van der Waals interactions,
produces a large reduction in complex stability.
The Tyr434 mutation decreases the affinity for RNase A
even more substantially than for Ang; indeed, the loss in
9276 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 Chen and Shapirobinding free energy (∆∆G) of 5.9 kcal/mol is by far the
largest for any substitution in the three proteins. The side
chain of residue 434 forms more extensive interactions with
RNase A (one H-bond and 13 van der Waals contacts; Table
1 and Figure 1C) than with Ang. However, replacement of
Tyr437 eliminates a similar number of interactions and yet
produces a much more modest change in binding strength,
2.6 kcal/mol. [The interactions cited are those in the pRI‚
RNase A complex and are assumed to be present in the hRI
complex as well: the Ki values for the two complexes are
indistinguishable (9, 31), the sequences of hRI (28) and pRI
(32) are 77% identical, and the region under examination is
especially well-conserved.] Substitution of Asp435 in hRI
destabilizes the complex with RNase A to the same degree
as that with Ang, suggesting that similar interactions have
been eliminated. Although the pRI‚RNase A crystal structure
exhibits no H-bonds corresponding to those of Asp435 with
Lys40 in the Ang complex (the analogous lysine, Lys41,
instead binds a sulfate ion from the crystallization medium),
such interactions probably form under the conditions used
for kinetic characterization, where sulfate and similar anions
are not present (14); this would require only a slight
reorientation of the -amino group of Lys41 to a position
already observed for it in some crystal structures of the free
enzyme (33).
The preceding observations raise numerous questions
regarding the interactions of the hRI segment of residues
434-438 with Ang and RNase A, particularly with respect
to the structural bases for the dramatic losses in affinity
associated with replacement of Tyr434. What is the relative
importance of H-bonds versus van der Waals contacts and
the hydrophobic effect in the interactions of Tyr434 and
Tyr437 with RNase A? Does Tyr434 form contacts with
either enzyme that are not apparent from the crystal
structures? Does the Tyr434 mutation disrupt contacts of
other hRI residues? More generally, are the functional effects
of replacing the individual interface residues independent?
We initially addressed these questions by characterizing the
complexes of RNase A and Ang with four new hRI
variants: Y434F, Y437F, Y434A/D435A, and Y434A/
Y437A. Interrelationships within this region of the hRI‚Ang
interface were then investigated further through kinetic
studies on the complexes of R5A-Ang and K40G-Ang with
hRI single and double mutants.

and Ang. The hRI variants Y434F and Y437F were produced

of Asp435 in the RI‚RNase A crystal structure most likely differ from those present under the conditions used for kinetic characterization. (i) The

Nonadditive Effects of “Hot Spot” Mutations Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 9277in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by RNase A-Sepharose
chromatography. Kinetic analysis of their interactions was
performed by standard methods (see Experimental Proce￾dures), and Ki values were calculated from the rate constants
for dissociation (kd) and association (ka). Replacement of
Tyr434 by Phe had essentially no effect on binding of RNase
A (Table 2), indicating that the putative H-bond of this
residue does not contribute to complex stability and that the
attenuated affinity of Y434A is due only to the loss of the
phenyl group. In contrast, replacement of Tyr437 by Phe
weakened the hRI‚RNase A interaction almost to the same
extent (2.1 kcal/mol) as had substitution with Ala (2.6 kcal/
mol). Thus, the OH group rather than the phenyl ring of this
Tyr appears to provide the energetically important interac￾tions.
The Tyr434 f Phe substitution decreased the binding
energy of the Ang complex by 0.6 kcal/mol (vs 3.3 kcal/
mol for the Ala replacement), suggesting that this residue
again participates primarily through its phenyl ring, but that
the OH group may play a minor role as well. Replacement
of Tyr437 with Phe did not alter the affinity significantly,
consistent with the absence of any H-bond for this residue
in the three-dimensional structure.
Interactions of Y434A/D435A-hRI and Y434A/Y437A-hRI
with RNase A. Recombinant Y434A/D435A and Y434A/
Y437A hRIs were prepared in the same manner as the other
variants, except that Ang-Sepharose was used for the final
purification step (19). Binding constants for the complexes
of these variants with RNase A were determined directly by
measuring the extent of inhibition of enzymatic activity, as
had been done previously with Y434A; indeed, dissociation
was too rapid to allow measurement of kd and ka by available
methods. Both hRI mutants bound only 8-9-fold less tightly
than the single Y434A derivative. Thus, the impacts of the
double replacements (Table 3) were 59-fold (Y434A/D435A)
and 10-fold (Y434A/Y437A) smaller than would be expected
if the individual substitutions reduce the affinity by inde￾pendent mechanisms. In energetic terms, the effects of the
replacements are subadditive; the difference (∆∆∆G) be￾tween the sum of ∆∆G values for the single-residue variants
and the measured ∆∆G value for the double-mutant complex
is 2.4 kcal/mol for the 434 and 435 pair and 1.3 kcal/mol
for the 434 and 437 pair.
Interactions of Y434A/D435A-hRI and Y434A/Y437A-hRI
with Angiogenin. Attempts to measure Ki values for the
complexes of Ang with the hRI double mutants by the
standard method were unsuccessful because neither complex
remained intact during the chromatographic procedure that
was used to quantitate bound and free Ang in dissociation
experiments. Thus, it was necessary to develop an alternative
approach for determining affinity. The ribonucleolytic activ￾ity of Ang is extremely weak (8), precluding measurement
of Ki by enzymatic assay. Instead, a fluorescence-based
technique for monitoring dissociation was devised. Lee and
co-workers had demonstrated that the fluorescence of the
complex of Ang (which contains a single tryptophan, at
position 89) and hRI (with six Trps) is twice that of the
oxindolylalanine-89-Ang complex (26), and that Trp￾oxidized Ang binds almost as tightly as the wild-type protein
(17). These findings suggested that kd values for the
complexes of Ang with Y434A/D435A-hRI and Y434A/
Y437A-hRI could be determined by adding to the com￾plexes excess Trp-modified Ang and then following the
decrease in fluorescence as the inhibitor dissociates from Ang
and binds to the Ang derivative. The feasibility of this
approach was tested with the Ang variant W89M (22) rather
than with the oxidized protein, which is more difficult to
prepare.
Met substitution of Trp89 had no significant effect on
complex stability (results not shown). Addition of W89M￾Ang to wild-type hRI produced a several-nanometer blue
shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum; the maximum
was 10% lower than that for hRI itself (Figure 2). Addition
of a 10-fold molar excess of this protein to the Ang‚Y434A/
D435A-hRI complex induced a ∼30% decrease in fluores￾cence emission that occurred with a half-life of 4.3 min
(Figure 3), i.e., 24400-fold faster than for the wild-type
complex (t1/2 ) 73 days) (Table 3). Dissociation of the Ang‚

9278 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 Chen and ShapiroY434A/Y437A-hRI complex was accelerated almost as
much, by a factor of 16 000.
The effects of the hRI double mutations on association
were investigated by the standard stopped-flow fluorimetric
method with a fixed concentration of inhibitor and multiple
concentrations of Ang ranging from a 4- to a 30-fold molar
excess. In all instances, the fluorescence increase that
accompanied complex formation was markedly biphasic (see
Figure 4), whereas a single-exponential process had been
observed for the wild-type complex and for every variant
complex examined previously. The data fit well to a double￾exponential equation, with rate constants for the two
processes differing by a factor of at least 6 at all Ang
concentrations.
Because of the unusual association behavior, it was not
immediately apparent how to obtain values for ka from the
stopped-flow data. This calculation is straightforward for the
wild-type complex, where association of Ang (E) and hRI
(I) occurs by a two-step kinetic mechanism in which rapid
formation of a loose complex EI (dissociation constant K1
) 0.3 µM) is followed by a slower isomerization to the tight
complex EI* (rate constant k2 ) 80 s-1
) (26; values cited
are from ref 19). The initial E + I a EI equilibrium for the
wild-type complex is established within the dead time of the
instrument (<1 ms), and the subsequent fluorescence change,
which is a single-exponential process, reflects conversion
of EI and remaining E + I to EI*. The rate constant for this
process, kobs, equals k-2 + k2[Ang]/(K1 + [Ang]) (k-2 is the
rate constant for the reverse isomerization and can be ignored
for most complexes); ka equals k2/K1 and is determined from
the dependence of kobs on Ang concentration (see Experi￾mental Procedures). For the hRI double mutants, the calcula￾tion is less straightforward. One obvious potential explanation
for the biphasic association of the complexes of these variants
is that the amino acid replacements have prolonged the first
step to the point where it is observable. In this case, the
slower of the two processes would correspond to the single
phase seen with the wild-type complex. Alternatively, the
faster process might correspond to that normally measured
(i.e., EI f EI*), with formation of EI still taking place during
the dead time and the slower phase reflecting an additional
step in the inhibition mechanism or an experimental artifact.
Values for ka determined on the basis of these two
interpretations differ substantially. Three considerations,
taken together, strongly support the latter view and indicate
that ka can be calculated by treating the rate constant for the
faster process as kobs in the standard procedure. (1) Most of
the fluorescence increase with the wild-type complex is due
to the conversion of EI to EI* rather than to formation of EI
(R. Shapiro, unpublished results); between 70 and 85% of
the fluorescence increase with the double mutants is associ￾ated with the faster process. (2) The dependence of the faster
rate constant on Ang concentration for Y434A/D435A is
linear over the entire range of concentrations examined,
reaching a value of 105 s-1 at 1.5 µM Ang. If these rates
reflect EI f EI*, then both K1 and k2 are much larger than
for wild-type hRI (see above), as was the case for the Y434A
and D435A single-residue variants (19). However, if the
faster rate constants reflect E + I a EI, then k2, as derived
from data for the slower phase, would be considerably
smaller than for wild-type inhibitor (K1 would be unchanged);
i.e., the effect of the double substitution on k2 would be the
opposite of that for the single replacements. (3) An ap￾FIGURE 2: Fluorescence emission spectra of hRI (s) and the

Nonadditive Effects of “Hot Spot” Mutations Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 9279proximate Ki value for the Y434A/D435A-hRI‚Ang complex
obtained by fluorimetric examination of competition between
Ang and RNase A (see Experimental Procedures) is consis￾tent with the ka value calculated from the faster phase. This
experiment indicated that Ang binds 100-200-fold more
tightly than RNase A (i.e., with a Ki of 28-56 pM). (A more
precise determination could not be performed because of
technical limitations.) Together with the value for kd mea￾sured above, this sets ka to 4.8-9.6 × 107 M-1 s-1.
The ka values for the Ang complexes with Y434A/D435A
and Y434A/Y437A based on the more rapid process were
7.0 × 107 and 5.9 × 107 M-1 s-1
, respectively, several-fold
lower than for the wild-type complex. These changes in
association are much smaller than the effects on dissociation,
as has generally been the case with mutations that substan￾tially weaken protein-protein interactions (19, 34, 35). The
calculated Ki value for the Y434A/D435A complex (39 pM)
is equivalent to that predicted if the effects of the mutations
at positions 434 and 435 are completely additive (∆∆∆G )
0). However, the Ki for the Y434A/Y437A complex (29 pM)
is 74-fold higher than expected for simple additivity; i.e.,
the effects of the replacements at positions 434 and 437 are
markedly superadditive, with ∆∆∆G being equal to -2.5
kcal/mol. Both findings stand in stark contrast to the strong
subadditivities observed with the RNase A complexes.
Consequently, the impacts of each double mutation on Ang
and RNase A binding are nearly the same, although the single
replacements at positions 434 and 437 reduced the affinity
for RNase A to a much greater extent than that for Ang.
Interactions of Ang Variants R5A and K40G with hRI
Single and Double Mutants. hRI Trp438 interacts with Ang
primarily through its main chain, whose oxygen atom forms
two H-bonds with the guanidino group of Arg5. Therefore,
additivities involving the interactions of this residue were
assessed through the use of R5A-Ang. Dissociation of all
R5A complexes was rapid enough to measure by the
fluorescence method; for the complex with Y434A/D435A￾hRI, it was so fast that it could be followed only with the
stopped-flow instrument. Association was monitored as for
the complexes with wild-type Ang, except that a single
concentration of R5A-Ang, well below K1, was used; in the
one instance where the fluorescence increase was biphasic
(with Y434A/Y437A), the ka value was calculated from the
faster process, as described above.
The effects of replacing Ang Arg5 and Tyr434, Asp435,
or both on hRI were all superadditive, with ∆∆∆G values
ranging from -0.9 to -1.4 kcal/mol (Table 4). The impact
of the three simultaneous replacements was particularly
dramatic; the Ki for the triple mutant complex was 10 nM,
i.e., (2.7 × 107
)-fold higher than for the wild type, and the
t1/2 for dissociation was only 1.1 s. The effects of substituting
Arg5 and both Tyr434 and Tyr437 were even more strongly
superadditive (∆∆∆G ) -2.1 kcal/mol), although the Ki
value for this complex was somewhat lower, 0.7 nM.
The Ang variant K40G was used to investigate further the
interactions of Lys40 with Asp435 and Tyr434 of hRI as
well as to assess additional interrelationships within this
interface region. The K40G complexes were characterized
in the same manner as those of R5A-Ang; association was
biphasic except with Y434A/Y437A. A previous study in
which K40G was used (19) had measured kd, but not ka, for
the complex with wild-type hRI. The missing parameter was
now determined so that the Ki value for this complex could
be calculated. The resultant ∆∆G value, 3.2 kcal/mol (Table
4), was similar to that produced by Ala substitution of
Asp435, the H-bonding partner of Lys40 (3.5 kcal/mol). The
∆∆G values for replacing Lys40 and Asp435 within the
context of the Ang‚Y434A-hRI complex also agreed closely
(3.3 and 3.5 kcal/mol, respectively). Replacement of Lys40
in the Ang‚D435A-hRI complex produced only a small
additional effect (0.6 kcal/mol), and substitution of this
residue in the Ang‚Y434A/D435A-hRI complex in fact
increased affinity slightly (by 0.4 kcal/mol). Thus, the effects
of replacing Ang Lys40 and hRI Asp435 are almost entirely
nonadditive, whereas those of substituting Lys40 and hRI
Tyr434 are fully additive, as for the combination of residues
434 and 435 (Table 3).
In contrast, replacing Ang Lys40 together with hRI Tyr437
revealed strong superadditivity (∆∆∆G ) -2.4 kcal/mol),
similar to that measured for the complex of Ang with Y434A/
Y437A-hRI. A somewhat smaller superadditivity (∆∆∆G
) -1.8 kcal/mol) was observed when all three mutations
were incorporated. The Ki for binding of K40G-Ang to
Y434A/Y437A-hRI (1.9 nM) was the second highest for any
of the complexes that were examined, as was the kd value.
Association was 28-fold slower than for the wild-type
complex, by far the largest change observed for this
parameter.

9280 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 Chen and ShapiroDISCUSSION
Nature of the Hot Spot in the hRI‚RNase A Binding
Interface. The results of earlier mutational studies showed
that the region of the hRI‚RNase A interface containing hRI
residues Tyr434, Asp435, Tyr437, and Ser460 constitutes
an energetic hot spot (19). Residues 434, 435, and 437 lie
on a single loop, with Ser460 juxtaposed next to them in
the three-dimensional structure; this cluster blocks the active
center of RNase A, contacting the P1 catalytic site (Lys41
and His119), B2 purine-binding subsite (Gln69, Asn71,
Ala109, and Glu111), and the P2 phosphate-binding subsite
(Lys7) (the subsite nomenclature is from ref 36). Individual
mutations of these hRI residues decreased the binding energy
by 2.6-5.9 kcal/mol. Substitutions of five others (Glu287,
Lys320, Glu401, Cys408, and Arg457) produced much
smaller changes, although all of these amino acids form
H-bonds or salt bridges in the crystal structure. Deletion of
the internal segment of residues 315-371, which eliminates
the interactions of all 10 contact residues between the
N-terminus and residue 371 because of the horseshoe shape
of the inhibitor, increased Ki only by 630-fold (29). None
of the nine contact residues on hRI still to be investigated
interact extensively with RNase A in the crystal structure of
the complex, and only one forms an H-bond. Six of them
are neighbors of residues 434-437 and/or 460 that may also
contribute to the hot spot.
The mutagenesis results indicated that Tyr434 is the hRI
residue most important for binding RNase A. However, the
nature of its role is not obvious from the crystal structure.
The H-bond between the Tyr OH group and the carbonyl O
of RNase A Leu35 appears to be weak (donor-acceptor
distance of 3.4 Å), and this is now supported by the finding
that Y434F-hRI is functionally indistinguishable from the
wild-type inhibitor (Table 2). The phenyl ring of Tyr434
forms numerous van der Waals contacts with RNase A and
becomes almost completely buried in the complex [solvent￾accessible surface area (ASA) decreases from 73 to 6 Å2].
In principle, these contacts and the hydrophobic effect might
provide appreciable binding energy. However, elimination
of the phenyl group of Tyr437, which forms nearly as many
interactions and undergoes a still larger decrease in ASA
(from 102 Å2 in free RI to 6 Å2 in the complex), had only
a minor effect; ∆∆G for Phe437 f Ala is 0.5 kcal/mol, i.e.,
5.3 kcal/mol smaller than that for Phe434 f Ala (Table 2).
Moreover, the burying of Tyr434 in the interface appears to
have an energetic cost; it requires an ∼180° rotation of the
side chain of Arg39, whose positions in the structures of
free RNase A and RNase-nucleotide complexes conflict
with that occupied by Tyr434 in the RI complex (16).
Results obtained in this study with Y434A/D435A-hRI and
Y434A/Y437A-hRI suggest that in fact much of the contri￾bution of Tyr434 to binding of RNase A is indirect. The
losses in binding energy for both double mutations are
strongly subadditive, implying that Tyr434 is functionally
coupled to Asp435 and Tyr437 in the complex. One plausible
basis for this would be that removal of the Tyr434 side chain
attenuates the interactions of the other residues. In this case,
the portion of ∆∆G for Y434A-hRI that is attributable to
indirect effects on Asp435 and Tyr437 could be as high as
63% (3.7 kcal/mol), since ∆∆G values for replacement of
Asp435 in wild-type and Y434A-hRI differ by 2.4 kcal/mol
and ∆∆G values for replacement of Tyr437 in these two
RIs differ by 1.3 kcal/mol.
An alternative or additional basis for the observed
couplings would be that substitutions of Asp435 and Tyr437
each impair the interactions of Tyr434. This would imply
that the direct energetic contributions of Asp435 and Tyr437
are much smaller than the ∆∆G values measured for the
Ala variants. Although this possibility cannot be excluded,
we note that the changes in binding energy produced by
replacing residues 435 and 437 are more readily understand￾able than that engendered by mutating residue 434. The ∆∆G
value for D435A-hRI (3.6 kcal/mol) is reasonable for the
loss of the putative H-bonds with Lys41; indeed, the similar
effect of mutating Asp435 in the hRI‚Ang complex seems
to be almost entirely due to disruption of the corresponding
interactions (see below). The ∆∆G values for removal of
the Tyr437 OH and phenyl groups are 2.1 and 0.5 kcal/mol,
respectively. The first of these values is not excessive for
the loss of the two H-bonds of the OH moiety, both of which
are well-buried and one of which is short (donor-acceptor
distance of 2.7 Å). The second value is low, rather than high,
in view of the 10 van der Waals contacts and extensive
burying of the phenyl ring in the complex. The preceding
considerations also argue against another potential explana￾tion for the subadditive effects of the mutations of the 434
and 435 and 434 and 437 pairs, i.e., that the replacement
pairs have common negative effects on solvent structure or
on energetically significant interactions of other residues.
Moreover, thermal denaturation studies have shown that Ala
substitutions of Tyr434 and Asp435 do not perturb the overall
hRI structure (19).
Functional coupling between Tyr434 and Asp435 is not
surprising given the short distance (5.7 Å) separating these
residues and the contact residue on RNase, Lys41, that they
share. Tyr434 might strengthen the 435-41 H-bonds by
aligning the two residues optimally and/or by shielding them
from solvent. The conformational change in RNase A
associated with binding of Tyr434 might also help to improve
these bonds. It is more difficult to envision how Tyr434 is
linked to Tyr437, as these residues are 13 Å apart, and their
contacts on RNase A approach no closer than ∼7 Å (the
major Tyr434 contact, Lys41, is separated from the Tyr437
H-bonding partners Asn71 and Glu111 by even greater
distances, 16-18 Å). Perhaps the loss of the side chain of
residue 434 alters the local RI backbone structure in a manner
that propagates to residue 437, which is on the same loop.
The pRI‚RNase A crystal structure indicates ways in which
Tyr434 might influence interactions of RI residues Glu401
and Ser460 as well. The two H-bonds between Glu401 and
Arg39 of RNase A are able to form only because of the
movement of the Arg side chain facilitated or induced by
Tyr434; elimination of these H-bonds by Ala substitution
of Glu401 decreases the complex stability by 1.3 kcal/mol
(unpublished data). van der Waals contacts of Tyr434 with
Ser460 might help to optimize the H-bonds of the Ser with
Lys7 and Gln11 of RNase A; removal of the Ser460
interactions produces a ∆∆G value of 3.5 kcal/mol (19).
In summary, the present findings suggest that Tyr434
serves as a key linchpin that functions largely by enhancing
interactions of other residues within, and possibly beyond,
the hot spot region of the hRI‚RNase A interface rather than
by forming strong direct contacts of its own. A more detailed
Nonadditive Effects of “Hot Spot” Mutations Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 9281understanding of the elaborate role of this residuesand,
indeed, confirmation of this hypothesissmust await the
outcome of further mutational and crystallographic studies.
Nonetheless, it is already clear that the residues within the
hot spot of the RI‚RNase A interface do not function
independently and that the effects of single-residue mutations
overestimate the contributions of some or all of these amino
acids.
Nature of the Hot Spot in the hRI‚Ang Binding Interface.
As with the RNase A complex, mutagenesis results point to
the existence of a hot spot in the hRI‚Ang interface
encompassing loop residues 434-438 and its neighbor
residue 460 on hRI and the P1/B2/P2 portion of the enzyme
active site. Replacements of four amino acids in this region
(hRI Tyr434 and Asp435 and Ang Arg5 and Lys40)
increased Ki substantially (∆∆G ) 2.3-4.2 kcal/mol), and
substitutions of four others (hRI Tyr437 and Ser460 and Ang
His8 and His114) produced smaller, but significant, changes
(∆∆G ) 0.6-1.3 kcal/mol). Replacements of three Ang
residues (Arg31, Arg32, and Trp89) that form H-bonds and
extensive van der Waals contacts with hRI in other parts of
the interface had little or no impact. Indeed, the results of
preliminary single-site mutagenesis studies on the remainder
of the interface suggest that no residues outside the key
region already identified make large energetic contributions
(R. Shapiro, unpublished).
Most of the effects of single-site substitutions within the
hot spot are readily understandable from the crystal structure
of the hRI‚Ang complex. Replacements of hRI Asp435 and
Ang Lys40, residues which are linked by two well-buried,
medium-length H-bonds and three van der Waals interac￾tions, decrease the binding free energy by 3.5 and 3.2-4.2
kcal/mol, respectively (Tables 1 and 4). Although each of
these amino acids forms additional intermolecular interac￾tions (Asp435 with Gln117 directly and with Asp41 and
Leu115 via water; Lys40 with Tyr434), the present findings
suggest that only their contacts with each other are energeti￾cally important. (i) ∆∆G values for Asp435 f Ala and
Lys40 f Gly are nearly identical; (ii) the effects of replacing
Asp435 and Lys40 are almost entirely nonadditive, and (iii)
the effects of mutating Lys40 and Tyr434 are fully additive.
Substitution of Ang Arg5 by Ala decreases the binding
energy by 2.3 kcal/mol; this residue forms two H-bonds with
Trp438 of hRI, a water-mediated H-bond with Ile436, and
van der Waals contacts with Trp438, Ser439, and Glu440.
Presumably, the strongest of these interactions are the direct
H-bonds, although neither is optimal; one is well-buried but
long, and the other is short but only partially buried.
Replacement of hRI Tyr437 by Ala produces a relatively
minor change in affinity (∆∆G ) 0.8 kcal/mol), and mutation
to Phe has no effect (Table 2). This is again consistent with
the crystal structure, where Tyr437 makes a small number
of van der Waals contacts with Ala106, Glu108, and His114
of Ang and does not form any H-bonds. Deletion of hRI
Ser460, which eliminates the H-bonds of this residue with
His8 and Gln12 of Ang, yields a ∆∆G value of 1.3 kcal/
mol.
The basis for the 3.3 kcal/mol loss in binding energy that
results from mutating hRI Tyr434 to Ala is less evident from
the crystal structure. The phenyl group of this residue forms
several van der Waals contacts with the alkyl portion of Ang
Lys40 and becomes almost fully buried upon complex
formation. As just noted, the effects of replacing Tyr434 and
Lys40 are entirely independent, suggesting that the interac￾tions between these two amino acids do not make an
important contribution. Nonetheless, the hydrophobic effect
still might account for much of the reduced affinity of
Y434A-hRI for Ang; i.e., it is possible that removal of the
Lys40 side chain does not increase significantly the acces￾sibility of the Tyr434 phenyl group to solvent. In addition,
the ∆∆G value of 0.6 kcal/mol for replacement of Tyr434
by Phe (Table 2) suggests that the OH group of the tyrosine
may form a weak H-bond not observed in the X-ray structure,
where its oxygen atom is 3.7 Å from the nearest potential
partner (Pro38 O). It is also possible that the phenyl group
forms a more favorable set of interactions under the
conditions used for the kinetic experiments than it does in
the crystal. [We note, however, that the complex is extremely
stable (t1/2 ≈ 70 days) in solution under the crystallization
conditions (14).] In addition, Tyr434 might provide binding
energy by altering the arrangement of the solvent at the
protein surfaces; this is particularly difficult to assess because
the structure of free hRI has not been determined.
Tyr434 does not appear to contribute to binding of Ang
via the indirect mechanism proposed for it in the RNase A
complex. The effects of replacing this residue and Asp435
are completely additive, and the effects of mutating it
together with hRI Tyr437 and/or Ang Arg5 are superadditive.
The simplest interpretation of these findings is that Tyr434
and Asp435 are functionally independent and that replace￾ment of Tyr434 does not reduce (and might increase; see
below) the contributions of Tyr437 and Arg5. These addi￾tivities also provide further evidence that the loss of the side
chain of residue 434 does not cause any general perturbation
of the inhibitor structure. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that the Tyr434 substitution attenuates specific
interactions of residues other than those examined here. For
example, removal of the two short (3.2 and 3.4 Å) van der
Waals contacts of the residue 434 phenyl ring with Ser460
CB might affect the H-bonds of residue 460 OG with His8
and Gln12 of Ang.
Superadditive mutational effects are found whenever hRI
Tyr437 or Ang Arg5 is replaced together with the other
residues that have been examined (Tables 3 and 4). They
are particularly large for the combinations of Tyr437 with
Tyr434 and with Ang Lys40, which give ∆∆∆G values of
-2.5 and -2.4 kcal/mol, respectively. ∆∆∆G values for
replacements of Arg5 and Tyr434, Asp435, or both are
smaller (-0.9 to -1.4 kcal/mol). The superadditivities
associated with mutations of Arg5 and Tyr437 do not seem
to be independent, as ∆∆∆G for the 434, 437, 5 triple
combination is about the same as for the 434 and 437 pair
by itself. These findings suggest that the hot spot residues
fall into two groups, Tyr434, Asp435, and Lys40 and Tyr437
and Arg5; the effects of eliminating multiple interactions
within each group are additive, whereas mutations involving
both groups give superadditive effects. All of the super￾additivities measured are highly significant since the errors
in the ∆∆∆G values are in the range of 0.1-0.2 kcal/mol.
Moreover, the effects would be even larger if our decision
to calculate ka values for biphasic associations from the faster,
rather than the slower, process was incorrect.
One potential physical basis for the observed superaddi￾tivities is that replacement of one residue within the pair or
9282 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 Chen and Shapirogroup strengthens the contacts of others. For example, once
the side chain of hRI Tyr437 or Ang Arg5 is removed, hRI
Tyr434 and Ang Lys40 might form more effective interac￾tions with each other, and the Asp435‚‚‚Lys40 H-bonds
might also be improved; this would imply that the actual
energetic contributions of Tyr437 and Arg5 in the wild-type
complex are larger than the effects of single-site mutations.
Conversely, losses of the Tyr434 and Lys40 side chains
might enhance the contacts of Tyr437, allowing this residue
to pack better or to form a strong H-bond with Glu108 (the
residue 437 OH and residue 108 OE2 are slightly beyond
H-bonding distance in the wild-type complex), or perhaps
to engage in a cation-π interaction (37) with His114; this
would imply that the free energy losses for the individual
Tyr434 and Lys40 replacements underestimate the true
importance of these residues in the wild-type complex.
Similarly, substitutions of Tyr434 and Lys40 might serve to
strengthen the H-bonds of Ang Arg5 with Trp438 of hRI.
This type of negative cooperativity might reflect the difficulty
of optimizing multiple interactions simultaneously when the
evolutionary driving force is not only to maximize affinity
but also to maintain broad specificity (hRI must bind tightly
to all members of the RNase superfamily; see ref 38).
An alternative explanation for superadditivity is that the
loss of the interactions of one residue is offset by the
formation of entirely new interactions by other residues
within the group. This would require at least some localized
structural rearrangements of hRI, Ang, or both. In this regard,
it should be noted that the loop that contains residues 434-
438 makes relatively few interactions with other structural
elements on hRI and therefore might be quite flexible. This
mechanism of superadditivity would again imply that some
of the interactions in this region make greater contributions
than is apparent from the single-residue replacements.
In principle, superadditive effects could also result if
multiresidue substitutions weaken or disrupt the interactions
of other residues but the individual replacements do not. In
this case, the basis for the observed superadditivities in fact
would be similar to that proposed above for the subaddi￾tivities in the RNase A complex. Although this possibility
cannot be ruled out entirely, it seems unlikely because ∆∆∆G
values for the triple mutations of Tyr434, Asp435, and Arg5,
Tyr434, Tyr437, and Arg5, and Tyr434, Tyr437, and Lys40
are all similar to or greater than those for any of the double
mutations.
In light of these considerations, we conclude that the hot
spot in the hRI‚Ang interface plays an even more critical
role than had been suggested by earlier studies with single￾residue variants. Elimination of the interactions of only three
of the residues in this site (Tyr434, Asp435, and Arg5)
together decreases the binding free energy by 10.1 kcal/mol
(47% of the total). Replacement of a fourth residue, Tyr437,
would be expected to have a significant further effect since
in all variant and variant‚variant complexes examined this
substitution reduced the binding energy by >1.5 kcal/mol.
The interactions of Ser460 might also add to the overall
contribution of this region; the ∆∆G value for deletion of
this residue in the wild-type complex is 1.3 kcal/mol, and
the results of preliminary studies (R. Shapiro, unpublished)
indicate that the energy losses for double mutations involving
Ser460 are superadditive.
Implications for Protein-Protein Interactions in General.
Single-site mutagenesis has been used extensively to inves￾tigate the distribution of binding free energy within protein￾protein interfaces. Although the maps obtained, in conjunc￾tion with the corresponding crystal structures, provide critical
information on the molecular basis for binding affinity, they
do not reveal how the whole is generated from its parts. This
issue is commonly addressed, as it is in this study, by
replacing two or more residues both separately and together
and comparing the effects that are produced (39-41). If the
∆∆G value for the multiple mutation equals the sum of those
for the individual mutations [i.e., if ∆∆∆G (sometimes
termed “∆∆Gint”) is zero], this suggests that the residues are
functionally independent. Positive ∆∆∆G values obtained
when two residues on the different protein partners are
replaced are taken to be quantitative measures of the energy
of the interaction between the residues as long as the
mutations have not produced secondary effects, e.g., on
protein or solvent structure. Although such complications
can be ignored in many cases, there are numerous examples
where they clearly come into play since significantly positive
∆∆G values (i.e., subadditivities) are measured for residues
that form no direct pairwise or triangulated contacts (20, 42,
43).
Early studies in which multiple sites were mutated on the
same protein partner showed the effects to be fully additive
as a rule (44, 45). However, many instances of subadditivity
have now been documented (46, 47). Indeed, this phenom￾enon must be quite prevalent because the sum of ∆∆G values
for single-residue mutants is much greater than the ∆G value
for virtually all complexes that have been examined; in the
most striking cases, Σ∆∆G and ∆G differ by nearly a factor
of 4 (48, 49). The subadditivities observed previously have
generally involved interface residues that are neighbors, and
can often be explained qualitatively in terms of intramo￾lecular contacts. The effect of the hRI Tyr434/Asp435 double
replacement on the affinity for RNase A reported here
constitutes yet another example of this situation. In contrast,
the coupling between the hRI Tyr434 and Tyr437 side chains
in binding RNase A occurs over a distance of >13 Å and
does not seem to reflect any direct or mediated interactions.
The paucity of analogous cases in the literature probably
reflects the limited extent to which studies on protein-protein
complexes have examined interrelationships between distant
residues on the same protein, as compared to those on the
two interacting proteins. This type of long-range thermody￾namic coupling within proteins has been seen for both protein
folding (50) and enzymatic systems (see refs 20 and 51).
Superadditive mutational effects such as those observed
here for the hRI‚Ang complex seem to be much rarer. Indeed,
we are not aware of any reported previously that are strictly
comparable. Jin and Wells (47) found that the affinity
decreases produced by Ala replacements of key antibody￾binding determinants on human growth hormone became
4-20-fold greater when groups of five to nine neighboring
residues were also mutated to Ala (i.e., ∆∆∆G values ranged
from -0.8 to -1.8 kcal/mol). These superadditivities differ
from those measured in this study in that they involve larger
sets of mutations and can potentially be explained by the
close proximity of the various replacement sites. The most
substantial ∆∆∆G values for the hRI‚Ang complex were
obtained for the double mutations 434(hRI)/437(hRI) and
Nonadditive Effects of “Hot Spot” Mutations Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 9283437(hRI)/40(Ang); these side chain pairs are separated by
at least 13.6 and 13.4 Å, respectively (the shortest distances
between the two residues; CG-CG and CG-NZ, respec￾tively), and there are no apparent links between them other
than the main chain. The 434(hRI)/5(Ang) combination gives
a somewhat smaller ∆∆∆G value for residues that are
similarly separated (>12.6 Å; CG-NH2). Outside of protein￾protein complexes, superadditivities have been seen in protein
folding and enzymatic systems (compiled in refs 20 and 51),
but these are likely to have very different physical meanings.
The same types of secondary physicochemical effects of
mutations that are usually invoked to account for subaddi￾tivity can also apply to superadditivity. These include
changes in local or global protein conformation, solvent
structure, electrostatic fields or dielectric constants, and
protein dynamic properties. However, whereas subadditivity
for protein-protein complexes reflects the fragility of the
specific intermolecular interactions (i.e., how easily the loss
of one interaction can impact on others), superadditivity
reflects the plasticity and adaptability of the interface (i.e.,
how readily the interactions lost can be compensated for).
Clearly, this latter property is particularly beneficial when
one protein component must evolve to recognize multiple
ligands of diverse structure as in the RI-RNase/Ang system,
where the sequences of the targets are only ∼25-35%
identical. Nonetheless, it seems likely that detailed studies
of additional protein-protein complexes will reveal that
superadditivity has been widely utilized in nature.
Nonadditivity has enormous implications for the interpre￾tation of binding energy hot spots identified by single-site
mutagenesis. As seen for the two hRI complexes, such sites
can be either “hotter” or “less hot” than they appear. In the
examples presented here, the binding energy within the key
region was overestimated due to subadditivity and underes￾timated as a result of superadditivity. However, each type
of nonadditivity can have the opposite outcome as well. If
some residues function largely to support the hot spot, as
proposed for the complex of human growth hormone with
its receptor, then the effects of mutating them together with
the critical amino acids will be subadditive, and this would
now mean that the binding energy is in reality more focused
than it appeared from the single-residue replacements (52).
If the effects of mutating combinations of non-hot spot
residues are superadditive, this would indicate that these
residues are more important (and the interaction energy less
concentrated) than they seemed to be on the basis of the
individual substitutions.
The extent to which binding free energy is localized within
hot spots has obvious ramifications for the design of small
molecules that block or mimic protein-protein interfaces;
in general, the more concentrated the energy is, the more
likely it is that these agents can be developed. Indeed, in
cases where the critical region comprises a single small
segment, it may be possible to utilize this peptide directly if
appropriate constraints can be introduced to achieve the
correct conformation. At the same time, complex inter￾relationships among the crucial residues, such as those
observed for the hRI interactions, might make this task more
difficult even when the key site is very compact. If residues
exhibit positive cooperativity (i.e., if mutational effects are
subadditive), then subtle deviations from optimal positioning
for a single amino acid can weaken multiple interactions and
thereby decrease affinity dramatically. If negative cooper￾ativity exists (i.e., if mutational effects are superadditive),
then it might be extremely challenging to maintain strong
interactions of multiple residues simultaneously. Moreover,
caution must be exercised when deciding which elements
of the hot spot region to incorporate into the designed
molecule. A residue that is dispensable in one context may
be extremely important in another that differs only slightly;
e.g., Tyr437 appears to make a much larger contribution to
binding Ang as part of Y434A than as part of wild-type hRI.
However, it might also be possible to exploit negative
cooperativity to increase affinity, if methods can be devised
for uncoupling the various residues so that they can all fulfill
their full binding potential in the presence of the others.
