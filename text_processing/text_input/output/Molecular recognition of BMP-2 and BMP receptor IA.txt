BMP signaling requires the binding of two types of receptor
serine/threonine kinases1,2. The ‘wrist’ epitope of BMP-2 binds BMP
receptor type IA (BRIA) and type IB (BRIB), whereas the ‘knuckle’
epitope binds BMP receptor type II and activin receptor type II3. The
interaction of BMP with the receptor chains is under stringent control
of modulator proteins that bind to the ligand and, by blocking it, 
prevent receptor activation and signaling4–6. These proteins form
three distinct families, the noggin, chordin-SOG and DAN-cerberus
families, defined by the spacing between cysteine residues7. The crystal
structure of the noggin–BMP-7 complex has recently been described8.
In accordance with previous findings that noggin interferes with
BMP’s binding to both receptor types9, structural analysis showed that
the noggin binding sites of BMPs overlap with the wrist and knuckle
epitopes for receptor binding. The ‘functional’ epitope of BMPs—
the pattern of residues determining specificity and affinity of noggin
binding—is not known. The proteins of the noggin, chordin and DAN
families have different specificities and affinities for different BMPs5.
Thus, different binding epitopes are likely to exist on the BMPs, and it
will be interesting to learn how these binding epitopes are constructed,
how they overlap with the receptor-binding wrist and knuckle 
epitopes, and whether inhibitors could be generated that are specific
for each type.
A medium-resolution structure analysis of the complex formed by
BMP-2 and the ectodomain of its high-affinity receptor BRIA showed
that the epitope of each protein comprises about 24 residues, burying a
total surface area of 2,310 Å2 on contact10. Many possible hydrogen
bonds seem to exist at the interface, involving side chain and main
chain donors and acceptors. A hydrophobic ‘knob in hole’ contact has
been postulated to determine specificity and possibly affinity for type I
receptor binding. However, an extensive mutational analysis of BMP-2
(ref. 3) and the BRIA receptor ectodomain11 showed no major binding
determinants at the interface, but numerous weak determinants. Thus,
it remains unclear whether the binding affinity of this interface is gen￾erated through many weak interactions or whether there are major
binding determinants that have so far escaped detection owing to
experimental limitations.
The present study was carried out to provide reliable data for future
structure-based molecular design of pharmacologically useful
inhibitors of specific BMPs. We tried to identify the main determi￾nants of BMP-2 for type I receptor binding through (i) a high￾resolution structure analysis of the complex to obtain a precise geom￾etry for the hydrogen bonds; (ii) mutational analyses to vary side chain
(alanine, phenylalanine) and main chain (proline) hydrogen bond
determinants; (iii) interaction analysis of all variants to determine
their affinity for the receptor ectodomains and the human modulatory
proteins noggin, chordin domains CR1 (cysteine-rich domain-1) and
CR3, and gremlin; (iv) determination of the biological activity of the
variants in human promyoblast C2C12 cells and the mouse embryonal
carcinoma–derived clonal cell line ATDC5.
RESULTS
Hydrogen bonding in the BMP-2–BRIAEC complex
The interface of BMP-2 and BRIA is distinct from other growth 
factor–receptor interfaces. The binding epitope of BMP-2 is highly
hydrophobic, with almost 60% of the contact surface area of 1,150 Å2
provided by hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1a,b). As compared with the
binding epitopes of other growth factors, such as human growth 
hormone12, interleukin-4 (ref. 13), erythropoietin14 or interleukin-6
(ref. 15), the hydrophobic contact area of BMP-2 is quite large. A
hydrophobic wrist epitope seems to be characteristic of ligands of the
TGF-β superfamily, as shown by structure-based sequence alignment.
The knuckle epitope also has a hydrophobic core, as seen in the struc￾tures of the complexes BMP-7 with activin receptor II16, TGF-β3 with
TGF-β receptor II17 and activin A with activin receptor IIB18. In

Molecular recognition of BMP-2 and BMP receptor IA
Sascha Keller, Joachim Nickel, Jin-Li Zhang, Walter Sebald & Thomas D Mueller
Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and other members of the TGF- superfamily regulate the development, maintenance
and regeneration of tissues and organs. Binding epitopes for these extracellular signaling proteins have been defined, but hot
spots specifying binding affinity and specificity have so far not been identified. In this study, mutational and structural analyses
show that epitopes of BMP-2 and the BRIA receptor form a new type of protein-protein interface. The main chain atoms of 
Leu 51 and Asp53 of BMP-2 represent a hot spot of binding to BRIA. The BMP-2 variant L51P was deficient in type I receptor
binding only, whereas its overall structure and its binding to type II receptors and modulator proteins, such as noggin, were
unchanged. Thus, the L51P substitution converts BMP-2 into a receptor-inactive inhibitor of noggin. These results are relevant 
for other proteins of the TGF- superfamily and provide useful clues for structure-based drug design.

contrast, the binding epitope of BRIA is less hydrophobic (30%) owing
to a stretch of polar and charged residues running across the binding
interface (Fig. 1b).
The program HBPLUS19 identified ten intermolecular hydrogen
bonds in a single BMP-2/BRIA epitope (the dimer arrangement 
comprises two epitopes with a total of 20 hydrogen bonds) (Table 1). 
BMP-2 provides five main chain atoms for hydrogen bonding and the
receptor provides four. The residues engaged in hydrogen bonds are
clustered in two structural elements: the loop consisting of residues
Phe49–Asn59 of BMP-2, and the short α-helix and flanking sequences
(Asp84–Arg97) of BRIA. Two hydrogen bonds, BMP-2 Asp53
(N)–BRIA Cys77 (O) and BMP-2 Ser69
(O)–BRIA Gln94 (N), are formed exclusively
between main chain atoms, two more occur
between side chains, and four are mixed
hydrogen bonds formed between side chain
and main chain atoms (Table 1). Eight of
these hydrogen bonds have donor-acceptor
distances (2.8 ± 0.14 Å) and N-O-C angles
(φ = 137 ± 11°) as expected for bona fide
hydrogen bonds20. The geometry of the
hydrogen bonds gives no hint for a ranking of
the contributions of individual bonds to
binding affinity.
To explore whether the importance of
hydrogen bonds can be predicted from the
interface structure, we analyzed the residual
fractional accessibility (Fig. 1c). This residual
accessibility in the complex correlates with
the location of a residue toward the core or
toward the periphery of the interface21. Eight
of the ten interfacial hydrogen bonds occur
between residues located at the periphery.
Only the two hydrogen bonds connecting the
receptor Gln86 side chain to the BMP-2
Leu51 main chain amide and carbonyl are
completely buried after complex formation
(Figs. 1c and 2a). This interaction might rep￾resent a binding hot spot22.
In addition, four water molecules that 
have low temperature factors (B-factors) of
40–50 Å2 (surrounding protein atoms have 
B-factors of ∼35 Å2), and are in close proxim￾ity of the hot-spot Gln86 residue of BRIA, are
buried in the ligand-receptor interface
(Fig. 2b). Three of these water molecules are
located near the side chain amide nitrogen
atom of BRIA Gln86 and form a hydrogen￾bonding network (Fig. 2b). These water 
molecules fill a sizeable cleft in the interface
with BRIA Lys97, blocking the entrance to the
cavity. A single, isolated water molecule is
located in a space next to the side chain 
carbonyl oxygen atom of BRIA Gln86. This
cavity is blocked from the outside by residues
Phe49 and Pro50 of BMP-2.
Mutational analysis of hydrogen bonds
To analyze the importance of hydrogen bonds
for affinity, we carried out interaction analysis
using BMP-2 and BRIAEC (extracellular
domain of BRIA) variants with two kinds of amino acid substitutions:
alanine substitutions introduced to disrupt side chain hydrogen bonds
(Table 1) and proline substitutions introduced to abolish hydrogen
bonding by the main chain amide group.
Interaction analysis of BMP-2 variants with immobilized receptor
BRIAEC (Table 2) showed that the substitutions W28F, D53A and
Y103A have only minor effects on binding affinity. The charge￾introducing substitution in variant S69R leads to a larger reduction in
affinity (17-fold). Notably, the L51P and D53P substitutions result in
markedly lower affinities. The apparent dissociation constant, KD, of
BRIAEC and L51P is >8,000 times higher than that of wild-type

BMP-2, and the KD of D53P is 53 times higher (Table 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 1 online). Both show a similar difference in affin￾ity for the BRIB receptor, indicating that identical determinants of
BMP-2 are used for binding of the two type I receptors. This suggests
that the main chain hydrogen bonds disrupted in the two proline vari￾ants are major binding determinants, whereas the side chain bonds of
Trp28, Asp53, Ser69 and Tyr103 have only minor roles in the binding
to the BRIA and BRIB receptors.
The affinity of the proline variants for the type II receptors, such as
activin receptors II (Table 2) and IIB as well as the BMP receptor II, is no
different from that of the wild type. This confirms that the gross struc￾ture of the protein variants must not be much altered, as possible struc￾tural alterations (owing to the proline introduced) are not propagated to
the nearby epitope for type II receptor binding (the knuckle epitope).
To identify binding determinants of BRIA, we prepared three recep￾tor variants. When immobilized on the biosensor, the receptor Q94P
variant bound BMP-2 with a threefold lower affinity than did the wild￾type ectodomain (Table 2), indicating that the main chain–main chain
hydrogen bond lost contributes only marginally to binding. We saw a
similarly small difference in affinity for S90A. In contrast, the receptor
Q86A substitution resulted in an 89-fold higher KD for BMP-2.
Because data for BMP-2 L51P had already shown that disruption of
this interaction leads to a large decrease in affinity, these results con￾firmed that the affected hydrogen bonds represent the major binding
determinants (see above). Most notably, the hot spot identified by the
mutational analysis coincides with the hot spot suggested by the analy￾sis of the residual fractional accessibility of the engaged donor and
acceptor groups (Fig. 1c). However, the loss in affinity is less severe for
the receptor variant Q86A (Table 2) than for the BMP-2 substitution
L51P. This discrepancy might be explained by compensating interac￾tions with neighboring side chains in the receptor, such as Lys79,
Glu81 or Asp89, which might partially offset the effect of the deleted
carboxamide group of Gln86 (Fig. 1b). Alternatively, the sterically
restricted Pro51 in BMP-2 L51P might introduce steric hindrance or
disturb nearby bonds by local structural rearrangements, for example
between the BMP-2 Asp53 backbone amide and the receptor Cys77
carbonyl, and thus the large decrease in binding affinity may be caused
by disruption of several interactions (Fig. 2a).
Structure of proline BMP-2 variant L51P
To determine possible structural alterations, we subjected L51P and
D53P to crystallization. Crystals of BMP-2 L51P could be obtained
under conditions similar to those for wild-type BMP-2 and had crystal
parameters almost identical to those of the wild-type protein
(Supplementary Table 1 online). The variant D53P did not crystallize
under those conditions; crystals obtained from either ethanol or 
2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol diffracted only to very low resolution and
were not analyzed further.
Except for the site of mutation, the structures of wild-type BMP-2
and L51P are identical within the limits of error of the structure
determination method (Supplementary Fig. 2 online); the root mean
square (r.m.s.) deviation for the Cα-atom positions was ∼0.6 Å. We
observed larger changes only in the pre-helix loop comprising
residues Pro48–His54. The distances between the Cα positions of
these residues in the wild type and variant exceeded 1 Å, with the
largest difference being 1.8 Å for the Cα of Ala52 (Supplementary
Fig. 2 online). The side chains of Leu51 (wild type) and Pro51 (vari￾ant) both point into the hydrophobic core of BMP-2 and show similar
van der Waals contacts with neighboring residues. The peptide bond

between residue Pro50 and either Leu 51 or Pro51 adopts a trans con￾formation (Fig. 3a). The preceding peptide bond (Phe49–Pro50) in
variant L51P is in cis conformation. This is also observed in the high￾resolution structure of the BMP-2–BRIA complex. In contrast, in the
structure of free BMP-2 (PDB entry code 3BMP), this peptide bond is
in the trans form. However, this observation might be an interpreta￾tion error caused by the lower quality of the electron density map of
the wild-type BMP-2 data in this region. For residues Asp53 and
His54, we observed only weak electron density for the side chains in
the data of wild-type BMP-2 and BMP2 L51P. Therefore, we could
not unambiguously define the side chain conformations of both
residues.
Notably, a comparison of the structures of BMP-2 in its free and
bound state showed that differences in the pre-helix loop are of similar
magnitude to those between wild-type BMP-2 and variant L51P. This
suggests that the conformation of the pre-helix loop is neither pre￾formed nor fixed. On complex formation, the pre-helix loop probably
changes its conformation through induced fit enforced by the surface
geometry of the receptor. High-temperature factors in the pre-helix
segment (Fig. 3b), indicating a flexible backbone support this hypo￾thesis. Therefore, differences seen between the structures of free wild￾type BMP-2 and the variant L51P might not explain the loss of binding
affinity for BRIA, because the free structures do not reliably indicate
whether the pre-helix loop can adopt the conformation of the bound
form seen in the complex. It seems puzzling, however, that the muta￾tion of BRIA Q86A should have a much smaller effect on binding
affinity than the mutation of BMP-2 L51P, assuming that both muta￾tions disrupt the same hydrogen bonds. Additional effects from the
introduced proline residue must account for the much greater loss in
binding affinity in BMP-2 L51P.
Superposition of the structure of BMP-2 L51P and the BMP-2–
BRIAEC complex showed that part of the proline ring occupies the vol￾ume formerly used by the hydrogen bond between the BMP-2 Leu51
amide and the side chain carbonyl of BRIAEC Gln86 (Fig. 3a). The
larger spatial requirement for the proline ring thus introduces steric
hindrance affecting the side chain of BRIAEC Gln86 (Fig. 3a). To
accommodate Pro51 in the interface between BMP-2 and BRIA, its
side chain needs to be pushed back further. Because of the rigid ring
structure that couples the N-terminal peptide bond to the ring orien￾tation, this push causes the backbone carbonyl of Pro50 to move
toward the side chain of BRIAEC Gln86. Thus, removal of one steric
hindrance introduces another one. One way or the other, steric hin￾drance cannot be avoided, possibly explaining the large loss of binding
energy by the mutation L51P.
Proline variants and biological activity
We assessed the biological activity of the BMP-2 proline variants by
dose-dependent induction of alkaline phosphatase activity using both
promyoblast C2C12 cells and the more sensitive mouse embryonal
carcinoma–derived clonal cell line ATDC5. The dose of wild-type
BMP-2 resulting in half-maximal response (ED50) was 25 nM in
C2C12 cells and 8 nM in ATDC5 cells. In contrast, BMP-2 L51P had
no measurable biological activity in either C2C12 (>1,600 nM) or
ATDC5 cells (>1,500 nM). BMP-2 D53P showed ED50 values of 
330 nM and 140 nM for C2C12 and ATDC5 cells, respectively—about
13–17 times higher than those of wild-type BMP-2. Thus, the decrease
in BRIA receptor affinity for the two BMP-2 proline variants parallels
their loss of biological activity (Fig. 4). Because the proline substitu￾tion of BMP-2 Leu51 affects only the interaction with the type I recep￾tor and not the interaction with the type II receptor, L51P might be
expected to function as a dominant-negative inhibitor. However, we
did not observe such an effect when we applied concentrations of up to
250 nM of the variant to cells stimulated with 20 nM BMP-2 (data not
shown). In comparison, the basal alkaline phosphatase activity in
ATDC5 cells was inhibited by the antagonistic BMP-2 A34D variant3
but not by L51P (Fig. 4a).

Proline variants as antagonists of modulator proteins
The lack of BMP-2 L51P to bind to BRIAEC raised the question of
whether the interaction with other binding proteins might also be
affected by the proline substitution. Of particular interest is noggin,
which binds to BMPs with high affinity. Other important modulator
proteins are chordin, which interacts with BMP-2 by means of two 
cysteine-rich domains, and gremlin, which interacts through a 
so-called DAN domain. We immobilized each of these three proteins
at the surface of a biosensor and analyzed their interactions with 
BMP-2 variants (Table 3).
The dissociation constants, KD, of the two BMP-2 proline variants
for the complex with noggin were similar to those of wild-type BMP-2,
ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 nM. Thus, BMP-2 Leu51 and Asp53 are not the
main binding determinants for noggin, even though the noggin N ter￾minus is in contact with the BMP-7 region, corresponding to BMP-2
Leu51 (BMP-7 Leu75) and Asp53 (BMP-7 Ser77, pre-helix loop)8, and
noggin inhibits BRIA binding to BMP-2.
The affinities of BMP-2 for the chordin domains CR1 and CR3 and
for gremlin were 10–30 times lower than for noggin (Table 3). Again,
we found a similar KD for wild-type BMP-2 and the two proline vari￾ants, indicating that the binding of these proteins is not affected by the
proline substitutions. Thus, the BMP-2 epitopes for both binding pro￾teins must be different from the epitope for the BRIA receptor.
L51P neutralizes noggin inhibition in C2C12 cells
BMP-2 induces the expression of alkaline phosphatase in starved
C2C12 cells. An equimolar concentration of a noggin-Fc fusion pro￾tein inhibited this response to background levels (Fig. 5). The inhibi￾tion of BMP-2 activity by noggin can be relieved in a dose-dependent
manner by L51P (Fig. 5). At equimolar concentrations of L51P and
noggin, >80% of noggin’s inhibitory effect is neutralized. This indi￾cates that the ‘receptor-dead’ L51P variant is an efficient inhibitor of
noggin. This result is in accordance with physical binding studies
showing disruption of type I receptor binding and conservation of
noggin binding after BMP-2 L51P substitution (Fig. 4 and Table 3).
DISCUSSION
The determination of binding affinity and specificity for type I recep￾tor interaction by the wrist epitope of BMP-2 represents a new type of
molecular recognition in ligand–receptor complexes. First, three main
chain groups involved in a hydrogen-bonding network—the amide
and carbonyl of Leu51 and the amide of
Asp53—are used as the main binding deter￾minants. Second, the large hydrophobic
patch, comprising 15 side chains, does not (as
we might have expected) contain a binding
free energy hot spot, but instead provides an
appropriate environment for the adjacent
hydrogen-bonding network. Third, the 
binding hot spot is located in a flexible loop
element that, upon complex formation,
becomes fixed as a result of induced fit.
Mutational analysis, including analysis of
proline substitutions, was crucial in establish￾ing that only the three hydrogen bonds
involving the main chain groups in the
hydrophobic core region are important 
binding determinants. Each of the hydrogen
bonds formed between peripheral groups can
be destroyed without substantial effect. These
observations support the idea that main chain
groups embedded in a hydrophobic surrounding are good candidates
for functionally important hydrogen bonding.
Structure and refolding after denaturation of BMP-2 are very per￾missive of amino acid substitutions. The cystine knot seems to stabilize
the two-stranded β-sheets and the loop regions. The pre-helix loop
(Pro48–His54), which is probably mobile in the free ligand, tolerates
even proline substitutions of Leu51 and Asp53 without substantial
structural alterations. The introduced proline residue lacks the hydro￾gen bond donating group in the main chain; however, its side chain
can cause steric hindrance during receptor binding. In BMP-2 L51P,
both effects are probably involved in the unusually large drop in bind￾ing free energy for binding to BRIA (∆∆G0 = 5 kcal mol–1). Half of this
loss is likely to be caused by the missing hydrogen bond, because the
binding free energy is reduced by ∆∆G0 = 2.5 kcal mol–1 in the recep￾tor Q86A variant. Modeling of the D53P variant suggests that a proline
residue at position 53 does not cause steric hindrance during receptor
binding.
The interaction between BMP-2 and BRIAEC has an apparent disso￾ciation constant of about 1 nM (ref. 4). Complex formation is quite
slow compared to that in other receptor systems, with an association
rate constant, kon, of between 3 × 105 M–1s–1 and 5 × 105 M–1s–1. This
could be explained by induced fit and immobilization of mobile bind￾ing determinants during receptor binding. Notably, in the unbound
state the pre-helix loop of BMP-2 shows the highest temperature fac￾tors of all main chain atoms (Fig. 3b). Upon complex formation, how￾ever, the temperature factors become much lower (Fig. 3b) and the
segment accordingly becomes very rigid. The high mobility of the pre￾helix loop seems to be conserved within the BMP family, as corre￾sponding segments in the structures of free BMP-7 (refs. 16,23),

BMP-6 and GDF-5 also show elevated temperature factors (T.M.,
unpublished data). In addition, the conformation of the pre-helix loop
differs significantly among the four BMP proteins, whereas the rest of
the backbone is similar. The flexibility of the pre-helix loop also seems
to be retained in BMP-7 bound to the activin type II receptor16. This is
plausible because the binding site for type II receptors is located in the
knuckle epitope and no contacts are made between the type II receptor
and the pre-helix region. However, this region becomes rigid upon
binding of BMP-7 to noggin, owing to interaction of the pre-helix loop
with the noggin N terminus8,24. The observed flexibility of the pre￾helix loop of the BMPs might therefore be a requirement for adapta￾tion to different surface shapes of the various binding partners.
Notably, mutation of Phe49 and Pro50 of the pre-helix loop to alanine
affects only the association rate of the complex; the dissociation rate,
which correlates with the complex’s thermodynamic stability, is unal￾tered. This suggests that these two residues, which bind into a
hydrophobic cleft close to Ile62 and Ile99 of BRIA, are required to put
the pre-helix loop into the backbone conformation necessary to form
the hydrogen-bonding network.
Residue Leu51 is invariant in members of the BMP-2–BMP-4, BMP￾5–BMP-6–BMP-7, and GDF-5–GDF-6–GDF-7 protein subfamilies, all
of which interact functionally with the receptors BRIA and BRIB.
Gln86 of BRIA is invariant in the related BRIB receptor but not in
other type I chains. This suggests that the hydrogen bond between
these residues is important for the binding of all the BMPs and GDFs
to the BRIA and BRIB receptors. Notably, the hydrogen-bonding part￾ners in the pre-helix loop of the ligand also participate in the interac￾tion of the noggin N terminus and BMP-7: the backbone carbonyl of
BMP-7 Leu75 (equivalent to BMP-2 Leu51) interacts with the back￾bone amide of noggin His32, and the amide of BMP-7 Ser77 (equiva￾lent to BMP-2 Asp53) forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of
noggin Tyr30. In addition, the backbone torsion angles for the pre￾helix loop of BMP-2 and BMP-7 are very similar in their bound con￾formation, but differ in the unbound state. Considering the very
different binding motifs of BRIA and noggin and their similar geome￾tries in the bound conformation, this suggests that the two backbone
hydrogen-bonding elements might serve as a general recognition
motif in the BMP ligands, although these do not always represent a
main binding determinant as shown for the interaction of BMP-2 and
noggin (Table 3). Notably, the pre-helix loop element is also important
for the binding of TGF-β to its type I receptor25,26. Oligopeptides com￾prising the residues of the pre-helix loop could be used as antagonists
of TGF-β signaling, as could antibodies raised against this loop region.
It therefore seems that the pre-helix loop represents a conserved recog￾nition motif in the TGF-β superfamily, despite considerable differ￾ences in the architecture of the ligand-receptor complexes observed in
the structures of BMP-7 bound to the activin type IIB receptor16 and
TGF-β3 bound to the TGF type II receptor17.
A further distinctive feature of the contact between BMP-2 and
BRIA is the small number of water molecules in the interface. They are
located in the core of the contact surrounding the functionally impor￾tant hydrogen bonds between the receptor Gln86 (NE2, OE1) and
BMP-2 Leu51 (N, O). Three water molecules occupy a hollow space
close to the side chain NH2 of BRIA Gln86; the fourth is located close
to the oxygen atom of the side chain carboxamide group of BRIA
Gln86 (Figs. 1c and 2b). All the water molecules form a hydrogen￾bonding network with BRIA Gln86 and surrounding neighbors. Aside
from their possible function in the formation and stabilization of the
intermolecular bidentate hydrogen bonds between BMP-2 Leu51 and
BRIA Gln86, these water molecules could also serve as mobile spatial
building blocks to allow adaptation to different surface shapes of 
different binding partners. The limited promiscuity observed for the
ligand-receptor interaction in the TGF-β superfamily probably
requires easy adaptation to changes in amino acid composition and
hence surface shape.
Identification of the functional epitope of BMP-2 for receptor BRIA
binding is of interest for the development of specific inhibitors. BMP2
interacts with numerous proteins beside type I and II receptor chains.
Type II receptor interaction occurs at the knuckle epitope of BMP-2
and BMP-7 (refs. 3,16). The identification of binding epitopes of
BMPs for the noggin-type, DAN-type, and chordin-SOG-type modu￾lators is still in its infancy. The recent X-ray structure analysis of the
BMP-7–noggin complex represents a highlight in this respect8,24.
According to the X-ray structure, noggin occupies and blocks the two
knuckle and the two wrist epitopes of the BMP dimer. As discussed
above, the N-terminal segment of noggin has extensive contacts with
the pre-helix loop of the BMP, including the residues corresponding to
Asp53 and Leu51 in BMP-2. Our results here indicate, however, that
the main determinants in BMP-2 for type I receptor binding are not
part of the BMP-2 epitope functioning in noggin binding.
BMP-2 L51P binds with unaltered affinity not only to noggin but
also to other modulatory proteins, such as the chordins CR1 and CR3
and the DAN protein gremlin. This opens up the possibility of devel￾oping receptor-dead inhibitors for other members of the chordin and
DAN families. Possible targets are the DAN family member sclerostin,
which limits bone regeneration and anabolism in adults, or the
chordin family members CTGF or CYR61, which may be involved in
the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases. The high affinity (subnanomolar
KD) of BMP-2 L51P for the dimeric noggin already provides distinct
discrimination in relation to DAN and chordin proteins that have up
to 50-fold lower affinities for BMPs. A detailed analysis, for example
by screening against a large collection of BMP-2 variants, will be
needed to determine how the epitopes for these proteins overlap,
coincide or differ.
The present experiments localize the main determinants of BMP-2
for BRIA binding in a continuous epitope in the pre-helix loop
(Pro48 to His54). Peptidomimetics—preferably cyclic, conforma￾tionally restrained peptides—could possibly be generated that inhibit

type I receptors. Such inhibitors might be useful for diseases (such as
fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, cranial synostosis and scleros￾teosis) that involve bone overproduction resulting from elevated
BMP activity.
METHODS
Preparation of proteins. Preparation of BMP-2 variant and BMP receptor pro￾teins was done as earlier described27,28. Variants for BMP-2 or BRIAEC were
obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange (Stratagene)
methodology3. Binding activity of the refolded BMP-2 variants was assessed by
measurement of the binding affinity for BMP type I and II receptor using
BIAcore methodology. Preparation of the BMP-2–BRIAEC complex for struc￾ture analysis was done as earlier described28.
Crystallization of the proteins. BMP-2 L51P was crystallized by hanging-drop
vapor diffusion at 21 °C 15% (v/v) t-butanol, 0.1 M lithium sulfate and 0.1 M
sodium citrate, pH 5.0, using a protein concentration of 8 mg ml–1.
Crystallization of the BMP-2–BRIAEC complex was done as earlier described10;
crystals for measurement at 100 K were obtained by co-crystallization with glu￾cose as a cryoprotectant. High-quality crystals for data acquisition were grown
from 0.75 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M imidazole, pH 7.0, and 30% (w/v) glucose
at 10 °C using a protein concentration of 11 mg ml–1.
X-ray data acquisition. Data for the complex of BMP-2 with BRIAEC were
obtained from a single crystal at 100 K at the beamline X06SA PX at the Swiss
Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland). The data were processed
and integrated using the software MOSFLM version 6.2.1 (ref. 29) and scaling
was done using SCALA CCP4 version 4.2.1 (refs. 30,31); a summary of the pro￾cessing statistics is given in Supplementary Table 1 online. Diffraction data for
BMP-2 L51P were collected at room temperature on a Rigaku RU-300 X-ray
generator equipped with Osmic ConfocalBlue optics and a Rigaku R-AXIS
IV++ image-plate system. Data from two crystals were collected, merged and
scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA29–31.
Structure determination. The structure of the complex of BMP-2 with BRIAEC
was refined using the lower-resolution structure (PDB entry 1ES7) as a start
model. The program REFMAC5 (ref. 32) was used for refinement, which was
followed by manual rebuilding of the model using the software QUANTA2000
(Accelrys). One TLS group was defined for each chain—that is, BMP-2
monomers and each BRIAEC molecule—to correct possible anisotropy in the
data33. The progress of refinement was monitored by cross-validation using a
test data set comprising 5% of the reflections34. In the final round of refine￾ment, Fobs – Fcalc difference electron density maps were used to identify 185
water molecules. The final minimization cycle yielded an R-factor of 20.7% and
a value of 22.9% for Rfree. The structure analysis of BMP-2 L51P was performed
using CNS 1.1 for simulated annealing and energy minimization. The structure
of wild-type BMP-2 (PDB entry 3BMP) served as a starting model. Manual
rebuilding of the model was based on σA-weighted 2Fobs – Fcalc and Fobs – Fcalc
electron density maps; in the final round of refinement 13 water and 2 MPD
molecules were added. The R-factor for the final structure of BMP-2 L51P is
21.5% and 23.5% for Rfree.
Interaction analysis. Interaction analysis was performed using a BIA2000 sys￾tem. Proteins were biotinylated and immobilized on CM5 streptavidin-coated
sensor chips (ref. 5). The extracellular domains of BRIA, BRIB and ARII were
prepared and analyzed under conditions as described3. Interaction with nog￾gin-Fc, chordin and gremlin (R&D Systems) could be measured after regenera￾tion of the chip surface with 0.1 M acetic acid, 1 M NaCl, and 6 M guanidinium
chloride. The sensorgrams were evaluated using the software BIAevaluation
version 2.0 (BIAcore) assuming a 1:1 interaction. Bulk face effects were cor￾rected by subtracting the control flow cell (FC1) from all sensorgrams; nonspe￾cific binding was negligible. The analysis yielded kinetic constants for complex
formation (kon) and dissociation (koff). The latter were evaluated at near satu￾rating concentrations of analyte during the first 10 s of complex dissociation.
The apparent binding constant of each variant was obtained using six or seven
analyte concentrations (10–300 nM). Mean values with a standard deviation of
35% for koff and 12% for kon were deduced from 6–12 independent
measurements. Apparent dissociation constants, KD, were calculated either as
KD = koff/kon or by evaluating the dose dependency of equilibrium binding.
Mean values together with the mean standard deviation are given in Tables 2
and 3.
Biological activity in cell lines. Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined in
serum-starved ATDC5 (Riken Bioresource Center, cell number RCB0565) and
C2C12 (ATCC CRL-1772) cells3. The cells were stimulated at a density of 
3 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well microtiter plate for 3 d with varying concen￾trations of wild-type or variant BMP-2 protein in 100 µl of Dulbecco’s modified
eagle medium (DMEM) containing 2% (v/v) calf serum. Cells were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 100 µl of 1% (v/v) NP-40
in alkaline phosphatase buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 9.6, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
ZnCl2). Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined by incubating lysed cells
for 15 min with 100 µl alkaline phosphatase buffer plus 1 mg ml–1 p-nitro￾phenylphosphate and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. One A405
absorbance unit corresponds to 1.5 nmol of p-nitrophenolate produced per
minute per 3 × 104 cells. Relief of noggin inhibition was assessed by incubating
C2C12 cells with 20 nM noggin plus 20 nM BMP-2 and increasing concentra￾tions (5–30 nM) of BMP-2 L51P. Results are given as mean values from six
determinations done in parallel for each condition.
Coordinates. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the structures of
the BMP-2–BRIAEC complex and the BMP-2 variant L51P have been deposited
with the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1REW and 1REU, respectively).
