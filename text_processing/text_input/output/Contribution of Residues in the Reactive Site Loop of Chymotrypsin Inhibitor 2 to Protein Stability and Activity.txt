ABSTRACT: Residues in the active site loop of the serine protease inhibitor, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, 
thought to play an important role in loop stability and inhibitory activity, have been investigated by site￾directed mutagenesis. Substitutions at residues 58 (threonine in wild type) and 60 (glutamic acid in wild 
type), which flank the scissile bond (Met-59-Glu-60) and are conserved among the potato inhibitor I 
family of serine protease inhibitors, are found to be of some importance in the global stability of the 
protein, as measured by guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation, but are essential for its inhibitory 
activity. Mutation of either Thr-58 or Glu-60 to alanine results in a decrease in stability of 0.7 f 0.1 kcal 
mol-’. These values reflect the loss of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of Thr-58 with 
Glu-60 and Arg-67 and hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge between Glu-60 and Arg-62 and Arg-65. In 
addition, these mutants were found to be much weaker inhibitors of the serine protease subtilisin BPN’. 
The dissociation constants for inhibition, K,, were found to be (7.0 f 0.4, 540 f 30, and 980 f 50) x 
M, for wild type, T58A, and E60A, respectively. Further, we find that these mutants are only 
temporary inhibitors of subtilisin BPN’, unlike wild type. Over long time scales, we observe a reversal 
of inhibition because of hydrolysis of the inhibitor. In addition, we have found from double-mutant 
cycle analysis on T58AE60A and T58DE60A that there are interaction energies between residues 58 and 
60 in the free inhibitor of 0.5 f 0.2 and 0.4 f 0.1 kcal mol-’ (measured for T58AE60A and T58DE60A, 
respectively) that increase substantially in the complex with subtilisin BPN’ to 2.1 f 0.1 and 4.2 f 0.2 
kcal mol-’, respectively. The hydrogen bonding and salt bridge network within the active site loop, 
which is a characteristic of potato inhibitor I family of inhibitors, is essential for the inhibitory activity 
of the protein. 
Serine proteases are common in nature and have a wide 
variety of biological roles, including digestion of proteins 
for nutrition, generation of active hormones, control of blood 
clotting, fertilization, and transport of secretory proteins 
across membranes (Neurath, 1984). Modulation of protease 
activity is consequently of some importance. Inhibitors of 
serine proteases exist in animal, plant, and microbial organ￾isms with the physiological function of preventing unwanted 
proteolysis. Serine protease inhibitors act as competitive 
inhibitors by binding tightly to the active site of the protease. 
Dissociation constants are typically M (Laskows￾ki & Kato, 1980). Despite much research in this area, it is 
still not clear what structural features are essential for their 
functioning as inhibitors and prevent them from being well￾designed substrates. To investigate further the structural 
basis for inhibition, we have performed site-directed mu￾tagenesis on residues in the reactive site loop of chymotrypsin 
inhibitor 2. Chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, C12, is a member of 
the potato inhibitor I family of serine protease inhibitors 
(Jonassen, 1980). It is found naturally in the albumin fraction 
of seeds from the Hiproly strain of barley. C12 is a potent 
inhibitor of subtilisin BPN’, with a K, in the picomolar range. 
It inhibits chymotrypsin and elastase some 500- and 10 000-

fold weaker, respectively, and does not inhibit and is 
hydrolysed by trypsin (Longstaff et al., 1990). A truncated, 
@-residue, form of the protein, lacking the first, unstructured, 
19 amino acids, is used in these studies (Jackson et al., 
1993a). It is a single domain protein whose tertiary structure 
consists of a central four-stranded mixed parallel and 
antiparallel P-sheet which is packed against an a-helix to 
form the hydrophobic core (McPhalen & James, 1987). 
Between parallel strands 2 and 3, on the opposite side of 
the P-sheet to the a-helix, is a wide loop in extended 
conformation which contains the reactive site bond, Met￾59-Glu-60; see Figure 1. Unlike many other serine protease 
inhibitors, C12 contains no disulfide bonds. Inhibitors from 
other families have disulfide bonds which flank the reactive 
site bond and which stabilize the reactive site loop. Although 
these are not present in the potato inhibitor I family, C12 
appears to have some comparable noncovalent interactions. 
Two highly conserved arginine residues, Arg-65 and Arg￾67, stabilize the reactive site loop through hydrogen-bonding 
and electrostatic interactions with Thr-58 and Glu-60; see 
Figure 1 and Table 1. Evidence from other studies on 
chymotrypsin inhibitor 1 (Boisen et al., 1981) and eglin c 
(Heinz et al., 1992) suggests that the stability of the reactive 
site loop is a key element in their ability to inhibit serine 
proteases.

"Calculated from the structure of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 com￾plexed to subtilisin BPN' (McPhalen et al., 1985). The crystal structure 
of the free inhibitor (McPhalen & James, 1987) is not used because 
the structure of the reactive site loop is very poorly defined. Average 
B-factors for Thr-58, Met-59, and Glu-60 are 43,47, and 36 A2 in the 
free inhibitor and 7, 11, and 8 A2 in the structure of the complex, 
respectively. The shucture of the reactive site loop is also poorly 
defined in the nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure (Ludvigsen 
et al., 1991). This results from its extended conformation reducing 
the number of long-range NOES available to constrain the structure. 
We, therefore, use the structure of the complex as a guide to the possible 
hydrogen-bonding and salt bridges in the reactive site loop. " Gly83 is

The functional properties of these mutants were studied using 
presteady state inhibition kinetics of the slow, tight-binding 
inhibition of the serine protease subtilisin BPN' (cf. Longstaff 
et al., 1990). In addition, the effect of the mutations on the 
stability of the protein was investigated using guanidinium 
chloride denaturation (cf. Jackson & Fersht, 1991 a,b; Jackson 
et al., 1993a,b) to measure the contribution that Thr-58 and 
Glu-60 make to both protein stability and activity and to 
investigate the relationship between them. Further, two 
double mutants at these positions were constructed, which 
have yielded information on the interactions between these 
residues in the native state, in both the free inhibitor and in 
complex with subtilisin BPN'. These data give insights into 
the mechanism of inhibition of this class of serine protease 
inhibitor. 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
Materials 
Chemicals. The buffer used in denaturation experiments 
was 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) purchased 
from Sigma. Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroaniline, 
sAAPFpNA, was prepared as a stock solution in dimethyl 
sulfoxide, DMSO, which had been dried over barium oxide 
and distilled under vacuum. Guanidinium chloride was 
sequanal grade purchased from Pierce Chemicals. Water was 
purified to 15 MQ resistance by an Elgastat system. 
Radiochemicals were from Amersham International. DEAE 
trisacryl was obtained from IBF, Villeneuve La Garenne, 
France. Yeast extract and tryptone were purchased from Lab 
M, Bury, U.K. Ammonium sulfate was enzyme grade from 
BDH. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. 
Mutagenesis. Single-stranded DNA was obtained from 
the modified pTZ18U, harbored in E. coli TG2 after infection 
with the helper phage M13K07 following the conditions 
described by Pharmacia. Site-directed mutagenesis was 
carried out using the method of Eckstein (Sayers et al., 1988) 
and the kit supplied by Amersham (using 0.2 of the 
recommended amounts of DNA and kit). Mutants were 
identified by directly sequencing the single-stranded DNA. 
Wild type and mutants were expressed and purified (Jackson 
et al., 1993a). 
Methods 
Chemical denaturation experiments were performed ex￾actly as described by Jackson et al. (1993a) and the data 
analyzed by fitting to the equation

Unfolding was monitored by the intrinsic fluorescence of C12 using 
an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength 
of 356 nm. Under these conditions the base lines of the native and 
denatured state are found to be dependent upon [GdnHCl]. These 
plots show the data normalized (fraction unfolded) taking into 
account the sloping base lines. The solid lines are the best fit of 
the data to a two-state process. 
have been described elsewhere (Jackson & Fersht, 1993; Cha, 
1975; Williams & Momson, 1979). 
In the experiments described in this paper the experimental 
conditions were as follows. The range of inhibitor concen￾trations used depended on the dissociation constant, typically 
1-5 nM for wild type, T58A, T58D, and T58DE60A and 
3-12 nM for E60A and T58AE60A, while the enzyme 
concentration was typically 5 pM. The substrate concentra￾tion was typically 0.6 mM. A Cary 3 UV-vis spectropho￾tometer with an automatic cell changer (2 x six cel1s)was 
used. Data were collected using the applications software 
package (Software Issue 2.00, Instrument Software Issue 
3.00) provided by Cary for 7-8 h. The data were translated 
into ASCII format using the Cary data impordexport program 
(Varian Associates (1990) Release 3.00) and then analyzed 
using the nonlinear regression analysis program Kaleida￾graph as previously described (Jackson & Fersht, 1993; Cha, 
1975; Williams & Morrison, 1979). 
RESULTS 
Stability Studies 
GdnHC1-Induced Denaturation. Wild type and mutants 
were found to follow two-state unfolding transitions. Typical 
normalized GdnHC1-induced denaturation curves are shown 
in Figure 2. Data from such transition curves were fitted to 
eq 1 to yield values for [GdnHCl]~o% and m for each mutant 
and associated errors. These values can then be used to 
calculate AG-F~~', AA&-F[~~~~~~~~~%, and AAG-F~~'. 
These results are shown in Table 2. It is clear that the errors 
associated with AAG-F~~O are substantially larger than those 
in calculating A~~-F[~~~~'~~~~, as has been previously 
reported (Jackson et al., 1993a). AAC;U-F[GdnHC1150B is used 
in the subsequent analysis. 
Double Mutant Cycle Analysis of T58AE60A and 
T58DE6OA. Double mutant cycles can be used to measure 
the interaction energy, AAGi,tp), between two residues in 
the folded state of a protein. AAGi,tc~l can be calculated 
according to the general equation below 
where E stands for the protein, X and Y the two residues 
being mutated, and AGu-F~-"-~', AGU-F~-'-~. 
AGU-FE-'~-~~, AGTJ-FE-'-~ for the free energy changes for 
the appropriate transitions in the cycle. Each of the free 
energy terms on the right-hand side of the equation is 
determined by measuring the difference in the free energy 
of the initial and final states of the respective transition. Thus, 
for example, AG-FE-xy4Ex is the difference in unfolding 
free energies between E-XY and E-X (Horovitz & Fersht, 
1990; Horovitz et al., 1990). 
The interaction energy between Thr-58 and Glu-60 is 0.50 
f 0.16 kcal mol-' and between Asp-58 and Glu-60 is 0.39 
f 0.14 kcal mol-', in the native state of the protein. Thus, 
there is a significant interaction energy between Thr-58 or 
Asp-58 and Glu-60. The positive sign indicates that, in both 
cases, the double mutant is less destabilizing than expected 
from the sum of the single mutants. 
Activity Studies 
Case 1: Classical Slow Tight-Binding Inhibition Kinetics. 
Wild type, T58D, and T58DE60A behave as classical slow, 
tight-binding inhibitors of subtilisin BPN'. A typical set of 
binding curves is shown in Figure 3a. Data from these 
curves were fitted to give values for kobs, the apparent first￾order rate constant for the transition to the steady-state rate, 
vs, the final steady-state rate, and vo, the initial rate, at each 
inhibitor concentration. Plots of kObs versus inhibitor con￾centration were used to calculate the association rate, k,,, 
for the binding of inhibitor to subtilisin BPN' (Jackson & 
Fersht, 1993). A typical plot is shown in Figure 4a. These 
plots were linear over the inhibitor concentration range 
studied. Values for k,, are given in Table 3. With the 
exception of T58D, the values of k,, for the mutants are very Reactive Site Loop Mutants of C12 Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 46, 1994 13883

similar to that of wild type. The value of k,, for T58D is 
significantly lower than this and could possibly result from 
conformational changes required on binding of this mutant 
to subtilisin BPN'. Theoretically, the dissociation rate, kef, 
can also be determined from the intercept on the y axis of 
such a plot. In this case, however, the intercept is so close 
to zero that an accurate value for k,, cannot be measured. 
Ki was determined from plots of (v, - v,)/v, versus 
inhibitor concentration (Jackson & Fersht, 1993). A typical 
plot is shown in Figure 4b. It is linear and passes through 
the origin. For slow-binding inhibitors, equilibrium is 
reached slowly and it is important to run the experiments 
for sufficient time so that a good estimate of vs can be 
obtained from fitting. In this case, experiments were run 
for 7 -8 h. If the experiment is not run for sufficient time, 
then systematic errors can be generated that can be misin￾terpreted as unusual binding. This is readily diagnosed in 
plots such as those shown in Figure 4b, which become

nonlinear in these cases. All the plots of (v, - vs)/vs versus 
inhibitor concentration were found to be linear. The results 
are summarized in Table 3. 
The plots of kobs versus inhibitor concentration are linear. 
Thus, the kinetic data are consistent with a reaction, eq 3, in 
which enzyme and inhibitor combine to form the final 
complex. 
(3) 
Values for ko~ can, therefore, be determined indirectly from 
measurements of k,, and Ki (k,~ = k,,Ki). The results are 
shown in Table 3. T58A also behaves as a slow, tight￾binding inhibitor over short time scales (0-300 min), and 
data were treated as above. Over longer time scales (0- 
500 min), however, then some reversal of inhibition is 
observed; see the next section. 13884 Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 46, 1994 
Case 2: Reversal of Inhibition by Destruction of Inhibitor. 
E60A and T58AE60A are much weaker inhibitors of 
subtilisin BPN' than wild-type CI2. Therefore, the concen￾tration range of inhibitor used was higher than for wild type. 
Consequently, the association rate (kon[C12]) is higher and 
slow-binding of the inhibitor to subtilisin BPN' is not 
observed; i.e., a steady-state is achieved within the dead￾time of the experiment. More importantly, E60A and 
T58AE60A both exhibit temporary inhibition. Over long 
time scales there is a reversal of inhibition due to the slow 
destruction of the inhibitor. In this case, this is probably 
due to the slow hydrolysis of the reactive site bond by 
subtilisin BPN'. This results in an upward curvature of the 
binding curves as shown in Figure 3b. Curvature is most 
significant at low concentrations of inhibitor. Although data 
cannot be fitted to the slow, tight-binding equation, K, can 
still be determined from the binding curves by taking the 
slope at t = 0 as v, and the rate of the uninhibited enzyme 
as v,. Ki may then be calculated as before. Plots of (v, - 
v,)/v, versus inhibitor concentration are linear and pass 
through the origin. Results are shown in Table 3. 
The two mutants, E60A and T58AE60A, which show 
noticeable reversal of inhibition are also the two most 
destabilized mutants; see Table 2. The fraction of unfolded 
protein for these is higher than for wild type or the other 
mutants. To ensure that hydrolysis is not occurring on the 
unfolded form of the protein, we perfomed a slow, tight￾binding assay on a destabilized mutant in the hydrophobic 
core of the protein. V70A destabilizes the protein by 1.95 
kcal mol-' (Jackson et al., 1993a). This mutant shows 
perfect slow, tight-binding inhibition kinetics and no reversal 
of inhibition due to depletion of inhibitor. The value of K, 
is within experimental error of the wild-type value. Thus, 
the reversal of inhibition is not due to the global destabiliza￾tion of the protein but must be due to a local destabilization 
of the reactive site loop. 
Calculation of the Rate of the Destruction of Inhibitor by 
Subtilisin BPN'. The following reaction scheme is assumed 
in which inhibitor reacts rapidly with the enzyme whose 
inhibition is being measured and then is more slowly 
destroyed (reaction scheme I): 
Jackson and Fersht 
where E1 is the enzyme-inhibitor complex, EI* is the 
enzyme-inhibitor complex in which the reactive site bond 
has been hydrolyzed, I* is the hydrolyzed inhibitor product, 
K* is the equilibrium constant for nonhydrolyzed and 
hydrolyzed enzyme-bound inhibitor, and k:! and k-2 are the 
dissociation and association rate constants for the enzyme￾hydrolyzed inhibitor complex, respectively. This can be 
simplified to reaction scheme 11: 
Ki kd E + I -E1 - E + I* 
Data from binding curves were converted from absorbance 
at 412 nm into fractional inhibition, i, and then fitted to eq 
4 (Goldstein, 1944) 
+ ln( ") - 7 1 4- In( L, = kdE,'t (4) I, 1 - io 1-i 
where io is the fractional inhibition at t = 0, i is the fractional 
inhibition at time t, kd is as above, and E{ = E,,,dKi. Values 
of kd calculated for E60A and T58AE60A are shown in Table 
3. Although T58A does show some reversal of inhibition, 
it is not significant enough for an accurate determination of 
kd. 
Binding Energies. Dissociation constants may be con￾verted into binding energies using eq 5 
hhGbinding = -RT ln(Ki/K{) 
where AAGt,inding is the difference in the binding energy of 
wild-type and mutant inhibitor to subtilisin BPN', K, is the 
dissociation constant for wild-type CI2, and K,' is the 
dissociation constant for mutant CI2. Values of AAGt,inding 
for all mutants are shown in Table 3.

energy, AAGint(~1), between residues 58 and 60 in the 
complex formed between C12 and subtilisin BPN', in a 
manner analogous to that described for AAGint(~): 
E-XY-EX - E-Y-E 
AAGint(EI) = 'binding 'binding 
By using the binding energies given in Table 3 for the single 
and double mutants, AAGht(~l) for T58AE60A is 2.10 f 0.13 
kcal mol-' and for T58DE60A AAGint(~l) is 4.23 f 0.16 kcal 
mol-'. 
DISCUSSION 
Contribution of Residues in the Reactive Site Loop to 
Protein Stability. Thr-58 and Glu-60 both contribute some 
0.7 kcal mol-' to protein stability (Table 2). Threonine at 
position 58 and an acidic residue at position 60 are highly 
conserved within the potato inhibitor I family of serine 
protease inhibitors; see Table 4. Mutation of Thr-58 to Ala 
could result in the loss of two possible hydrogen bonds 
between Or' of Thr-58 and OC2 of Glu-60, and NV2 of Arg 
67, see Table 1, and van der Waals interactions of CY. In 
this case, the side chain is exposed to solvent and Cy makes 
no van der Waals contacts; therefore, the destabilization 
energy reflects the loss of hydrogen bonds. Studies on the 
tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Fersht et al., 1985), barnase 
(Serrano et al., 1992), and T4 lysozyme (Alber et al., 1987; 
Alber, 1989) have shown that the destabilization energy on 
deletion of a hydrogen-bonding group from a protein is 
highly variable and context-dependent. For deletion of a 
side-chain group that makes a hydrogen bond with a charged 
group in which there is access of water to the site of mutation, 
AA&-F is found to vary between 0 and 1.9 kcal mol-'. 
The destabilization energy measured for T58A is consistent 
with these values. 
The mutation T58D creates a possible salt bridge with Arg￾67. Single, solvent-exposed salt bridges have been found 
to contribute between 0.3 and 1 kcal mol-' to protein stability 
(Akke & ForsCn, 1990; Dao-Pin et al., 1991; Horovitz et 
al., 1990; Sali et al., 1991). In this case, however, a favorable 
electrostatic interaction with Arg-67 is likely to be offset by 
(i) the loss of the hydrogen bond with Glu-60 and (ii) an 
unfavorable electrostatic interaction with Glu-60. These Reactive Site Loop Mutants of C12 Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 46, 1994 13885

Calculated using homology-derived secondary structure of proteins program (Sander & Schneider, 1991). 
unfavorable and favorable interactions balance out which 
results in the mutation having little, or no, effect on protein 
stability. 
The mutation E60A removes three possible hydrogen 
bonds between OE1 and NE of Arg-62, OE2 and the hydroxyl 
group of Thr-58, and OE2 and the NH of its own backbone, 
see Table 1. In addition, the mutation may remove an 
exposed salt bridge with Arg-65. Removal of this group 
and these favorable interactions may be offset by the access 
of water to the point of mutation replacing some of the lost 
hydrogen bonds. The mutant is, therefore, only destabilized 
by 0.7 kcal mol-'. 
The double mutant T58AE60A, in which two of the groups 
involved in the hydrogen-bonding and salt bridge network 
in the active site loop are lost, is the most destabilized. 
T58AE60A, however, is only slightly destabilizing. This 
suggests that an aspartic acid group at position 58 can replace 
some of the interactions lost on deletion of the glutamic acid 
group at position 60. 
Interaction between Thr-58/Asp-58 and Glu-60 in Free 
Inhibitor. The interaction energy between a threonine or 
aspartic acid at position 58 and glutamic acid at position 60 
can be calculated using double mutant cycles. A formal 
analysis of the use of double mutant cycles to calculate 
interaction energies is given elsewhere (Horovitz & Fersht, 
1990; Horovitz et al., 1990) and will not be discussed in 
detail here. We find there is a significant interaction energy 
for both double mutants. AAGlnt(~) = 0.50 f 0.16 and 0.39 
f 0.14 kcal mol-', for T58AE60A and T58DE60A, respec￾tively. For T58AE60A, the interaction energy results from 
the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Thr-58 
and the OC2 of Glu-60, which is lost on mutation of either 
T58A or E60A. Thus, this hydrogen bond contributes, in 
effect, some 0.4 kcal mol-' to protein stability. For 
T58DE60A, the introduction of the aspartic acid group at 
position 58 in the presence of the glutamic acid at position 
60 (T58D mutant) may result in unfavorable electrostatic 
interactions between the two negatively charged groups and 
or steric strain. The introduction of the aspartic acid in the 
absence of glutamic acid at position 60 (T58DE60A mutant) 
will not result in such unfavorable interactions. In this case, 
the interaction energy is a measure of the unfavorable 
interactions between Asp-58 and Glu-60. 
Contribution of Residues in the Reactive Site Loop to 
Protein Activity. The presence of both Thr-58 and Glu-60 
make significant contributions to the inhibitory activity of 
the protein: there is a significant increase in K,, 80 and 140 
fold on mutation of T58A and E60A, respectively, represent￾ing decreases in binding energy of 2.6 and 2.9 kcal mol-', 
respectively. Thr-58 and Glu-60 make no contacts with 
subtilisin BPN' in the crystal structure of the subtilisin BPN': 
chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 complex (McPhalen et al., 1985). 
The effects of these mutations on the stability of the complex 
must, therefore, be due to intramolecular and not intermo￾lecular interactions. 
Although mutation of T58D has little or no effect on the 
stability of the protein (Table 2), it is found to have a large 
effect on the inhibitory activity of the protein and destabilizes 
the subtilisin BPN':CI2 complex by 2 kcal mol-'. The side 
chain in the free inhibitor is exposed to solvent. In this case, 
it is possible that the larger aspartic acid group introduces 
little, or no, steric strain. In the complex, however, the side 
chain is buried in a densely packed region, and the larger 
aspartic acid group may be more difficult to accommodate 
without some unfavorable steric strain. 
All mutations are found to have a much larger effect on 
the stability of the complex than on the stability of the free 
inhibitor. This may result from the difference in the 
environment of the residues in the free inhibitor and in the 
complex. In the former, the side chains are largely exposed 
to solvent. This has two effects. First, the effective dielectric 
constant may be close to that for water. In comparison, the 
side chains in the complex are completely buried and the 
effective dielectric constant will be significantly lower. In 
this case, electrostatic interactions will be larger. It has been 
shown that the strength of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges 
varies according to environment. Whereas hydrogen bonds 
and salt bridges on the surface of proteins are found to have 
only a small effect on stability, buried hydrogen bonds and 
salt bridges are found to have a much larger effect. A buried 
charge without a partner, for example, will result in a major 
destabilizing effect on protein stability (3 -4 kcal mol-'; 
Fersht, 1972, 1987, 1988). In principle, the net contribution 
of a hydrogen bond between two groups in a protein will be 
small, since it will reflect only the difference between the 
energies of interaction of the groups with each other relative 13886 Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 46, 1994 
to the interaction of those hydrogen-bonding groups with 
water (Fersht, 1985). The burial of a charged hydrogen bond 
donor or acceptor without its partner will, however, be very 
destabilizing. In addition, the side chains in the complex 
are in a more densely packed environment than in the free 
inhibitor. Thus, unfavorable steric interactions in the 
complex will be worse. 
Interaction between Thr-58/Asp-58 and Glu-60 in Complex 
with Subtilisin BPN‘. The interaction energy between a 
threonine or aspartic acid group at position 58 and the 
glutamic acid group at position 60 in the complex between 
subtilisin BPN’ and C12 has been calculated using double 
mutant cycles. The interaction energies are 2.10 f 0.13 and 
4.23 f 0.16 kcal mol-’ measured for T58AE60A and 
T58DE60A, respectively. Thus, there is a significant 
interaction between these residues in the complex. These 
interaction energies are significantly larger than those 
measured in the free inhibitor. For T58AE60A, the interac￾tion energy is a measure of the strength of the hydrogen bond 
between the hydroxyl of Thr-58 and the O‘* of Glu-60. The 
hydrogen bond is much weaker in the free idubitor where 
the dielectric constant is high and there is access of water to 
the site of mutation. For T58DE60A, the interaction energy 
has contributions from unfavorable electrostatic interactions 
and steric strain. Both of these factors will be more 
important in the complex than in the free inhibitor because 
the side chains are buried and there is a low effective 
dielectric constant, no access of water to the site of mutation, 
and close-packing of the side chains. 
Mechanism of Inhibition of Subtilisin BPN‘ by Chymo￾trypsin Inhibitor 2. Previous kinetic studies on C12 (Long￾staff et al., 1990) have found that the kinetic data are 
consistent with a simple bimolecular association, where 
inhibitor binds with minimal change in inhibitor structure 
such that the E1 adduct represents a frozen Michaelis complex 
or something closely related to it. The data presented here 
are also consistent with this mechanism; Le., plots of (v, - 
v,)/v, are linear over the inhibitor concentration range studied. 
It has been proposed that hydrolysis of the scissile bond is 
slow in wild-type C12 because (i) inhibitor binds tightly to 
the enzyme leading to a very stable complex and (ii) the 
activation barrier for hydrolysis is raised by having an 
inflexible peptide in the substrate binding cleft. In this way 
the E1 complex is in a thermodynamic “pit” with a large 
barrier preventing hydrolysis (Longstaff et al., 1990). Data 
presented here support this hypothesis. Mutants of C12 that 
significantly decrease the binding energy and decrease the 
stability/flexibility of the reactive site loop also show 
temporary inhibition due to the slow hydroLysis of the scissile 
bond. 
Comparison of the data for T58A and E60A in the free 
inhibitor and in the complex shows that, whereas the 
destabilization energies for the two mutants are very similar 
in the free inhibitor, E60A is significantly more destabilizing 
in the complex. This suggests that the interactions made by 
Glu-60 are more critical for inhibition than those made by 
Thr-58. The O‘* of Glu-60 makes a hydrogen bond with its 
own amide proton. Previous studies on eglin c have shown 
that this hydrogen bond is important for inhibition (Bode et 
al., 1986; Heinz et al., 1992). Our studies agree with this 
conclusion. In addition, the double mutant T58DE60A has 
little effect on the stability of the complex. We propose that 
this could, in part, be due to the aspartic acid replacing the 
Jackson and Fersht 
interactions made by Glu-60, including the hydrogen bond 
to the backbone amide of residue 60. 
Hydrolysis of Destabilized C12 Mutants by Subtilisin BPN. 
By comparison of data from destabilizing mutants in the 
active site loop and in the hydrophobic core of CI2, we have 
shown that the hydrolysis of C12 does not result from the 
global destabilization of the protein but must be a conse￾quence of local destabilization of the reactive site loop. The 
reversal of inhibition due to the hydrolysis of the inhibitor 
can be limited by either the rate of hydrolysis of the scissile 
bond, i.e., the equilibrium constant between cleaved (EI*) 
and noncleaved (EI) forms of the bound inhibitor, or by 
dissociation of the ET* complex. For T58AE60A, kd = 3.5 
x s-’. This value is close to the values of ko~ 
determined for the more destabilized mutants; see Table 3. 
This suggests that the rate-limiting step is the dissociation 
of the ET* complex. It is perhaps interesting to note that, 
with the exception of T58D, there is a very strong correlation 
between the destabilization energy in the free inhibitor and 
in the complex (the slope of the plot is 4.3, the intercept is 
-0.3, and the correlation coefficient is 0.99). 
CONCLUSIONS 
Thr-58 and Glu-60, residues whose functional groups are 
conserved among the potato inhibitor I family of serine 
protease inhibitors, have some importance in the stability of 
the free inhibitor. They are far more important, however, 
for the stability of enzyme-inhibitor complex and are 
essential for the activity of C12. These residues take part in 
the hydrogen-bonding and salt bridge network within the 
active site loop which is a characteristic of this family of 
inhibitors.
