Abstract 
The rate constants, k,,, for the formation of hen (chicken) lysozyme (HEWL) .Fab-lO complexes have been determined 
for wild-type (WT) and epitope-mutated lysozymes by a homogeneous solution method based on the 95% reduced 
enzymatic activity of the complex. The values fall within a narrow IO-fold range [(0.18 to 1.92) X lo6 M" s-I 1. The 
affinity constants, KO. cover a broader, 440-fold, range from 0.075 to 33 nM. Values of KO as high as 7 pM were 
obtained for the complexes prepared from some mutations at HEWL positions 96 and 97, but the associated kinetic 
constants could not be determined. The values of k,, are negatively correlated with side-chain volume at posi￾tion IOIHEWL, but are essentially independent of this parameter for position 21HEWL substitutions. The multiple muta￾tions made at positions 21HEWL and ~O~HEWL provide sufficient experimental data on complex formation to evaluate @ 
values [@ = (AAGi;,)/(AAG,)] at these two positions to begin to define trajectories for protein-protein association. The 
data, when interpreted within the concept of a two-step association sequence embracing a metastable encounter complex 
intermediate, argue that the rate determining step at position 2lHEWL (aavg = 0.2) is encounter complex formation, but 
the larger @'a\.g value of 0.36 experienced for most position 10l~EwL mutations indicates a larger contribution from the 
post-encounter annealing process at this site for these replacements.

The importance of macromolecular recognition in guiding a large 
number, if not the majority, of cellular metabolic processes such as 
signal transduction, apoptosis, transcription, cell to cell communi￾cation, protein folding, etc., is becoming increasingly appreciated. 
The understanding of protein recognition is, at present, predomi￾nantly qualitative; however, a number of careful investigations on 
the thermodynamics and kinetics of these reactions have been

These interactions require the establishment of contacts typically 
between 10-20 individual amino acids from each interacting part￾ner (Janin & Chothia, 1990). Site-directed mutagenesis studies 
have begun to probe their relative contributions (e.g., Wells, 1991; 
Jin & Wells, 1994; Clackson & Wells, 1995; Schreiber & Fersht, 
1995; Dall'Acqua et al., 1996). 
The role of protein-protein interactions has been extensively 
studied with components of the immune system. X-ray structures 
of the complexes have guided kinetic and site-directed mutagen￾esis investigations of several protein antigen-antibody complexes, 
including that of the chicken lysozyme specific monoclonal anti￾body, D1.3 (England et al., 1997). 
The lysozyme (HEWL) . HyHEL- 10 Fab (Fab-IO) complex was 
characterized by Padlan et al. (1989), and free energy contributions 
of the chicken lysozyme epitope residues Asnl9, Arg21, AsplOl, 
and Gly 102 were evaluated by extensive amino acid replacements 
(Kam-Morgan et al., 1993). Replacements of several HyHEL-IO 
Fv paratope residues have also been thermodynamically investi￾gated (Tsumoto et al., 1995, 1996). Methods are presented in the 
present study that allow determination of the kinetics describing 
1857 M.G. Taylor et al. 
the formation and decomposition of mutant HEWL. WT Fab-IO 
complexes. The association rate constants are monitored by the 
decrease in activity associated with the formation of the nearly 
inactive HEWL . WT Fab- 10 complex. The ratios of the difference 
activation energies of formation, AAG$,(MUTAGJ, - wTAGi,) to 
the difference free energies of dissociation, AAGD(WTAGD - 
MUTAGD), are referred to as @ values, a parameter related to the p 
values of the Bransted relationship, and introduced by Fersht and 
colleagues to evaluate transition state structures in protein folding 
studies (Sancho et al., 1991; Fersht et al., 1992; Horovitz & Fersht, 
1992; Matouschek et al., 1992; Sancho & Fersht, 1992; Serrano 
et al., 1992a, 1992b, 1992~). The large data set of individual site 
replacements allows the determination of two sets of @ values 
describing the extent of interaction at lysozyme positions 21 and 
101 in the transition state of antigen-antibody complex formation. 
Results 
Wild-type HEWL. Fab-IO complex 
The value of KO for the WT 9 Fab-10 complex is 75 f 8 pM 
(Table I); therefore, the rates of dissociation of the complexes do 
not significantly intrude into the kinetics, for all but the weakest 
complexes, because [Fab-IO] was generally >>KD. 
The value of k,, for the WT.Fab-IO complex formation is 
1.49 f 0.07 X lo6 M" s-' . Dissociation rate constants can be 
calculated from the independently determined values for KO and 
k,, as kOff = kon/KD, or measured independently as described in 
Rajpal et al. (1998). Smith-Gill et al. (pers. obs.) measured k,, and 
koff values of 0.23 X lo6 M" s-I and 0.52 X spl, respec￾tively, for the WT HEWL reaction with HyHEL-IO, by surface 
plasmon resonance analysis at pH 7.4 with 150 mM NaCl added. 
The calculated KO is 220 pM. 
Aspartate 101 mutants 
Asp101 makes a hydrogen bond with T~r53~ on the Fab-10 heavy 
chain (Padlan et al., 1989) (Fig. IC). Equilibrium constants for the 
substitutedAsplO1 HEWL.Fab-10 complexes were determined by 
Kam-Morgan et al. (1993). 
The constants describing the equilibria and kinetics of the in￾teractions of Fab-10 with WT and mutant lysozymes are given in 
Table 1. The WT HEWL + Fab-10 association rate constant is 
1.49 k 0.07 X lo6 M" spl . The mutations at position 101"~~~ 
resulted in 1.5-8.4-fold decreases in the value of this rate constant. 
There may be a slight inverse correlation of the corresponding 
AAGJ, values with side-chain volume (Richards, 1974; Creighton, 
1993) that becomes more apparent when this quantity is greater 
than 80 A3 (Fig. 2a). The negatively charged DlOlE mutant as￾sociates with the antibody with a rate constant that approaches that 
observed with WT lysozyme. A plot of the calculated AAG& val￾ues for position lOlHEWL mutant complexes versus side-chain vol￾umes is shown in Figure 2B. 
Arginine 21 mutants 
Kam-Morgan et al. (1993) found that most Arg21 substitutions, 
presumably disrupting hydrogen bonds to two antibody tyrosine 
residues (see Discussion), resulted in a net loss of 2.2 kcal/mol in 
AAGD compared to the WT HEWL complex (Fig. 3, dotted line). 
The R21A.Fab-IO complex, however, is only 0.82 f 0.08 kcal/ 
mol less stable than that formed from WT HEWL. The R21M. 
Fab-10 AAGD of 2.1 kcal/mol fits the earlier correlation (Rajpal 
et al., 1998). 
The rate constants for the association of all Arg2 1 mutant lyso￾zymes with Fab-10 are about twofold (range: 1.3- to 2.7-fold) less 
than that exhibited by the WT protein except for R21E (5.2-fold 
lower) and R21A (nearly identical to that of WT HEWL) (Fig. 4a). 
A plot of the calculated AAG?, values for position 2 I HEWL mutant 
complexes versus side chain volumes is shown in Figure 4b. 
Lysine 97 mutants 
The only ion pair in the complex is formed from Lys97 of lyso￾zyme and A~p32~ of Fab-IO (Fig. lb) (Padlan et a]., 1989) (see 
Discussion). Six substitutions at position 97HEWL were produced to 
explore the quantitative contribution of this interaction. Replace￾ment with methionine (K97M) resulted in a AAGD of only 0.80 f 
0.15 kcal/mol (Table 1). The arginine replacement, K97R, forms 
a substantially weaker complex (AAGD = 3.05 i 0.32 kcal/mol). 
The values of the AAGD for the position 97HEWL mutants are 
dominated by the size of the side chain with a AAG, of 6.4 kcal/ 
mol between the WT and K97G complexes (Fig. 3). These results 
contrast sharply with the shallow dependencies observed earlier 
for substitutions at positions ~O~HEWL and 21HEWL (Fig. 3, dashed 
and dotted lines, respectively). The values of k,, could only be 
determined for formation of the K97E, M, and R complexes be￾cause the high KD values for the K97G. A, and D complexes make 
it difficult to drive the reactions to completion. 
Other mutants 
Lysine 96 is hydrogen bonded to the side chain carbonyl oxygen of 
the antibody Asn3IL (Fig. Ib) and to the main chain of His15 in 
HEWL (Padlan et al., 1989). Lys96 is also within contact distance 
of Tyr50L. The relatively conservative mutation, K96M, results in 
a substantial, 6.8 kcal/mol (Table I), decrease in affinity for the 
antibody providing clear evidence for the dominance of the E-NH:,' 
interactions at this position. 
The unrefined X-ray structure of the HEWL.Fab-10 complex 
raises the possibility that Tyr20 of lysozyme may form a long 
hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ser91L 
(roo-o = 3.4 A) (Padlan et al., 1989). The resultant Y20F mutant 
has about the same affinity and indistinguishable kinetics for anti￾body as WT lysozyme (Table I); therefore, the postulated hydro￾gen bond does not contribute significantly to the free energy of 
association. 
The main-chain amide nitrogen of Gly102 forms a hydrogen 
bond with the side-chain phenolic oxygen of Tyr5& (Y~.~ = 
2.6 A) (Padlan et al., 1989). Replacement of this group with valine, 
the WT residue in Japanese Quail lysozyme, resulted in small 
changes in rate constants and equilibria (Table I), showing that the 
increased steric hindrance of the larger valine side chain does not 
significantly effect association.

free energies of association, AGD, for these protein complexes 
cover a wide range: (-4.8 to - 19.4 kcal/mol; reviewed by Horton 
& Lewis, 1992; see also Braun et al., 1988). Antibody-protein 
antigen complexes typically involve buried surface areas of 1,250- 
1,950 (Janin, 1995). 
Intermolecular contacts in protein-protein interfaces include hy￾drogen bonds, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions. Bound 
solvent molecules are released (Bhat et al., 1994), and decreases in 
the conformational entropies of interacting side chains ensue upon 
association. The relative contributions of each of these factors is 
likely to be system dependent. 
Association rate constants, k,,, are 105-109 M" s-' (reviewed 
by Janin & Chothia, 1990; see also Schreiber & Fersht, 1995; 
Janin, 1997), but the range is smaller for monoclonal antibody￾protein antigen complexes: 105-106 M" s" (Friguet et al., 1989; 
Janin & Chothia, 1990; Foote &Winter, 1992; Raman et al., 1992; 
Janin, 1995; Glaser & Hausdorf, 1996; England et al., 1997). The 
variation within the KO values is thus primarily due to the large 
range in the corresponding dissociation rate constants (1-10" 
s-I) (Janin & Chothia, 1990). As a result, mutations that perturb 
the various residue-residue contacts predominantly effect kos, with 
considerably less effect on k,, although a contrary example has 
recently been observed (Smith-Gill et al., pers. obs.). 
Methodology 
The determination of the KD values for the complexes of Fab-10 
with WT and mutant HEWLs in homogeneous solution was en￾abled by the fact that this antibody occludes the active site of the 
enzyme, so that the extent of complex formation parallels the 
decrease in activity (Kam-Morgan et al., 1993). The fully associ￾ated complex does exhibit about 5% of WT activity in the Micro￾coccus luteus cell wall assay (Shugar, 1952). This residual activity 
was usually ignored in the analysis, but inclusion sometimes im￾proved the fit of the data to the calculated curves generated by the 
models (Equation 2 of Rajpal et al., 1998). 
Similarly, advantage was taken of the decrease in activity 
associated with complex formation to determine the value of the 
association rate constant. The rate law is given in Equation 1 in 
Materials and methods, and the derivation is in the Appendix. 
Surface plasmon resonance is a generally applied method for 
measuring the rate constants for protein-protein interactions, be￾cause of its wide applicability and ease of use. This method re￾quires that one of the two components of the reaction mixture be 
immobilized while the second flows over that surface. Thus, this is 
a heterogeneous, as opposed to a homogeneous, system with as￾sociated limitations. Schuck and Minton (1996) discussed exam- Chicken lysozyme' HyHEL-IO Fab kinetics 1861

insufficient reagent flow rates, and steric hindrance within immo￾bilized protein surfaces can result in apparent affinity and kinetic 
constants that have no direct relationship to those determined in 
homogeneous solution (Nieba et al., 1996; Sadana & Chen, 1996; 
England et al., 1997). 
Aspartate 101 
Crystallographic studies suggest that Asp101 is hydrogen bonded 
to the antibody residue, T~r53~, as well as being within contact 
distance of T~r33~, Ser52H, Ser5'lH, and Ser56H (Padlan et al., 
1989) (Fig. IC). In addition, the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of 
T~r53~ is within 2.3 8, of a carboxylate oxygen atom of AsplOl; 
a presumably unfavorable contact. Comparison of the structures of 
free and complexed lysozyme established that AsplOl undergoes 
significant rearrangement upon binding to Fab-IO. 
Substitution of AsplOl with other amino acids leads to de￾creases in the stabilities in the corresponding HEWL.Fab-IO com￾plexes that are well correlated with increasing side-chain volume. 
The slope = 0.012 k 0.002 kcal/mol/A3, for example, the AAGD's 
of the Dl01 A and DlOlF complexes from that of WT are 1.5 and 
2.5 kcal/mol, respectively (Kam-Morgan et al., 1993) (Fig. 3). The 
WT.Fab-10 complex is 1.6 kcal/mol more stable than predicted

showing the importance of additional factors, such as optimal elec￾trostatic and nonpolar interactions. 
The dependence of the values of k,, upon side-chain volume in 
the 101 series is very slight (Table 1; Fig. 2A). Most mutations 
elicit only an approximately threefold drop in this rate constant, 
while slightly larger decreases were observed with those mutations 1862 M.G. Taylor et al. 
that substitute larger side chains (Le., DlOlK, DIOIF, or DIOIR). 
The k,, value for formation of the DlOlE complex is only de￾creased by one-third compared to WT. This might have been ex￾pected from the retention of the anion in the side chain; however, 
kOff for the DlOlE complex is anomalously large (see below). 
The slope of 0.0045 f 0.0005 kcal/mol/A3, correlating the 
values of AAG:,, is a little smaller than that of 0.0067 f 0.0021 
kcal/mol/W3 for AAGiH. Thus, more of the mutational induced 
change in AAGD in this series is reflected in the dissociation rate 
constants. This appears to be the more common observation in 
mutational analyses of protein/protein interactions (e.g., Friguet 
et al., 1989; Foote & Winter, 1992; Schreiber & Fersht, 1995; 
England et al., 1997). 
The value of kOff for the DlOlE complex is significantly larger 
than that predicted from the correlation line of Figure 2B. This is 
unexpected, given the retention of the negative charge. The value 
of KD for the DlOlG complex is nearly indistinguishable from that 
of WT (Kam-Morgan et al., 1993), as is the corresponding value of 
koff (Table 1). 
Arginine 21 
The quanidinium side chain of Arg21 forms hydrogen bonds with 
the antibody residues, Ty196~ and Tyr50H (Padlan et al., 1989) 
(Fig. 1A). The main-chain amide moiety of Arg21 also hydrogen 
bonds to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of A~n92~. Arg21 is also 
within contact distance of residues Tyr.58~ and Tr~98~. 
Most substitutions at position 2lHEWL studied by Kam-Morgan 
et al. (1993) (R21G, N, E, Q, and W) destabilize the resultant 
complexes by about 2.2 kcal/mol relative to the WT complex; a 
pattern very different from that observed at position ~OIHEWL 
(Fig. 3). Only the cationic amino acid substitutions, R21K and 
R2 1 H, exhibited any deviation from this pattern, consistent with a 
small partial restoration of the overall binding energy (Kam￾Morgan et al., 1993). A current analysis of the stabilities of the 
R21A, M, and V complexes found additionally that the stability of 
the complex is inversely proportional to the size of the aliphatic 
side chain (Rajpal et al., 1998). 
Most mutations at position 2lHEWL result in 30-60% reductions 
in the value of k,, for complex formation. These observations 
contrast with those recorded for mutations in the F, for the WT 
HEWL. D1.3 complex where unchanged values or small increases 
ink,, were mostly observed (It0 et al., 1995; England et al., 1997). 
The value of k,, for formation of the R21A complex is identical to 
that of WT, an observation that by itself might be interpreted as 
countering the view that long-range electrostatic forces are impor￾tant in determining the values of k,, (Kozack & Subramanian, 
1993; Van Oss, 1995). Charge reversal at this position (R21E), 
however, introduces the largest decrease of k,, introduced in this 
series (80%). There are insufficient data in the literature to gener￾alize on this point. 
The general rule that the effects of mutations are most pronounced 
in the rate constants for the dissociation of protein-protein com￾plexes is obeyed in the Arg2l series. The increases in k,,ff range from 
threefold for the R2 1 A complex to above 50-fold in the R2 1 Q com￾plex. There is no correlation with charge type as the R21K, M, and 
E complexes dissociate with nearly the same rate constants. 
Lysine 97 
Only one intermolecular salt bridge is observed in the X-ray struc￾ture of the HEWL-Fab-IO complex (Padlan et al., 1989). It is 
between Lys97 and Asp32~ (Fig. 1B). Lys97 is also in van der 
Waals contact with T~r33~ and T1p98~. These authors suggested 
that the large distance between the charged atoms (3.6 A) and the 
presence of a single water molecule in van der Waals contact with 
the €-amino group of Lys97 would tend to reduce the contribution 
of this charge-charge interaction to the overall binding energy. 
Substitutions at position 97HEWL result in as much as five orders 
of magnitude decrease in antibody affinity relative to WT HEWL 
contrasting with the position IOlHEWL and 21HEWL results (Fig. 3). 
In general, the AAGD values increase as the side-chain volume of 
the substituted residue deviates from that of the original lysine. 
That is, the smallest residue replacements (K97G, K97A, and K97D) 
yield the largest losses in free energy of association (6.41 f 0.10, 
5.54 f 0.12, and 6.75 f 0.14 kcal/mol, respectively). The K97M 
mutant, which was generated to remove the positive charge with 
minimum effect on the rest of the side chain, produced only a 
minor destabilization in the free energy of complex formation 
(AAGD = 0.80 f 0.15 kcal/mol). This small value is not un￾expected in light of a recent study in which Asp32, was mutated 
to an asparagine, resulting in the loss of the same ion pair, with 
little effect on affinity (AAGD = 0.40 f 0.25 kcal/mol) (Tsumoto 
et al., 1996). The K97R mutation, which preserves the positive 
charge at this position, results in a moderate destabilization relative 
to the WT complex, further illustrating the minimal contribution of 
the cation in this charge-charge interaction. 
A computational analysis of a variety of salt bridges demon￾strated that molecular modeling replacement of charged residues 
with hydrophobic isosteres often results in more favorable free 
energy of association (Hendsch & Tidor, 1994). They suggested 
further that the role of salt bridges may be to increase specificity 
at the expense of excess free energy of association. 
The changes in the rate constants associated with the K97M 
complex are an interesting exception to the general tendency of 
free energy changes to be reflected predominantly in k,ff. The 
value of kOff in this case is, within error, not much changed from 
that of the WT complex, while that for k,, is decreased nearly 
threefold (Table 1). 
Transition state structures for protein docking 
The elegant, modified Bronsted, protein engineering approach to 
the experimental determination of transition state structures in pro￾tein folding reactions, developed by Fersht and his associates, can 
be extended to protein-protein interactions. The analysis measures 
the effect of a series of mutations at a given position on the ratio: 
where AAG!nf is the difference in free energy of activation for the 
unfolding rate constant of the mutant versus the wild-type protein, 
and AAG::f is the corresponding difference in the total free energy 
of unfolding. A value of = 0 indicates that the residue in 
question lies in an environment in the transition state that closely 
resembles that of the folded state, while a value of aUnf = 1 implies 
the converse (Sancho et al., 1991; Fersht et al., 1992; Horovitz & 
Fersht, 1992; Matouschek et al., 1992; Sancho & Fersht, 1992; 
Serrano et al., 1992a, 1992b, 1992~). 
We can describe two general models for protein association. In 
the first, the process is resolved notionally into the two steps Chicken lysozyme. HyHEL-10 Fab kinetics 
shown in Figure 5. The first is the formation of an encounter 
complex that is relatively unpopulated compared to the reactant 
and transition states. This species is characterized by the loss of 
three degrees each of translational and rotational entropy accom￾panying “2 + 1” association reactions. These entropy losses are in 
part offset by introduced vibrations specific to the complex (Jencks, 
1981). The components of such a complex as envisioned would 
largely retain the solvation shells of the individual proteins, and 
few of the short-range interactions of the docked complex would 
be established (Van Oss, 1995). The second step is the annealing 
process, in which the solvent structure of the interface is formed, 
short-range hydrophobic, hydrogen bond, and electrostatic inter￾actions are made, and conformational changes achieved both at the 
epitope-paratope interface as well as at remote sites (Williams 
et al., 1996). 
We extend the @ value concept to protein-protein interactions 
hv the formula: 
AAGK, a=- 
AAGD ’ 
According to this model, a Q, value near zero, i.e., where the 
effect of a series of mutations at a single site on the association rate 
constants is very small compared to those on the overall equilib￾rium constant, is characteristic of a docking transition state where 
the first step, i.e., formation of the encounter complex at this site, 
is rate determining, and annealing steps are rapid compared to 
complex dissociation. This is so, because single site mutations 
would be expected to have negligible effects on the physics of 
diffusion. Larger values of @ signal increasing contributions from 
the annealing process. Different @ values can be associated with 
each site on the protein, and can be used to provide information 
about the docking trajectory

Reaction Coordinate 
Fig. 5. Reaction coordinate diagram describing a protein-protein inter￾action (PI + P2 + PI .PI). Most mutations have little effect on the asso￾ciation rate constant, while the majority of the effect in AAG, is reflected 
in AAGAff. The dip in the profile represents the encounter complex (E.C.) 
(see Janin, 1997). Step 1, encounter complex formation is the highest 
barrier at those epitope sites with low values, while step 2, annealing of 
the encounter complex, is a significant kinetic barrier at those positions 
with larger @ values (see Discussion). 
1863 
A simpler, but physically unlikely, model involves a single 
transition state, where all interactions reach their greatest free 
energy barrier height at the same fractional extent of the reac￾tion. This model, which allows no metastable intermediates, is 
extremely improbable for such a complicated process involving 
the establishment of numerous intermolecular contacts and sol￾vation changes. The @ values in this second model provide a 
measure of the extent of bond making at each site in the tran￾sition state. 
The preponderance of the experimental data presented here and 
in the cited references shows that the effects of mutation are largely 
realized in the values of kOB; therefore, the transition state for 
docking in most cases, is early (step 1 of Fig. 5). Implementation 
of the Brgnsted analysis requires that a statistically large number of 
substituents be introduced at each probed position, and that the 
majority of these at this site generate similar @ values. Outliers in 
a series will be found occasionally; i.e., the @ value for a given 
substitution at a particular site is significantly different from the 
average @ value for the others at this site. This can occur as a result 
of division of small AAGK, by a small AAGD, leading to a large 
apparent error, and an artifactual deviation. Alternatively, a given 
mutation can effect the energetics at remote sites. This outcome 
may sometimes be distinguished by double mutant cycle analysis 
(Carter et al., 1984; Goldman et al., 1997). The present work, to 
the best of our knowledge, is the first to present sufficient accu￾mulated experimental data to permit a Brgnsted analysis of protein￾protein interactions. 
@ Values at specific sites 
Replacement of Arg21 with glycine, asparagine, glutamine, or his￾tidine gave CP values ranging from 0.01-0.12, while the larger 
lysine, methionine, and tryptophan resulted in slightly higher @ 
values of 0.20-0.26 (Table 2; Fig. 6A). The weighted average for 
these seven replacements is 0.14 +_ 0.03. These combined data 
argue that the environment of Arg21 in the docking transition state 
is very close to what it is in free lysozyme and that specific inter￾actions made with, for example, T~r96~ and Tyr50H follow in post 
rate-determining steps. That is, the rate-determining step is the 
formation of the encounter complex as experienced by this site. 
The R21E mutation results in a higher 6, value of 0.37 consistent 
with a substantial kinetic barrier contribution from the annealing 
step for this charge reversal mutation. 
Accurate @ values could be determined only for the K97E and 
K97R mutations at this position (Table 2). Both of these values are 
about 0.2, despite the opposite charges. The transition state is early 
in this, as in the position 21HEWL series. The apparent @ value for 
the K97M mutation of 0.7 may be unreliable, due to the large 
associated error. 
The largest number, nine, of @ values were determined at po￾sition ~OIHEWL (Table 2; Fig. 6B). That for DlOlG is unreliable 
because of the small perturbation in AAG values. The weighted 
average of the other seven @ values, DlOlE excluded, is a very 
well defined 0.36 f 0.03. These results could argue that the tran￾sition state experienced at position 10IHEWL occurs later on the 
reaction coordinate than it does for residues at position 21HEWL. 
The one mutation, however, that conserves the charge, DlOlE, 
generates a small @ value of 0.10 f 0.02. This figure argues for an 
early transition state at position IO~HEWL. The difference could be 
a simple manifestation of favorable electrostatic steering that in￾creases the proportion of productive collisions. 1864

A few mutations were made at positions 20HEWL, 96HEWL, and

for experimental reasons. 
Why are Q, values so small in protein-protein interactions? 
The rates of formation of protein-small molecule complexes are 
generally fast, and often approach diffusion controlled limits (Brou￾wer & Kirsch, 1982). Specific association rate constants at defined 
sites can be reduced significantly from the 108-109 M-' s-' 
expected for diffusion-controlled reactions by a variety of factors 
including restricted solid angle geometry (Solc & Stockmayer, 
1973), conformational changes in which the substrate reacts with 
a minor conformer, association coupled with pre-organization or 
desolvation of the binding site (Julin & Kirsch, 1989; Cannon 
et al., 1996), or association with a minor prototropic form of the 
enzyme or ligand. 
The above considerations do not generally apply to protein￾protein interactions. That is, the solid angles of interaction are 
relatively large and are confined to the surface, and significant 
conformational changes on association are rare. The fact that the

association rate constants are mostly in the 105-107 M-' s" 
range (Janin & Chothia, 1990) suggests that association with a 
minor prototropic form of one of the protein partners is uncom￾mon. These factors taken together account for the early transition 
states noted for most protein-protein association reactions. On the 
other hand, later transition states would be expected for protein 
association reactions where the chains fold cooperatively (Tsai 
et al., 1997). 
Material and methods 
Materials 
Wild-type HEWL, M. luteus (Micrococcus lysodeikticus), and corn 
steep liquor were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St. 
Louis, Missouri). The inactive lysozyme mutant, E35Q, was a gift 
from Dr. Ichiro Matsumura. Mutants of lysozyme at posi￾tions 21HEWL, 10IHEWL, and I02HEWL were prepared by Drs. Lei 
Zhang and Lauren Kam-Morgan. The Fab fragment of HyHEL- IO 
was prepared by use of the ImmunoPure Fab Kit (Pierce Chemical 
Company, Rockford, Illinois). 
Expression of mutant lysozymes 
Site-directed mutagenesis of the hen egg-white lysozyme gene was 
performed according to Malcolm et al. (1989) with modifications 
described by Shih et al. (1993) and Matsumura and Kirsch (1996). 
Expression and purification were carried out according to Kam￾Morgan et al. (1993) and Matsumura and Kirsch (1996). 
Purification of mutant lysozymes 
Cultures were centrifuged at 4,500 X g at 4 "C for 10 min to 
remove cells (lysozyme is excreted into the media). The pH of the Chicken lysozyme. HyHEL-10 Fab kinetics 1865 
remaining media was raised to 10.7 with concentrated NaOH, 
followed by centrifugation at 12,000 X g at 4 "C for 10 min. The 
pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was quickly brought to 
pH 4.7 with concentrated HCI. The crude fraction was diluted 1 : 1 
with distilled de-ionized water and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose 
column (2.5 X 12 cm) pre-equilibrated with 10 mM KHz PO4 (pH 
4.7) (Buffer A). The column was washed with 200-300 mL Buffer 
A and eluted with a gradient from 0-1.5 M NaCl in Buffer A. 
Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration using 
an Amicon YM-I0 membrane, and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose 
column (2.5 X 10 cm) pre-equilibrated with 66 mM potassium 
phosphate buffer, pH 6.24 (Buffer B). The column was washed 
with 200-300 mL Buffer B and eluted with 0.5 M NaCl in Buffer 
B. Active fractions were pooled, and concentrated and desalted 
using the Centricon- 10 microconcentrator. Protein concentrations 
were determined from ~2~" = 38,500 M" cm" (Sophianopoulos 
et al., 1962). 
Determination of antibody concentration 
Antibody (or Fab fragment) concentration was determined by ti￾tration with WT lysozyme. Aliquots of lysozyme (10 nM = 100 X 
ICD) were pre-incubated at 25 "C for 1 h with various volumes of 
added antibody stock solution, and the residual activity monitored 
by the M. luteus assay (Shugar, 1952). The concentration of anti￾body was determined by extrapolating the volume of added anti￾body stock solution necessary to effect maximal inhibition of 
lysozyme activity. 
Determination of afinity constants for 
lysozyme-antibody complexes 
Equilibrium constants for the complexes of the active lysozyme 
forms with either whole HyHEL-10 antibody or the Fab fragment 
(Fab-IO) were determined by the previously described competitive 
inhibition assay (Kam-Morgan et al., 1993). Fully complexed ly￾sozyme retains approximately 5% of the original enzyme activity. 
As a result, the equation used by Kam-Morgan et al. (1993) to 
calculate equilibrium constants has been modified slightly to ac￾count for this residual activity (Rajpal et al., 1998). 
Determination of the rate constants for the 
association of lysozyme with antibody 
Lysozyme variants (1-4 nM) were mixed with a 5-40 fold molar 
excess of Fab-10 in the presence of 10-200 pg/mLM. luteus cells 
in Buffer B at 25 "C. Activity was monitored starting 15 s after 
mixing by the decrease in light scattering at 450 nm. The associ￾ation rate constant, k,,, was calculated by nonlinear regression fit 
(using either the SAS statistical analysis program; Ray, 1982; or 
KaleidagraphTM 3.0) of either the enzyme velocity, uobs (deter￾mined at several windows of time) using Equation 1 (see Appendix 
for derivation): 
or the raw absorbance data, Absnh,, using Equation 2. The latter is 
the integrated form of Equation 1: 
where [SI = initial cell wall substrate concentration, ET = total 
lysozyme concentration, AbT = total Fab concentration, Absinit = 
initial absorbance, and vhl = blank velocity (Le., the nonenzymatic 
decrease in light scattering with slow time-dependent settling of 
cell wall particles). The K, and kc,, values used in this analysis 
were determined independently by nonlinear regression of enzyme 
activities (in the absence of antibody) from the Michaelis-Menten 
rate equation. Typically, the k,, values were determined from the 
compiled data for 24 individual reactions. 
Propagation of standard error 
Propagated standard errors, SEs, are calculated from individual 
standard errors, as follows: 
SEA,, = d (WTSEA,)2 + (MUTSEAG)2 
where K represents an affinity or rate constant, SEK refers to the 
standard error in that constant, AG represents the corresponding 
free-energy term, and SEA, and SEAAc correspond to the propa￾gated standard errors in AG and AAG, respectively. 
The propagated standard error in a, SEQ, is calculated, as 
follows: 
Appendix 
A simplified kinetic scheme for the competition of antibody, Ab, 
with substrate, S, for the active site of lysozyme, E, is shown 
below:

E .Ab 
where P and Ab represent the degraded cell wall product and the 
antibody concentration, respectively. Rates for the enzyme-catalyzed 
reaction are fast relative to that for antibody association under 
these conditions (data not shown). The observed decrease in light 
scattering, vohs, is equal to the rate of product formation plus the 
rate of nonenzymatic settling of substrate with time, ub,: 
The rate of product formation equals the product of the maximum 
velocity of lysozyme, V,,,,,, and the fraction of enzyme that is 
complexed to substrate: 1866 M.G. Taylor et al. 
where ET equals the total lysozyme concentration (i.e., ET = [E] + 
[ES] + [EAb]). Substituting (kCat[ET]) for V,,, and expanding the 
fraction of enzyme in the ES form gives: 
Note the following: 
[ESi [SI 
[E] + [ES] - K,,, + [SI' 
Substituting Equation 9 into Equation 8, one gets the following: 
Assuming that koff << kon [Ab], the time-dependent loss of enzyme 
that has not complexed with antibody (i.e., [E] + [ES]) can be 
described, as follows: 
because only the uncomplexed form of lysozyme, E, can associate 
with antibody. Expanding the [E] term, the following equation can 
be written: 
d([El+ [ESI) - 
dt - -koJAbl [E] + [ES] ([E] + [ES]). (12) 
Rearranging Equation 9, one gets the following: 
Given experimental conditions in which [AbT] >> [ET] (i.e., 
[Ab] - [Ab,], the total antibody concentration), and substituting 
Equation 13 into Equation 12, the following equation is derived: 
Rearranging Equation 14 and integrating results in the following 
expression: 
(15) 
Substituting Equation 15 into Equation 10, the following equation 
is produced: 
Finally, substituting Equation 16 into Equation 6, one arrives at 
Equation 1 :
