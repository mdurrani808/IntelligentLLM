Different families of protein inhibitors of serine proteases share similar
conformation of the enzyme-binding loop, while their scaffoldings are
completely different. In the enzyme-inhibitor complex, the P1 position of
the loop makes numerous contacts within the S1 pocket and signi®cantly
in¯uences the energy of the interaction. Here, we determine the associ￾ation energies (Ga values) for the interaction of coded P1 variants of
bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) with bovine b-trypsin (BT),
anionic salmon trypsin (AST), bovine a-chymotrypsin (BCHYM), and
human neutrophil elastase (HNE). The respective Ga ranges are 15, 13,
9, and 8 kcal molÿ1 (1 cal  4.18 J). Next, through interscaffolding addi￾tivity cycles, we compare our set of Ga values determined for BCHYM
and HNE with similar data sets available in the literature for three other
inhibitor families. The analysis of the cycles shows that 27 to 83 % of
cycles ful®l the criteria of additvity. In one particular case (comparison of
associations of P1 variants of BPTI and OMTKY3 with BCHYM) there is
a structural basis for strongly non-additive behaviour. We argue that the
interscaffolding additvity depends on sequential and conformational
similarities of sites where the mutation(s) are introduced and on the par￾ticular substitution. In the second interscaffolding analysis, we compare
binding of the same P1 mutants to BT and AST. The high correlation
coef®cient shows that both trypsins recognize with comparable strength
the non-cognate side-chains. However, the cognate Arg and Lys side￾chains are recognized signi®cantly more strongly by AST.

Introduction
Serine proteases and their natural canonical
protein inhibitors belong to the most intensively
studied models of protein-protein recognition
(Laskowski & Kato, 1980; Janin & Chothia, 1990;
Jones & Thornton, 1996; Otlewski & Apostoluk,
1997). Protein inhibitors do not form a single
group but can be divided into about 20 different
families (Laskowski, 1986). Global structures of
proteins representing different inhibitor families
are completely different and comprise a-helical
proteins, b-sheet proteins, a/b-proteins and differ￾ent folds of small disul®de-rich proteins (Bode &
Huber, 1992). The inhibitor binds to the enzyme
through the exposed and convex binding loop,
which is complementary to the active site of the
enzyme (Figure 1). Binding loops of different
inhibitors adopt rather similar, so-called, canonical
conformation, which is de®ned by the torsion
angles of the P3-P3
0 segment (Pn, Pn
0 follow the
notation introduced by Schechter & Berger, 1967).
The mode of recognition is always very similar
and resembles that of an ideal substrate: the short
antiparallel b-sheet formed between the P3 and P1

important features include: short (about 2.7 AÊ ) con￾tact between the P1 carbonyl carbon atom and the
catalytic Ser195 Og
, two hydrogen bonds between
the amide group of P1 and the carbonyl group of
Ser214 and the side-chain of Ser195, and two
hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen
atom of P1 and Gly193/Ser195 amide groups. The
similar system of intermolecular hydrogen bonds,
shape complementarity of interacting areas (Jones
& Thornton, 1996) and the lack of conformational
adjustments during complex formation ensure very
similar recognition of different proteases and
inhibitors.
In a stable enzyme-inhibitor complex, about 10-
12 amino acid residues on an inhibitor side and 20-
25 on an enzyme side are in direct contact, provid￾ing an intermolecular buried area of 600-900 AÊ
(Janin & Chothia, 1990; Janin, 1995). Free energies
of interactions between residues forming the loop
and the protease are often found to be additive
(Wells, 1990; Laskowski et al., 1989). A large part
of the contacts (up to 50 %) involves the P1 residue,
which is placed in the center of the loop and pene￾trates deeply into the S1 speci®city pocket of the
protease. The principial inhibitory activity is often
dictated by this position (e.g. trypsin inhibitors
have Lys or Arg; chymotrypsin inhibitors have
Tyr, Leu or Met). However, amino acid residues
that precede or follow the P1 residue (e.g. P2 or P3
0
)
and those from a sequentially remote region, called
the secondary contact region, can also in¯uence the
association energy (Laskowski et al., 1989).
Here, we determine the in¯uence of the P1 resi￾due of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)
on its interaction with four serine proteases: bovine
b (BT) and salmon anionic trypsins (AST), bovine
a-chymotrypsin (BCHYM) and human neutrophil
elastase (HNE). BPTI is a small protein (58 amino
acid residues) with three disul®de bonds, well￾de®ned secondary structure and a hydrophobic
core. Crystal and solution structures of BPTI and
proteins homologous to BPTI as well as their
complexes with different proteases have been
thoroughly characterized by X-ray crystallography
(Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975; Wlodawer et al.,
1984, 1987; Hynes et al., 1990; Eigenbrot et al., 1990;
Housset et al., 1991; Arnoux et al., 1995) and NMR
spectroscopy (Wagner et al., 1982; Berndt et al.,
1992; Zweckstetter et al., 1996). The P1 residue of
BPTI is the fully exposed Lys15. The wild-type of
BPTI forms tight complexes with a number of ser￾ine proteases (Fritz & Wunderer, 1983), particularly
bovine trypsin (Ka  1.6  1013 Mÿ1 at pH 8.0) and
bovine chymotrypsin (Ka  6  107 Mÿ1 at pH 8.0:
Lazdunski et al., 1974). The BPTI mutant K15V is
known to strongly inhibit pancreatic
(Ka  3.3  108 Mÿ1
) and neutrophil (Ka  3.6  108
Mÿ1
) elastases (Kraunsoe et al., 1996). The proteases
studied here possess very different S1 binding
pockets and are archetypes of trypsin-like, chymo￾trypsin-like and elastase-like enzymes. For the
latter two proteases, the precise data on binding of
different P1 side-chains have recently been deter￾mined for three inhibitors: turkey ovomucoid third
domain (OMTKY3; Lu et al., 1997), eglin c (Lu et al.,
1997) and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor
(SLPI; Eisenberg et al., 1990). This enables the exten￾sive quantitative analysis of analogous mutations
introduced into the binding loops of different
inhibitors on the binding with a serine enzyme, the
interscaffolding additivity comparison (Qasim et al.,
1997). To the best of our knowledge, there is no
information available on recognition energetics of
different amino acid side-chain in the trypsin S1
pocket, hence, interscaffolding additivity analysis is
impossible. Instead, we compare association ener￾gies for bovine b and salmon anionic trypsins. The
enzymes are about 65 % homologous and show
overall displacement in their main-chain atoms of
about 0.8 AÊ (Smalas et al., 1994). According to
the kinetic data, the psychrophilic enzyme
from cold-adapted ®sh species displays up to
20-fold lower Km toward the cognate P1 Arg sub￾strate than mesophilic bovine protease (Smalas et al.,
1994). This encouraged us to study the effect of
non-cognate P1 amino acid substitutions to see
whether the stronger binding is a universal prop￾erty of the psychrophilic trypsin. Thus, the compari￾son of association energies of the same inhibitor P1
mutants with two homologous serine proteases
offers another type of interscaffolding analysis.

(HNE). To facilitate further analysis, especially
additivity comparisons, the Ka values were con￾verted into the respective association free energies
(Ga  ÿ RT ln Ka at 295 K) and shown in
Figure 2. The range of Ka values is particularly
broad for both trypsins: about 109
-fold for BT and,
probably, about 1011-fold for AST. The extremely
high Ka values for P1 Arg and Lys variants with
both trypsins could not be precisely determined at
pH 8.3. Instead, they were determined at pH 5.0,
where the interactions are weaker: the Ka value
for the association of BT with the P1 Lys mutant
is 3  1010 Mÿ1 and with the Arg mutant
8  1010 Mÿ1
; respective values for AST are
1.3  1012 Mÿ1 and 5  1012 Mÿ1
. Based on the
pH-dependence of Ka for BPTI - BT interaction
(Finkenstadt et al., 1974), the estimated Ka values at
pH 8.3 for Lys and Arg variants interacting with
BT are 1.2  1013 Mÿ1 and 4.5  1013 Mÿ1 and for
AST are 7.4  1014 Mÿ1 and 2.8  1015 Mÿ1
. The
estimated value for P1 Lys BPTI - BT interaction is
in agreement with Ka  1.7  1013 Mÿ1 determined
at pH 8.0 (Vincent & Lazdunski 1973). The esti￾mated Ka values are shown in Figure 2.
In agreement with the narrow trypsin speci®city,
Lys and Arg mutants of BPTI bind to BT about
105
-fold stronger than BPTI with P1 Tyr, which is
the strongest binding non-cognate residue. For
AST, this factor can even approach 107
. The range
of Ka values for non-cognate substrates is about
104
. Aromatic (Tyr, Phe and Trp), large hydro￾phobic (Met and Leu) and polar (Gln, Asn, Ser and
His) side-chains bind stronger than small (Gly and
Ala), b-branched (Val, Ile and Thr) and acidic (Asp
and Glu) residues.
The determination of Ka values for two trypsins
offers a possibility to compare binding of the same
P1 side-chains to two enzymes of very similar
speci®city. The correlation plot of Ga values for
BT versus AST is a straight line with a slope
s  0.98 and a correlation coef®cient r  0.97
(Table 2). This shows that both trypsins recognize
non-cognate side-chains with similar energetics
and geometry of interaction. In contrast, measure￾Table 1. The association constants Ka (Mÿ1

higher for AST than for BT and these data points
would be clearly off the correlation plot.
It is also possible to form thermodynamic addi￾tivity cycles in which the effect of the same amino
acid substitution (e.g. P1 Thr15 ! Phe) in BPTI is
compared for two trypsins (cycle 1):
where: Ga (Thr15 ! Phe)BT  Ga (Thr15)BT
ÿ Ga (Phe15)BT: the difference in the associat￾ion free energy values between Thr15 and
Phe15 mutants of BPTI interacting with BT;

(Thr15 ! Phe)BT: the non-additivity in association
energy quantitatively describing the departure of
the cycle from additivity.
For 15 mutants, we analyzed all possible 105
(15  14/2) interscaffolding additivity cycles
(Table 3). The key value of the cycle is Ga,
which informs whether the effect of a substitution
is additive. For the ideal interscaffolding additivity,
Ga should equal zero. Instead, jGaj
ranges from 20 to 1430 cal molÿ1
, which suggests
that non-additivity occurs essentially in all con￾sidered cases. However, as discussed by Qasim
et al. (1997), the cycle comprises four independent
Ka, each with an estimated error of 20 %, equival￾ent to 400 cal/mol as an acceptable additivity
range of jGaj values at the 2s level. Our indi￾vidual association constants were measured with
an estimated error 30 % for strong associations
(Ka > 106 Mÿ1
) and 50 % for weak interactions;
therefore, an average 40 % error was assumed,
which is equivalent to 200 cal molÿ1 error in Ga
and, consequently, 800 cal molÿ1 as an acceptable
additivity range of Ga values. In agreement
with the high correlation coef®cient (Table 2), 86 of
105 additivity cycles (82 %) reported in Table 3 ful-
®l the additivity criteria. Some of the amino acid
side-chains (Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, Tyr and His)
clearly produce additive effects. The remaining 19
cycles (18 %) are weakly non-additive:
800 < jGaj < 1450 cal molÿ1
. Particular non￾additivity involves P1 Asp (eight of 14 cycles).
Association constants for BCHYM and HNE
Compared with trypsins, the dynamic ranges of
Ka values are signi®cantly narrower for BCHYM,
6.3  105
-fold, and HNE, 2  106
-fold (Table 1 and
Figure 2). The data presented are in agreement
with the general conclusions on BCHYM
(Schellenberger et al., 1991; Lu et al., 1997) and
HNE (Lu et al., 1997) speci®cities reported in the
literature. None of these enzymes shows as clear
speci®city toward any kind of amino acid side
chain(s) as trypsins exhibit towards Arg and Lys.
BCHYM association energies are distributed con￾tinuously. The S1 pocket of BCHYM is shaped to
bind aromatic residues together with Leu and Met.
In the case of HNE, a clear-cut separation into two
groups can be noticed. The P1 amino acid residues
that bind strongly have medium-sized hydro￾phobic side-chains, including all b-branched ones,
and Ala, Leu and Met. Aromatic, charged and
polar residues form the other group of poorly
binding P1 residues. Interestingly, for all four
enzymes studied, particularly weak binding can be

It is possible to compare our data with the
association constants determined for OMTKY3 (Lu
et al., 1997), eglin c (Qasim et al., 1997) and SLPI
(Eisenberg et al., 1990). The particularly large data
set comprises 25 P1 mutants (20 coded and ®ve
non-coded amino acids) of OMTKY3. The data sets
available for eglin c (seven P1 mutants) and SLPI
(six P1 mutants) are more limited. To facilitate com￾parison, our association constants were measured
under identical conditions as for the association of
OMTKY3 (Lu et al., 1997) and eglin c (Qasim et al.,
1997) P1 variants with BCHYM and HNE. Exper￾imental conditions for SLPI association constants
measurements were somewhat different (pH 7.5,
37 C; Eisenberg et al., 1990).
Table 2 shows r and s values of the Pearson pro￾duct-moment correlation for comparisons of
BCHYM associations with P1 BPTI variants and
other inhibitors mutants. The correlation plot
measured for BPTI and OMTKY3 mutants with
BCHYM are shown in Figure 3. When two (Arg
and Lys) points, clearly well off the straight line,
are removed, the r value changes from 0.92 to 0.99.
Similarly, the Arg and Lys data points are clearly
off the plot in the BPTI versus SLPI correlation ana￾lyzed for the association with BCHYM (data not
shown), and improvement of the correlation was
observed after the elimination of these two data
points (Table 2).
Besides the correlations, we analyzed interscaf￾folding additivity in the form of a thermodynamic
cycle where the effect of the same amino acid sub￾stitution (e.g. P1 Leu15 ! Ser) in BPTI and another
inhibitor is compared for a single enzyme (Qasim
et al., 1997). An example of the cycle is shown
below for the association of mutants of BPTI and
OMTKY3 containing either Leu or Ser at position
P1 (residue 15 and 18 in BPTI and OMTKY3,
respectively) with BCHYM (cycle 2). The cycle
descripition is analogous to that of cycle 1:
Table 4 presents the interscaffolding additivity
analysis for associations of P1 mutants of BPTI and
OMTKY3 with BCHYM. For 18 P1 amino acids
compared, there are (18  17/2)  153 cycles and,
hence, 153 Ga non-additivity energy entries in
Table 4. In agreement with a visual inspection of
the correlation plot, Lys and Arg side-chains are
least additive (with a single exception for
Arg  Lys substitution) with Ga values
approaching ÿ4.15 kcal mol
ÿ1 (Table 4). Also some
other residues, particularly large aromatic ones
(Phe, Trp, Tyr and His) tend to exhibit a non-addi￾tive behaviour. In general, 65 cycles (43 %) are
additive in the jGaj < 800 cal molÿ1 range
(Table 3). The additivity cycles were also con￾structed and analyzed based on data available for
eglin c and SLPI. The statistics of all interscaffold￾ing additivity cycles is given in Table 3; r and s
values of different correlation plots are given in

well correlated with log (kcat/Km) of Ala-Ala-Xaa
substrates (Harper et al., 1984).
Discussion
Binding properties of S1 pockets
The proteases studied here possess very different
S1 binding pockets and are the archetypes of tryp￾sin-like, chymotrypsin-like and elastase-like
enzymes. Since the S1 pockets of BCHYM (Lu et al.,
1997; Schellenberger et al., 1991) and HNE (Lu et al.,
1987; Harper et al., 1984) have been extensively
characterized using large sets of coded amino
acids, their properties will not be analyzed here.
Although a large number of trypsin mutants have
been designed and analyzed (Perona et al., 1995),
little is known about catalytic and binding energies
of non-cognate amino acid side-chains to trypsin.
For trypsin, only limited kinetic data for Suc-Ala￾Ala-Pro-Xaa-AMC substrates (Xaa  Arg, Lys, Tyr,
Phe, Leu and Trp) have been reported (Graf et al.,
1988). Our data show a large gap between Ga
values for cognate and non-cognate side-chains,
approaching 6.5 to 9 kcal mol
ÿ1 (Figure 2). There
are two sources of binding energy for the cognate
side-chains: a major one, involving the ion pair for￾mation between Asp189 at the bottom of the S1
pocket and the charge of the P1 side-chain, and an
additional one resulting from the burial of the
hydrophobic part of the P1 side-chain inside the
pocket. Comparison of P1 Lys, Met and Gly associ￾ation energies allows the separation of these two
effects. Except for the charged amino group, Lys
and Met side-chains can be considered similar,
since binding of -CH2- and -S- groups in the S1
pockets of several serine proteases was found to be
energetically equivalent (Lu et al., 1997). If we
assume that enzyme-inhibitor interactions outside
the speci®city pocket are equivalent regardless of
the identity of the P1 residue, we can eliminate all
contributions that do not include the P1 side-chain
by subtracting the Ga value for Gly from
the association free energies for Lys and Met resi￾dues: Ga, Lys ÿ Ga, Gly  ÿ 12.03 kcal molÿ1 and
Ga, Met ÿ Ga, Gly  ÿ 4.60 kcal molÿ1
. It appears
that binding of the hydrophobic part of the
Lys side-chain (equivalent to Met) provides
ÿ4.60 kcal molÿ1
, while the remaining part
resulting from the ion pair interaction is
extremely strong: ÿ12.03 kcal molÿ1  4.60 kcal
molÿ1  ÿ 7.43 kcal molÿ1
.
As might be expected, due to the presence of
Asp189 at the bottom of the trypsin pocket, placing
a negatively charged P1 side-chain in the pocket is
strongly disfavoured. Surprisingly, the effect is
much more severe for Asp than for the longer Glu,
if estimated from the comparison with the binding
of respective isosteric amide groups. For BT,
Ga,Asn ÿ Ga,Asp  ÿ 3.42 kcal molÿ1 and Ga,Gln
ÿ Ga,Glu  ÿ 0.74 kcal molÿ1
. We suppose that
the longer and more ¯exible side-chain of Glu can
adopt a conformation that allows a more favour￾able interaction of its negative charge with water
molecule(s) or main-chain nitrogen atoms forming
the walls of the pocket. Interestingly, Asp is the
least favoured side-chain for all enzymes studied.
Binding of Gly in the pockets of both trypsins (and
also of BCHYM) is similarly strongly disfavoured.
In the case of chymotrypsin there is no
additional factor(s) generating speci®city. The
association energy origins predominantly from the
burying of the P1 side-chain hydrophobic area in
the S1 pocket; hence, there is a gradual dependence
of the association energy on the size of the hydro￾phobic side-chain, complicated further for residues
with branching, polar or charged atoms (Lu et al.,

180 Interscaffolding Additivity1997). Interestingly, if the cognate trypsin Lys/Arg
amino acids are eliminated, the correlation of
BCHYM and AST binding energies is high and
shows r  0.9 (for BT r  0.72; Figure 4 and
Table 2). This suggests that both enzymes recog￾nize non-cognate substrates using similar binding
interactions within their S1 pockets.
Compared to BCHYM, the S1 pocket of HNE,
although hydrophobic, is signi®cantly smaller and
prefers hydrophobic amino acid side-chains of
moderate size. The dynamic character of the pocket
allows favourable binding of b-branched side￾chains, which are strongly disfavoured by BT, AST
and BCHYM (Figure 2). Due to the small size of
the pocket, binding of Gly residue is not as
unfavourable as in the case of trypsin and chymo￾trypsin. The size of the pocket is severely restricted
by the side-chains of Val216 and Asp226, these
positions are occupied by glycine both in BCHYM
and in trypsins. Our data correlate well with kcat/
Km values determined for tripeptide substrates
(Table 2). There is virtually no correlation
(r  ÿ 0.32) if the BPTI association data for non￾cognate side-chains of trypsins are compared with
the HNE - BPTI data (for BT r  ÿ 0.32 and for
AST r  ÿ 0.22) and if HNE/BCHYM correlation is
performed for all side-chains, r  0.02 (Table 2).
This shows that, unlike the situation observed for
BCHYM, the size and dynamic character of the
HNE S1 pocket is a clear determinant of its speci-
®city.
Additivity
In recent years the applicability of the thermo￾dynamic additivity principle to protein chemistry
has been tested several times, mainly through
double mutant cycle analysis involving a single
protein (Lu et al., 1997; Carter et al., 1984; Dill,
1997; Ackers & Smith, 1985; Wells, 1990; Horovitz
& Fersht, 1990). Qasim et al. (1997) analyzed inter￾scaffolding additivity comparisons made between
seven P1 mutants of OMTKY3 and eglin c, which
do not share a common fold (Figure 5), but show
extremely similar conformations of their binding
loops (Figure 1).
Here, interscaffolding additivity comparisons
were analyzed using two different approaches. In
the ®rst one we checked whether introduction of
the same amino acid substitutions into structurally
and functionally equivalent regions in different
inhibitors will produce the same effect on the
association with a particular protease. We have
chosen the P1 position of BPTI, which is the best￾known protease inhibitor, but had not been exten￾sively mutated at its P1 site before. Taking into
account the amino acid sequence and main-chain

their complexes with BCHYM. The P3-P3
0 segment and the P1 side-chain are shown as darker. SLPI structure (Grutter
et al., 1988) could not be included, as the coordinates are not available in PDB yet. The Figure was drawn with
SYBYL software (Tripos).
Interscaffolding Additivity 181rmsd values, the binding loop of BPTI is more dis￾similar both from OMTKY3 and eglin c loops than
OMTKY3 loop is from eglin c (Figure 1 and
Table 5) and offers a possibility of structurally
more remote comparison than OMTKY3/eglin c
(Qasim et al., 1997). We determined the association
energies for 17 P1 mutants of BPTI and the recom￾binant wild-type inhibitor (Met52 ! Leu) and
compared them with the data available in the lit￾erature for OMTKY3, eglin c and SLPI inhibitors.
The most extensive additivity comparison com￾prises binding of P1 mutants of BPTI and OMTKY3
to BCHYM. We analyzed 153 interscaffolding addi￾tivity cycles (Table 4). About half of the cycles ful®l
our additivity criteria (Table 3). They involve
mainly small side-chains of Asn, Asp, Val, Gly,
Met, Thr and Ala. On the contrary, long or bulky
side-chains of Arg, Lys, Phe, Tyr and Trp belong to
the least additive ones, suggesting different modes
of interaction with the S1 pocket of BCHYM.
Fortunately, in the case of P1 Lys mutants high￾resolution crystal structures are available for
BCHYM complexes with BPTI (Scheidig et al.,
1997) and OMTKY3 (PDB code 1HJA). The com￾parison of both structures reveals the completely
different conformations of the P1 side-chain. In the
OMTKY3 - BCHYM complex, the side-chain of Lys
extends directly into the pocket, as in typical tryp￾sin complexes (Figure 6). In the BPTI - BCHYM
complex, the side-chain of Lys15 bends away from
Ser189 and forms two hydrogen bonds with the
main-chain atoms of enzyme Ser217 (2.8 AÊ ) and
Pro13(P3) of inhibitor (3.0 AÊ ). Moreover, the Arg
side-chain in a BCHYM complex of Alzheimer's
amyloid b-protein precursor (Scheidig et al., 1997),
which is highly homologous to BPTI, shows
exactly the same bending and difference in inter￾actions as observed for BPTI complexed with
BCHYM. The average value of the non-additivity
factor is ÿ2.32 kcal molÿ1 for all cycles involving
Lys and ÿ2.46 kcal molÿ1 for cycles involving Arg.
This value is a measure of the above-mentioned
charged hydrogen bonds that are formed by P1 Lys
in the BPTI - BCHYM complex, and is in agree￾ment with the experimentally determined G
value of charged hydrogen bonds (Fersht, 1987).
The Arg and Lys data points also lead to a clear
non-additivity in the case of BCHYM association
with BPTI and SLPI (average Ga for
Lys  ÿ 1.43 kcal molÿ1 and for Arg  ÿ 1.93 kcal
molÿ1
), in agreement with the lack of Pro as a
hydrogen-bond donor at P3. This comparison can￾not be extended to eglin c, due to a lack of data for
P1 Arg and Lys residues. A similar analysis of
other strongly non-additive effects is impossible,
due to a lack of respective spatial structures.
The OMTKY3/eglin c interscaffolding additivity
comparison determined for their interaction with
six different proteases gives 69 % additivity at
IGaI < 800 cal mol
ÿ1 (Qasim et al., 1997). For
BCHYM, 15 of 21 cycles (71 %) were additive.
Interestingly, all non-addtive cycles included P1
Pro. It seems plausible that the larger non-additiv￾ity observed here results from different loop
sequences of BPTI: Pro(P3)-Cys(P2)-Lys(P1) and
OMTKY3: Cys(P3)-Thr(P2)-Lys(P1) and larger
difference in the conformations of their loops as
indicated in Table 5. This is clearly seen from rmsd
values operating in torsion angles: while for the
P3-P3
0 segment of OMTKY3/eglin c the rmsd value
is 20 , it is about 56  for BPTI/OMTKY3 and
BPTI/eglin c superimpositions (Table 5). In con￾clusion, we argue that interscaffolding additivity
may depend on the sequential and conformational
similarity of the regions where the mutation(s) is
introduced, and on a particular substitution, e.g.
the presence of Pro at P3, P2 or P1 sites may lead to
the non-additive behaviour.
In the second approach, we analyzed the oppo￾site situation: two different enzymes of very similar
speci®city were tested for their association energy
with P1 variants of the same inhibitor. BT and AST
show about 65 % amino acid sequence homology
and are very similar in the architecture of their S1
speci®city pockets. The mean rmsd value for the
main-chain atoms of nine residues forming the S1
pocket (189 bottom, 190-192 and 214-220 walls) is
0.13 AÊ and 0.27 AÊ if the side-chains are included
(Smalas et al., 1994). Among the nine residues
forming the pocket, there is one amino acid differ￾ence between the two proteases (Ser217 in BT,
Tyr217 in AST). This change does not seem to
affect the af®nity toward substrates, as the side￾chain of residue 217 points away from the active
site and makes interactions mostly with the solvent
(Smalas et al., 1994). Nevertheless, AST was found

182 Interscaffolding Additivityto hydrolyze amide bonds at cognate P1 Arg up to
40-fold more ef®ciently than BT, primarily due to
the 20-fold decrease in Michaelis constant (Outzen
et al., 1996). Our measurements at pH 5 also show
respectively 40 and 60-fold stronger association of
Lys and Arg side-chains to AST. The direct hydro￾gen bond between Nx of P1 Lys and Od2 of Asp189
(Helland et al., 1998), which is not observed in the
BT - BPTI complex (Huber et al., 1974), is a likely
reason for stronger binding of cognate side-chains.
Another, not observed in the BT - BPTI complex,
hydrogen bond P1 N - 214 O should equally stabil￾ize all other P1 BPTI - AST complexes, compared to
BT complexes, but this does not occur. Instead,
there is a very good correlation between AST and
BT for binding of non-cognate P1 mutants (Table 2).
This is, perhaps, not surprising, since the corre￾lations for BT/BCHYM and AST/BCHYM are also
good, if cognate Lys and Arg substrates are elimi￾nated (Figure 4 and Table 2).
In summary, the binding properties of BT, AST
and BCHYM pockets are similar for non-cognate
substrates of trypsin. The tune-up of trypsin speci-
®city towards cognate substrates is possible
through hydrogen bond(s) from the P1 side-chain
to Asp189. The further increase of binding energy
observed for the interaction of AST with Lys and
Arg may result from the formation of direct hydro￾gen bonds, instead of water-mediated ones present
in the S1 pocket of BT (Helland et al., 1998). The
structural differences between BT, AST and
BCHYM pockets on one hand, and HNE on the
other, are not restricted to one particular substi￾tution within the pocket, but manifest in pocket
size and dynamics, leading to completely changed
speci®city pattern also toward non-cognate amino
acids.

All P1 mutants of BPTI were expressed as fusion pro￾teins in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS using the
phage T7 system (Studier et al., 1990), as described
(Staley & Kim, 1994). All mutants used in this study con￾tained additional mutation Met ! Leu at position 52 to
enable cleavage of the fusion protein by CNBr. Puri®-
cation of BPTI mutants was performed as described

Interscaffolding Additivity 183(Krokoszynska et al., 1998). To ensure high purity,
mutant proteins were puri®ed both in the reduced and
the oxidized state on a Vydac C18 semi-preparative
HPLC column. Solvents A (0.1 % TFA) and B (90 %
acetonitrile, 0.1 % TFA) were mixed with a linear gradi￾ent of 10 % to 60 % solvent B (1.5 ml/minute ¯ow). Oxi￾dation of BPTI variants (10ÿ4 M protein concentration)
was performed in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.7), 6  10ÿ4 M
reduced glutathione and 3  10ÿ4 M oxidized gluta￾thione, 1 mM EDTA, 4 M urea for one hour at 45 C. A
typical yield of oxidative refolding was 30-50 % (7 to
10 mg of pure protein per liter of culture medium). The
P1 Pro and Cys variants could not be produced, as
HPLC chromatograms showed accumulation of many
single and double-disul®de intermediates and no peak
corresponding to natively folded protein.
Mass spectrometry
Electrospray mass spectrometry of all genetic variants
used in this study was performed with a Finnigan MAT
TSQ-700 equipped with ESI source (USA). Species were
assigned according to their molecular masses. Samples
were dissolved in methanol/water (1:1, v/v) containing
1 % acetic acid. Molecular masses of all variants were
within 1.0 atomic mass unit from those expected from
amino acid sequences, as found by electrospray mass
spectrometry.
Standardisation of enzyme, inhibitor and substrate
stock solutions
Bovine b-trypsin and a-chymotrypsin were dissolved
in 1 mM HCl, 20 mM CaCl2 to obtain the stock of about
1  10ÿ4 M. Salmon anionic trypsin (1  10ÿ5 M) was
dissolved in 25 mM diethanolamine, 0.14 M NaCl,
pH 5.5; a 6  10ÿ5 M solution of HNE was prepared in
50 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.2 M NaCl. The exact
concentrations of trypsins stock solutions were deter￾mined by NPGB titration (Chase & Shaw 1970). The
standarized trypsin was used to titrate turkey ovomu￾coid inhibitor. Concentrations of chymotrypsin and HNE
were, in turn, determined by titration with turkey ovo￾mucoid.
The P1 BPTI variants were prepared in 1 mM HCl at
10ÿ2 ÿ 10ÿ4 M. Concentrations of variants that do not
strongly inhibit any of the proteases (Ka < 108 Mÿ1
) were
determined spectrophotometrically, assuming a molar
absorbance coef®cient of 5720 Mÿ1
cmÿ1 at 275 nm for
BPTI (Kosen et al., 1981). In the case of strong inhibitors
(Ka > 108 Mÿ1
), concentration was determined by
titration with a standarized solution of trypsin, chymo￾trypsin or HNE. All substrates were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); 4-Nitrophenyl 4-guanidino￾benzoate hydrochloride (NPGB) was dissolved in 20 %
acetonitrile in DMSO.
Equilibrium association constants
The equilibrium association constants were deter￾mined in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.3 at 22 C), 20 mM CaCl2,
0.01 % (v/v) Triton X-100 (HNE buffer additionally con￾tained 0.5 M NaCl) using a described procedure (Empie
& Laskowski, 1982; Otlewski & Zbyryt, 1994). The
association constants between wild-type BPTI and P1
Arg BPTI and both trypsins were also measured in
50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 20 mM CaCl2, 0.01 %
Triton X-100. Increasing concentrations of inhibitor were
added to the constant concentration of appropriate pro￾tease and after a suitable incubation time the residual
enzyme activity was measured using turn-over substrate
on a HP8452A diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett
Packard) or on a microplate reader Spectra Max 340
(Molecular Devices). In order to prevent substrate￾induced dissociation of the complex, the substrates were
used at concentrations ®ve to ten times lower than the
respective Km values. This problem was particularly
serious during the determination of low association con￾stants. In these cases, substrates with a poor kcat/Km
index were chosen. The experimental data were ®tted to
the equation (Empie & Laskowski, 1982):
