An experimental approach to evaluate the net binding free energy of burï¿¾ied hydrogen bonds and salt bridges is presented. The approach, which
involves a modiÂ®ed multiple-mutant cycle protocol, was applied to
selected interactions between TEM-1-b-lactamase and its protein inhibitor,
BLIP. The selected interactions (two salt bridges and two hydrogen
bonds) all involving BLIP-D49, deÂ®ne a distinct binding unit. The penta
mutant, where all side-chains constructing the binding unit were mutated
to Ala, was used as a reference state to which combinations of sideï¿¾chains were introduced. At Â®rst, pairs of interacting residues were added
allowing the determination of interaction energies in the absence of
neighbors, using double mutant cycles. Addition of neighboring residues
allowed the evaluation of their cooperative effects on the interaction. The
two isolated salt bridges were either neutral or repulsive whereas the
two hydrogen bonds contribute 0.3 kcal molÃ¿1 each. Conversely, a
double mutant cycle analysis of these interactions in their native environï¿¾ment showed that they all stabilize the complex by 1-1.5 kcal molÃ¿1
.
Examination of the effects of neighboring residues on each of the interï¿¾actions revealed that the formation of a salt bridge triad, which involves
two connected salt bridges, had a strong cooperative effect on stabilizing
the complex independent of the presence or absence of additional neighï¿¾bors. These results demonstrate the importance of forming net-works of
buried salt bridges. We present theoretical electrostatic calculations which
predict the observed mode of cooperativity, and suggest that the coopï¿¾erative networking effect results from the favorable contribution of the
protein to the interaction. Furthermore, a good correlation between calcuï¿¾lated and experimentally determined interaction energies for the two salt
bridges, and to a lesser extent for the two hydrogen bonds, is shown.
The data analysis was performed on values of Gz
Kd which reÂ¯ect
the strength of short range interactions, while G
KD values which
include the effects of long range electrostatic forces that alter speciÂ®cally
Gz
ka were treated separately.

Introduction
Understanding the molecular basis of proteinï¿¾protein recognition requires a detailed characterizï¿¾ation of individual interactions in the interface
between the proteins. The availability of protein
structures in their complexed and unbound forms,
has created a wealth of structural knowledge on
the determinants of protein-protein interactions
(summarized by Conte et al., 1999; Jones &
Thornton, 1996). The energetics of these interï¿¾actions arise from favorable intermolecular interï¿¾actions including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic
and van der Waals interactions and ion pairing.
However, it is difÂ®cult to invoke any generalizï¿¾ation about the relative importance of each of these
terms because their relative contributions to bindï¿¾ing vary (Stites, 1997). E-mail address of the corresponding author:

0022-2836/00/030503Â±18 $35.00/0 # 2000 Academic PressThe currently popular approach to study the
energetic contribution of an amino acid towards
stability or binding of proteins is by mutating it
and monitoring the change in the protein properï¿¾ties. However, the interpretation of such experï¿¾iments is severely limited by the fact that the
properties of a protein are a function of the entire
system, and not necessarily the sum of its parts. As
a result, the energetic importance of a particular
residue to binding cannot be explained by a physiï¿¾cal analysis of the binding site. A powerful experï¿¾imental and theoretical approach to study proteinï¿¾protein interactions uses double and higher-order
mutant cycles, where interactions between amino
acids are treated within their native context
(Ackers & Smith, 1985; Carter et al., 1984; Horovitz,
1987). Such cycles reveal whether the contributions
from a pair of residues are additive or whether the
effects of mutations are coupled (Horovitz &
Fersht, 1990; Serrano et al., 1990). However, even
interaction energies derived from double mutant
cycles include, in addition to their direct interaction
energy, effects due to neighboring residues and
solvent (Fersht et al., 1992; Horovitz et al., 1990).
The complexity in the analysis of pair-wise interï¿¾action energies derived from double mutant cycles
is demonstrated in the analysis of the barnase-barï¿¾star binding site (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995), where
residues separated by up to 7 AÃŠ were shown to
interact. This distance is too large to result solely
from direct bond formation. Moreover, the magniï¿¾tude of the interaction energy varies even for the
same type of interaction resulting in a poor relation
between structural data and energies deduced by
double mutant cycles. The argument that indirect
interactions contribute to the interaction energy is
demonstrated by the multiple mutant cycle analï¿¾ysis of Glu73 on barnase (Schreiber et al., 1997).
Glu73 is located in the active site pocket of barnase
and is surrounded by a number of positively
charged residues which interact with barstar.
While Glu73 contributes to the stability of barnase,
it was less expected to contribute signiÂ®cantly to
the binding of barstar, since the only potential resiï¿¾due on barstar close enough for binding is Asp39.
A multiple double mutant cycle analysis of this site
suggested that neighboring residues were the
cause of the measured interaction energy between
Glu73 and Asp39. The evaluation of third position
effects on the surface of proteins was further
demonstrated for the salt bridge triad Asp8,
Arg110 and Asp12 on the surface of barnase. Mulï¿¾tiple thermodynamic cycles were used to show
that the strength of each salt bridge was reduced
by 0.77 kcal molÃ¿1 in the absence of the other salt
bridge (Horovitz et al., 1990). These studies show
that interaction energies cannot be reduced to a
sum of pairwise interactions due to their cooperaï¿¾tive nature. Therefore, instead of analyzing indiï¿¾vidual interactions, one should look at binding
units, composed of the interacting residues and
their neighbors.
This study is intended to decipher the binding
energy of a binding unit, buried within the interï¿¾face of two proteins, into its components. Namely,
the net energetic contribution of individual interï¿¾actions and the indirect cooperative effects of
neighboring residues. Data analysis was performed
separately on the measured kd and ka values to disï¿¾tinguish between short range interactions which
stabilize the complex and which dictate Gz
kd
,
and long-range electrostatic interactions which
dictate Gz
ka
. Pairwise, ternary and higher order
coupling energies were calculated as described by
Horovitz & Fersht (1992). The experimental
approach utilized double mutant cycles, where the
bond energy of an isolated interaction was deterï¿¾mined for a pair of residues in the absence of its
neighbors. This was done by mutating all the resiï¿¾dues in the unit except for the interacting pair and
constructing a double mutant cycle using
Gz
kd
values. Second order effects were evaluated
by selectively adding residues one by one and conï¿¾structing higher order mutant cycles. In a similar
manner the computational analysis, utilizing the
continuum electrostatic approach, allowed the
determination of the electrostatic contribution of a
speciÂ®c bond towards protein stability and probed
parameters which are difÂ®cult to examine experï¿¾imentally. This experimental and computational
analysis of a single binding unit is described here
for a binding domain located in the periphery
of the binding interface of the complex between
TEM-1 b-lactamase and its protein inhibitor, BLIP.
In this binding unit Asp49 on BLIP forms four
interactions with four conserved residues lining the
active site pocket of TEM; two hydrogen bonds
with S235 and S130, respectively, and two salt
bridges with R243 and K234, respectively
(Figure 1). Single mutations of each of these resiï¿¾dues alter the stability of the complex by up to
2 kcal mol
Ã¿1 (Albeck & Schreiber, 1999). The availï¿¾ability of the crystal structure of the TEM-BLIP
complex (Strynadka et al., 1996) on one hand, and
the multiple nature of this particular site on the
other, make it ideal for measuring the direct and
cooperative contributions towards the interaction
energy.
Results
The interaction between two proteins A and B to
form the complex AB is typically described by a
three-state energy proÂ®le which includes an
encounter complex A:B, and a transition state.
According to transition state theory, the kinetic
rate constants describe the formation of the tranï¿¾sition state. For the formation of the TEM-BLIP
complex, it has been shown that the relation
between the association rate constant, ka, the
dissociation rate constant, kd and the equilibrium
dissociation constant KD follows equation (1)
(Albeck & Schreiber, 1999):
504 Direct and Cooperative Contributions to BindingKD Âˆ kd
ka
Â…1Â†
Therefore, ka is proportional to the energy to form
the transition state starting from the unbound proï¿¾teins, whereas kd is proportional to the energy to
form the transition state starting from the complex
(Piehler & Schreiber, 1999; Selzer & Schreiber,
1999). The transition state energy is related to the
kinetic constants according to:
Gz
k Âˆ Ã¿RT ln hk
RT Â…2Â†
were h is the Plank constant and k is either the
association or dissociation rate constants. While
values of Gz
k are problematic in deÂ®nition
(especially ka, which is a second order rate conï¿¾stant), the change in Gz
k upon mutation, Gz
k is
a good measure of the change in transition state
energy upon mutation:
Gz

For systems which obey equation (1), the change in
free energy upon mutation (G
KD ) can be related
to the kinetic rate constants according to:
G

ka Ã¿ Gz

Thus, the free energy contribution of a speciÂ®c resiï¿¾due towards complex stability can be divided into
its contribution to the rate constants of association
and dissociation. The rate of association is dictated
primarily by long range electrostatic interactions
which stabilize the encounter complex. The
encounter complex can be described in structural
terms as a collection of states where the binding
sites of the two proteins are already pre-oriented
but still separated by a layer of water (Schreiber &
Fersht, 1996; Selzer & Schreiber, 1999; Gabdoulline
& Wade, 1999; Vijayakumar et al., 1998). Short
range interactions seem to be unimportant in stabiï¿¾lizing the encounter complex. On the other hand,
they directly affect the dissociation rate constant
which is a function of the strength of all the nonï¿¾covalent interactions between the two proteins and
the contribution of solvation. Therefore, the physiï¿¾cal interpretation of the contribution of a sideï¿¾chain towards afÂ®nity can be understood better if
Gz
ka and Gz
kd are treated separately.
Trends in the binding kinetics of the
TEM-BLIP complex
Association kinetics
At ambient pH, both TEM-1 and BLIP carry a
net negative charge of Ã¿7e and Ã¿2e, respectively.
Therefore, the association kinetics for the formation
of the TEM-BLIP complex is highly sensitive to
changes in the charge of one of the proteins
(Table 1, Figure 2(a)): mutation of any one of the
Ser residues on TEM (singly or doubly) has little
effect on the association rate. However, removal of
a positively charged residue reduces the associï¿¾ation rate constant by an average factor of 3 and
removal of an additional positive charge reduces it
by an order of magnitude. Truncation of the negaï¿¾tively charged BLIP-D49 side-chain, eliminates
most of the negative potential on the TEM binding
surface of BLIP, thus removing most of the repulï¿¾sive forces between the two proteins (Albeck &
Schreiber, 1999). The observed association rate conï¿¾stants can be directly related to the perturbation in
the electrostatic Â®eld between the two proteins
(Selzer & Schreiber, 1999). Figure 3 shows the
relation between the Coulombic energy of interï¿¾action between the proteins and the measured
rates of association. The Coulombic energy is
highly sensitive to the removal of a positively
charged TEM residue (causing a large repulsion).
This effect is additive, so that removal of two posiï¿¾tively charged residues doubles the repulsive Couï¿¾lombic energy. However, mutation of BLIP-D49
nulliÂ®es the repulsive forces between the two proï¿¾teins in such a way that mutation of the selected
positively charged residues of TEM, no longer
effect the electrostatic interaction energy. Since the
rates of association are directly proportional to the
electrostatic free energy at the encounter complex,
values of lnka are almost constant once BLIP-D49 is
removed (Figure 3).
Dissociation kinetics
There is no general explanation for the observed
distribution of the dissociation rate constants of the
different mutants (Table 1, Figure 2(b)). Since the
Figure 1. Structure of the TEM-BLIP complex
(Strynadka et al., 1996) showing the Â®ve residues conï¿¾structing the binding unit which was used in the present
analysis. BLIP-D49 forms two salt bridges with TEM
residues R243 and K234 and two hydrogen bonds with
TEM residues S235 and S130 (all designated with broï¿¾ken lines). The Figure was made using Swiss-PDB
Viewer (Guex & Peitsch, 1997).
Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Binding 505dissociation rate constant is a measure of the sum
of the contributions of all of the short-range interï¿¾actions, it is not surprising that elimination of
BLIP-D49, causes an increase of over an order of
magnitude in the dissociation rate constant, as this
mutation causes the disruption of all four interï¿¾actions with TEM-wt. However, simple rules canï¿¾not explain the individual contributions to binding
of the TEM residues interacting with BLIP-D49.
The results presented here will address this issue.
An important observation is that the tetra-TEM
mutant (S130A, S235A, K234A, R243A) has the
same dissociation rate constant with either BLIP-wt
or BLIP-D49A. This suggests that the side-chain of
BLIP-D49 interacts solely with these four TEM resiï¿¾dues and vice versa (as seen in the crystal strucï¿¾ture). This allows us to treat this binding site as an
individual binding unit for our analysis.
Cooperativity in the binding domain
Experimental results
The energy term which best reÂ¯ects the energetic
contribution of a particular residue towards stabilï¿¾ization of the complex is Gz
kd
. Summing up the
individual Gz
kd values measured for the four
TEM single mutations (S130A, S235A, K234A and
R243A), Gz
kd
, equals 3.2 kcal mol
Ã¿1 (Table 1).
Conversely, mutating BLIP-D49 to Ala reduces
Gz
kd by only 2 kcal molÃ¿1
. Moreover, removal of
the entire site by mutating all Â®ve residues simulï¿¾taneously to Ala (KSSR Â‡ D49 in Table 1), results
in a loss of binding energy of 1.6 kcal molÃ¿1
. Thus,
the sum of the free energy contributions of the
individual mutations is much larger than the conï¿¾tribution of the binding site as a whole. This extra
stabilization is due to cooperativity between the
residues which is disrupted upon a single
mutation. This is one of the reasons why comparï¿¾ing the binding energy of a wild-type protein with
that of a mutant in which a side-chain has been
truncated often gives an apparent binding energy
which is greater than the incremental binding
energy attributable to that side-chain.
A more advanced approach to dissect the total
binding free energy within a binding site into its
components, is to evaluate the interaction e?nergy
between pairs of residues using double mutant
cycles. An effective interaction between two resiï¿¾dues is characterized by a coupling energy
GKDint which deÂ®nes the experimental measure
of binding strength between two residues. Simiï¿¾larly, Gz
kdint deÂ®nes the energetic contribution
of a bond between a pair of residues towards
stabilization of the complex. Values of GKDint
and Gz
kdint are presented in Table 2. While for
the two hydrogen bonds (S235-D49 and S130-D49)
the values of GKDint and Gz
kdint are similar,
the values differ signiÂ®cantly for the two salt
bridges (R243-D49 and K234-D49). This discreï¿¾pancy results from the large contribution of the
charged but not polar residues to ka. Summing up
the interaction free energies, Gz
kdint, for each of
the four interactions in the wild-type proteins gives

Determination of the energetic contribution of
the individual bonds
In order to evaluate the direct energetic contriï¿¾bution of a speciÂ®c bond towards complex stabï¿¾ility, emphasis was made on isolating the effect of
the selected pair of residues in the absence, or
selective presence of its neighbors. This novel
approach is summarized in Figure 4 for the interï¿¾action R243-D49. In Figure 4(a) all the side-chains
in this domain were mutated to Ala, except for the
two interacting residues BLIP-D49 and TEM-R243.

Figure 5 illustrates the Gz
kdint values obtained
for each of the four interactions between BLIP-D49
and the isolated TEM residues compared to the
values obtained in their native environment. The
two isolated hydrogen bonds between the individï¿¾ual Ser residue and D49 contribute about 0.3 kcal
molÃ¿1 each. On the other hand the two isolated
salt bridges are energetically either neutral or
unfavorable.

neighboring residues
The cooperative contributions of neighboring
residues towards a given pairwise interaction were
evaluated by adding residues to the site and
measuring their effect. In Figure 4(b) this is illusï¿¾trated for the R243-D49 interaction in the presence
of K234. Gz

Schematically, this can be described by a triple
mutant box where the last two mutant cycles repï¿¾resent the two opposite faces of a box (Horovitz &
Fersht, 1990).
Gz
kdint values were determined for each of the
four interactions in the presence of a third neighï¿¾boring residue from which Gz
kdint values were
determined (Table 2, rows 5-10). Because of the
symmetry of the triple mutant box, equivalent
expressions are obtained for the effect of residue
K234 on R243-D49 and R243 on K234-D49. Thereï¿¾fore, this manipulation yields for the four interï¿¾actions only six different Gz
kdint terms which
are a measure of the cooperativity between the
three respective residues. The highest cooperativity
(0.86 kcal molÃ¿1
) is observed for the two salt
bridges and the lowest, negative cooperativity, for
the double hydrogen bonds with the two Ser resiï¿¾dues (Ã¿0.26 kcal molÃ¿1
).
Addition of a fourth residue to the site
(Figure 4(c)) will allow the evaluation of its added
effect on the interaction (Table 2, rows 11-14).
Thus, for example, Gz
kdint(I Ã¿ j, [k, l]), the interï¿¾action energy between R243-D49 in the presence of
both K234 and S235 is given by:

results from cooperative effects. Figure 6 illustrates
the cooperative effects on each of the four TEMï¿¾BLIP interactions by the remaining three amino
acids.
Calculated results
The detailed experimental analysis shown above
calls for a theoretical analysis of the forces particiï¿¾pating in these interactions. A major obstacle in
performing calculations of values of G
KD using
the crystal structure of the wild-type complex is
the assumption that the structures of the mutant
proteins are similar to that of the wild-type. In
order to validate this assumption, we performed
an energy minimization calculation of each of the
side-chains of the interacting residues upon
mutation of one of the residues. Only small moveï¿¾ments were observed for the side-chains of all the
mutants. All the following calculations were perï¿¾formed either on the experimentally determined
crystal structure of the wild-type proteins, with the
mutations introduced by deleting the relevant
side-chains, or on a minimized mutant structure.
No large deviations were found between the
two sets of calculations. Therefore, only the
data obtained from the wild-type crystal structure
derived mutants will be presented. To resolve
the concern of possible structural alterations
caused by mutations we are (in collaboration with
Dr Strynadka) in the process of solving the strucï¿¾tures of some of the more interesting mutations.
Solvent accessible surface area (SASA)
The correspondence between solvent-accessible
surfaces and thermodynamic quantities such as
enthalpies, entropies and heat capacities of solï¿¾vation has promoted many investigators to explore
the connection between the two. SASA was calcuï¿¾lated for the wild-type complex, for each of its
mutants and for the unbound proteins and their
corresponding mutants using the known crystal
structure of the complex (Strynadka et al., 1996)
(the single proteins and mutant structures were
derived from this structure). SASA is the differï¿¾ence between the calculated SASA of the comï¿¾plexed proteins and that of the free proteins while
SASA is the difference in SASA upon
mutation. Figure 7(a) shows a very poor correï¿¾lation between the calculated SASA values and
the experimental Gz
kd values. The direct use of
surface areas to approximate the extent of all these
surface interactions does not consider geometric
considerations and their complicated energetic
implications. The two polar interactions and two
salt bridges in this domain strongly rely on the corï¿¾rect orientation of the residues. Therefore, exposure
of surface area is not enough to describe the enerï¿¾getic contribution of the various residues.
Electrostatic energy calculations
Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, which are
exclusively found in this binding domain, can be
described by an electrostatic treatment. We have
therefore, used continuum electrostatic methods to
calculate the effect of speciÂ®c electrostatic interï¿¾actions on the stability of the complex. All calcuï¿¾lations took advantage of the known X-ray crystal
structure of the TEM-BLIP complex. Employing
Â®nite-difference numerical methods to solve the
Poisson-Boltzmann equation using the Delphi comï¿¾puter program package (Molecular Simulations,
Inc.), the electrostatic contribution of bonds to comï¿¾plex stability was calculated. Two methods of calï¿¾culation were employed. One, where the total
electrostatic energy difference between the comï¿¾plexed proteins and their free states was calculated
(U) for the wild-type proteins and for each of
the mutants from which U was derived
(Table 1). In the second method, a thermodynamic
cycle allowed the electrostatic effect of an interï¿¾action on the complex stability to be dissected into
direct and indirect contributions within the protein
Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Binding 511to understand better the competing effects acting
on the protein complex stability (Hendsch & Tidor,
1994, 1999).
Figure 7(b) shows that there is no correlation
between Gz
kd
and U. This emphasizes the
need to relate to pair-wise interactions and not to
changes in the system properties that result from
mutation. Therefore, the calculated U values
were used to construct double mutant cycles from
which Uint values were obtained for each of the
four TEM interactions with BLIP-D49 in the
absence and selective presence of the different
neighboring residues. These values are a measure
of the electrostatic contribution of a speciÂ®c interï¿¾action towards the total electrostatic free energy
and are summarized in Table 3. The relations
between Uint and Gz
kdint values for each of
the four interactions in the absence and selective
presence of neighbors are shown in Figure 8. While
weak correlations were observed for the two
hydrogen bonds (Figure 8(a) and (b), correlation
coefÂ®cients of 0.60 and 0.62, respectively), the data
for the two salt bridges are linearly correlated
(Figure 8(c) and (d), without the stray point associï¿¾ated with the S235A mutation, correlation coefÂ®-
cients of 0.92 and 0.97, respectively, were
obtained). Hence, the two salt bridges are stabilï¿¾ized primarily by electrostatic interactions. Moreï¿¾over, the cooperative nature of the two salt bridges
could be predicted from electrostatic considerï¿¾ations.
Dissecting the electrostatic energy into contriï¿¾butions from solvent (Usol), the bond itself
(Ubon) and the effect of the protein on the interï¿¾action (Uprot) using the method introduced by
Hendsch & Tidor (1994, 1999), has the advantage
that it probes parameters that are difÂ®cult to examï¿¾ine experimentally. On the other hand, the electroï¿¾static contribution of an interaction towards
stability, Utot, calculated as the sum of these indiï¿¾vidual direct and indirect contributions, gives an
apparent value. This results from the fact that only
the effect of the side-chain is calculated (see
Materials and Methods). Therefore, unlike the
Uint calculations, changes in the interfacial
dielectric due to mutation are not accounted for.
Despite this fact, values of Utot correlate well
with Uint and give similar correlations with
Gz
kdint (as for Uint in Figure 8). Results of the
above calculated contributions for each of the four
interactions are summarized in Table 3. For the
wild-type proteins (KSSR in Table 3), all of the
interactions except for S235-D49 are characterized
by a signiÂ®cant negative Ubon term ranging
between Ã¿4 and Ã¿14 kcal molÃ¿1
. Usol and Ubon
are opposite in sign and the latter is usually smalï¿¾ler in magnitude. Therefore, the electrostatic stabilï¿¾ization of the interaction requires a substantial
favorable Uprot term. This term reÂ¯ects the stabilï¿¾ization of an interaction by its neighbors and in
other words it exempliÂ®es the electrostatic cooperaï¿¾tivity between the residues. Table 3 shows that this
term is the most sensitive to the mutation of neighï¿¾boring residues. The Uprot term for each of the
salt bridges is signiÂ®cantly favorable for the double
salt bridge, providing an electrostatic explanation
for the experimental observation.
Discussion
Evaluation of the energetic contributions of
hydrogen bonds and salt bridges towards both
protein and complex stability is a difÂ®cult task
both experimentally and theoretically. Standard
mutagenesis experiments usually probe, to a greatï¿¾er or lesser extent, several physical contributions to
Figure 6. The cooperative effect
of neighboring residues demonï¿¾strated by plotting Gz
kdint values
as a function of the residues preï¿¾sent in the site for each TEM-BLIP
interaction. Starting from the isoï¿¾lated interaction on the left, the site
was reconstructed to obtain KSSR,
which is the wild-type protein.
512 Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Bindingstability at the same time making it difÂ®cult to
obtain the net contribution of a speciÂ®c bond. Here
we combine an experimental and a computational
approach to quantitatively evaluate non-covalent
interactions using a modiÂ®ed multiple mutant
cycle approach. Our model system is a distinct
binding domain in the TEM-BLIP complex which
contains four interactions between side-chains of
residues lining the active site pocket of TEM and a
single BLIP residue, Asp49. This binding site is
located at the periphery of the interaction interface
making it a pseudo-independent binding unit.
Taking advantage of its solitude positioning, we
examined the two buried salt bridges and two
hydrogen bonds formed, and the cooperative conï¿¾tributions of the environment on the strength of
these interactions.
The standard method for analyzing binding
energies is either by monitoring perturbations
caused by mutations, or by a more advanced proï¿¾tocol using double-mutant cycles. The coupling
energy, GKDint, which is obtained by the latter,
is an experimental measure of binding strength
between two residues. However, even this energy
includes, in addition to the direct interaction
energy, effects due to neighboring residues and
due to desolvation (Fersht et al., 1992; Horovitz &
Fersht, 1990).
Here we reversed the double-mutant cycle methï¿¾od by changing the reference state of the system to
one where all involved residues are Ala, namely,
the complex of the tetra-mutant of TEM
(S130A,S235A,K234A,R243A) interacting with
BLIP-D49A. This approach was introduced by
Horovitz & Fersht (1992) for measuring changes in
synergy during refolding of barnase using a cube
of mutant cycles. Here we extended this approach
to construct a penta-mutant cycle which analyzes a
binding unit as a whole. Most of the analysis utiï¿¾lized measured values of Gz
kd for the determiï¿¾nation of Gz
kdint. This excludes contributions of
long range electrostatic interactions which inÂ¯uï¿¾ence the association process, but are not relevant to
the short range net bond energy between the two
residues. The distinct contribution of charged resiï¿¾dues towards the rate of association (and thus to
the afÂ®nity) was analyzed separately (Figure 3). In
order to estimate the net strength of the isolated
pairwise interactions without the indirect effect of
neighboring residues, we constructed double
mutant cycles between each of the four pairs of
interacting residues (BLIP-D49 with either S130,
S235, K234 or R243 on TEM) with the remaining
three residues mutated to Ala. Using measured
Gz
kd values, the resulting energy term, Gz
kdint,
is a direct measure of the energetic contribution of
a speciÂ®c interaction towards stabilization of the
complex. Second order effects, such as cooperativï¿¾ity, which can contribute to the stabilization of the
interaction, were determined by selectively adding
neighboring residues and constructing higher
order mutant cycles.
The two isolated salt bridges D49-K234 and D49-
R243 (in the absence of S130,S235,R243 and
S130,K234,S235, respectively) are good examples of
buried salt bridges as they are 93 % solvent inacï¿¾cessible. Both do not contribute to complex stabï¿¾ility. In fact the residues R243 and D49 repel each
other with a negative Gz
kdint value of Ã¿0.38 kcal
molÃ¿1
. Neutral or negative contributions of salt
bridges to protein stability have been speculated,
but not shown experimentally. These results are
consistent with octanol partitioning experiments on
a model system which showed that salt bridges are
energetically neutral in terms of protein stabilizï¿¾ation (Wimley et al., 1996). The destabilization due
to each separate salt bridge which we observed for
TEM-BLIP was suggested by Hendsch & Tidor
(1994) who performed electrostatic continuum calï¿¾culation which indicated that buried, as opposed
to exposed, salt bridges usually destabilize proteins
with respect to mutation to hydrophobic isosteric
residues or Ala. This is a direct consequence of the
fact that ionic groups are thermodynamically more
stable when immersed in a high dielectric medium
such as water than when embedded in a lower

Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Binding 513dielectric medium such as that of the protein
matrix. According to these theoretical calculations
the H31-D70 salt bridge in T4 lysozyme (75 % burï¿¾ial) destabilizes the protein by 3.5 kcal molÃ¿1
,
while a solvent-exposed salt bridge (37 % burial)
such as E22-K35 of uteroglobin was calculated to
stabilize the protein by just over 1 kcal molÃ¿1
.
Accordingly, Honig & Hubbel (1984) estimated
that the free energy cost of forming an ion pair in a
medium with a dielectric constant of 10, would be
about 5 kcal molÃ¿1
. Conversely to calculations,
experimental measurements of the strength of burï¿¾ied salt bridges show consistently positive interï¿¾action energies between the residues involved. For
example the buried I16-D194 salt bridge in chymoï¿¾trypsin was determined by pKa shift to contribute
2.9 kcal mol
Ã¿1 (Fersht, 1971, 1972). Dahlquist and
co-workers have studied the H31-D70 salt bridge
in T4 lysozyme also by pKa shift and concluded
that it contributes 3-5 kcal molÃ¿1 toward the stabï¿¾ility of the protein (Anderson et al., 1990). These
experiments, as opposed to ours, measure the stabï¿¾ility of the salt bridge relative to one or more
charged hydrogen bonds or relative to a neutral
hydrogen bond while our measurements and calï¿¾culations measure the stability relative to Ala,
which for buried salt bridges is a preferred referï¿¾ence state. The double-mutant cycle approach also
yielded positive contributions for salt bridges. For
example the buried D14-R17 salt bridge in l
repressor was shown by double mutant cycle to
contribute 0.8 kcal mol
Ã¿1 (Marqusee & Sauer, 1994)
and the buried salt bridges R31-E36 and R40-E36
in Arc repressor were shown to contribute 1.7 and
4.7 kcal mol
Ã¿1
, respectively (Waldburger et al.,
1995). Furthermore, GKDint values for a number
of salt bridges within the interface of barnase-barï¿¾star were shown to be in the range of 1.6-6 kcal
mol
Ã¿1 (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995). Even the interï¿¾action between two negatively charged residues
within the interface of barnase and barstar (E73-
D39) was shown to stabilize the complex by
2.9 kcal molÃ¿1
. The main difference between these
cited studies and those presented here, is that the
negative contributions for D49-R243 and D49-K234
were measured in the absence of neighboring resiï¿¾dues. The interaction energy (Gz
kdint) between
BLIP-D49 and either K234 or R243 on TEM within
the context of the binding site (in the presence of
all their neighbors) are 1.0 and 1.4 kcal molÃ¿1
,
respectively, which is in good agreement with the
other published results.
Addition of a third residue to the site and conï¿¾struction of a triple mutant cycle allowed the deterï¿¾mination of the cooperative effect between the
three selected residues. Positive cooperativity
accounts for the enhanced stabilization of an interï¿¾action in the presence of the added residue. The
strongest cooperative effect is observed for the salt
bridge triad (two salt links involving three resiï¿¾dues) R243, K234 and D49 with a cooperative
value of 0.86 kcal molÃ¿1
. This stabilization is quite
impressive considering the negative energetic conï¿¾tribution of each salt bridge alone. Interestingly,
the cooperativity between the salt bridge triad
R110-D8-D12 located on the surface of barnase
showed a similar positive cooperativity of 0.77 kcal
mol
Ã¿1 (Horovitz et al., 1990). Statistical analyses
have shown that 37 % of ion pairs in protein crystal
structures occur as charge networks (Barlow &
Thornton, 1983; MusaÂ®a et al., 1995). Networking
of salt bridges is suggested to be one of the mechï¿¾anisms for increasing the thermostability of proï¿¾teins (Elcock & McCammon, 1999; Perutz & Raidt,
1975; Vetriani et al., 1998; Yip et al., 1995).
Examining the cooperativity exerted by the
addition of K234 to the R243-D49 interaction in the
presence of both Ser residues gives a value of

a Uint, the electrostatic contribution of a speciÂ®c interaction towards the total electrostatic free energy (kcal molÃ¿1) was derived by double mutant cycles using U values, where U is the
difference in calculated total electrostatic energy between the free and complexed proteins (Ufree Ã¿ Ucomplex, I Âˆ 0.15 M, in kcal molÃ¿1). A negative value indicates repulsion and a positive value,
attraction.
Usol, Uprot, Ubon, the relative electrostatic contribution of desolvation, neighboring residues and the bond itself on the total electrostatic energy of an interaction (kcal molÃ¿1) calculated by
the method of Hendsch & Tidor (1994, 1999).
b KSSR, the wild-type protein where all four TEM residues are present.0.81 kcal molÃ¿1
, which is similar to the value
obtained in the absence of the Ser residues
(0.86 kcal molÃ¿1
). This implies that the cooperativï¿¾ity of the triad is not dependent on other, nonï¿¾charged residues located in the vicinity. This also
strengthens the notion that structural rearrangeï¿¾ment is minor.
Positive cooperativity for the D49-R243 interï¿¾action, though much lower, is exerted also by each
of the two Ser residues. Addition of a single Ser
residue stabilizes the R243-D49 interaction by an
average of 0.3 kcal molÃ¿1
. In a similar manner, the
addition of S235 to the double salt bridge with
R243 and K234 also contributes about the same
value. Similar values for the positive cooperativity
between a salt bridge and hydrogen bond was
observed for the D14-R17-S77 interactions in l
repressor where each of the interactions is stabilï¿¾ized by 0.3 kcal molÃ¿1 in the presence of the other
interaction (Marqusee & Sauer, 1994). Adding up
all the cooperative contributions participating in
the R243-D49 and K234-D49 interactions in TEMï¿¾BLIP, one gets 1.46 and 0.95 kcal molÃ¿1
, respectï¿¾ively, which are close to the values of Gz
kdint for
the wild-type proteins (1.36 and 1.06 kcal molÃ¿1
,
respectively). Thus, for the two salt bridges most
of the interaction energy is attributed to additive
cooperative effects.
To further understand the basis of the cooperaï¿¾tive nature of the two salt bridges we related the
experimental results with calculated energy terms.
The interactions between these residues are electroï¿¾static in nature as no correlation between buried
surface area and binding energies was found
(Figure 7(a)). The electrostatic contribution towards
the free energy for complex formation was calcuï¿¾lated from which the contribution of the speciÂ®c
interactions towards the total electrostatic energy
Uint was derived. The same scheme was used
for the calculations as was used for the experimenï¿¾tal analysis as well as the same reference state.
Namely, Uint was Â®rst determined by a double
mutant cycle for the isolated pair of interacting
residues and subsequently for the pair in the preï¿¾sence of its neighbors allowing higher order coopï¿¾erative effects to be detected (note that for
interaction energies deduced from double mutant
cycles using either experimental or computational
data, a positive value indicates attraction). Despite
the large difference in absolute values between the
calculated and measured data, a good correlation
was observed for the two salt bridges between the
experimentally determined values of Gz
kdint and
calculated values of Uint (Figure 8).
The values of Uint for the double salt bridge
are more favorable than for the single salt bridges
(5.6 for the double salt-bridge versus 3.9 kcal molÃ¿1
for R243-D49 and 13.1 for the double salt-bridge
versus 11.4 kcal molÃ¿1 for K234-D49). This suggests
that the observed cooperative effects are electroï¿¾static in nature. In order to understand the basis
for electrostatic cooperativity we employed the
continuum electrostatic approach of Hendsch and
Tidor which allows the total electrostatic energy of
an interaction to be dissected into the indirect conï¿¾tributions from solvent (Usol), the rest of the proï¿¾tein (Uprot) and the direct effect of the bond itself,
(Ubon). This analysis showed that stabilization of
the salt bridge network between D49, K234 and
R243 results primarily from a relatively favorable
Uprot term for the double salt bridge compared to
the single one (Ã¿7 for the double salt-bridge versus
6 kcal molÃ¿1 for R243-D49 and Ã¿2.9 for the double
salt-bridge versus 2.9 kcal molÃ¿1 for the K234-D49
interaction, Table 3). This results from the presence
of charged residues on the surface that reduce the
repulsion between the two proteins. Hence, this
electrostatic description provides an explanation
for the experimental observations. Networking of
salt bridges to other polar and charged groups was
suggested to be a strategy for stabilizing the 434
repressor where the R10-E35 buried salt bridge
was calculated to stabilize the protein by 0.4 kcal
molÃ¿1 despite a very high solvation term. This is
due to the presence of K7 which co-interacts with
E35 resulting in favorable Ubon and Uprot terms
(Hendsch & Tidor, 1994).
In contrast to the charged residues, the two burï¿¾ied hydrogen bonds (D49-S130 and D49-S235) are
favorable (Gz
kdintÂˆ0.3 kcal molÃ¿1 each) even in
the absence of all neighboring residues (in
S235A,K234A,R243A and S235A,K234A,R243A
backgrounds, respectively). Values for Gz
kdint in
a wild-type background were measured to be 0.9
and 1.5 kcal molÃ¿1
, respectively. These values are
in the range of the suggested net stabilization of
hydrogen bonds reported in the literature (0.5-
2.0 kcal mol
Ã¿1
) (Fernandez-Recio et al., 1999;
Fersht, 1987; Freier et al., 1986; Goldman et al.,
1997; Myers & Pace, 1996; Schreiber & Fersht, 1995;
Shirley et al., 1992; Yamagata et al., 1998;
Creighton, 1991). Recent theoretical studies, howï¿¾ever, have drawn the opposite conclusion arguing
that mutational studies of one member of a hydroï¿¾gen bonding pair leaves the protein with an unsaï¿¾tisÂ®ed buried polar residue (Honig & Yang, 1995;
Lazaridis et al., 1995; Sippl et al., 1996). The
interpretation of the cooperative effects of neighï¿¾bors on the two hydrogen bonds is more complex.
For both hydrogen bonds R243, but not K234, had
a positive cooperative effect of about 0.3 kcal
molÃ¿1
. On the other hand, the presence of the
second hydrogen bond had an adverse effect on
the strength of binding of the probed hydrogen
bond of about Ã¿0.3 kcal molÃ¿1
. If one adds to the
binding energy all the cooperative effects of the
participating neighbors, one does not account for
the interaction energy, suggesting more complex
phenomena and higher orders of cooperativity.
Furthermore, the electrostatic calculations failed to
explain the experimental results which is clear
from the weak correlation between Uint and
Gz
kdint for the two hydrogen bonds in Figure 8.
The reason for our difÂ®culty in accounting for the
effects of the two hydrogen bonds may stem from
the fact that they are very sensitive to the angle
516 Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Bindingand distance between the residues, while chargeï¿¾charge interactions are less so.
Stabilization of an interaction by the presence of
a third residue can also result from structural coopï¿¾erativity, where formation of an interaction
between a pair of residues helps orient one of the
side-chains involved in the second interaction,
thereby reducing the entropic cost and making the
second interaction more favorable. While electroï¿¾static cooperativity can explain the stabilization of
the salt bridge triad, we suggest that structural
cooperativity may account for some of the extra
stabilization of the hydrogen bonds by their neighï¿¾bors. Structural cooperativity is especially importï¿¾ant for hydrogen bonds which rely on the correct
positioning of its interacting residues. Fixation of a
residue, by an interaction, in an unfavorable orienï¿¾tation for a second interaction can cause the
adverse effect which may explain the large negaï¿¾tive cooperativity between the double hydrogen
bonds. S235 may be involved in structural cooperaï¿¾tivity which may account for the unexplainable
destabilization of the complex in the absence of
S235 (Figure 2(b), and the relatively high value of
Gz
kd
in Table 1), and of the other interactions as
well (relatively low values of Gz
kdint for
R243,K234,S130 in Table 2). Furthermore, the salt
bridge triad cooperativity is lost upon mutation of
S235 (0.13 kcal molÃ¿1
), which does not occur upon
mutation of S130 (0.97 kcal molÃ¿1
). Destabilization
of the complex with S235A is not accounted for in
the calculated results: U for S235A is almost 0
(Table 1), and values of Uint and Ubon for
R243,K234,S130 in Table 3 are not unusual. This
discrepancy between experimental and calculated
results is the reason for the stray points in Figure 8.
While the experimental data account for any type
of cooperativity, the calculated data reÂ¯ect only
electrostatic effects. This is further supported by
the fact that while the experimental results suggest
a positive contribution for the S235-D49 interï¿¾action, electrostatic calculations indicate that the
S235-D49 interaction is unfavorable (Uint is
about 0 with or without neighboring residues and
values of Ubon for all the interactions are negative
with values ranging between Ã¿4 and Ã¿14 kcal
molÃ¿1
, whereas for the S235-D49 interaction the
value is close to zero, Table 3). Structural relaxï¿¾ation may account for some of these observations.
Therefore, structural studies are necessary to deterï¿¾mine the answer unambiguously.
A basic assumption for mutational analysis is
the intactness of the protein structures despite the
introduction of mutations. As structures of the
mutant proteins are not available, all calculations
were done on structures derived from the crystalloï¿¾graphically determined wild-type complex. This of
course can introduce errors, if there are major
structural rearrangements of the residues upon
mutation. To assess possible structural rearrangeï¿¾ment upon mutation we performed energy miniï¿¾mization of the mutated structures allowing
freedom for the side-chain residues. The resulting
structures were incorporated into the calculations.
Small movements of the side-chains were
observed; however, they had very little impact on
the calculated energies. It is noteworthy that the
position of the side-chains in the free TEM crystal
structure is almost identical to their position in the
complex. This is not the case for BLIP-D49. This
residue perturbs from the b-hairpin turn and
makes no contacts to other BLIP residues. Thereï¿¾fore, it potentially can take different orientations,
which is exerted by the low temperature factor of
this residue in the BLIP structure. The TEM pocket,
in fact, is large enough to accommodate most of
these structures. The position of the D49 side-chain
is therefore imposed by the residues of TEM
with which it interacts. The minimized structures
of the complex reÂ¯ect this Â¯exibility, with D49
making the largest movements. Though when
implemented into our calculation, the minimized
structures made very small changes in U and
Uint values. Structures of some of the key
mutations are currently being analyzed by X-ray
crystallography in collaboration with Dr Strynadka
to verify that no major movements occur in the
binding site.
In summary, in order to evaluate interactions
one has to analyze them within their speciÂ®c
environment and differentiate between the direct
binding energy and indirect effects. The measured
interaction energy between a pair of residues is the
sum of these different contributions. The picture is
further complicated by the fact that all interactions
have to compete with water at 55 M concentration.
Here we have shown that the direct binding
energy is small (for hydrogen bonds) and is negliï¿¾gible or even repulsive for charge-charge interï¿¾actions. Albeit, once a network of interactions is
established cooperative effects can convert the
interactions to favorable ones. This is especially
pronounced for salt bridges, where networking
changed the interaction from repulsive to attracï¿¾tive. Thus the positive contribution of each salt
bridge in the wild-type proteins is due entirely to
the indirect cooperative effects due to neighboring
residues. Theoretical electrostatic calculations comï¿¾pliment the experimental results showing quantiï¿¾tatively how the observed cooperative effect for
the salt bridge triad is due to the indirect electroï¿¾static effect of the environment.
Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification
Site-directed mutagenesis and the expression and
puriÂ®cation of BLIP, TEM and their mutants were as
described (Albeck & Schreiber, 1999). Mutant plasmids
were identiÂ®ed by direct sequencing.
Kinetic measurements
Kinetic constants were obtained using SPR detection
on a BIAcore as described (Albeck & Schreiber, 1999).
Either BLIP or BLIP-D49A were immobilized on to the
Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Binding 517sensor chip and the binding of TEM and its mutants was
monitored (HBS, 25 C). Binding of protein to a control
surface without immobilized ligand was also measured
and the sensogram subtracted from the binding proÂ®le
measured on a surface with immobilized protein. Associï¿¾ation and dissociation rate constants were determined by
analysis of the appropriate regions of the resulting sensoï¿¾gram using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software package
(Pharmacia). This conÂ®guration (with BLIP bound) was
shown to give apparent rate constants which are differï¿¾ent from those obtained in the opposite conÂ®guration or
by other techniques. However, values of the change in
free energy (or kd) for the alanine mutants relative to the
wild-type (G
KD , and Gz
kd
) were independent of the
protein immobilized (Albeck & Schreiber, 1999).
Energy minimization
Energy minimization of relevant side-chains was perï¿¾formed using CHARMM (Brooks et al., 1983) as
implemented in Quanta96, a Molecular Modeling Packï¿¾age of MSI (Molecular Simulation Inc.). In order to save
computational time, the X-ray crystal structure of the
complex was modiÂ®ed so that residues over 15 AÃŠ from
all of the interacting residues (R243, S235, K234, S130 on
TEM and D49 on BLIP) were mutated to glycine (to
reduce the solvation layer). Minimization was then perï¿¾formed on the modiÂ®ed wild-type complex and on its
mutants in a similar way: polar hydrogen atoms were
built into the structure using CHARMM, subsequently
the structures were solvated in a radius of 10 AÃŠ around
each residue (for the TEM-BLIP complex, for example,
about 2700 water molecules were added). The back-bone
and side-chains of the entire complex were Â®xed while
the position of the side-chains of all Â®ve interacting resiï¿¾dues were minimized. Also included in the minimization
were water molecules in a sphere of 15 AÃŠ around the
binding site. The sphere was centered on Cg of D49, or
on Cb of residue S235 (whenever D49 was mutated).
Typically, such a sphere contained 60-70 water molï¿¾ecules. The minimization procedure ran for 500 steps
using the Powell (Brent, 1973) method. The minimized
coordinates of the side-chains were then implemented
into the unminimized structure and the resulting conï¿¾struct was used for the calculations.
Calculation of solvent accessible surface
area, SASA
Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) was calculated
for the wild-type complex, for each of its mutants and
for the unbound proteins and their corresponding
mutants using an analytical parametric approach based
on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (Fraczkiewicz & Braun,
1998) implemented in the molecular surface routine
GETAREA (a web service provided by the Sealy Center
for Structural Biology at the University of Texas Medical
Branch). SASA is the difference between the calculated
SASA of the complexed proteins and that of the free proï¿¾teins. SASA is the difference in SASA upon
mutation.
Electrostatic calculations
Continuum electrostatic calculations were carried out
with version 9.5 of DELPHI computer package incorporï¿¾ated in InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). The linearï¿¾ized Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved on an
89  81  81 point three-dimensional grid. The grid cenï¿¾ter was deÂ®ned to be the center of the Â®nal complex. The
individual proteins were mapped onto the grid in
relation to the grid center in the same way as they relate
to the center of the complex. The total extent was set to
88 AÃŠ with grid points separated by 1 AÃŠ from each other.
A solvent probe of 1.4 AÃŠ was used to deÂ®ne the molecuï¿¾lar surface and a 2 AÃŠ Stern layer surrounded the molï¿¾ecules. The proteins and solvent were assigned dielectric
values of 4.0 and 80.0, respectively, for all the calcuï¿¾lations except for the Coulombic energy where a conï¿¾tinuous dielectric of 80.0 was assigned. The X-ray
crystallographic coordinates of the TEM-BLIP complex
were obtained from Dr Strynadka. The coordinates of
the free proteins were derived from the complex by elimï¿¾inating the unwanted partner. Hydrogen atoms were
added by model building using InsightII (Molecular
Simulations, Inc.). Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg side-chains
and N and C termini were modeled in their ionized
state.
Calculation of the total electrostatic energy of
interaction, U
The electrostatic energy of interaction, U was calcuï¿¾lated from the difference between the total electrostatic
energy of the free proteins and that of the complex:

where qi refer to the charges of the protein atoms and fi
are the electrostatic potentials at the atomic sites for a
protein speciÂ®ed under the summation sign. These were
calculated as described above assigning Parse charges to
every atom in the molecule (Sitkoff et al., 1994). This calï¿¾culation was performed at an ionic strength of 0.15 M
(the same as the experimental data).
Calculation of direct and indirect contributions to
the electrostatic energy of interaction
The following calculations are based on the method of
Hendsch & Tidor (1994, 1999). The desolvation penalty,
Usol for the interaction j Ã¿ k, is the sum of the loss of
solvent interaction energy upon binding, for each of the
two interacting residues:

Partial charges for side-chain atoms of one of the interï¿¾acting residues were assigned (Cb and on). All other resiï¿¾dues were assigned 0 charge. The potential was then
determined at each partial charge position of that same
side-chain and the energy computed. This calculation
was performed for the complexed and uncomplexed proï¿¾teins for each of the interacting residues separately.
Usol was computed for each interaction in the absence
of neighboring residues by substituting the appropriate
coordinates of the desired mutation.
The indirect effect between the side-chains of the interï¿¾acting residues and the rest of the protein, Uprot, was
calculated by assigning partial charges to all atoms of
518 Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Binding  the protein except for those in the side-chains of the
interacting residues which were set to 0 (Cb and on). Solï¿¾ving the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation, the
potential was then determined at the position of both
side-chains of the interacting pair. This was repeated for
the individual proteins where the potential was deterï¿¾mined at the position of its relevant side-chain only. The
energy was computed according to:

while j and k are the individual interacting residues of
that protein.
The contribution of the electrostatic interaction
between the interacting side-chains in the complex,
Ubond, was computed by assigning 0 charge to all
atoms in the complex except those on the side-chain of
one interacting residue. The potential was then deterï¿¾mined by solving the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann
equation at each partial charge position of the other sideï¿¾chain and Ubond was calculated:

where i ranges over the partial charges in the other sideï¿¾chain. The same results should be obtained when the

mutated coordinates. The % burial of the interaction was
calculated as described by Hendsch & Tidor (1994).
