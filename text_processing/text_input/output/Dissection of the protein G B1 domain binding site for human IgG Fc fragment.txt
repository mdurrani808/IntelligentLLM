Abstract
The contribution to the free energy of binding of each of the residues forming the binding site for a human IgG Fc
fragment on the surface of the B1 domain of protein G was determined by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The interface
between these two proteins is atypical in that it is smaller than usual, polar in character, and involves two well-defined
“knobs-into-holes” interactions. The bulk of the free energy of binding is contributed by three central residues, which
make hydrogen bonds across the interface. Of these, the most critical interaction is formed by Glu27, which acts as a
charged knob on the surface of the B1 domain, inserting into a polar hole on the Fc fragment. A single alanine mutation
of this residue virtually abolishes stable complex formation. Formation of a stable interface between these two proteins
is therefore dominated by a small, polar “hot spot.”

Protein–protein interactions play an essential role in many biolog￾ical processes. Understanding the energetics of such interactions is
of great importance because it defines the necessary concentra￾tions of interacting partners, the rates at which these partners are
capable of associating, and the relative concentrations of bound
and free proteins in the solution ~Stites, 1997!. Well-studied classes
of protein–protein interactions ~Jones & Thornton, 1996; LoConte
et al., 1999! include hormone receptor binding and activation ~Wells
& deVos, 1996!, antibodies with protein antigens ~Davies & Co￾hen, 1996!, enzyme inhibitor complexes ~Tsunogae et al., 1986!,
and protein oligomerization ~Argos, 1988!. Here, we present a
study of the contributions to the free energy of binding of the
residues forming the site on the surface of the B1 domain Strep￾tococcal protein G for binding of human Fc fragment of IgG ~hFc!.
B1 is one of the domains of protein G, a member of an important
class of proteins which form IgG-binding receptors on the surface
of certain Staphylococcal and Streptococcal strains ~Boyle, 1990;
Frick et al., 1992!. It has been suggested that these proteins allow
the pathogenic bacterium to evade the host immune response by
coating the invading bacteria with host antibodies ~Goward et al.,
1993!, thereby contributing significantly to the pathogenicity of
these bacteria. Furthermore, the B1 domain has found numerous
application in biotechnology as a reagent for affinity purification
of antibodies ~Ståhl et al., 1993!, since it binds to IgGs of many
different species and subclasses ~Stone et al., 1989!. A deeper
understanding of the sequence determinants that contribute to IgG
binding may therefore lead to new therapeutics for Streptococcal
infections and novel immunochemical reagents.
B1 is a 56-residue domain that folds into a four-stranded b-sheet
and one a-helix, as shown by NMR and X-ray crystallography.
Despite its small size, the B1 domain has two separate IgG-binding
sites on its surface, each interacting respectively with specific,
independent sites on the Fab or Fc fragments of the antibody. The
structure of a B1-Fab complex ~Derrick & Wigley, 1992! has
revealed that the Fab-binding site is mediated almost entirely through
backbone contacts between the edge of the b-sheet of the B1
domain and the last b-strand of the CH1 domain of the Fab frag￾ment, thereby forming a continuous b-sheet spanning the interface
between the two partners. In contrast, a B1-Fc complex ~Sauer￾Eriksson et al., 1995! has shown that the Fc-binding site is medi￾ated primarily by side-chain contacts between the two proteins.
This is further supported by competition experiments in which
an 11-residue peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of the
a-helix and the N-terminal part of the third b-strand competitively
inhibits binding of B1 to hFc ~Frick et al., 1992!. NMR experi￾ments also confirm the general location of the Fc-binding site on
the surface of the B1 domain ~Gronenborn & Clore, 1993; Kato
et al., 1995!.

1643Compared to most other protein–protein interactions, the Fc￾binding site on the B1 protein is somewhat atypical. First, it is
predominantly polar rather than hydrophobic in character ~Stites,
1997!; second, the interfacial area is on the lower end of the
observed range, ;700 Å2 rather than the average 1,200 Å2 ~Jones
& Thornton, 1996!; third, rather than a planar interaction surface
typically observed in heterodimers, this interface is formed by a
double “knobs-into-holes” interaction ~Crick, 1952, 1953! in which
a knob from the B1 protrudes into a hole in the hFc, and vice versa.
This study defines the energetic contributions of each of these
elements on the B1 domain binding surface for hFc.
Results
Mutagenesis of the Fc-binding site on the B1 domain
The X-ray structure of the complex between the B1 and a human
IgG Fc fragment ~hFc! ~Sauer-Eriksson et al., 1995! was used to
identify the residues located in the interface between these two
proteins. The static solvent-accessible surface ~Richards, 1977!
was calculated for the B1 domain in the presence and absence of
the hFc fragment. Eleven residues showed a significant decrease in
solvent accessibility in the structure of the complex ~Table 1!.
Single alanine mutants of each of these residues were constructed.
These are located in the alpha helix, the third b-strand, and the
loop between this helix and strand ~Fig. 1!.
Binding studies
The interaction of the mutant B1 domain with the hFc was mea￾sured using a fluorescence method previously developed by us
~Sloan & Hellinga, 1998!, which relies on the attachment of an
environmentally sensitive fluorophore placed at the rim of the
binding site in a location such that its fluorescence changes upon
formation of the complex by virtue of alterations in conforma￾tional degrees of freedom and solvent accessibility, without ad￾versely affecting the binding constant. Binding constants for hFc
were determined in a direct titration experiment in which purified
hFc was added to a solution of a Q32C B1 mutant to which the
fluorophore acrylodan was covalently coupled at position 32C
~Fig. 2A!. The binding constants for all the B1 mutants were
determined in the Q32C background ~Table 1!. For those mutants
whose Kd showed a greater than 50-fold increase, the binding
constants were determined in a competition experiment in which a
complex was preformed between fluorescently labeled wild-type
B1 ~Q32C! and hFc, which was then titrated with an unlabeled,
mutant B1 domain whose free cysteine at position 32 had been
blocked with iodoacetamide ~Fig. 2B!. This approach was used to
avoid having to use large quantities of pure hFc.
To verify that large decreases in the binding constants were not
due to loss of structure, we took advantage of the fact that B1 has
a separate binding site for the Fab fragment, which does not over￾lap with the Fc binding site. Fab binding was determined semi￾quantitatively by phage display in M13 ~Smith & Scott, 1993!
using a genetic fusion between gene III and B1, expressed as
a second copy in the phage genome ~Armstrong et al., 1996!
to obtain uni- rather than polyvalent display of the B1 domain
~McConnell et al., 1994!. In all cases, the mutants constructed in
the Fc-binding site retained the ability to bind Fab ~data not shown!,
indicating that there was no significant loss in overall structure.
The results show that 5 out of the 10 residues in the binding site
had a significant effect on hFc binding ~Kd increased at least 10-
fold!, whereas the other 5 showed little or no effect ~less than
twofold change in Kd!. A single mutant, E27A, virtually abolished
binding ~.4,000-fold increase in Kd!. The five residues that most
affected binding form a contiguous patch on the surface of B1,
surrounded by a ring of the other residues ~Fig. 1!.
Discussion
The experiments described in this paper report the energetic con￾tributions of the residues forming the binding site between the B1
domain of protein G and human IgG Fc fragment. The X-ray
structure of a complex between the B1 domain and hFc show that
about 13 residues on the surface of B1 are directly involved in the
binding site as defined by a change in their solvent-accessible area
upon complex formation. Three of these residues are alanines, and
we did not perform glycine scanning mutagenesis to determine the
energetic contribution of these residues. Alanine mutations of only
about half of the 10 mutated residues significantly affect the bind￾ing free energy ~at least 10-fold increase in Kd!. Within these five
residues the effect of binding varies sharply, ranging from 10-fold
to more than 4,000-fold increases in Kd, indicating that the deter￾minants contributing to the free energy of binding are highly lo￾calized. The localization of binding energy to such “hot spots” has
also been observed in other heterodimeric interfaces ~Bogan &
Thorn, 1998; Wells, 1991!.
The binding hot spots on the surface of the B1 domain are
associated with clear structural motifs. The binding site is formed
by two “knobs-into-holes” interactions. E27 of the B1 domain fits
into a hole formed by I253 and S254 on the surface of the Fc
fragment, where the carboxylate forms hydrogen bonds with the
backbone amides of these residues as well as the Og of S254.
Mutation of this charged knob on the surface of the B1 domain
virtually completely abolishes binding. The carboxylate of E27 is
held in position by a hydrogen bond from the amino group of K31,
the neighboring residue, on the surface of B1. Removal of this

Interaction between B1 and IgG Fc 1645interaction in the K31A mutant significantly decreases affinity
~350-fold increase in Kd!. The second knob-into-hole interaction is
formed by the protrusion of N434 from the surface of the Fc into
a hole in B1 bordered by N35, D36, D40, E42, and W43. The
indole nitrogen of W43 forms a hydrogen bond with N434. Of all
the bordering residues forming the hole on B1, the W43A mutant
has the most profound effect on the interaction ~580-fold increase
in Kd!, presumably as a direct consequence of this interaction. Of
the other residues, only N35A significantly affects binding ~50-
fold increase in Kd!. Interestingly, it makes a hydrogen bond with
H433 on the hFc.
These results quantify the contribution of the individual residues
identified in the high-resolution structure of the B1-hFc complex
~Sauer-Eriksson et al., 1995!. It was noted in the description of this
structure that all of these residues are involved in contacts between
the two proteins. From this study it is clear, however, that only a
small subset makes significant contribution to the free energy of
binding, illustrating the importance of combining structural infor￾mation with thermodynamic data. It should be emphasized that in
an alanine-scanning mutagenesis experiment side chains are de￾leted. Lack of a large effect upon loss of an interaction does not
imply that the choice of a particular amino acid is unimportant,
since replacement with residues that result in incorrect steric pack￾ing or charge complementarity may adversely affect proper for￾mation of the interface. Furthermore, an alanine scanning experiment
does not address the issue of main-chain interactions. Two B1
domain residues potentially form main-chain interactions with hFc
residues, those being the nitrogen of G41 and the carbonyl oxygen
of V39 ~Sauer-Eriksson et al., 1995!.
The four critical binding residues within the B1 domain are
glutamate, tryptophan, lysine, and asparagine. Tryptophan is fre￾quently found within interfaces, whereas lysine and asparagine are
not normally enriched, and glutamate is underrepresented in het￾erodimer interfaces ~Bogan & Thorn, 1998!. It has been suggested
that hot spots located in planar interfaces need to be surrounded by
a ring of residues that exclude bulk solvent ~the O-ring hypoth￾esis!, aiding in the formation of polar hydrogen bonds ~Bogan &
Thorn, 1998!. The polar knobs-into-holes binding motif observed
in the B1 domain provides another mechanism to form buried,
polar hydrogen bonds.
Staphylococcal protein A competitively binds to a similar site on
hFc as the B1 domain, involving in both cases hFc residues 252–
254, 433–435, and 311 ~Deisenhofer, 1981; Sauer-Eriksson et al.,
1995!. Whereas the interactions between B1 and hFc are predom￾inantly polar, half of the protein A interactions are polar and half
are hydrophobic. These proteins present an example of two distinct
folds that have evolved different structural features to achieve
binding at very similar sites on the same target molecule.
The existence of a well-defined hot spot suggests that it may be
possible to develop a low molecular weight reagent that could
disrupt this interface. Such a reagent could have applications in
immunochemistry as well in treatment of Streptococcal infections
by potentially unmasking bacteria cloaked in a coat of antibodies.
Materials and methods
Mutagenesis
The construction of the B1 domain construct ~Q32C! has been
reported previously ~Sloan & Hellinga, 1998!. All mutations in this
study were constructed in that background by polymerase chain
reaction ~PCR! mutagenesis ~Ho et al., 1989!. A C-terminal oligo￾histidine ~His5! affinity tag was used to allow the purification of
the mutant proteins by immobilized metal affinity chromatography
~Hochuli et al., 1988!. The recombinant genes were flanked by
EcoRI sites that allowed facile cloning into either the pKK223-3
vector for protein expression or the M13 construct for phage dis￾play using gIII fusions.
Protein expression and purification
The expression and purification of mutant B1 domains has been
previously described ~Sloan & Hellinga, 1998!. A typical expres￾sion experiment produced 15 mg of pure mutant protein from 1 L
of culture.

site-specifically attached to a cysteine mutation at position 32 of the B1
domain. Each point represents the average of three independent titrations,
with experimental errors as indicated. A: The unlabeled Fc fragment was
titrated into a solution of 250 nM of the T25A mutant B1 domain. The data
were fit to Equation 1. Experimental error bars are smaller than symbols on

1646 D.J. Sloan and H.W. HellingaFluorophore coupling and iodoacetamide blocking
All of the above mutations were constructed into the Q32C back￾ground to allow site-specific covalent coupling with acrylodan for
fluorescent binding assays as described previously ~Sloan & Hell￾inga, 1998!. In competitive binding experiments between fluores￾cently labeled wild-type B1 and unlabeled mutants, the free thiol
in the mutant protein was blocked by reaction with iodoacetamide.
Binding of B1 mutants to human IgG Fc fragment
The binding constants for each of the alanine mutants were mea￾sured as an increase in fluorescence by direct titration of Fc frag￾ment of human IgG ~ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, California!
into a solution containing 250 nM acrylodan-conjugated B1 do￾main mutant in 20 mM KPO4 ~6.0! at 25 8C ~excitation 392 nm;
emission 500 nm; slit widths of 4 and 16 nm, respectively!. After
each addition of protein, the solution was allowed to equilibrate for
30 s before the final fluorescence value was recorded. Each titra￾tion consists of 20 points and was performed in triplicate. The data
were fit to a binding isotherm that described a single binding site
and takes into account all of the species present ~Segel, 1975!:

where F is the measured fluorescence with F0 and Fmax represent￾ing the initial and final values, respectively. @B1#t and @hFc#t are
the concentrations of B1 and hFc, respectively, and the Kd is the
disassociation constant.
The binding constants of weak binders ~greater than 50-fold
increases in Kd! were measured in a competition assay with a
pre-formed complex ~250 nM! of wild-type Q32C construct con￾jugated to acrylodan and hFc. Binding constants were determined
by measuring the decrease in fluorescence of the complex by the
addition of iodoacetamide blocked mutant B1 domains. From these
competition binding curves, the Kd for each of the mutant B1
domains was calculated from the binding isotherm ~Fierke et al.,
1991!:

where F is the measured fluorescence with F0 and Ff representing
the initial and final values, respectively. @B1wt# and @B1mut# are the
concentrations of B1 wild-type and mutant, respectively, and Kd is
the disassociation constant of the mutant or wild-type.
Phage display
A gly-gly-gly-ser-gly-gly-gly-ser linker was inserted into the NotI
site of pCANTAB5 ~Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden! to reduce the
interactions between the displayed protein and PIII ~Smith &
Scott, 1993!. The resulting gIII gene fusion was subcloned from
pCANTAB5 into the multiple cloning site of M13mp18 ~Messing,
1991!. A unique NheI site was introduced into the gIII fusion by
site-directed mutagenesis ~Kunkel, 1985! into which the B1 gene
was cloned. Alanine mutations were constructed directly into this
vector. Biopanning ~Smith & Scott, 1993! was used to determine
the Fab-binding properties of the fusion constructs, using 100 ng
biotinylated IgG, 5 3 109 pfu of each B1 bacteriophage, high
protein binding ELISA wells ~Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany!,
and 2% nonfat dry milk blocking solution. Binding between mu￾tant B1 and IgG was detected by anti-M13 antibody-HRP conju￾gate ~Pharmacia; manufacturers protocol!. Control experiments in
which the Fab fragment was left out were done in parallel to rule
out nonspecific binding.
