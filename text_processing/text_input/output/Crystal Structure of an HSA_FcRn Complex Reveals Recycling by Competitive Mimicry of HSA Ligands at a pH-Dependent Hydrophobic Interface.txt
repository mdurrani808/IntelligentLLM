SUMMARY
The long circulating half-life of serum albumin, the
most abundant protein in mammalian plasma,
derives from pH-dependent endosomal salvage
from degradation, mediated by the neonatal Fc
receptor (FcRn). Using yeast display, we identified
human serum albumin (HSA) variants with increased
affinity for human FcRn at endosomal pH, enabling
us to solve the crystal structure of a variant HSA/
FcRn complex. We find an extensive, primarily
hydrophobic interface stabilized by hydrogen￾bonding networks involving protonated histidines
internal to each protein. The interface features two
key FcRn tryptophan side chains inserting into
deep hydrophobic pockets on HSA that overlap albu￾min ligand binding sites. We find that fatty acids (FAs)
compete with FcRn, revealing a clash between ligand
binding and recycling, and that our high-affinity HSA
variants have significantly increased circulating half￾lives in mice and monkeys. These observations open
the way for the creation of biotherapeutics with
significantly improved pharmacokinetics.
INTRODUCTION
Serum albumin (SA) is the most abundant protein in mammalian
plasma and binds many endogenous and exogenous molecules
(such as fatty acids [FAs] and lipophilic small molecules) at over
ten discrete sites (Ghuman et al., 2005; Curry, 2009). SA and
immunoglobulin G (IgG) have circulating half-lives that are
much longer than those of other circulating proteins (18 and
22 days in humans for SA and IgG, respectively, compared
with, for example, 3–6 days for other immunoglobulin [Ig]
classes; Beeken et al., 1962; Spiegelberg et al., 1968). This
arises from a shared property, namely their being rescued from
degradation by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) (Chaudhury
et al., 2003; Rodewald and Kraehenbuhl, 1984). Ordinarily,
fluid-phase endocytosis in endothelial and myeloid cells contin￾uously removes plasma proteins to an acidic endosomal
compartment, whence they are sorted to the lysosome and
degraded (Akilesh et al., 2007). In the case of SA and IgGs, a
pH-dependent interaction occurs between these proteins and
FcRn, a transmembrane protein that sorts to the cell surface
and does not enter the lysosomal degradation pathway (Chaud￾hury et al., 2006; Israel et al., 1993; Ober et al., 2004). At the cell
surface, the bound proteins are released upon titration back to
physiological pH, at which dissociation from FcRn is rapid
(Chaudhury et al., 2006). Physiological modeling implies that
FcRn recycles six human serum albumin (HSA) molecules for
every IgG, and the ratio is 30:1 in mice (Kim et al., 2006).
The pH-dependent interaction between FcRn and IgG1 has
been studied in some detail (Ghetie et al., 1997; West and Bjork￾man, 2000; Martin et al., 2001; Dall’Acqua et al., 2002; Hinton
et al., 2004). FcRn is a heterodimer of a nonpolymorphic MHC
class I-like a chain and b2-microglobulin (b2m; Figure S1A avail￾able online). No substantial conformational change occurs upon
pH shift in either IgG1 or the FcRn interface; rather, the interac￾tion requires protonation of key histidine residues in the CH2-CH3
hinge region of IgG1, which then form salt bridges with key acidic
residues in the FcRn interface (West and Bjorkman, 2000; Martin
et al., 2001). FcRn can bind IgG and SA simultaneously, with
neither competition nor cooperation, suggesting a second,
distinct pH-dependent binding site (Chaudhury et al., 2003,
2006; Andersen et al., 2006, 2012). Consistent with this, the
SA/FcRn interaction is detergent sensitive and hydrophobic in
character, whereas the IgG/FcRn interaction is detergent insen￾sitive and largely polar (Chaudhury et al., 2003). To better under￾stand the structural basis of FcRn and SA interaction and
1966 Structure 21, 1966–1978, November 5, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reservedrecycling, we solved the cocrystal structure of human FcRn
(hFcRn) bound to a high-affinity variant of HSA, selected using
yeast display at pH 4.9 to 2.4 A˚ resolution. We find a large, pre￾dominantly hydrophobic interface that must initially be stabilized
by pH-dependent hydrogen-bonding networks internal to each
protein. In contrast to IgG/FcRn, no pH-dependent intermolec￾ular salt bridges exist. Furthermore, binding critically depends
upon each of two tryptophan residues inserting into deep hydro￾phobic pockets in HSA, each of which can also be occupied by
natural ligands that compete with hFcRn binding.
Several groups have described IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 variants
with increased affinity for hFcRn at pH 6.0 (Ghetie et al., 1997;
Dall’Acqua et al., 2002; Hinton et al., 2004, 2006; Petkova
et al., 2006; Yeung et al., 2009; Stapleton et al., 2011). Some
of these show increased half-lives in animals and humans, and
a number have been exploited pharmaceutically (Kuo and
Aveson, 2011). The high-affinity HSA variant used in the structure
was one of several we obtained that showed up to a 300-fold
increase in hFcRn affinity at pH 6. We therefore also evaluated
whether high-affinity HSA variants also had increases in their
circulating half-lives. We find that in both rodents and nonhuman
primates, circulating half-lives increased significantly, by >50%.
RESULTS
Isolation of High-Affinity HSA Variants
HSA is composed of three structurally related domains (DI–DIII),
each composed of subdomains A and B connected by long
intradomain loops (Figure S1B), with DIII being key for FcRn
interaction (Chaudhury et al., 2006; Andersen et al., 2006,
2012; Curry et al., 1998). To isolate variants with increased
affinity, we employed a modified version of a yeast secretion
and capture system (Rakestraw et al., 2006) in which HSA is
expressed as a fusion to the high-affinity antifluorescein scFv
4M5.3 (Boder et al., 2000) and captured on the surface of
secreting cells by binding to fluorescein that has been chemically
conjugated to the cell surface (Figure S1C). An HSA library with
random changes in DIII introduced through error-prone PCR
was displayed and sorted by FACS for increased binding to sol￾uble, single-chain hFcRn (schFcRn) at pH 5.5 (Figures 1A and
1B). Progressively higher binding was observed starting in round
three, while maintaining pH dependence (Figure 1C). Sequence
analysis of clones from sorts three through seven showed suc￾cessive enrichment of variants at several positions (Table S1).
We characterized the effect of both single changes and com￾binations on hFcRn affinity by ELISA and SPR at pH 6.0 and 7.4
(Tables S2 and 1; Figure S2). Single mutations increased hFcRn
affinity by up to 3-fold as measured by ELISA, with substantially
higher affinities obtained in combinations suggesting that each
change was acting independently. The highest pH 6.0 affinity
variant, HSA13, has four changes (V418M, T420A, E505G, and
V547A; Figure 1D) and a pH 6.0 KD of 3–8 nM, at least 300-fold
lower than that of wild-type HSA (Tables 1 and S2; Figure S2).
Overall Structure of the Complex
We purified complexes of hFcRn/HSA and hFcRn/HSA13, but
crystals were obtained only with HSA13, at pH 4.9, and we
solved its structure by molecular replacement to a 2.4 A˚

FcRn Mimics Albumin Ligands for Recycling
Structure 21, 1966–1978, November 5, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1967resolution (Figures 2A and S3; Table 2). Albumin is a heart￾shaped, wholly a-helical protein, whereas FcRn is closely related
to MHC class I proteins but with narrowed helices, such that
peptides cannot be accommodated (Figures S1A and S1B;
West and Bjorkman, 2000; Curry et al., 1998; Sugio et al.,
1999). In the complex, the DIII and DI domains of HSA13 make
spatially separated contacts to a single face of hFcRn, with DIII
making a broad contact to the end of the a1a2 platform, the
hinge, and b2m, and DI primarily contacting an exposed face
of the a2 helix (Figures 2A and 2B; Table 3), in total burying
4,068 A˚ 2 of surface area. Compared to ligands of other MHC
class I–like proteins, the a1, hinge, and b2m contact surface of
hFcRn is unique (Adams and Luoma, 2013).
A model of the HSA13/hFcRn/IgG ternary complex using the
available rat FcRn/Fc structure (Martin et al., 2001) shows at
least 24 A˚ between any part of HSA and Fc, and even a rota￾tionally free Fab arm should not be able to come any closer
than 10 A˚ to HSA (Figure 2C). This is consistent with the ability
of FcRn to bind both ligands simultaneously with complete inde￾pendence (Chaudhury et al., 2003, 2006; Andersen et al., 2006).
The Ca backbone of hFcRn shows little movement compared
to two other reported low-pH structures (root-mean-square
deviation [rmsd] of 0.7 A˚ ). On the other hand, HSA is a flexible
protein, whose domains move to accommodate bound ligands
(Ghuman et al., 2005; Curry, 2009). In HSA13, hFcRn binding
induces several movements compared to apo HSA. DI and DIII
have each rotated compared to DII, and furthermore, DIIIB has
rotated with respect to DIIIA, such that the DI–DIIIB distance
across the cleft has increased by 10 A˚ , and the Arg-114/Glu￾520 interdomain salt bridge cannot form (Figure 2D). Individual
DIIIB helices appear to move to maximize complementarity to
hFcRn. The mutation HSAK519E is away from the interface but
eliminates hFcRn binding (Gao et al., 2013), plausibly by stabiliz￾ing the DI–DIII contact via a second interdomain salt bridge with
Arg-186, adjacent to the Arg-114/Glu-520 salt bridge. Despite
these movements, each domain is very similar to the corre￾sponding domain in four other unliganded HSA structures (back￾bone Ca rmsd of 0.6–0.8 A˚ for DI, DII, DIIIA; 1.3–1.4 A˚ for DIIIB). A
major displacement (R2 A˚ ) is seen in the flexible DIIIA–DIIIB con￾necting loop (the DIII loop), discussed further below.
The HSA13/hFcRn Interface
The HSA13/hFcRn interface is markedly hydrophobic (69%
nonpolar; Table 3) with polar contacts scattered throughout (Fig￾ure 2B), consistent with the detergent sensitivity of the interac￾tion (Chaudhury et al., 2003). The DIII interface accounts for
76% of the contacts and 3,076 A˚ 2 of buried surface area,
whereas DI accounts for 24% and 1,045 A˚ 2
, respectively. This
distribution is consistent with the unique ability of isolated HSA
DIII to bind hFcRn (Chaudhury et al., 2006; Andersen et al.,
2013; Kenanova et al., 2010) and reveals a role for DI in
FcRn binding. Interestingly, two loops with high flexibility in
crystal structures (the DIII loop and the loop connecting the
C-terminal helices of DIA Curry, 2009) are involved in FcRn
contacts.
In the DIII contact, the most striking feature is the insertion of
two absolutely conserved (Figure 3B) FcRn tryptophans, Trp￾53 and Trp-59, into deep hydrophobic pockets in DIII (W53
pockets and W59 pockets), burying 180 and 160 A˚ 2 of surface
area, respectively (Figure 2E). Trp-53 and Trp-59 are located in a
loop in the FcRn a1 domain (from Trp-51 to Trp-61) that we name
the WW loop.
The DIII contact can be further subdivided into the DIIIA and
the DIII loop/DIIIB contacts. DIIIA primarily contains the W59
pocket (Figures 2E and 3A) but also makes a number of stabiliz￾ing contacts to the surface of the FcRn a1 helix (Table 3). The
W59 pocket lies at the aliphatic end of the high-affinity FA bind￾ing site 4 (FA4) in DIIIA (Bhattacharya et al., 2000; Simard et al.,
2005), and compared to unbound low-pH FcRn structures, the hFcRna
W59 side chain has to flip and rotate 100 to make this
interaction (Figure 4A). The W59 pocket is wider than both
defatted and fatted structures (by 2 and 1 A˚ , respectively),
but it is not clear whether this is due to W59 insertion or an effect
of two changes in HSA13 that occur near the W59 pocket
(V418M, T420A; see Figure 4A). Met-418 extends the hydropho￾bic surface against which Trp-59 packs, whereas the reduced
side chain of Ala-420, which increases affinity measurably by
itself (Table S2), allows DIIIA helix h3 to move toward DIIIB helix
h2. A V424I mutation, one turn further down than T420A in the
DIIIA-h3 helix, also increases affinity (Table S2), presumably
also through better packing against helix DIIIB-h2.
To confirm the role of Trp-59 in HSA interaction, we replaced
the side chain with another aromatic residue (Phe) or a methyl
group (Ala). Strikingly, hFcRna
W59A abolishes both HSA13 and
HSA binding, whereas the affinity of hFcRna
W59F for both is
reduced, but not eliminated (Figure 4B).
The DIII loop/DIIIB contact contains the W53 pocket (Fig￾ure 2E), and its formation requires a unique displacement of
part of the DIII loop (residues Lys-500 to His-510; the HH loop)
induced by a steric clash with the WW loop of hFcRn (Figure 5C).

Structure 21, 1966–1978, November 5, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1969The W53 pocket lies very close to thyroxine (T4) binding site Tr3
(Figure 4D; Petitpas et al., 2003), and the W53 side chain has a
similar disposition to one ring of T4, having rotated 10–25
compared to unbound hFcRn. In this region, additional HSA13
contacts are made to the WW loop, the a1 platform, a3, and
b2m of hFcRn (Table 3). Notably, only a single side chain in the
HSA13 terminal helix (Lys-573) makes any contact, and that is
one of the two interfacial salt bridges, to b2mGlu-69 (Figure S4A). HSALys-573 is almost unique to humans (being proline in almost
every other species; Figure 3A) and is a sensitive site for hFcRn
affinity (Plumridge et al., 2012).
The HH loop contains one of the four HSA13 changes (E505G),
which in isolation produces a 3-fold affinity improvement (Table
S2). Backbone atoms of Gly-505 make favorable polar contacts
to hFcRna
Ser-230 in the a3 domain and to b2mArg-12, as well as a
nonpolar contact to b2mPhe-22. In wild-type HSA, the large nega￾tive side chain of Glu-505 would reduce complementarity but
likely restore this part of the HH loop to better resemble apo
HSA (Figure S4B). I523G, which increases affinity by 40-fold
(Gao et al., 2013), lies in the helix DIIIB-h2 that forms part of the
W53 pocket. We interpret the positive effect to arise from an
introduced kink in that helix, right under Trp-53, improving its fit.
As with Trp-59, a W53F mutation is well tolerated with only a
modest change in affinity, whereas the loss of the side chain in
a W53A mutant completely abolishes hFcRn binding to both

transverse p-stacking interaction with Phe-509 (Figure 4D).
Mutational analysis supports the importance of this contact in
complex stability. An F509M mutation in HSA, which would
lose the stacking interaction and alter the packing in the pocket,
has a 30-fold reduction in FcRn binding, whereas the tryptophan
side chain in an F509W mutation would directly compete with
Trp-53, and abolishes hFcRn binding (Gao et al., 2013).

showing that this contact is overall not highly conserved. Nonetheless, because hFcRn has higher affinity than mFcRn for either HSA or mouse SA (Andersen
et al., 2010), the systematic superiority of hFcRn could be due to some of these changes.

between DIA-h4 and DIA-h5 and the a2 helix of FcRn (Figure 2F).
His-161 could make a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl
of hFcRna
E82. However, mutation of His-161 to Ala has little effect
on HSA binding (Table S3; Andersen et al., 2012), and H161 is
poorly conserved (Figure 3B), failing to support a role in pH
sensing.
Mechanism of pH-Dependent Binding
The WW loop of hFcRn makes no HSA contacts via residues pre￾dicted to change their ionization state across the pH 6.0–7.4
range, but the loop itself is stabilized in hFcRn by a protonated
hFcRna
His-166, anchoring a network of hydrogen bonds (Fig￾ure 5A). His-166 is absolutely conserved in FcRn (Figure 3B)
but also makes no direct HSA contact. Protonation of His-166
has been previously identified as a candidate part of the pH
sensor (Chaudhury et al., 2006; Andersen et al., 2006), and its
effect on the WW loop has been noted (Andersen et al., 2012).
Both hFcRna
H166F and hFcRna
H166A abolish wild-type HSA bind￾ing and reduce HSA13 affinity >100-fold (Figure 5B).
The HH loop is anchored at each end by a series of hydrogen
bonds and p-cation interactions involving protonated HSA histi￾dines at 510 and 535 (Figures 5C–5E), both of which are
absolutely conserved (Figure 3A). HSAH510 forms the sole inter￾molecular, potentially pH-sensitive interaction as a p-cation
contact to the absolutely conserved hFcRna
W176 residue (Figures
5D and 3B), though mutation of hFcRna
W176 to leucine reduces
binding affinity only 3-fold (Figure 5B). All other His-510 and
His-535 interactions are intramolecular and likely act to stabilize
the HH loop. Consistent with this, mutation of His-510 or His-535
in HSA13 to Phe results in 10- and 30-fold losses of affinity for
hFcRn, respectively, whereas in wild-type HSA, H535F nearly
eliminates hFcRn binding (Figure 5F).
NMR studies have shown that in DIII at pH 6, only two of the
four histidines will be protonated (Bos et al., 1989; Labro and
Janssen, 1986), which we propose to be His-510 and His-535
(see Supplemental Discussion). Mutational studies have shown
that changes at His-464 also reduce hFcRn affinity (Table S3;
Andersen et al., 2012). However, His-464 contacts Trp-59 in
the W59 pocket and is buried in a hydrophobic environment.

Structure
FcRn Mimics Albumin Ligands for Recycling
1972 Structure 21, 1966–1978, November 5, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reservedWe interpret the effect of His-464 mutations to be disruption of
the W59 pocket.
Our model for the pH-dependent interaction of hFcRn and
HSA thus proposes that at pH 7.4, the WW loop is unstructured,
and the HH loop is loosely structured. Upon shift to pH 6.0,
hFcRna
His-166 protonates and stabilizes the WW loop, holding
Trp-53 and Trp-59 at the hFcRn surface. At the same time,
HSAHis-510 and HSAHis-535 become fully protonated and anchor
the HH loop in a more ‘‘open’’ position. Interaction is stabilized
by hFcRna
W59 rotation into the W59 pocket, the DI contact, and
HSAHis-510 binding to hFcRna
Trp-176. Finally, the hFcRna3 and
b2m interaction with DIIIB and the DIII loop rotates DIIIB ‘‘up,’’
fully opening the W53 pocket and allowing hFcRna
Trp-53 insertion
(Figure 5G).
In this model, the main barrier to neutral pH binding will be the
cost of stabilizing the WW loop and opening the HH loop. We
would therefore predict that changes that increase binding at
pH 6.0 by strengthening existing contacts would also increase
affinity at pH 7.4. Indeed, all four variants evaluated by SPR
had measurable hFcRn affinity at pH 7.4 (Figure S2; Table 1).

Structure
FcRn Mimics Albumin Ligands for Recycling
Structure 21, 1966–1978, November 5, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1973Fc mutations that increase the affinity of hIgG1 for hFcRn typi￾cally have a proportionate effect on binding across all pHs
(Yeung et al., 2009). However, the HSA variants reported here
show that the relationship between pH 6.0 and pH 7.4 binding
can be uncoupled for HSA (compare HSA11 and HSA7; Table 1).
hFcRn Competition with Ligands
Based on a superposition of 35 structures with FA present in
FA4, Trp-59 should be unable to rotate into its pocket in the pres￾ence of C16 or C18 lipids (Figure 4A). Similarly, based on a
superposition of three structures with T4 present in Tr3, Trp-53
should be unable to insert into the W53 pocket in the presence
of T4 (Figure 4D), suggesting that both key FcRn interactions
may be compromised in the presence of certain SA ligands.
We therefore tested the ability of FA to compete with hFcRn
binding to HSA at pH 6.0. Strikingly, C18:1 abolished and
C16:0 strongly reduced hFcRn binding, whereas C12:0 had a
lesser effect (Figure 4C), revealing that the recycling efficiency
of FA-bound HSA is likely to be lower than that of ligand-free
HSA. Due to the low aqueous solubility of T4 and its low affinity
for HSA, we were not able to demonstrate the corresponding
effect at the W53 pocket. Thus, one means of delivering ligands
to cells may be via nonsalvage followed by lysosomal degrada￾tion of albumin.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis of HSA Variants
For IgGs, increasing FcRn affinity can increase their circulating
half-life, although the relationship is not strict (Gurbaxani et al.,
2006; Wang et al., 2011; Datta-Mannan et al., 2007, 2012;
Gurbaxani et al., 2013). Thus, we examined the half-lives of
some of our HSA variants in mice and primates. In wild-type
C57BL/6 mice, HSA7, HSA11, and HSA13 had increases of
129%, 50%, and 69% in the elimination half-life, t1/2, compared
to HSA, respectively, whereas HSA5 was more similar to HSA
(Figure 6A; Table 4). In C57BL/6 FcRn knockout mice transgenic
for hFcRn (Petkova et al., 2006), on the other hand, HSA5 and
HSA7 showed 52% and 48% increases, respectively, in t1/2,
whereas HSA11 and HSA13 had reduced t1/2 and elevated clear￾ance due to an antibody response (Figure 6B; Table 5), possibly
arising from higher pH 7.4 hFcRn affinity (Table 1; Liu et al.,
2011). In macaques, HSA7 showed an increase of 53% in t1/2
and a 41% reduction in clearance compared to wild-type HSA
(Figure 6C; Table 6). Thus, as for IgGs, increased affinity for
hFcRn at pH 6.0 increases the circulating half-life.
DISCUSSION
The features of the low-pH HSA13/hFcRn complex reported
here are likely to be the same as for wild-type HSA, based on
the analogous effects of mutations in hFcRn on both, the location
of the changes in HSA that increase affinity, and the similar
effects of mutations in either the wild-type or HSA13 back￾grounds. The overall architecture of the complex readily
accounts for the high entropic gain in forming the HSA/hFcRn
complex (Chaudhury et al., 2006) by its dependence on hydro￾phobic interactions. However, there were several unexpected
features of the interface. First was its extensiveness, given the
low affinity of wild-type HSA, and the absence of any meaningful
direct pH-dependent contacts compared, for example, to the
IgG1-FcRn interface, which features two (human) or three (rat)
titratable salt bridges and is half the size (Martin et al., 2001).
Instead, a fundamentally ionic shift results in the elaboration of
a hydrophobic surface that provides most of the energy, with a
prominent use of aromatic side chains to make profound hydro￾phobic contacts or engage in p interactions. The larger interface
and the more complex interaction of HSA with hFcRn over that of
IgG could be argued as support for a more ancient origin of the
SA/FcRn interaction.
Second was the site overlap and competition between natural
ligands and hFcRn, implicating bound ligands as direct control￾lers of the circulating half-life of HSA, and perhaps SA in general,
and nonsalvage as a means to deliver ligands to cells.
For example, bound lipid, metals, hemin, bilirubin, or T4 could
be delivered to cells following lysosomal degradation of SA,
but it is not clear what the overall capacity of this would be. In
normal plasma, the mole ratio of FA to HSA is 0.5–1.0 (Nielsen

Structure
FcRn Mimics Albumin Ligands for Recycling
1974 Structure 21, 1966–1978, November 5, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reservedet al., 1997), implying that perhaps 50% of circulating HSA will
be lipid-free, given multiply lipidated HSA species. However,
elevated FAs after meals, fasting, or exercise or in diabetes
can increase the ratio to well above 1 (Brodersen et al., 1990),
which, based on the results presented here, should result in
more HSA turnover and perhaps also more lipid delivery to cells.
Mutations that affect ligand binding at these sites might therefore
also affect recycling without affecting FcRn affinity. Intriguingly,
the natural albumin variant Casebrook (D494N, not in the inter￾face) binds eight times more lipid than wild-type (Nielsen et al.,
1997) and has about one-half the circulating concentration
(Peach and Brennan, 1991). Furthermore, ligands bound to
Drug Site 2 displace FAs from FA4 (Simard et al., 2005; Liu
et al., 2005), suggesting that drug binding may also influence re￾cycling efficiency.
HSA is recycled inefficiently because of hFcRn saturation (Kim
et al., 2007); in people with analbuminemia, nonsaturating doses
of HSA exhibit half-lives of 50–100 days (Bennhold and Kallee,
1959). Increasing the low-pH affinity of HSA for hFcRn can
increase its circulating half-life, but improving on-rates may be
the more effective path to outcompete wild-type HSA. General
improvements in affinity run the risk of acquiring neutral pH bind￾ing, but HSA appears to be able to uncouple its pH 7.4 and 6.0
hFcRn affinities. Together, this suggests that it may be possible
to achieve even longer half-life gains than those reported here by
further increasing the affinity for hFcRn at low pH with the appro￾priate counterselection at pH 7.4. The large contact surface
suggests that there will be a breadth of options available to influ￾ence the affinity via gain, loss, or tuning of contacts.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
DNA Constructs
The 4M5.3 S. cerevisiae display vector comprised the high-affinity antifluores￾cein scFv 4M5.3 (Boder et al., 2000) with an N-terminal app8 leader sequence
(Rakestraw et al., 2009) and C-terminal (G4S)3 linker followed by cloning sites,
an hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA), and stop codon, in a variant
pYC2/CT expression vector (Life Technologies) with TRP1 replacing URA3.
The 4M5.3-HSA library backbone was generated by cloning the DI and DII
domains of HSA cDNA (OriGene) into the 4M5.3 display vector. Expression
of mature HSA variants in yeast used the app8 leader sequence in an unmod￾ified pYC2/CT vector. For in vivo studies in primates, a HA tag was added to
the N terminus of HSA in the preceding constructs by QuikChange mutagen￾esis (Agilent).
The schFcRn construct comprised b2m fused to the extracellular domain of
the FcRn a chain through a (G4S)3 linker as described previously by Feng et al.
(2011), flanked by an N-terminal IL-2 leader sequence and C-terminal FLAG
tag. To generate material for binding studies, the above ORF minus the tag
was subcloned into a variant of the pTT5 expression vector (NRCC) containing
a C-terminal FLAG/His tag. A cDNA encoding mouse single-chain FcRn was
also synthesized and cloned into the pTT5-FLAG/His vector as above except
that the native murine b2m leader sequence was used. For crystallography
material, the pTT5 ORF was subcloned into pLVX (Clontech). HSA and FcRn
point mutants were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis or overlap
extension PCR.
Protein Expression and Purification
FLAG-tagged schFcRn was expressed in FreeStyle CHO cells and purified on
an M2 anti-FLAG affinity column. For yeast selections, the protein was
biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reagent. FLAG/His-tagged schFcRn
used in ELISA and SPR studies was expressed in HEK293-6E cells. Proteins
were purified with Ni-NTA affinity resin, and additional polishing was per￾formed as needed on a Superdex 75 column. For crystallography material,
His-tagged schFcRn was expressed in HEK293-6E cells in a 50-liter BIOSTAT
CultiBag system with a 25-liter working volume. Protein was purified on a
high-performance Ni-Sepharose column.
HSA was expressed in BJ5a yeast and purified from the supernatant using a
CaptureSelect HSA affinity column. For in vivo studies, HSA variants were
further purified on a PorosHQ anion exchange column to remove endotoxin.
Additional details can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Library Generation and Induction
PCR mutagenesis and library generation in yeast were performed as described
previously by Chao et al. (2006). DIII was amplified using primers that added
50 bp of homology with the flanking sequences of the DII domain and
C-terminal vector, mixed with linearized 4M5.3-HSA library backbone, and
electroporated into BJ5a.

Structure 21, 1966–1978, November 5, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1975Secretion and capture of the 4M5.3-HSA library were performed similarly to
previously described protocols (Rakestraw et al., 2006). Induced cells were
labeled with 100 mg/ml NHS-PEG3500Da-Fluorescein for 30 min at RT and incu￾bated in a static culture at 20C for 14–16 hr. Additional details can be found in
the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
FACS Selections
Libraries were simultaneously labeled for schFcRn binding and HSA display
level. For selection rounds one to four, 20 nM biotinylated schFcRn-FLAG
was preloaded onto 5 nM Streptavidin-APC (Life Technologies) to form tetra￾mers prior to incubating with the cells. For rounds five to seven, monomeric
biotinylated schFcRn was incubated with the cells followed by detection
with NeutrAvidin-DyLight-650 (1:5,000; Pierce). In all rounds, cells were
labeled for display with an anti-HA primary antibody (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich)
followed by a PE-Cy7-conjugated antimouse secondary (1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). All labeling and wash steps were performed in PBS plus
0.1% fish gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) (pH 5.5). Libraries were run on a FACSAria
III cell sorter, and cells with high schFcRn binding (APC signal) relative to
display (PE-Cy7 signal) were selected and regrown in SDCAA plus uracil
with citrate buffer (pH 4.5).
Crystallization and Structure Determination
HSA13/schFcRn complex was formed by combining approximately equal
molar amounts of HSA13 and His-tagged schFcRn, dialyzing overnight, and
isolated on a Superdex (S200) gel filtration column. Complex stoichiometry
was confirmed by SEC-MALS.
Crystals were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 293K.
Preliminary microcrystals were microseeded to optimize crystallization.
Diffraction quality crystals grew within 3–4 weeks. Prior to data collection,
crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor containing 20% glycerol and flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more
details.
Data were collected at 0.9782 A˚ and 100K at beamline CMCF-08ID of the
Canadian Light Source using a MARCCD detector. Images were processed
with XDS and XSCALE (Kabsch, 2010). Crystals belong to the space group
P21212 with two complexes per ASU and 58% solvent. A data set extending
to 2.4 A˚ was used for structure determination (Table 2).
The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program
Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007) using structures of HSA and hFcRn (Protein
Data Bank [PDB] 1AO6 and 3M17) as search models. Subsequent model
rebuilding and refinement were performed in several cycles using Coot
(Emsley et al., 2010) and CCP4 (Murshudov et al., 1997). TLS refinement (using
REFMAC5, CCP4; Murshudov et al., 1997) was applied, resulting in lower R
factors and higher-quality electron density maps. Statistics of the final struc￾ture are listed in Table 2. Contact maps and buried surface area values were
calculated using the Protein Interfaces, Surfaces, and Assemblies server
(Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). Structural figures were prepared using PyMOL
(Schro¨ dinger). Atomic coordinates and structure factor amplitudes for the
structures have been deposited in the PDB (PDB 4K71).
Affinity Measurements
ELISAs
Purified HSA variants were coated on EIA plates, and FLAG/His-tagged
schFcRn was added at various concentrations in triplicate. Bound FcRn
was detected with anti-FLAG-HRP. The background signal measured
on wells with no immobilized HSA was subtracted from each reading,
and the resulting values were fitted to an equilibrium KD model: Abs =
(Max 3 [FcRn]/([FcRn] + KD). For additional details, see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Surface Plasmon Resonance
Studies were performed on a Reichert Technologies SR7000DC spectrometer.
schFcRn, scmFcRn, or HSA-WT was immobilized on 500 kDa carboxymethyl
dextran chips (Reichert) via standard amine coupling with 20 mg/ml protein in
10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 to densities of 1,700, 1,700, and 3,500 RU,
respectively. Serial dilutions of HSA or scFcRn variants in PBS plus 0.005%
Tween 20 (pH 6.0 or 7.4), were injected at 25C with a 50 ml/min flow rate
and data collected over time. The surface was regenerated between runs
with PBS-T (pH 7.4). Reference cell values and signal from buffer injection con￾trols were subtracted, and the sensorgram traces were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir
binding model using Scrubber2 software (BioLogic) to calculate ka, kd, and KD
values. For studies examining the effect of FA loading, sodium laurate (TCI
America), sodium palmitate, or sodium oleate (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved
in ddH20 at 70C, then added to delipidated HSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS to
a final concentration of 2 mM FA/200 mM HSA. The FA:HSA mixture was
incubated at 37C for 60 min, then filtered through a 0.2 mm membrane and
buffer exchanged into PBS (pH 6.0). FA-loaded HSA was flowed over an
schFcRn-coated chip at a 10 mM concentration and the binding signal
recorded over time.
In Vivo Studies
Mouse
PK studies were performed in C57BL/6 mice and Fcgrt/ C57BL/6 mice
homozygous for a transgene bearing the human gene (Jackson Laboratory;
strain 4919). Eight- to 9-week-old female mice weighing 16–19 g were divided
into groups (n = 3) with approximately equal average weights. Mice were anes￾thetized using isoflurane and injected intravenously in the retro orbital venus
plexus with 50 ml of HSA or HSA variants at 1 mg/ml in PBS (pH 7.4). At
selected times postinjection, 25 ml of blood was collected via tail nick and
mixed with citrate phosphate dextrose at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. All experiments
and procedures were conducted in accordance with Eleven Biotherapeutics’
Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committees protocol and guidelines.
Cynomolgus
PK studies were performed in male monkeys weighing 4.5–7.2 kg (Sinclair).
Prebleeds were drawn from all potential animals and screened for the pres￾ence of preexisting antibodies against HA-tagged HSA molecules by ELISA.
Selected animals were divided into groups with approximately equal average
weights (n = 6 for 1 mg/kg HA-HSA; n = 2 for all other groups) and injected with
a 1 or 5 mg/kg IV bolus dose of HA-HSA or HA-HSA7 in PBS. At selected times,
blood samples were drawn from each animal via direct venipuncture of the
femoral vein into a 3 ml K3-EDTA tube. All experiments and procedures
were reviewed and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
prior to procedure initiation. All studies were conducted according to the
Animal Welfare Act.
PK Assays
For mouse samples, anti-HSA antibody was coated on EIA plates; plasma
samples were diluted and added to wells at various final dilutions. A standard
curve was included on each plate with purified HSA. Bound HSA was detected
with anti-HSA-HRP. The background signal from wells with no plasma sample
was subtracted, and the standard curve on each plate was fitted to an
equilibrium KD model: Abs = (Max 3 [HSA])/([HSA] + KD). The plasma HSA

KD/(Max  Abs) using the dilutions that fell within the linear range of the stan￾dard curve. Anti-HSA immune responses in the animals were measured by
titrating mouse plasma samples on HSA-coated plates and detecting bound
antibody with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse-IgG antibody (1:1,000; Rockland).
For primate samples, ELISAs were performed similarly to above except that
plates were coated with anti-HA capture antibody. See Supplemental Experi￾mental Procedures for additional details.
PK Analysis
All PK values other than terminal half-lives were computed using in-house
software implementing standard noncompartmental analysis methods (Gabri￾elsson and Weiner, 2007). Terminal half-lives were computed by fitting to a
biexponential model using the NLINFIT function in MATLAB 2010a. Statistical
comparisons for PK data were computed using an unpaired two-tailed t test for
populations with unequal variances as implemented by the TTEST2 function in
MATLAB 2010a.
