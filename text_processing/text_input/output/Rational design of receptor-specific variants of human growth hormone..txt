ABSTRACT Human growth hormone (hGH) binds to both
the growth hormone (GH) and the prolactin (PRL) receptors.
Competition experiments followed by mutational analysis show
that the epitope on hGH for hPRL receptor consists of strong
determinants in the middle of helix 1 (comprising residues
His-18, His-21, and Phe-25), a loop region (including Ile-58,
Ser-62, and Asn-63), and the central portion of helix 4 (con￾taining residues Arg-167, Lys-168, Lys-172, Glu-174, Phe-176,
and Arg-178). When these residues are mapped on a structural
model of hGH, they form a patch that overlaps but is not
identical to that previously determined for the hGH receptor.
Three of these side chains (His-18, His-21, and Glu-174) are
ligands for binding Zn2+, which is required for high-affinity
hGH-hPRL receptor complex formation. By introducing pairs
of mutations into hGH that exploit the zinc dependency for
hPRL receptor binding and remove side chains in the nonover￾lapping regions, we have shifted the binding preference toward
the hGH receptor by a factor of 34,000 or toward the hPRL
receptor by a factor of 150 without substantial loss in binding
affinity for the preferred receptor. The energetic effects of the
individual mutations are additive within the double mutants,
suggesting that each functions independently and does not
introduce gross perturbations in structure. Such receptor￾selective variants of hGH should be useful molecular probes to
link specific receptor binding events to the various biological
activities of hGH.
Human growth hormone (hGH) elicits a myriad of biological
effects including linear growth, lactation, nitrogen retention,
diabetogenic and insulin-like effects, and macrophage acti￾vation (1-4). Each of these effects begins with the interaction
of hGH with specific cellular receptors (5). Thus far, the only
cloned human genes whose products bind hGH are the hGH
receptor from liver (6) and the human prolactin (hPRL)
receptor from mammary gland (7). However, there may be
other receptors that bind hGH, including the placental lac￾togen (PL) receptor (8).
The hGH and hPRL receptors (6, 7) contain an extracel￾lular hormone binding domain (consisting of 246 and 211
residues, respectively) that share 32% sequence identity, a
single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain
that differs widely in sequence and length. Nonglycosylated
forms of the extracellular binding domains of the hGH and
hPRL receptors (hGHbp and hPRLbp, respectively) can be
expressed in large quantities in Escherichia coli. These highly
purified recombinant binding proteins retain the same affinity
for hGH and specificity as their natural glycosylated coun￾terparts (9, 10) and are extremely useful reagents for efficient
assessment of the binding affinity for mutants of hGH (9-13).
It is not known whether the binding sites on hGH for the
hGH and hPRL receptors are identical or which receptor (or
combination of receptors) is responsible for which pharma￾cological effect. To address these issues, we have mapped
binding determinants on hGH for the hGH and hPRL recep￾tors and showed that they overlap but are not identical. Using
this information, we designed receptor-specific variants of
hGH that should be useful as probes to link binding to either
receptor with particular biological activities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The hGHbp and hPRLbp were expressed in E. coli and
purified on hGH affinity columns (9, 10). Mutants of hGH
were produced by site-directed mutagenesis (14) as described
(10-12). The mutated hormones were expressed in E. coli (15)
and purified by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation to 60o% homoge￾neity (11). Control experiments show that the residual E. coli
contaminants do not affect the binding assays, which are
performed at high dilution of the mutated hGH analog and in
the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin.
The binding constants for variants of hGH to the hGHbp
were measured by competitive displacement of 1251-labeled
hGH (1251-hGH) from the hGHbp as described (6, 9-12). A
monoclonal antibody to the hGHbp (mAb5, obtained from
Agen, Parsippany, NJ; ref. 16) was used to precipitate the
1251-hGHIhGHbp complex. Zinc-dependent binding of the
hGH mutants to the hPRLbp was measured by competitive
displacement of 1251-hGH as described for the hGHbp (6, 9)
except that assays included 50 AM ZnCl2 and 10 mM MgCl2
(10). Zinc-independent binding was measured by identical
methods except 1251-hPRL was used as the labeled ligand,
since it binds hPRLbp tightly in the absence ofZn2+ (10). This
assay buffer included 1 mM EDTA without ZnCl2 or MgCl2.
Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against
the hPRLbp were used to precipitate the 125I-hGH hPRLbp
complex (10). Under these conditions, hGH forms a 1:1
complex with either the hGHbp or hPRLbp.
RESULTS
The hPRL and hGH Receptor Binding Sites on hGH Overlap
but Are Not Identical. Previous studies have shown that the
binding affinity of hGH to the hPRLbp is enhanced >8000-
fold in the presence of ZnCl2 (10). The hPRLbp is able to
competitively displace the hGHbp from hGH with an IC50 of
120 pM (Fig. 1). This value is in close agreement with the Kd
measured by direct binding of hGH to the hPRLbp in 25 ,M
ZnCl2 (10). Higher concentrations of ZnCI2 (50 AM) promote
slightly stronger binding between hGH and the hPRLbp (Kd
= 38 pM; Table 1); however, such concentrations of ZnCI2
reduce the affinity ofhGH for the hGHbp by a factor of4 (10).
Thus, we chose a zinc concentration of 25 ,M to mitigate the
inhibition of hGH binding to the hGHbp while allowing zinc
to promote tight binding of hGH to the hPRLbp. The fact that

FIG. 1. Competition between hGH and hPRL binding proteins for
binding to 125I-hGH. The concentrations of 1"I-hGH and purified
hGHbp (9) were fixed at a subsaturating level (80 pM). Increasing
concentrations of purified hPRLbp (10) were added and the three
components were allowed to reach equilibrium in assay buffer
containing 25,uM ZnC12, 20 mMTris HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.1% (wt/vol)
bovine serum albumin for 12 hr at 25°C. mAbS (16) was added to
precipitate the hGHbp with any 125I-hGH that remained bound to it
as described (6, 9-12). Displacement of 50% 1251-hGHbp occurs at
120 pM hPRLbp. The residual counts not displaced result from the
nonspecific binding of the 1251-hGH label, which occurs in the
absence of added hGHbp.
the hPRLbp and hGHbp compete suggests that their epitopes
on hGH overlap.
Homolog-scanning mutagenesis (11) was used to further
localize the epitope on hGH for the hPRLbp (Table 1). In this
approach, variants of hGH that contained segment substitu￾tions (7-30 residues long) derived from a nonbinding ho￾molog, pGH, or binding-competent homologs, hPRL and
hPL, were analyzed for binding to the hPRLbp. As expected,
virtually all of the substitutions tested from the binding￾competent hormones, hPRL and hPL, do not disrupt binding
to hPRLbp. The only exception is hPRL residues 22-33,
which causes a 15-fold reduction in binding affinity to the
hPRLbp. In contrast, the hGH mutants containing segments
of pGH-namely, pGH residues 11-33 and pGH residues
57-73-cause large disruptions in binding affinity for the
hPRLbp, whereas pGH residues 48-52 have no effect. Thus,
binding to the hPRLbp is very sensitive to mutations in hGH
near the central portion of helix 1 and the loop region between
residues 57 and 73.
Several of the segment substituted variants cause substan￾tial changes in receptor binding preference (Table 1), sug￾gesting that the hPRL and hGH receptor epitopes are not
identical. For example, the binding affinity of variants sub￾stituted with hPRL residues 22-33 or pGH residues 11-33 are
18- and 130-fold lower, respectively, for the hPRLbp than for
the hGHbp. In contrast, the hPL residues 56-64 and hPRL
residues 54-74 have almost no effect on binding to the
hPRLbp, yet they weaken binding to the hGHbp by factors
of 30 and 69, respectively. These preferential receptor bind￾ing effects for the hGH mutants coupled with their unaltered
binding properties for a number ofmonoclonal antibodies (11)
indicate that reductions in receptor binding affinity are
caused by local and not global structural changes in the
variant hormones.
High-Resolution Functional Map, of the hPRL R
Bing Site. We next identified specific side chains in hGH
that strongly modulate binding to the hPRLbp by alanine￾scanning mutagenesis (Table 2). In addition to analyzing the
two regions implicated by homolog scanning to be involved
in binding, we also scanned the helix 4 region because it is
located between helix 1 and the 54-74 loop region (Fig. 2) and
had previously been shown to contain a number of residues
that strongly modulate hGH affinity for the hGHbp (12). The
alanine substitutions causing a >4-fold reduction in binding
affinity to the hPRLbp are in the central portion of helix 1
(including residues His-18, His-21, and Phe-25), a loop region
(including Ile-58, Asn-63, and Ser-62), and the middle ofhelix
4 (comprising Arg-167, Lys-168, Lys-172, Glu-174, Phe-176,
and Arg-178). These 12 residues form a patch when mapped
on a structural model of hGH (Fig. 2A). The most disruptive
alanine substitutions in helix 1 and helix 4 project in the same
direction as shown by the helix wheel diagrams.

Mutants of hGH produced by homolog-scanning mutagenesis (11) are named according to the extremes of the segment substituted from the
various hGH homologs: pGH, hPL, or bPRL. The exact description ofthe mutations introduced is given by the series of single mutants separated
by slashes. The mutants were purified and their binding constants to the cloned hPRLbp were determined. The relative reductions in binding
affinities [Kd(mut)/Kd(hGH)I reported for the hGH variants with the hGHbp are from ref. 11. The change in receptor preference was calculated
by dividing the ratio of the relative reduction in binding affinity for the hPRLbp by that for the hGHbp. WT, wild type; SD, standard deviation.

Data for the reduction in binding affinity to the hGHbp are from
refs. 12 and 13. The binding constants for the single mutants H21A,
F25S, D26E, and R178A are 0.15 ± 0.01, 0.29 ± 0.02, 0.37 ± 0.01,
and 27 ± 8 nM, respectively. These values compare to the Kd for
wild-type hGH of 0.46 ± 0.03 nM to the hGHbp determined here.
WT, wild type; ND, not determined.
Three residues (His-18, His-21, and Glu-174) along with
His-188 from the hPRLbp are proposed to comprise the
binding site for Zn2+ that is required for tight binding of hGH
to the hPRLbp (10). For example, in the absence of zinc the
alanine mutants of the zinc ligands in hGH have essentially
the same affinity for the hPRLbp as does wild-type hGH.
Here, we extend these studies (Table 3) and show that the

Binding affinities for each mutant were determined. The data for
binding in 50 AM ZnCl2 are from Table 2. The relative (rel) reductions
in binding attributed to effects on zinc coordination are calculated as
{[Kd(mut, zinc)]/[Kd(WT, zinc)]}/{[Kd(mut, EDTA)]/[Kd(WT,
EDTA)]}. WT, wild type.
residues near the zinc site (R167A and K172A) are partially
mitigated by removal of the zinc with EDTA.t Thus, R167A
and K172A give large reductions (770- and 220-fold, respec￾tively) for zinc-mediated hPRLbp affinity but show substan￾tially smaller losses in binding (36- and 30-fold, respectively)
in the presence of 1 mM EDTA. In contrast, mutations at
nearby hydrophobic sites, 158A and F176A, give the same
reductions in hPRLbp affinities whether measured in the
presence or absence of Zn2+. These data suggest that the
disruptive effects of R167A and K172A are caused partly by
perturbations in the zinc site.
Design of Receptor-Specific Variants of hGH. The high￾resolution functional data show that the hGHbp and hPRLbp
epitopes (Fig. 2 A and B) overlap but do not superimpose. For
example, Ile-58, Lys-172, and Phe-176 are important for
binding to both receptors (Fig. 2C). Other determinants are
more important for binding to the hPRLbp (especially those
involved in the Zn2+ site) and for selective binding of hGHbp
(notably, Phe-10, Glu-56, Asp-171, and Arg-64). These data
suggest that not all of the binding determinants for recogniz￾ing hGH are the same in the hGH and hPRL receptors.
We reasoned that it should be possible to design receptor￾specific variants ofhGH by combining two receptor-selective
single alanine mutants. Indeed, when two single mutants that
preferentially disrupt binding hPRLbp (K168A and E174A)
are combined, the double mutant exhibits a 34,000-fold shift
in preference for binding to the hGHbp (Table 4). The
preference for binding the hPRLbp over the hGHbp can be
enhanced nearly 150-fold by combining R64A and D171A.
These receptor-selective hGH variants (K168A/E174A or
R64A/D171A) do not substantially reduce the affinity for the
preferred receptor (hGHbp or hPRLbp, respectively). It is
also possible to reduce binding to both receptors simultane￾ously. For example, combining K172A and F176A, which
individually cause large reductions in binding affinity to both
receptors, produces much larger disruptions in affinity (500-
to 8000-fold) than either of the two single mutants.
The changes in the free energy of binding (AAGbjnding) upon
introduction of two mutations into hGH are strikingly addi￾tive (Table 5). This suggests that these mutant residues paired
in the multiple mutants function independently and do not
grossly perturb the structure of hGH (for review, see ref. 18).
thGH mutants are designated by the wild-type residue (in single￾letter code) followed by its position in the sequence and the mutant
residue. For example, H18A indicates a mutation where His-18 is
converted to Ala. Multiple mutants are indicated by a series ofsingle
mutants separated by slashes.

DISCUSSION
We have presented a systematic mutational strategy for
identifying residues that modulate binding of hGH to two
different receptors. We determined functionally important
side chains on hGH by scanning-mutational analysis and
showed that the binding epitopes overlap but are not identi￾cal. By mutating the nonoverlap residues, we have produced
analogs of hGH that alter binding to either or both receptors.
Combinations of these mutations have additive effects on
binding and can be used to engineer hGH variants with
altered receptor specificities.
The mutational analyses show that there are significant
differences between the epitopes on hGH for the hGHbp and
hPRLbp (Fig. 2). For example, with Zn2+ bound, the net
charge in the epitope on hGH for the hPRLbp is +5 (defined
by residues causing .4-fold reduction in affinity; Fig. 2A).
This strongly electropositive charge cluster is surrounded by
a series of important hydrophobic residues (Phe-25, Ile-58,
Tyr-164, and Phe-176). Zinc is not required for formation of
the hGH-hGHbp complex and the hGHbp epitope (Fig. 2B)
is notably less electropositive (net charge for residues causing
.4-fold disruptions, +1). The most disruptive alanine sub￾stitution in hGH for the hGHbp was a 58-fold reduction

AAGbinding for the variant relative to wild-type hGH was calculated
from the reduction in binding affinity according to AGbjming = RT
ln[Kd(mut)/Kd(hGH)] and is expressed as kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J).
The values of Kd(mut)/Kd(hGH) for the single or multiple mutant
hormones are from Tables 1-3.
caused by R178A. In contrast, there are five alanine substi￾tutions that reduce binding to the hPRLbp 90- to 770-fold. Of
these, three are at the proposed zinc ligands (H18A, H21A,
and E174A) and two others mutate basic residues (R167A and
K172A). Both R167A and K172A appear to partially disrupt
zinc coordination as shown in Table 3 by the greater reduc￾tion in hPRLbp affinity under conditions of 50 ,u M ZnCl2 (770-
and 220-fold, respectively) compared to those observed in the
presence of 1 mM EDTA (36- and 30-fold, respectively). The
data suggest that the disruptive effects caused by mutating
basic residues near the zinc site (but not hydrophobic resi￾dues) result in part from perturbing the zinc site as well as
breaking direct interactions with the hPRLbp. Thus, the three
zinc ligands and nearby basic residues appear to support
zinc-mediated binding to the hPRLbp, and the large disrup￾tions caused by mutations at any one of these sites affect the
ability of the other four to function in this role.
We have previously shown (12) that the E174A mutation in
hGH enhances binding to the hGHbp by a factor of 4. Here,
we find that H21A enhances binding to the hGHbp by a factor
of 3. Both of these residues are required for zinc-mediated
binding of hGH to the hPRLbp (Fig. 2A). Thus, to maintain
the dual binding role of hGH to the hGH and hPRL receptors,
the hormone has had to compromise binding to the hGH
receptor by incorporating ligands to bind zinc in the over￾lapping epitope for the hPRL receptor.
Residues that cause large changes in receptor binding
affinity may do so by indirect effects. However, we believe
that the majority of the disruptive effects observed here are
due to local structural changes because virtually all of the
single mutants tested retain full binding affinity to eight
different hGH monoclonal antibodies (11, 12). In addition,
the mutants often lead to changes in receptor binding pref￾erence and not global disruptions in affinity for both recep￾tors (Tables 1 and 2).
Two recent studies (19, 20) present some data on the
location of the lactogenic binding site on hGH. Retegui and
coworkers (19) using monoclonal antibodies suggested that
part of the lactogenic site is located in helix 1 (residues 1-32).
Gertler and coworkers (20) showed that deletions in the
amino-terminal portion of helix 1 reduce binding to crude
preparations of somatogenic receptors more than lactogenic
receptors. These studies are consistent with the data pre￾sented here but do not provide a high-resolution functional
map of the lactogenic binding site, nor do they reveal the
importance of specific residues in the 54-74 loop region and
central portion of helix 4 for lactogenic receptor binding.
There are a number of cases similar to hGH, in which two
or more receptors or receptor subtypes are known to exist￾for instance, the adrenergic receptors (21), the insulin-like
growth factor I receptors (22), interleukin 2 receptors (23,
24), and atrial natriuretic peptide receptors (25). In these
situations in which a hormone exhibits broad receptor spec￾ificity it is difficult to link specific receptor function to a
specific pharmacological effect. However, the use of recep￾tor-specific hormone analogs can greatly simplify this task.
For example, catecholamine analogs have been used to
characterize,8-adrenergic receptor subtypes and link specific
receptor function to particular pharmacologic responses (for
review, see ref. 26). By analogy, the receptor-specific vari￾ants ofhGH should be key reagents for probing the role of the
hGH and hPRL receptors in the complex pharmacology of
hGH, and for identifying other receptors for hGH.
