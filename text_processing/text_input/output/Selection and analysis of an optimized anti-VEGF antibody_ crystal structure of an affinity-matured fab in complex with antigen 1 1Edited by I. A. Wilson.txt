The Fab portion of a humanized antibody (Fab-12; IgG form known as
rhuMAb VEGF) to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been
af®nity-matured through complementarity-determining region (CDR)
mutation, followed by af®nity selection using monovalent phage display.
After stringent binding selections at 37 C, with dissociation (off-rate)
selection periods of several days, high af®nity variants were isolated
from CDR-H1, H2, and H3 libraries. Mutations were combined to obtain
cumulatively tighter-binding variants. The ®nal variant identi®ed here,
Y0317, contained six mutations from the parental antibody. In vitro cell￾based assays show that four mutations yielded an improvement of about
100-fold in potency for inhibition of VEGF-dependent cell proliferation
by this variant, consistent with the equilibrium binding constant deter￾mined from kinetics experiments at 37 C. Using X-ray crystallography,
we determined a high-resolution structure of the complex between VEGF
and the af®nity-matured Fab fragment. The overall features of the bind￾ing interface seen previously with wild-type are preserved, and many
contact residues are maintained in precise alignment in the superimposed
structures. However, locally, we see evidence for improved contacts
between antibody and antigen, and two mutations result in increased
van der Waals contact and improved hydrogen bonding. Site-directed
mutants con®rm that the most favorable improvements as judged by
examination of the complex structure, in fact, have the greatest impact on
free energy of binding. In general, the ®nal antibody has improved af®-
nity for several VEGF variants as compared with the parental antibody;
however, some contact residues on VEGF differ in their contribution to
the energetics of Fab binding. The results show that small changes even
in a large protein-protein binding interface can have signi®cant effects on
the energetics of interaction.

Introduction
Angiogenic factors (Folkman & Klagsbrun,
1987), which stimulate endothelial cells leading to
new vascularization, have roles in such disease
states as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and macular
degeneration (reviewed by Ferrara, 1995; Folkman,
1995; Iruela-Arispe & Dvorak, 1997). Vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a heparin-bind￾ing protein initially identi®ed from pituitary cells
(Ferrara & Henzel, 1989), is clearly a key angio￾E-mail address of the corresponding author:

disease states, including the growth of solid tumors
(reviewed by Ferrara, 1999). A murine monoclonal
antibody, A.4.6.1, was found to block VEGF￾dependent cell proliferation in vitro and to
antagonize tumor growth in vivo (Kim et al., 1993).
The murine mAb was previously humanized in
Fab form to yield a variant known as Fab-12
(Presta et al., 1997). Both chimeric and humanized
antibodies retained high af®nity binding to VEGF,
with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant,
Kd
25 
, of 0.9 to 3 nM (Presta et al., 1997; Baca et al.,
1997; Muller et al., 1998a). The corresponding full￾length IgG form of this antibody, rhumAb VEGF,
is being developed as a possible therapeutic agent
for the treatment of human solid tumors (Mordenti
et al., 1999).
We became interested in obtaining higher af®-
nity variants of Fab-12 in order to test whether af®-
nity improvements of this antibody might improve
its potency and ef®cacy. Phage display of random￾ized libraries of antibodies and other proteins has
been extensively used to engineer proteins with
improved af®nity and speci®city (Lowman et al.,
1991; reviewed by Kay & Hoess, 1996; Rader &
Barbas, 1997; Grif®ths & Duncan, 1998). In particu￾lar, a phage-based in vitro af®nity maturation pro￾cess has been successful in improving the binding
af®nity of antibodies previously identi®ed from
traditional monoclonal or naive-library sources
(e.g. Hawkins et al., 1992; Marks et al., 1992; Barbas
et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1995; Schier et al., 1996;
Thompson et al., 1996).
In previous work, the humanized anti-VEGF
antibody Fab-12 was adapted for improved mono￾valent phage display through selection of a CDR￾L1 variant, designated Y0192 (Muller et al., 1998a).
To select target residues for randomization and
af®nity optimization, we also previously screened
all CDR residues, as de®ned by a combination of
the hypervariable (Kabat et al., 1987) and structu￾rally de®ned (Chothia & Lesk, 1987) CDR residues.
Fab variants of Y0192 generated by alanine scan￾ning were analyzed for side-chain contributions to
antigen binding (Muller et al., 1998a). In addition, a
crystal structure of Fab-12 in complex with the
receptor-binding domain of VEGF, VEGF(109), was
determined (Muller et al., 1998a). The results of
these studies showed that the antigen binding site
is almost entirely composed of residues from the
heavy chain CDRs, CDR-H1, H2, and H3. There￾fore, these CDRs appeared most likely to provide
the opportunity for improved binding interactions
with antigen.
Here, we describe the selection of an af®nity￾improved anti-VEGF antibody by phage display
and off-rate selection. We show that the af®nity￾matured antibody binds VEGF with at least 20-fold
improved af®nity and inhibits VEGF-induced cell
proliferation with enhanced potency in a cell-based
assay. We also report the crystal structure of an
af®nity-optimized antibody in complex with
VEGF, to our knowledge, representing the ®rst
reported structure of an in vitro af®nity-matured
antibody:antigen complex. The structure, together
with mutational analysis, shows that subtle
changes in the antibody-antigen interface account
for improved af®nity.
Results
Library design
We used the results of an alanine-scanning anal￾ysis, combined with a crystal structure of the wild￾type Fab fragment in complex with VEGF (Muller
et al., 1998a), to design targeted libraries within the
antibody CDRs for random mutagenesis and af®-
nity selection. This strategy enabled us to construct
theoretically complete libraries with a small num￾ber of residues randomized in each CDR. Although
sites remote from the antigen-combining region or
buried within the protein could modulate antigen
binding af®nity indirectly and have in fact been
exploited for af®nity improvement (Hawkins et al.,
1993), clearly residues shown to be important by
alanine scanning are useful starting points for
binding-af®nity optimization (Lowman et al., 1991;
Lowman & Wells, 1993). Furthermore, we
reasoned that by making mutations at residues of
the antibody CDRs which were known to affect
antigen binding and were located at or near points
of contact in the bound complex, we could mini￾mize the possibility of other indirect effects which
might alter stability, immunogenicity, or other
properties of the antibody.
Both Ala-scanning and crystallography (Muller
et al., 1998a) identi®ed CDR-H3 as the predomi￾nant contact segment for VEGF, consistent with the
general observation that CDR-H3 is often key to
antigen binding (Chothia & Lesk, 1987). Within
CDR-H3, residues Y95, P96, H97, Y98, Y99, S100b,
H100c, W100d, Y100e, and F100f (numbering is as
described by Kabat et al. (1987)), all showed effects
on binding over a range of twofold to >150-fold
when mutated to Ala, and Ala substitution at
S100a caused a slight improvement in binding.
However, H100c, Y100e, and F100f were found to
have little or no direct contact with VEGF and pre￾sumed to have indirect effects on binding. On the
other hand, Y95 and W100d have signi®cant con￾tacts with VEGF, and Ala substitutions resulted in
no detectable binding to VEGF. Therefore, these
residues were excluded from optimization. Inspec￾tion of the complex structure suggested that substi￾tutions at P96 and Y98 could be disruptive to the
antibody structure, while G100, where Ala
mutation had little effect, might tolerate further
substitutions. We therefore constructed a library
(YC81) which fully randomized positions H97,
Y99, G100, S100a, and S100b, within CDR-H3.
Signi®cant effects of Ala substitution were also
found in CDR-H2. Here, W50, I51, N52, T52a, Y53,
T54, T58 alanine mutants all showed >twofold loss
in binding af®nity, with the greatest residue sur￾face area buried at positions W50, I51, Y53, and
866 Structure-function of an Optimized VEGF AntibodyT58 (Muller et al., 1998a). Indeed, W50 along with
other aromatic side-chains was observed to form a
deep pocket into which a loop of VEGF inserts in
the complex, and was excluded from further
optimization. Residue I51, on the other hand,
showed no direct contact with VEGF and was also
excluded. Residue T58 had multiple interactions
within the interface, including contacts with VEGF
and with the critical W50 of the CDR pocket.
Although E56 showed no contact with VEGF and
little effect (<twofold) upon alanine substitution,
its side-chain lies at the periphery of the interface,
near several hydrophobic residues of VEGF. We
reasoned that these might be exploited for
additional binding interactions. Two CDR-H2
libraries were constructed: YC266, randomizing
positions T52a, Y53, T54, and E56; and YC103, ran￾domizing positions N52, T52a, Y53, and T54.
In CDR-H1 G26, Y27, F29, N31, Y32, G33, M34,
and N35 were implicated by alanine mutagenesis
as important for binding VEGF; however, only
N31, Y32, and G33 had signi®cant direct contacts
with VEGF. Since Ala substitution of G33 showed
reduced binding, larger side-chains seemed less
desirable; for this reason, this position was not ran￾domized. Residues 27 (buried in the antibody
structure) and T28 and T30 (which are mutually
contacting) were included at the end of the H1
loop as possible indirect determinants of binding.
Residues 27, 28, and 30-32 were randomized in a
library designated YC265.
Framework residues, especially heavy chain resi￾dues 71 and 93, normally outside the region of con￾tact with antigen, have also been found to affect
antibody binding af®nity (Tramontano et al., 1990;
Foote & Winter, 1992; Hawkins et al., 1993; Xiang
et al., 1995), and sometimes participate in antigen
contacts (reviewed by Nezlin, 1998). Therefore, an
additional region of the anti-VEGF Fab, within FR￾H3 and including position 71, was also targeted for
randomization. Since the residue 71-76 region has
contacts with CDR-H1 (at F29) and CDR-H2 (at I51
and T52a), these represented potential sites for af®-
nity improvement through secondary effects on the
interface residues. Residues L71, T73, and S76 were
randomized in this FR-H3 library.
Phage selections
Fab libraries were constructed using a fusion to
the g3p minor coat protein in a monovalent phage
display (phagemid) vector (Bass et al., 1990;
Lowman et al., 1991). For each library, stop codons
were introduced by mutagenesis into the Y0192
phage template (Muller et al., 1998a) at each resi￾due position to be randomized. Each stop-codon
construct was then used for construction of a fully
randomized (using NNS codons) library as
described in Materials and Methods. Phage were
precipitated from overnight Escherichia coli shake-
¯ask cultures and applied to VEGF-coated immu￾nosorbant plates for binding selections. Cycles of
selection followed by ampli®cation were carried
out essentially as described (Lowman, 1998).
We used an off-rate selection process (see
Materials and Methods) similar to previously
described procedures (Hawkins et al., 1992; Yang
et al., 1995), modi®ed by gradually increasing the
selective pressure for binding to antigen during
successive cycles of enrichment. The enrichment
factor (ratio of displaying phage to non-displaying
phage eluted versus applied) was used to monitor
the stringency of selection at each step (Table 1).
As a control, and to obtain a relative measure of
af®nity improvement, Y0192-phage were subjected
to the same procedure at each cycle.
Fab-phage clones were sequenced from several
phage-binding selection rounds that showed
enrichment for Fab-phage over non-displaying
phage. From round 6 of the CDR-H1 library selec￾tions, a dominant clone, Y0243-1 was found, hav￾ing wild-type residues at Y27, T30, and Y32, and
substitutions T28D and N31H (Table 2). Additional
clones had related sequences, with N31H found in
all selectants; Asp or Glu substituting for T28; and
Thr, Ser, Gln, or Gly found at position T30.

were mixed with non-displaying control phage (chloramphenicol-resistant) in each starting pool, and subjected to VEGF binding
selection, washing, and elution as described in the text.
The enrichment factor for each library is reported here as the ratio of Amp/Cam colony-forming units in the eluted pool, divided
by the ratio of Amp/Cam colony-forming units in the starting pool. Starting phage concentrations were about 1012/ml, except
1013/ml in round 1. The wild-type Fab-phage, Y0192 was included at each round for comparison of enrichment under the particular
conditions used. a In some cases, the wash-step included incubation at 37 C.
Structure-function of an Optimized VEGF Antibody 867Clones from two independently constructed
CDR-H2 libraries were remarkable in that all
sequenced library clones conserved wild-type resi￾dues at virtually all positions mutated, except at
position Y53, where all clones contained a Trp sub￾stitution (Table 3).
Because of the strong enrichment observed from
the CDR-H3 library, a number of clones were
sequenced from rounds 5 and 7 (Table 4). Of 39
sequenced clones, 37 retained the wild-type residue
S100b, and all contained the mutation H97Y. The
remaining positions showed greater diversity, even
after seven cycles of selection. The dominant clone
at round 7, Y0238-3, contained the mutation
S100aT (in addition to H97Y), with wild-type resi￾dues Y99 and G100. Other substitutions observed
included Lys or Arg for Y99 (in 18 of 39 clones),
G100N (11 of 39 clones), and a variety of substi￾tutions including Arg, Glu, Gln, and Asn at S100a.
In this library, the consensus sequence is rep￾resented by the dominant clone, Y0238-1 (Table 4).
Clones from round 6 of the FR-H3 library
(Table 5) showed conservation of wild-type residue
S76, with wild-type residues or various substi￾tutions at the remaining positions: Val or Ile substi￾tuting for L71, and Val or Lys substitutions at T73.
Binding affinity of selected variants
For measurements of binding af®nity, we made
use of an amber stop codon placed between the
genes for the Fab heavy chain and the g3p C-term￾inal domain, and expressed soluble Fab variants
from E. coli shake-¯ask or fermentation cultures.
Fab variants puri®ed from protein-G af®nity chro￾matography were characterized for binding af®nity
using an SPR-based assay on a BIAcoreTM-2000
instrument. The binding-kinetics assay has been
described (Muller et al., 1998a).
Association kinetics (kon) for the wild-type anti￾body binding to immobilized VEGF are slow
(Presta et al., 1997; Baca et al., 1997; Muller et al.,
1998a), and none of the variants tested had signi®-
cantly improved on-rates. On the other hand, dis￾sociation kinetics varied over a range of 10ÿ4 sÿ1
to 44  10ÿ6 sÿ1 at 25 C (Table 6). Based on
measurements of instrumental drift, we could not
accurately measure koff (and consequently Kd)

nity from Y0238-3, which retained Y99.
Affinity improvements from combinations of
CDR mutations
To improve af®nity further, several combinations
of the phage-selected CDR-H1, H2, and H3
mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis
(Table 7). Among these, the highest af®nity was
obtained with pY0313-1 (i.e. pY0192 with
mutations CDR-H1 (T28D/N31H/I34M) and CDR￾H3 (H97Y/S100aT); note I34M is a reversion to
Fab-12 wild-type). From BIAcoreTM kinetics
measurements carried out at 25 C, this Fab variant
had 520-fold higher af®nity than Y0192 (Table 6).
Addition of the Y53W mutation, which alone
produced little or no improvement over Y0192, to
Y0313-1 (producing variant Y0268-1) actually
reduced binding af®nity by >twofold (Table 6).
The ®nal Fab version was constructed by remov￾ing the phage-expression enhancing mutations in
CDR-L1 from pY0313-1 by site-directed mutagen￾Table 6. Binding kinetics of anti-VEGF Fab variants at 25 C

Kinetic constants were determined from measurements using a BIAcoreTM-2000 instrument with a biosensor chip containing
immobilized VEGF(109). Measurements were performed at 25 C. Fab concentrations were calculated from quantitative amino acid
analysis. The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, is calculated form the ratio of the rate constants, koff/kon. The relative af®nity,
reported as Kd(Y0192)/Kd(variant) indicates the fold increase in binding af®nity versus the wild-type humanized antibody Y0192.
Errors in Kd were approximately 25 %. Variant Y0242-1 corresponds to the point mutations Y53W in CDR-H2 of Fab Y0192; for
descriptions of the other variants, see Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. a Data for Y0192 is from Muller et al. (1998a,). b In some cases, the dissociation rate constant observed was at or near the limit of detection; therefore, the reported koff and Kd
are upper limits, and the relative af®nities are an upper limit.

Substitutions are shown relative to Y0192. Fab-12 also contains T221 in the heavy chain. Dashes (-) indicate no substitution. Num￾bering is according to Kabat et al. (1987) for both the light chain (CDR-L1) and heavy chain (CDR-H1, H2, H3).
870 Structure-function of an Optimized VEGF Antibodyesis. The M4L substitution was identi®ed during
phage-humanization experiments (Baca et al.,
1997), and the Leu residue was retained so as to
preclude possible oxidation of the Met side-chain.
The ®rst libraries were constructed from a Fab-12
phagemid derivative, pY0101, which contained a
buried framework mutation, VL(M4L), as well as a
mutation (T221L) at the junction to g3p. Thus the
®nal version, Y0317 (Table 7 and Figure 1) differs
from Fab-12 by the following six mutations:
VL(M4L), VH(T28D/N31H/H97Y/S100aT/T221L).
Each of the CDR mutations in H1 and H3 was
tested for its effect on VEGF binding af®nity by
introducing the corresponding point mutation into
the parental Y0192 Fab and measuring binding kin￾etics. The results (Table 6) show a 14-fold and 3.6-
fold improvement with substitution of H97Y or
N31H, respectively, into the parental Fab. How￾ever, T28D or S100aT had identical af®nity to
Y0192, within experimental error.
We compared Fab-12 and Y0317 Fab af®nities in
a solution binding assay, using VEGF competition
with [125I]VEGF for binding to Fab. The results
showed Fab-12 having Kd
25 
 433 pM and Y0317
Fab having Kd
25 
 20 pM, a 22-fold improvement
in binding af®nity (Figure 2).
Because dissociation kinetics in surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) experiments exceeded instrumen￾tal capabilities at 25 C, and in order to assess bind￾ing af®nity under more physiological conditions,
we compared binding af®nities of the original
humanized antibody Fab-12 with the ®nal variant
Y0317 in kinetics experiments at 37 C. kon and koff
were faster for both antibodies than at 25 C, and
koff was clearly measurable above background.
Using either immobilized VEGF(109) or immobi￾lized VEGF(165), Y0317 was 120-fold to 140-fold
improved in af®nity over Fab-12, with a Kd
37 
of 80-
190 pM (Table 8).
VEGF Ala-scan of the Y0317 binding epitope
In order to understand how mutations in the
Fab affected binding af®nity to VEGF, we also
tested VEGF variants for binding to the af®nity￾improved antibody. For these experiments, we
made use of the full-length IgG forms of Fab-12
(known as rhuMab VEGF) and Y0317 (termed
Y0317-IgG) produced in CHO cells (V. Chisholm,
unpublished results). These VEGF variants were
previously used for mapping the parental anti￾body's binding site on VEGF (Muller et al., 1998a).
In this assay, carried out at 37 C, VEGF com￾peted with biotin-VEGF with an IC50 of 9 nM in
binding rhuMab VEGF, compared with an IC50 of
1 nM for Y0317-IgG (Table 9). SPR measurements
have shown similar af®nity improvement of
Y0317-IgG over rhuMAb VEGF (H. Lowman,
unpublished results).
Alanine mutations of VEGF that affected rhu￾Mab VEGF binding also affected Y0317-IgG. For
example, M81A, G88A, and G92A all caused large
(100 to >500-fold) losses in binding af®nity. And
smaller reductions (3 to 30-fold) in binding af®nity
for both antibodies were seen for I80A, K84A,
I91A, E93A, and M94A.
However, signi®cant differences in the magni￾tude of the effect were observed at certain sites,
including Y45A, fourfold reduced in af®nity for
rhuMAb VEGF versus 26-fold for Y0317-IgG;
Q89A, 19-fold versus sixfold; and M94A, 11-fold
versus 25-fold. Most surprisingly, two mutations
that led to loss of detectable binding af®nity for
rhumAb VEGF (>500-fold) had only modest effects
(four- to ninefold) on binding to Y0317-IgG. These
differences might suggest a shift in the binding epi￾tope of the antibody, and this possibility was
addressed with receptor-inhibition assays and
structural analysis, both described below.
Inhibition of VEGF activity
Cell-proliferation assays have been described
(Fairbrother et al., 1998) for the measurement of
VEGF mitogenic activity on human umbilical vein
endothelial cells. Here, we compared the potency
of Fab-12 and the af®nity-improved variants
Y0238-3 and Y0313-1.
The results (Figure 3) show both variants Y0238-
3 and Y0313-1 inhibit VEGF activity more potently
than Y0192 Fab. Comparing the Fab forms, variant
Y0313-1 appeared at least 30-fold to 100-fold more
potent than the wild-type Fab. In additional exper￾iments, Y0317 activity was similar to that of Y0313-
1 (data not shown). It should be noted that the
amount of VEGF (0.2 nM) used in this assay is
potentially limiting for determination of an accu￾rate IC50 for the mutant. For example, if the bind￾Table 8. Binding kinetics of anti-VEGF Fab variants at 37 C

Kinetic constants were determined by injecting Fab solutions onto a BIAcoreTM-2000 instrument with a biosensor chip containing
approximately 190 RU of immobilized VEGF(109) or VEGF(165), as indicated. The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, is calculated
from the ratio of the rate constants, koff/kon. The relative af®nity, reported as Kd(Fab-12)/Kd(variant) indicates the fold increase in
binding af®nity versus the original humanized antibody (Fab-12; Presta et al., 1997) under the speci®ed conditions.
Structure-function of an Optimized VEGF Antibody 871ing af®nity (Kd) of the mutant is in fact <0.2 nM,
then the IC50 in this experiment will appear higher
than under conditions of lower VEGF concen￾tration. The result therefore supports the con￾clusion that the af®nity-improved variant is at least
30-fold improved in af®nity for VEGF, and that it
effectively blocks VEGF activity in vitro.
Structure of the complex
In order to compare the structure and binding
site of the af®nity-improved antibody with that of
the parental antibody, we determined the complex
structure by X-ray crystallography. Crystals of the
complex between the receptor binding domain of
VEGF (residues 8 to 109) and the af®nity-matured
Fab Y0317 were grown as described (see Materials
and Methods) and diffracted to a maximum resol￾ution of 2.4 AÊ . The structure was re®ned starting
from the coordinates of the complex between
VEGF and the parent of Fab Y0317, Fab-12 (Muller
et al., 1998a), and re®ned to an R-value of 19.9 %
(Rfree  27.4 %) for the re¯ections between 20 AÊ
and 2.4 AÊ resolution.
Figure 1 (legend shown opposite)
872 Structure-function of an Optimized VEGF AntibodyThe ®nal model consists of two Fab fragments
bound to the symmetrical poles of the VEGF
dimer. Only residues 14-107 of each VEGF mono￾mer are well de®ned in the electron density, and
therefore the six N-terminal and the two C-term￾inal residues of each monomer were omitted from
the model. Each Fab light chain comprises residues
1 to 213, with the C-terminal residue disordered,
whereas for each heavy chain residues 138 to 143
as well as the six C-terminal residues are absent
from the model. As in the parental Fab complex,
two out of 1050 residues, namely T51 in the VL
chain of each Fab fragment, are located in the ``dis￾allowed regions'' (Laskowski et al., 1993) of the
Ramachandran plot; 85 % of all residues have their
main-chain torsion angles in the ``most favored''

chain is shown above the sequences; numbering according to Kabat et al. (1987) is shown below. CDR regions are
underlined. Positions at which Y0317 differs from Fab-12 are indicated with double underlining.

51.8 AÊ 2 and the mobility of the individual domains
follows the pattern that was previously observed
in the crystal structure of VEGF in complex with
the Fab-12, with the constant domain dimer
(CL:CH1) of one of the Fabs poorly ordered (Muller
et al., 1998a).
Comparison of the ®nal model with that of the
parental Fab-VEGF complex (Muller et al., 1998a)
shows that the bound structures are very similar
overall (Figure 4(a)) with Y0317 binding to the
same site on VEGF as Fab-12 (Figure 4(b)). Side￾chains show excellent overlap, and the main-chain
structures show very little difference. The most
prominent difference in contact residues is at H97Y
(Figure 4(c); discussed below), where the tyrosine
side-chain packs more favorably with VEGF and a
buried water molecule from the parental Fab￾VEGF complex is absent in the Y0317-Fab-VEGF
complex.
Discussion
Antibody binding selections and
affinity improvement
Here we made use of results from alanine-scan￾ning and the previous structure of a humanized
antibody-antigen complex to design Fab-phage
libraries that randomized the three heavy-chain
CDRs as well as one framework region (FR-H3) for
improving the binding af®nity of an anti-VEGF
antibody. Af®nity-improved Fab variants were
obtained, with the largest effects seen in variants
from the CDR-H3 library, although signi®cant
improvement was also obtained from mutation of
CDR-H1. We therefore combined two mutations
from H1 with two from H3, generating a further
improved variant, Y0317. By making point
mutations, we showed that the 20-fold (Figure 2)

VEGF and (a) Fab-12 or (c) Y0317. Fabs were captured with an anti-Fab antibody-coated immunosorbant plate.
Scatchard analysis (Munson & Rodbard, 1980) with a 1:1 binding model was used to calculate Kd of (b) 433 (116)
pM for Fab-12 and (d) 19.8(4.3) pM for Y0317.

(circles). Cell proliferation was measured by incorpor￾ation of [3
H]thymidine. Curves show four-parameter ®ts
to the data. Each point represents the mean of three
treated wells.
874 Structure-function of an Optimized VEGF Antibodyto >100-fold (Table 8) af®nity improvement in
Y0317 can be attributed to two CDR mutations:
H97Y and N31H. In fact, H97Y alone improves
binding af®nty 14-fold.
Despite the relatively slow kon and slow koff of
the parental antibody, binding selections described
here yielded slower dissociation rates and
improved equilibrium dissociation constants.
Results of SPR measurements demonstrated that
af®nity is enhanced mainly through a slower dis￾sociation rate (as opposed to faster association).
These results are consistent with the idea of off￾rate selection (Hawkins et al., 1992) and with the
progressively increased stringency in washing pro￾cedures used here (see Materials and Methods and
Table 1). Previous binding-optimization efforts
have also often yielded larger improvements in koff
than in kon (see Lowman & Wells, 1993; Yang et al.,
1995; Schier et al., 1996). This may suggest funda￾mental limitations to the improvements in kon for a
given binding site. Even if no conformational
changes need occur between free and bound states,
the on-rate is limited by the size of the binding
interface and the translational and rotational diffu￾sion rates of the binding components (reviewed by
Delisi, 1983).
The association rate constants (kon) for both the
wild-type Y0192 and the ®nal Y0317 antibodies are
relatively slow (about 4  104 Mÿ1 sÿ1 for both)
compared to other antibodies of equal or weaker
antigen binding af®nity. In fact, the fastest kon
identi®ed for any mutant was 6.8  104 Mÿ1 sÿ1
(Table 6). Typically, kon for antibodies binding to
protein antigens, including af®nity-matured anti￾bodies, has fallen in the range of 3  104 to 1  106
Mÿ1 sÿ1 (Karlsson et al., 1991; Malmborg et al.,
1992; Barbas et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1995; Schier
et al., 1996; Wu et al., 1998). In this particular pro￾tein-protein interaction, a likely explanation for the
slow kon is the high degree of ¯exibility associated
with the binding site both on the Fab and on
VEGF. In fact, crystallographic evidence suggests
that the ``80's loop'' region is quite mobile (Muller
et al., 1997; Muller et al., 1998b). We are pursuing
other strategies to assess whether improvements to
kon can be obtained.

ELISA assays were carried out using the full-length IgG form
of Fab-12 or the IgG form of Y0317 and VEGF(109). Incubation
of antibody with VEGF was at 37 C for ®ve hours. The IC50
for inhibition by each Ala mutant was evaluated using a four￾parameter equation, and the relative af®nities calculated as
IC50(mutant VEGF)/IC50(wild-type VEGF). Under these condi￾tions, Fab12-IgG and Y0317-IgG showed IC50 values of 9 nM
and 1 nM, respectively.

Structure-function of an Optimized VEGF Antibody 875    The contributions of point mutations in proteins
to the free energy of binding or activation are often
additive (Wells, 1990). This principle has been used
to produce a variety of af®nity-improved protein
variants based on point or grouped mutations
identi®ed by phage display (Lowman & Wells,
1993; Yang et al., 1995) or point-mutant screening
(Wu et al., 1998). Considering the initial library
selectants Y0238-3 (>ninefold improved in af®nity)
and Y0243-1 (3.1-fold improved), we would have
predicted an improvement of >27-fold for Y0313-1
or Y0317 (Table 7). In fact, a 22-fold improvement
is observed (Figure 2) at 25 C. Addition of the
CDR-H1 mutation would be predicted to improve
af®nity slightly (1.3-fold), but in fact this mutation
reduced af®nity >twofold (Y0268-1 versus Y0313-1;
Table 6). Certainly additivity does not always
apply, particularly if interacting residues are
involved (Wells, 1990). In this case, non-additivity
probably results from steric interference between
the new Trp in CDR-H2 and the new Tyr in CDR￾H3.
To test the energetics of binding by the ®nal
Y0317 antibody to VEGF, we made use of a panel
of alanine mutants that had been previously con￾structed for mapping the binding site of the orig￾inal antibody (Muller et al., 1998a). For these
experiments, we made use of the full-length IgG
forms of both antibodies. In view of the slow dis￾sociation kinetics for both antibodies, ELISA assays
were carried out at 37 C with incubation for at
least ®ve hours to insure that equilibrium was
reached. Under these conditions two dramatic
differences appear in the Ala-scan of VEGF with
respect to Y0317 versus Fab-12: both R82A and
I83A have small effects on binding in Y0317, but
result in large decreases in binding for Fab-12. The
reasons for these differences are not clear, but R82
and I83 do have signi®cant surface area (55 AÊ 2 and
32 AÊ 2
, respectively) buried on binding to VEGF,
and make contacts that include residues S100a of
CDR-H3 and N52 of CDR-H2 in the wild-type
antibody (Muller et al., 1998a).
Structural analysis of the affinity-matured Fab
The structures of a number of antibodies derived
from in vivo immunization and hybridoma tech￾niques have been determined, in complex with
their antigens (reviewed by Nezlin, 1998), and
recently, crystallization and preliminary X-ray stu￾dies of a chain-shuf¯ed anti-lysozyme scFv anti￾body in complex with antigen were reported
(KuÈttner et al., 1998). However, to our knowledge,
the Y0317 Fab:VEGF structure is the ®rst report of
an in vitro af®nity-matured Fab in complex with
antigen. The structural basis of binding af®nity
improvement is therefore of interest
The Fab fragment of the af®nity-matured anti￾VEGF antibody Y0317 preserves the structure of
the original humanized antibody, Fab-12. Super￾position with Fab-12 results in an rmsd of only
0.38 AÊ for a total of 431 Ca
-positions, demonstrat￾ing the absence of major structural changes
between the two molecules. With a total of 1800 AÊ 2
of solvent-accessible surface buried in each VEGF￾Fab interface, the contact area is about 50 AÊ 2 larger
than in the Fab-12 complex. This small increase in
buried surface area is mostly due to the exchange
of H97 to a tyrosine residue. In the VEGF:Fab-12
complex, H97 buries a solvent-accessible area of
56 AÊ 2
, while the larger tyrosine side-chain of the
matured antibody accounts for 86 AÊ 2 of buried sur￾face. The tyrosine side-chain also affects the hydro￾gen-bonding pattern and the number of ordered
water molecules in the vicinity. In the parental
antibody complex, a water molecule near H97
forms two hydrogen bonds to the side-chains of
Q79 and E93 of VEGF (Figure 4(c)). In the complex
with the af®nity-matured Fab, this water molecule
is replaced by the hydroxyl group of the newly
introduced tyrosine side-chain at position 97. The
H97Y mutation therefore not only increases the
amount of buried surface area, but also introduces
two additional hydrogen bonds between the ligand
and Fab-0317 (Figure 4(c)). This is in good agree￾ment with the observation that this single substi￾tution improves VEGF binding af®nity by 14-fold
(Table 6). We therefore conclude that this single
substiution is responsible for the majority of the
improvement in binding af®nity of Y0317 com￾pared to the parent antibody.
In contrast, despite the availability of the crystal
structures of both complexes, it remains uncertain
what the structural basis is of the 3.6-fold
enhanced binding caused by the N31H mutation.
The side-chains of the asparagine and the histidine
residues in this position adopt identical confor￾mations in both crystal structures, and the amount
of buried surface is not signi®cantly increased in
the VEGF:Fab-Y0317 complex. The only difference
we can detect is a slight possible improvement in
the hydrophobic interactions between the histidine
side-chain and the phenyl group of VEGF residue
F17, which has rotated slightly compared to the
parent complex. It is unclear whether this could
contribute to the increased af®nity.
Neither of the remaining differences between
Fab-12 and Fab-Y0317 has a signi®cant effect on
the binding af®nity towards VEGF, and the struc￾tures show that these residues contribute only mar￾ginally to the interface. Some interactions are
present between VEGF and the main-chain atoms
of the serine and threonine residues in position
100a of the two Fabs, but the side-chains of these
residues are not in contact with VEGF. Finally, no
contact exist between VEGF and T28 (or D28) of
the Fab fragments (the closest point on VEGF to
this residue is more than 6 AÊ distant).
In summary, the analysis and comparison of the
two crystal structures are in very good agreement
with the results of the binding assays on the var￾ious single mutants of the Fab fragments. Although
it is not possible to quantify the effects introduced
by the amino acid exchanges solely based on the
crystal structures, the detailed crystallographic
876 Structure-function of an Optimized VEGF Antibodyanalysis supports and enables us to interpret the
binding data.
Biological implications for antibody inhibition
of VEGF
An inhibitory antibody of improved af®nity may
have improved potency or ef®cacy in treating dis￾eases associated with VEGF expression. Preceding
versions of the anti-VEGF antibody described here,
including the murine A4.6.1 (Kim et al., 1993), the
humanized version Fab-12 (Presta et al., 1997), as
well as Y0192 (Muller et al., 1998a), clearly demon￾strated suf®cient af®nity to effect inhibition of
VEGF activity. Here, we show that an af®nity￾improved variant, Fab Y0317, can inhibit endo￾thelial cell proliferation in vitro with least 30-fold
greater potency than the parental humanized Fab
(Figure 3).
We have limited our optimization strategy to a
subset of heavy-chain CDR residues implicated by
alanine-scanning and crystallography (Muller et al.,
1998a). Furthermore, not all combinations of
phage-derived mutations have been tested. One
may therefore reasonably ask whether Y0317, with
Kd
25 
 20 pM and Kd
37 
 130 pM, is the globally
optimum variant for binding to this particular epi￾tope (or others) on VEGF. Other af®nity optimiz￾ation efforts have resulted in protein-protein
binding af®nities in the low picomolar range, from
Kd 6 pM to 15 pM (see, e.g. Lowman & Wells,
1993; Schier et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1995). Indeed,
we cannot exclude the possibility that higher af®-
nity variants of the A4.6.1 antibody could be pro￾duced. However, it seems unlikely that further
af®nity improvement would greatly enhance bio￾logical potency or ef®cacy because for effective
inhibition, the antibody must certainly occupy a
signi®cant fraction (perhaps >99 %) of the available
(VEGF) binding sites. Serum VEGF concentrations
of about 20 pM in normals, and of >300 pM in
patients with metastatic carcinoma, have been
observed (Kraft et al., 1999). Local or effective con￾centrations are likely higher. If we conservatively
assume the effective concentration of VEGF in vivo
to be about 400 pM, then 400 pM of even an in®-
nite-af®nity Fab would be required to block all
sites.
Other factors may limit the improvement in
potency of a full-length IgG resulting from an
improvement in intrinsic binding af®nity of the
Fab for antigen. The full-length IgG form of the
antibody may bene®t from an avidity effect in vivo,
especially since VEGF is known to associate with
proteoglycans on the cell surface (Gitay-Goren et al.,
1992). Even in cell-based assays, the IgG form of
Fab-12 is a more effective inhibitor than the Fab
form (data not shown). Finally, the half-life for dis￾sociation of the af®nity-improved antibody is
already signi®cant, even on the time-scale of the
half-life of clearance for IgG's (days to weeks). The
effect of an improved association rate constant for
antibody in this system is unknown.
The fact that point (Ala) mutations in the anti￾body binding site on VEGF sometimes have lesser
effects on the binding of Y0317 than on the binding
of Fab-12 may suggest that the optimized binding
site is more tolerant than the parental one of vari￾ations in the antigen. Indeed, Y0317 showed
greatly enhanced af®nity for murine VEGF over
that of Fab-12 (data not shown), though still >100-
fold weaker than its af®nity for human VEGF. This
could provide an advantage against naturally aris￾ing VEGF variants.
Materials and Methods
Construction of phage libraries and mutagenesis
A variant of the Fab-12 antibody (a humanized form
of murine antibody A4.6.1) was previously identi®ed
from phage-displayed Fab libraries for improved
expression on phage particles (Muller et al., 1998a). We
made use of the plasmid pY0192, a phagemid construct
with ampicillin (or carbenicillin) resistance, as the par￾ental (``wild-type'') construct for libraries described here.
To prevent contamination by wild-type sequence
(Lowman et al., 1991; Lowman, 1998), templates with the
TAA stop codon at each residue targeted for random￾ization were prepared from CJ236 E. coli cells (Kunkel
et al., 1991). Libraries are designated according to the
mutagenic oligonucleotides used for their construction:
YC265, TCC TGT GCA GCT TCT GGC NNS NNS TTC
NNS NNS NNS GGT ATG AAC TGG GTC CG, rando￾mizing residues 27-28, 30-32 in CDR-H1; YC266, GAA
TGG GTT GGA TGG ATT AAC NNS NNS NNS GGT
NNS CCG ACC TAT GCT GCG G, randomizing resi￾dues 52a-54, 56 in CDR-H2; YC103, GAA TGG GTT
GGA TGG ATT NNS NNS NNS NNS GGT GAA CCG
ACC TAT G, randomizing residues 52-54 in CDR-H2;
YC81, C TGT GCA AAG TAC CCG NNS TAT NNS
NNS NNS NNS CAC TGG TAT TTC GAC, randomizing
residues 97, 99-100b in CDR-H3; and YC101, CGT TTC
ACT TTT TCT NNS GAC NNS TCC AAA NNS ACA
GCA TAC CTG CAG , randomizing residues 71, 73, and
76 in the ``FR-H3`` region. An additional library in CDR￾H2 was designed to insert three new residues: YC90, GA
TGG ATT AAC ACC TAT NNS NNS NNS ACC GGT
GAA CCG ACC.
The products of random mutagenesis reactions were
electroporated into XL1-Blue E. coli cells (Stratagene) and
ampli®ed by growing 15-16 hours with M13KO7 helper
phage. The complexity of each library, ranging from
2  107 to 1.5  108 , was estimated based on plating
of the initial transformation onto LB plates containing
carbenicillin.
Site-directed mutagenesis for point mutations was car￾ried out as above, using appropriate codons to produce
the respective mutations, and sequences were con®rmed
by single-strand DNA sequencing using SequenaseTM
(USB).
Phage binding selections
For each round of selection, approximately 109
-1010
phage were screened for binding to plates (Nunc Maxi￾sorp 96-well) coated with 2 mg/ml VEGF(109) in 50 mM
carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and blocked with 5 % (w/v)
instant milk in 50 mM carbonate buffer, (pH 9.6). Also
included were phage prepared from a non-displaying
Structure-function of an Optimized VEGF Antibody 877  control phagemid (pCAT), which confers chlorampheni￾col resistance, as a means of measuring background and
enrichment (Lowman & Wells, 1993). Bound phage were
eluted with 0.1 M HCl and immediately neutralized
with one-third volume of 1 M Tris (pH 8.0). The eluted
phage were propagated by infecting XL1 cells for the
next selection cycle as described (Lowman, 1998).
In the ®rst cycle, the VEGF plate was incubated with
Fab-phage, then was brie¯y washed to remove bound
phage. In the second cycle, binding and washing were
followed by a one hour dissociative incubation at room
temperature with binding buffer, after which the plate
was again washed prior to acid elution. This process was
repeated in rounds 3, 4 and 5, except that 1 mM VEGF
was included in the dissociative incubation, and the
incubation time was increased to 2, 18, and 37 hours,
respectively. During these selections, Y0192 phage
showed enrichments ranging from 1.5-fold (at the lowest
stringency) to 22,000-fold (using a two hour dissociation
incubation). However, further increases in stringency
(rounds 4-5) resulted in decreasing enrichments for the
control phage, with higher enrichments observed for cer￾tain libraries, especially the two CDR-H2 libraries and
the CDR-H3 library (Table 1).
In cycle 6, a 17 hour dissociative incubation at room
temperature was followed by an additional 30 hour incu￾bation at 37 C (also including VEGF in the buffer).
Under these conditions, Y0192-phage showed only slight
binding enrichment (20-fold), whereas the CDR-H3
library phage were enriched by 3500-fold. Cycle 7 was
carried out with a 63 hour dissociative incubation, after
which only small enrichment factors were observed.
However, some libraries were continued through eight
cycles (with 120 hours of dissociative incubation in the
presence of VEGF), after which Fab-phage were still
recoverable by acid elution (data not shown).
Purification of Fab
For small-scale preparations, Y0317 Fab and mutants
were prepared from E. coli shake-¯asks as described
(Muller et al., 1998a).
For large-scale preparation, whole cell broth was
obtained from a ten liter E. coli fermentation. The cells
were lysed with a Manton-Gaulin homogenizer (two
passes at 6000 psi; lysate temperature maintained at 15-
25 C with a heat exchanger). A 5 % (v/v) solution of
polyethylene imine (PEI), pH 6.0, was added to the
lysate to give a ®nal concentration of 0.25 % (v/v). The
lysate was mixed for 30 minutes at room temperature.
The suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant
(containing the Fab) was processed further. The pH of
the supernatant was adjusted to 6.0 with 6 M HCl, fol￾lowed by dilution to a conductivity of 5 mS/cm with
puri®ed water. The conditioned supernatant was loaded
onto a BakerBond ABx ion-exchange column. Following
a wash with the column equilibration buffer, the Fab
was eluted with an increasing sodium chloride gradient
in the equilibration buffer. Fractions containing the Fab
were identi®ed by SDS-PAGE. The BakerBond ABx col￾umn fractions were pooled, pH adjusted to 5.5 with 1 M
Mes and diluted to a conductivity of 5 mS/cm with puri-
®ed water. The conditioned BakerBond ABx pool was
loaded onto a SP Sepharose HP cation exchange column
(Pharmacia). Once again, the Fab was eluted with a
sodium chloride-containing gradient. Fractions contain￾ing the Fab were identi®ed by SDS-PAGE. The level of
purity of Fab (as determined by SDS-PAGE) after this
two column puri®cation was >95 %.
BIAcoreTM binding analysis
The VEGF-binding af®nities of Fab fragments were
calculated from association and dissociation rate con￾stants measured using a BIAcoreTM -2000 surface plas￾mon resonance system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). A
biosensor chip was activated for covalent coupling of
VEGF using N-ethyl-N0
-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbo￾diimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS) according to the supplier's (BIAcore, Inc., Piscat￾away, NJ) instructions. VEGF(109) or VEGF(165) was
buffer-exchanged into 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8
and diluted to approximately 50 mg/ml. Aliquots of
VEGF were injected at a ¯ow rate of 2 ml/minute to
achieve approximately 700-1400 response units (RU) of
coupled protein. A solution of 1 M ethanolamine was
injected as a blocking agent.
For kinetics measurements, twofold serial dilutions of
Fab were injected in PBS/Tween buffer (0.05 % Tween￾20 in phosphate-buffered saline) at 25 C or 37 C at a
¯ow rate of 10 ml/minute. Equilibrium dissociation con￾stants, Kd values from SPR measurements were calcu￾lated as koff
/kon (Tables 6 and 8).
Radiolabeled VEGF binding assay
Solution binding af®nity of Fabs for VEGF was
measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concen￾tration of (125I)-labeled VEGF(109) in the presence of a
titration series of unlabeled VEGF, then capturing bound
VEGF with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate.
To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates
(Dynex) were coated overnight with 5 mg/ml of a
capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM
sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked
with 2 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to
®ve hours at room temperature (approximately 23 C). In
a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM
[
125I]VEGF(109) was mixed with serial dilutions of Fab￾12 or Fab Y0317, respectively. Fab-12 was incubated
overnight; however, the Fab Y0317 incubation was con￾tinued for 65 hours to insure that equilibrium was
reached. Thereafter, the mixtures were transferred to the
capture plate for incubation at room temperature for one
hour. The solution was then removed and the plate
washed eight times with 0.1 % Tween-20 in PBS. When
the plates had dried, 150 ml/well of scintillant (Micro￾Scint-20; Packard) was added, and the plates were
counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten
minutes. Concentrations of each Fab were chosen to give
420 % of maximal binding.
For competitive binding assays, Dynex plates were
coated and blocked as above, and serial threefold
dilutions of unlabeled VEGF(109) were made in PBS/
Tween buffer in a Nunc plate. [125I]VEGF(109) was
added, followed by addition of a ®xed concentration of
Fab-12 or Fab Y0317. The ®nal concentrations of Fab-12,
and Fab Y0317 were 100 pM and 10 pM, respectively.
After incubation (as above), bound VEGF was captured
and quanti®ed as described above. The binding data was
analyzed using a computer program to perform Scatch￾ard analysis (Munson & Rodbard, 1980) for determi￾nation of the dissociation binding constants, Kd, for Fab￾12 and Fab Y0317.
878 Structure-function of an Optimized VEGF AntibodyELISA assay of VEGF Ala mutants
The binding af®nities of VEGF Ala mutants for full￾length Fab-12-IgG (known as rhuMAb VEGF) and
Y0317-IgG, a full-length IgG form of the improved anti￾body expressed in CHO cells (V. Chisholm, unpublished
results) were measured as previously described (Muller
et al., 1997; Muller et al., 1998a) for the murine antibody
A4.6.1, except that the temperature was increased to
37 C, and the incubation time increased to ®ve hours,
to insure that equilibrium was reached with the high￾af®nity antibody.
Cell-based assay of VEGF inhibition
Several versions of the anti-VEGF antibody were
tested for their ability to antagonize VEGF(165) induc￾tion of the growth of HuVECs (human umbilical vein
endothelial cells). The 96-well plates were seeded with
1000 HuVECs per well and fasted in assay medium
(F12:DMEM 50:50 supplemented with 1.5 % (v/v) dia-
®ltered fetal bovine serum) for 24 hours.
The concentration of VEGF used for inducing the cells
was determined by ®rst titrating to identify the amount
of VEGF that can stimulate 80 % of maximal DNA syn￾thesis. Fresh assay medium containing ®xed amounts of
VEGF (0.2 nM ®nal concentration), and increasing con￾centrations of anti-VEGF Fab or mab were then added.
After 40 hours of incubation, DNA synthesis was
measured by incorporation of tritiated thymidine. Cells
were pulsed with 0.5 mCi per well of [3
H]thymidine for
24 hours and harvested for counting, using a TopCount
gamma counter.
Crystallization and refinement
The complex between the Fab fragment of af®nity￾matured, humanized antibody Y0317 Fab and the recep￾tor binding fragment of VEGF (VEGF(109)) was puri®ed
and crystallized as described for the analogous complex
with the parental humanized Fab-12 fragment (Muller
et al., 1998a). The resulting crystals had symmetry con￾sistent with space group P21 with cell parameters
a  89.1 AÊ , b  66.4 AÊ , c  138.7 AÊ , and b  94.7 , and
were isomorphous with the crystals obtained with the
parent complex. A data set was collected from a single
frozen crystal at beam line 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light
Source, Berkeley, and processed using programs
MOSFLM and SCALA (CCP4, 1994). The ®nal data set
(Rmerge 7.3 %) is described in Table 10. Starting with the
model of Brookhaven Protein Data Bank entry 1bj1
(Muller et al., 1998a), the structure was re®ned using the
programs X-PLOR (BruÈ nger et al., 1987) and REFMAC
(CCP4, 1994). The free R-value was monitored using the
identical set of re¯ections sequestered before re®nement
of parent complex. The differences in the primary struc￾ture between Fab-12 and Fab-Y0317 were modeled using
the program O (Jones et al., 1991). After correction for
anisotropy and application of a bulk solvent correction,
the R-value reached its ®nal value of 19.9 % for all re¯ec￾tions greater than 0.2s (see Table 10; Rfree  27.4 %).
