Proteins bind one another in aqua’s solution to form tight and specific
complexes. Previously we have shown that this is achieved through the
modular architecture of the interaction network formed by the interface
residues, where tight cooperative interactions are found within modules but
not between them. Here we extend this study to cover the entire interface of
TEM1 β-lactamase and its protein inhibitor BLIP using an improved method
for deriving interaction maps based on REDUCE to add hydrogen atoms and
then by evaluating the interactions using modifications of the programs
PROBE, NCI and PARE. An extensive mutagenesis study of the interface
residues indeed showed that each module is energetically independent on
other modules, and that cooperativity is found only within a module. By
solving the X-ray structure of two interface mutations affecting two different
modules, we demonstrated that protein–protein binding occur via the
structural reorganization of the binding modules, either by a “lock and key”
or an induced fit mechanism. To explain the cooperativity within a module,
we performed multiple-mutant cycle analysis of cluster 2 resulting in a high￾resolution energy map of this module. Mutant studies are usually done in
reference to alanine, which can be regarded as a deletion of a side-chain.
However, from a biological perspective, there is a major interest to
understand non-Ala substitutions, as they are most common. Using X-ray
crystallography and multiple-mutant cycle analysis we demonstrated the
added complexity in understanding non-Ala mutations. Here, a double
mutation replacing the wild-type Glu,Tyr to Tyr,Asn on TEM1 (res id
104,105) caused a major backbone structural rearrangement of BLIP,
changing the composition of two modules but not of other modules within
the interface. This shows the robustness of the modular approach, yet
demonstrates the complexity of in silico protein design.

Introduction
The interest in the mechanisms of binding and
networking of protein–protein interactions has
grown increasingly over the past years stemming
from the realization that much of the cellular
complexity is related to such interactions. The
ability of certain proteins to form specific stable
protein–protein complexes is fundamental for
biological processes, including events such as
signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, immune
response etc. This is feasible due to the almost
unlimited potential to generate unique binding
sites on proteins, characterized by their shape
and surface chemistry. Much effort has been
invested in understanding the biophysical basis
allowing for proteins to interact in aqueous
solution. Mutational analysis of protein interfaces
has led to the conclusion that only a minority of

of binding; these are called “hot–spots” and they
are defined as residues that cause a large change
in binding energy upon mutation. The biophysi￾cal basis for hot spots is under intense
scrutiny.1–3 One of the critical issues in this
area is our poor ability to properly predict
which residues will be hot spots, and what is
their contribution to binding. This is true for the
simple case of mutations to Ala, and worse for
mutations to the other 19 amino acids.4,5 One
possible explanation for the complexity of the
binding interface is that one may have to
interpret mutagenesis results of single residues
in light of their environment, and not necessarily
the sum of the parts.6
Based on sequence and structural analysis,
several general rules have been proposed to
explain the features of interface hot spots.
Although these rules appear useful for the
analysis of specific interfaces, they break down
when applied to a larger set of protein–protein
interactions, underlining the extreme variation in
size, shape, amino acid character and solvent
content of protein–protein interfaces.7,8 This led to
the development of a number of computer
programs with predictive power concerning the
energetic composition of binding sites, and pre￾diction of an energetic cost of interface amino
acids.4,5,9 While much improvement has been
achieved in recent years, the overall success is
still limited.
In a previous study, we have shown that the
interface between TEM1 and BLIP is built in a
modular fashion, each module being comprised
of a number of closely interacting residues, with
few interactions between the modules. We
demonstrated that the effects of mutations in
one module are additive in respect to residues in
neighboring modules, but cooperative within
their module. As a result, the structural and
energetic consequences of the deletion of entire
modules are smaller then expected.10 Thus, we
suggested that hot spots can be understood only
within the frame of their module, and that non￾linear effects, such as cooperativity and non-direct
interactions have to be taken into consideration.
Here, we verified our theory regarding modular￾ity of the interface by extending the mutation study
of the TEM1–BLIP complex to the entire interface,
measuring the energetic contribution of most
combinations of pairwise mutations, whether
within or between modules on binding. We also
show an improved method to derive the network
interaction map of the interface. Using this, we
show that indeed, each module is independent of its
neighbor within the TEM1–BLIP interface. More￾over, solving the X-ray structure of two interface
mutations we demonstrate that protein–protein
binding occurs via the structural reorganization of
the binding modules, while each module adapts
either the “lock and key” model11 or the “induced￾fit” model.12
Results
Deriving a high-resolution interface contact map
In the past decade the network model has been
applied in different aspects of biology to obtain
useful insights into protein structure, folding,
stability, regulation and evolution. A network
representation requires the depiction of a system
as a set of nodes and edges that constitute the graph.
In the case of proteins, residue and atom-based
graphs were used to represent the interaction
networks within the protein structure.13–15 Here,
the amino acid residues are the nodes and the edges
are the interactions between them. Clustering of
such networks defined highly clusters-forming
residues, which were suggested as hot spots.13
However, one of the main limitations of this
approach lies in the difficulty to obtain a good
physical definition for the non-covalent bonds
between residues, from which the energetic con￾tribution of the contact (edges in the graph) may be
estimated. The most common approach to define
such interactions uses a combination of distance
thresholds and chemical character of the interacting
residues. For example, the CSU method16 was
successfully applied for a number of detailed
structural protein analyses.17,18 The drawback of
this method is that it adds some false positive edges
that increase the noise of the interaction network
and thereby require a secondary clustering analysis.
Here, we introduced a stricter mean to represent
interactions by the use of the REDUCE and the
PROBE programs, developed by the group of Jane
and David Richardson (see Materials and Methods).
REDUCE adds hydrogen atoms to all heavy atoms,
and allows side-chain rearrangement for H-bond
optimization. PROBE defines interactions by rolling
a ball with radius of 0.25 Å along the Van der Waals
surface and defining the points of inter-atomic
contacts. While this method gives an excellent
quantitative description of H-bonds and Van der
Waals interactions, it misses some of the aromatic
and electrostatic interactions because their distance
and angle restrictions on physical meaningful bonds
are not within the simple definitions of Van der
Waals distances probed by PROBE. Therefore, we
added a modified version of the NCI server to
identify pi–pi and cation–pi interactions, and the
PARE server to identify charge–charge interactions
(Figure 1(a), see Materials and Methods). Once all
inter-atomic contacts were listed, they were inte￾grated into their respective amino acids and
summarized in a matrix containing all the interface
interactions between residues from both proteins.
The procedure is explained in a flow chart diagram
in Figure 1(b). The connectivity map of the TEM1–
BLIP interface, showing only inter-protein interac￾tions is drawn in Figure 2(a). This map shows six
clean clusters of interactions, without the need to
apply additional clustering methods to separate
between them. The main difference between this
664 Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interfacemap and the one published before10 is the division
of C3 into two separate clusters, C3 and C4. The
non-covalent interactions within or between pro￾teins can be divided into three: backbone–backbone
(bb), side-chain–backbone (sb) and side-chain–side￾chain (ss). Mutational analysis is probing only the
latter two, while double-mutant cycles probes only
ss interactions. To relate connectivity maps to
mutagenesis results, ss interactions are represented
as solid lines, and sb interactions as dotted lines,
arrows point to residues that contribute backbone
atoms toward the interaction (Figure 2(a)). Since a
mutagenesis to Ala removes only side-chains, Cβ
atoms were considered as backbone atoms.
The crystal structure of the TEM1–BLIP complex
(PDB code 1JTG) contains two copies of the complex
in the asymmetric unit (chains A and C for TEM1
and B and D for BLIP). Contact maps were derived
for both copies of the complex (Figure 2(a) versus (b))
to compare their cluster organization. The interac￾tion map showed the same cluster organization for
both duplicates, with the exception of small changes,
indicating minor structural differences between the
two. C1 (D49 on BLIP and S130, S235, R243, K234 on
TEM1), C2 (three BLIP residues K74, F142, Y143 and
two TEM1 residues E104, Y105) and C3 (two BLIP
residues W150 and R160 and two TEM1 residues
Q99 and N100) are similar between the two
complexes. C4 in the A-B complex contains one
BLIP residue (W162) interacting with three TEM1
residues (V103, P167 and E168), while in the C-D
complex W162 interacts only with E168 and V103. In
the A-B complex the C5 cluster is formed by four
BLIP residues (F36, S39, Y50 and Y53) and four
TEM1 residues (P107, M129, V216 and K111).
Cluster C6 is the smallest cluster, containing two
BLIP residues (S71 and S113) and one TEM1 residue
(E110). Interestingly, rotamers of two residues from
clusters C5 and C6, BLIP S113 and TEM1 M129, have
a different angle between the two complexes,
suggesting flexibility of these residues (Figure 3).
An interaction between TEM1 E110 and BLIP S113 in
chains A-B does not exist in chains C-D. In the
interface of the C-D chains C5 is split into two,
forming one cluster containing mostly sb interac￾tions (TEM1 residues M129, K111, H112 and BLIP
residues F36, S35) and the ss interactions, BLIP Y50–
TEM1 and BLIP F36–TEM1 M129. Overall, this
analysis demonstrates that the cluster composition
of a protein–protein interface is a stable feature, but
that some flexibility exists for movements within
clusters, and the definition of their exact boundaries.
Mutation analysis of the TEM1–BLIP interface
Previously we have thoroughly characterized the
inter and intra relations of C1 and C2.10,19 Here, we
extended this study to include the remaining four
clusters: C3–C6 by mutating most residues to
Figure 1. Defining interface interaction maps. (a) A
slice through a small section of the binding interface
showing TEM1 residues Y105 and E104 in blue, BLIP K74
in green and hydrogen atoms in white. The atom contact
surfaces are shown as colored dots. The probe sphere
(orange ball) is rolled over the surface of each atom, leaving
a contact dot only when the probe touches another not
covalently bonded atom. The dots are colored by local gap
width between the two atoms: bright green at perfect Van
der Waals contact distance, clashes are shown by yellow
and red dots. When suitable H-bond donor and acceptor
atoms overlap, the dots are pale green, forming lens shapes
(marked as HB). Ionic interactions were calculated using
PARE and are shown by a line connecting two charged
atoms (blue and red balls). (b) A flow diagram of the
method used to produce interface contact maps.
Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interface 665Figure 2. Cluster analysis of the TEM1–BLIP interface. The interactions between TEM1 and BLIP residues located
within the interface were extracted as shown in Figure 1. The crystal structure of the TEM1–BLIP complex (PDB code 1JTG)
contains two copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit (chains A and C for TEM1 and B and D for BLIP). A connectivity
map was derived for both complex duplicates ((a) for chains AB and (b) for chains CD). TEM1 and BLIP residues are nodes
in the graph (red squares and blue circles, respectively). Three interaction types are shown in the map: side-chain–side￾chain (continuous lines), backbone–side-chain (dotted lines) and where both side-chain–side-chain and backbone–side￾chain interactions were found between the same pair of residues (continuous lines with arrows). The arrows point towards
the residues that contribute the backbone to the interaction. For example, the dotted line between TEM N100 and BLIP R160
indicates a side-chain–backbone interaction, with N100 contributing the backbone atoms. The interface was divided into
six clusters. Alignments of the interface clusters from TEM1–BLIP (complex-1JTG), TEM1 (unbound-1BTL) and BLIP
(unbound41) structures are shown in (c). BLIP residues of bound and unbound structures are colored in blue and cyan,
respectively. TEM1 residues from the bound complex are in red and from the unbound proteins in yellow. The backbone
atoms are colored gray. BLIP and TEM residues are labeled using blue and red fonts, respectively.
666 Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interfacealanine and measuring the effects of mutation on
binding. All interactions were measured by hetero￾geneous phase detection using the multi-channel
surface plasmon resonance ( SPR) as implemented in
the ProteOn™ XPR36 protein interaction array
system (BioRad). Analysis of SPR data is inherently
problematic, and has to be done with great care.20–22
For this study, five different TEM1 proteins were
immobilized on five different channels on the chip
(leaving one empty for a blank subtraction),
subjected to six concentrations of BLIP in a single
run (Figure 4(a) and (b)). Kinetic binding constants
were determined directly from the SPR traces using
the BIAevaluation 4.1 package (see Materials and
Methods). In addition, we determined the equili￾brium response at each BLIP concentration, from
which the affinity can be directly assessed using the
law of mass action. In Figure 4(d) and Table 1 we
compare the ΔΔG values obtained from equation (1)
(ratio of kinetic data) and equation (4) (mass action,
see the Materials and Methods), showing a very
good fit between the two. A third method of analysis
used here is to consider only values of kd to
determine ΔΔGkd
. The logic behind this is as follows,
for systems that obey equation (1):
KA ¼ ka
kd
ð1Þ
the change in free energy upon mutation (ΔΔGKA ° )
can be related to the kinetic rate constants according
to:
DDG￾KA ¼ DDGz
ka  DDGz
kd ð2Þ
Thus, the free energy contribution of a specific
residue towards complex stability can be divided
into its contribution to the rate constants of associa￾tion and dissociation. The rate of association is
dictated primarily by long-range electrostatic
interactions,23 while the rate of dissociation is
dictated by short-range interactions.19 Thus, values
of ΔΔGkd reflect better the contribution of a residue
to its close environment. Where possible, the
influence of mutations on binding, as well as double
and multiple mutant cycles were analyzed using the
three methods (Tables 1–4).
The change in free energy of binding (ΔΔG) for
single mutants in clusters C3–C6 are presented in
Table 1, and for combinations of mutations in Table
2. The free energy changes for single mutations on
BLIP are well correlated with previously published
data obtained using a β-lactamase inhibition
assay.24 Moreover, we showed in a previous pub￾lication that ΔΔG values of TEM1–BLIP interactions
measured by SPR are similar to values obtained
from either a β-lactamase inhibition assay or from
equilibrium titration giving a confidence to the
analysis done here.25 Overall, mutations to alanine
of BLIP residues are less tolerated than mutations on
TEM1 (Figure 5). One of the possible reasons for the
robustness of TEM1 residues to mutagenesis is that
many of the BLIP side-chains interact with atoms on
TEM1 that are not altered by mutagenesis, either
backbone, Cα or Cβ (Figure 2(a)). Half of the TEM1
interface residues contribute their backbone atoms
to binding, while only one third of the BLIP
backbone atoms are involved in binding (Figure
5(b)). No backbone–backbone interaction and few
Cβ–bb or Cβ-Cβ interactions were found between
TEM1 and BLIP.
The contact maps in Figure 2(a) and (b) show
that the side-chains of residues P107, P167, N170
(TEM1) and S113 (BLIP) form interactions with
the second protein only in either chains AB or
chains CD (but not in both chains). These
residues are located in clusters C2 to C6. We
prepared mutations to Ala for four of them (P167
did not fold) and measured their contribution to
binding. All three mutations did not cause a
change in the free energy of binding of the
complex, suggesting that the minor changes in
the cluster composition between the two repeats
of the complex in the asymmetric unit are a result
of neutral movements of the side-chains, allowing
them to move without penalty. In other words,
the cluster composition of residues that contribute
to binding did not change showing the inherent
robustness of the cluster approach in defining
interfaces.
Free energy relationships within and between
clusters
The binding free energies of proteins with muta￾tions located within the same cluster are given in
Table 2A, whereas ΔΔG for mutations located in
two different clusters are given in Table 2B. The data
were analyzed according to changes in the rate of
dissociation (ΔΔGkd
), the affinity as calculated from
the ratio of ka/kd (ΔΔGKA) and the affinity as cal￾culated from the mass action signal (ΔΔGKA(ma)).
In terms of experimental errors, ΔΔGkd is the most
precise as it does not depend on instrument artifact
and protein concentrations as ΔΔGKA. In addition,
ΔΔGkd is a direct measure of the strength of the
short-range interactions, which are related to the
cluster architecture while ΔΔGKA is also a reflection
of the rate of association, which is influenced by
longer-range effects. Mostly, the change in free
energy caused by mutations in clusters C3–C6 are
additive, with the non-additivity being much less
pronounced than in clusters C1–C2. Still, the
analysis of clusters C3–C6 points out again that
mutations located in different clusters are additive
to each other (Figure 6(b)) while mutations located
in one cluster may also be sub-additive to one
another (Figure 6(a)).
An alignment of the unbound and bound struc￾tures is shown in Figure 2(c). Backbone movements
are in all cases relatively small, while most of the
rearrangements upon binding can be attributed to
side-chain movements, which are quite significant.
No relation is found between the magnitude of
movement and the energetic contribution of the
residue to binding.
Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interface 667 Detailed analysis of the cooperative network in
cluster 2
Of the six clusters between TEM1 and BLIP, only
C1 and C2 are highly cooperative. A detailed
analysis of the cooperativity within C1 was done
previously.19 Here, we did a multiple-mutant
analysis of C2, which includes side-chain contribu￾tions from K74, F142 and Y143 from BLIP and
E104, Y105 and N170 from TEM. As N170 did not
contribute energetically, it was omitted from the
analysis. The results of this analysis are in Table 3A
and B. The small differences in values of ΔΔG
given in this Table, compared to Tables 1 and 2 are
due to the different instrument (Proteon F, BioRad)
used for these measurements (data taken from
Reichmann et al.
10). Still, the values of both
measurements are within the experimental error
(2σ for ΔΔGKA = 1.4 kJ/mol) and as all the data in
Table 3 were done using the Proteon F we chose to
leave them as measured for better self-consistency
of the mutant cycles. In Table 3B in brackets are the
residues mutated in the background of the circle, for
example the ΔΔGint value of −10.3 kJ/mol calcu￾lated for K74 (142) and E104 (Y105) is obtained from
the following calculation:
DDG74;142;104;105  DDG74;142;105  DDG142;104;105
þ DDG142;105 ¼ 13:1  20  6:3 þ 2:9 ¼ 10:3
In the center of C2 is the salt-bridge between E104
and K74. ΔΔGint between K74A and E104A is
14.8 kJ/mol within its native environment (Table
3B). Mutating either Y143A or Y105A has only a
small effect on the K74–E104 interaction (ΔΔGint of
−14.6 and −12.4 kJ/mol, respectively). F142A has a
somewhat larger effect (ΔΔGint of −9.9 kJ/mol) and
removing all the surrounding residues (F142, Y143
(BLIP) and Y105 (TEM1)) reduced ΔΔGint of K74–
E104 by half to −7 kJ/mol, showing that the strength
of this salt-bridge is partially dependent on its
immediate environment. Interestingly, the effect of
the environment of this salt-bridge is additive, with
the single mutation of F142A reducing it by 4.9 kJ/
mol (14.8–9.9), Y105A by 2.4 kJ/mol (14.8–12.4),
Y143A by 0.2 kJ/mol (14.8–14.6), (compare 4.9+2.4+
0.2 = 7.5 kJ/mol to the multiple mutant reduction of
ΔΔGint by 7.8 kJ/mol (14.8–7).
A second interaction in C2 is between the aromatic
residues F142-BLIP and Y105-TEM1 (Table 3). The
structure of the F142 mutant did show a major
rearrangement within C2,10 thus, the influence of
neighboring residues on this interaction is expected.
ΔΔGint of F142 and Y105 equals −5.2 kJ/mol; this
interaction is strengthened to −9.5 kJ/mol in the
E104A background, but is reduced to 0.7 kJ/mol in
the K74A background. Surprisingly, the almost
energetically neutral mutation of Y143A (BLIP) has
a major negative effect on the interactions of F142
with Y105. The reason for this can be seen when
probing the interactions of Y143 with Y105 in the
presence or absence of the F142A mutation. ΔΔGint
of Y143 with Y105 in the background of the F142A
mutation is 6.5 kJ/mol, indicating a strong negative
cooperativity between these two residues, up from
3.6 kJ/mol within it native environment. Combining
these data with the analysis done previously on
C1,19 clearly indicates that the energetics of both
clusters is complicated by environmental (coopera￾tive) effects, while the energetic relationship
between different clusters is simply additive. To
better understand the cooperative behavior within
clusters, we determined the structures of two
TEM1–BLIP complexes containing hot spot muta￾tions (D49A of C1 and F142A of C2) in BLIP.

respectively, and chains C-D colored in violet). Unbound
TEM1 residues are shown by yellow, and unbound BLIP
residues are in cyan, similarly to Figure 2(c). Bound BLIP
and TEM1 residues are labeled using blue and red fonts,
respectively.
668 Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interface     Hot spots in protein–protein interfaces:
two major mechanisms
A major hindrance in evaluating the energetics of
mutant proteins is the potential for a structural per￾turbation upon mutation. Here, we investigate the
structure of the BLIP D49A mutant in complex with
TEM1, and compare it to the structure of the F142A
mutant determined previously.10 These two muta￾tions are located in clusters C1 and C2, respectively.
D49 is the only BLIP residue in C1, interacting with
four TEM1 residues, S130, K234, S235 and R243. A
superimposition of the structure of the D49A mutant
in complex with TEM1, on the structure of the wild￾type complex does not show significant structural
rearrangements within or outside the interface
region (Figure 7). Overlaying the unbound struc￾tures of TEM1 and BLIP on the complex structures
shows that the four TEM1 residues on C1 are pre￾arranged before complex formation (Figure 7). Only
D49 has to flip-in upon complexation. The pre￾Figure 4. Binding of TEM1 WT with: BLIP WT (a) and
BLIP H148A ((b) and (c)). The measurements were done
using the ProteOnTM XPR36 Protein Interaction Array
System (BioRad). The TEM1 proteins were immobilized
on the sensor chip by amine coupling on five channels,
leaving one channel as blank. Binding was measured at six
different concentrations of the BLIP proteins (BLIP WT:
18.75 nM, 37.5 nM, 75 nM, 150 nM, 300 nM, 600 nM; BLIP
H148A: 100 nM, 300 nM, 500 nM, 1000 nM, 1500 nM,
2000 nM), which were run simultaneously across the ligand
channels. The affinity constants, KAwere derived from both
the ratio between ka/kd and from fitting the equilibrium
response (Req) at each concentration of BLIP to the mass
action equation, KA(ma) (c). KA and KA(ma) values of the
TEM1 WT–BLIP H148A interaction are 1.2 × 107 and
1.3× 107
, respectively. Correlation between free energy
values obtained from both, independent fitting methods
(ΔΔGKA determined from ka/kd and ΔΔGKA(ma) determined
from the equilibrium response) are shown in (d).

Binding energies (in kJ/mol) were measured with TEM1 proteins
immobilized to the sensor chip. KA-ma is the equilibrium affinity
constant derived by action mass analysis. The change in free
energy upon mutation, ΔΔGKA is calculated from in kJ/mol. The
change in ΔΔGkd upon mutation, is a good measure of the change
in transition state energy upon mutation, which is calculated from

Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interface 669assembly of the TEM1 interface in C1 may explain
its structural rigidity upon mutation of D49A.
The structure of the F142A mutant located in C2
has been published by us previously (PDB code is
1SOW). In this case a major rearrangement of most
side-chains of C2 was observed upon binding, with
a side-chain relaxation towards the unbound struc￾ture of C2 being observed in the F142A mutant
structure (Figure 2(c)). As has been shown in Table 3,
the energetic contribution of F142 depends strongly
on its environment. Overall, unlike D49A, the whole
organization of C2 seems to be affected by the F142A
mutation. Both the thermodynamic and structural
analysis of C2 strongly suggests that this cluster is
highly cooperative, and that the F142 residue has a
major part in holding this cluster together. Any
mutation in this cluster affects other, neighboring
interactions and thus this cluster should be viewed
as one binding unit.
Conformational rearrangement upon binding is
observed also for C3 and C6 (Figure 2(c)) and less
for C4 and C5. None of the C3 residues in the
complex structure have the same rotamer position
as in the unbound structure. It is possible that the
non-aditivity between TEM1 Q99 and BLIP W150
is caused by the flip of the W150 aromatic ring,

Structural perturbation upon non-alanine
mutations
So far we discussed in details the energetic and
structural consequences of mutations to Ala, which
can be regarded as a pure deletion of a side-chain.
However, from a biological perspective, there is
major interest in understanding non-Ala substitu￾tions, as they are the most commonly occurring
mutations. In this case, in addition to losing existing
interactions, new interactions may be formed.
Understanding of non-alanine mutations is a pre￾requisite for protein design.
We have shown that Ala mutations in the TEM1–
BLIP interface cause minor structural perturbation,
which effects are restricted to the cluster of the
mutated residue. In order to analyze the contribution
of non-alanine mutations, two residues in the TEM1
protein, i.e. E104 and Y105, were changed to Y104 and
N105, respectively. This mutation is between polar
residues of approximately the same size, and there￾fore is not expected to cause major structural
rearrangements. Binding affinities of the TEM1
104Y-105N (TEM1-YN) protein toward several BLIP
proteins were measured, and the complex structure of
TEM1-YN with BLIP-WT was determined (PDB code
is 2B5R). Indeed, the YN mutation resulted only in a
reduction of 4.2 kJ/mol of binding energy, which is
slightly less then that observed for the Ala mutations
of these residues. Looking at the structure of the YN
mutation, one observes only a minor change in TEM1
(Figure 8(a)). However, to our surprise, the small
changes introduced to the sequence of TEM1 lead to a
major local backbone-rearrangement of the hairpin
loop between residues 46–53 in BLIP (Figure 8(a)).
The hairpin loop (46–53) between strands 2 and 3 in
the BLIP protein became untwisted, with the first
residues of the hairpin loop (46–49) showing the
largest movement, up to 6.4 Å. This major movement
of the loop is not observed in the unbound BLIP
structure, where the B-factor of this loop is rather low.
This clearly indicates that the rearrangement of BLIP
is a direct consequence of the mutations on TEM1,
apparently representing a new low energy state.
Interestingly, the untwisting of the loop occurs in such
a way that allows the active group BLIP-D49 to
remain in the same position as in the wild-type (WT)
complex, thus keeping its crucial interactions with
four TEM1 amino acids in cluster C1.
The movement of the second part of the loop (50–
53) leads to flipping of both the Y50 and Y51
residues. The new position of the Y50 residue in
BLIP allows the formation of new bonds between
TEM1 and BLIP, among which are cation–π and
hydrogen bonds between Y50 in BLIP and N104 in

and ΔΔGint (TEM1WT).
Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interface 671TEM1, and between Y50 in BLIP and S130 in TEM1.
A minor rotation of K74 allowed keeping the
hydrogen bond with N105 as in the WT complex
(Figure 8(b)). Also of interest is that the OH of Y51 in
the mutant is pushed to the same place, as is OH of
Y50 of the wild-type BLIP. As a result of the double
mutation in positions 104 and 105 of TEM1, clusters
C2 and C5 are changed completely due to formation
of new interactions. Importantly, all other clusters in
the complex remained unaffected (Figure 8(c)).
In order to evaluate the thermodynamic changes
underlying this major structural rearrangement we
determined the influence of the TEM1-YN mutant
on residues located in proximity, in C2 and C4 (Table
4). Overall, despite the large structural perturbation
caused by the TEM1-YN mutation, the affinity of the
complex was reduced by only 4.2 kJ/mol, which is
even less than observed for the Ala mutations.
Multiple mutant cycle analysis of TEM1-YN with
either BLIP F142A or BLIP K74A-Y142A-Y143A
shows that ΔΔGint values on TEM1-YN are similar
to those measured for the TEM1-AA mutations
(Table 4B). In other words, in respect to C2 no energy
is gained by the TEM-YN mutation. The same is true
for the cycles done between TEM1-YN and H41A or
Y53A on BLIP (Table 4B right column). The only
significant interaction measured was with Y50A on
BLIP (−2.5 kJ/mol). In the wild-type structure, Y50
is part of C5, but in the cluster map of the TEM1-YN
mutant this residue is shifted to C2 (to the same
cluster as TEM1-YN). The data suggest that this new
interaction is a major cause for the rearrangement of
the loop on BLIP upon mutation of residues on
TEM1. Y50A on BLIP is a mutation that results in
tighter binding towards TEM1; in other words, this
tyrosine has a negative effect on binding (Table 1). In
the TEM1-YN structure, Y50 adapts a more positive
role in stabilizing the complex by forming interac￾tions with a large number of BLIP residues (for
details see Figure 8(c)). It is interesting to note that
the Y50A mutant on BLIP also caused a reduction in
the binding affinity towards β-lactamase type SME￾1. This TEM1 protein is highly similar to the TEM1
protein,24 but Tyr and His residues are found at
positions 104 and 105, similar to the TEM1-YN
mutation introduced by us.
The data presented here imply that the structural
rearrangement caused by TEM-YN represents a new
energetical minimum of the complex. Counting the
number of interacting dots in the wild-type and
TEM-YN structures (dots are produced by PROBE￾see Materials and Methods) showed that the number
of dots is the same for both complexes. However, the
mutant complex contains more inter-protein inter￾actions than the wild-type complex, while the wild￾type complex has more intra-protein interactions
(Figure 8(d)). ΔΔG of binding is a result of the overall
change in energy of the system. In the case presented
here, it seems that interactions stabilizing BLIP were
replaced by interactions stabilizing the complex,
leading overall to a new energetical minima of the
system.
Discussion
We have previously suggested, based on the
analysis of the interactions within and between
modules C1 and C2 of the TEM1–BLIP interface that
the effect of mutations is limited to within their
Figure 5. (a) Changes in binding free energies for TEM1 (black) and BLIP (gray) upon mutation to alanine. The change

672 Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interfacecluster.10 Here, we extended this study to the entire
TEM1–BLIP interface in order to further establish its
modular nature. For the purpose of this work we
refined the method of producing contact maps, by
defining interactions after hydrogenation of all
heavy atoms (using REDUCE), and defining the
contacts using the programs PROBE, NCI and
PARE. This protocol divided the interaction between
TEM1 and BLIP into six clusters, which are similar to
those found before,10 but with C3 split into two.
Cluster definitions were obtained without the need
for additional clustering of the contact maps due to
their exact nature. Experimental alanine mutagen￾esis spanning the entire TEM1–BLIP interface con￾firmed the modular architecture of this binding site.
One of the major challenges in studying proteins is
their diversity. While, a simple modular architecture
is true for some interfaces, for others, long-range
cooperative effects were detected. One such example
is for the T cell receptor variable domain binding a
bacterial superantigen were cooperative binding
energetics between distinct hot regions that are
separated by >20 Å was shown.26 The propagation
of these cooperative effects through a dynamic
structural network is a complex evolutionary
phenomenon, which is reminiscent of the alosteric
effects found in enzymes. In contrast, the simple
additivity found for remote hot spots in TEM1-BLIP
can be viewed as the typical mechanism.
The common method to analyze the contribution
of residues towards the stability of a protein–protein
complex is by evaluating the loss in free energy of
binding upon mutation. However, as shown here,
this method could be problematic as the loss in the
measured free energy of binding of single mutations
equals, or even exceeds, that which accompanies the
removal of complete clusters. The loss in free binding
energy of hot spot residues, e.g. D49 or F142 on C1
and C2, respectively, exemplifies two different
mechanisms of hot spots and shows the complexity
in calculating their contribution to binding (Figures 7
and 2(c)). D49 in BLIP is located in the center of C1,
surrounded by four TEM1 residues. The X-ray
structure of the TEM1–BLIP complex with the
D49A mutation illustrates a case were removing a
side-chain wipes out the interaction network of C1

Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interface 673and affects complex stability without causing any

shows that all five residues forming C1 are pre￾arranged, except a rotamer flip of D49. Binding of C1
fits nicely the lock and key mechanism for protein–
protein interactions and thus should be relatively
easy for calculation. Indeed, the single-mutants on

674 Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP InterfaceTEM1 of C1 were calculated with reasonable preci￾sion using the FoldX64 server (Figure 1 in Supple￾mentary Data), however, the D49A mutation on
BLIP was completely wrong (24.5 kJ/mol calculated,
7.0 kJ/mol experimental), apparently due to lack of
cooperativity within the calculation. To see how well
theoretical calculations are able to predict the
outcome of mutations for the TEM1–BLIP system
we used the FoldX64 and Robetta42 programs, as
implemented in their respective web servers to
calculate the free energy change of all single￾mutations on either BLIP or TEM1 investigated
here (see Figure 1, Supplementary Data). The
calculated average ΔΔG per mutation (for 30 single
mutations) was 7.5 kJ/mol and 6.9 kJ/mol for
Robetta and FoldX6, respectively, versus 6.3 kJ/mol
from experimental data. However, the individual
values deviated, with an r
2= 0.39 for a fit of the
calculated versus experimental data for FoldX6 and
r
2= 0.15 for Robetta (Figure 1 Supplementary Data).
From here it seems that energy calculations are good
to obtain the global energy, but not on a per-residue
basis. Maybe, this is one of the reasons that energy
functions simulate well systems, but not individual
mutations.
A second mechanism of hot spots is illustrated in
C2, where binding is accompanied with structural
rearrangement of this cluster. F142 has a key role in
C2, by stabilizing the interaction network of this
cluster by introducing structural constraints includ￾ing a flip of Y105 on the TEM1 protein and the
decrease in the distance between K74 and E104. The
removal of F142 causes an unraveling of C2 (as seen
in the mutant structure), and thereby a heavy loss in
binding energy. Still, even in the absence of F142,
ΔΔGint of K74 and E104 is 9.9 kJ/mol, which is 2/3
of the value measured in the native environment. A
comparison of the unbound BLIP and TEM1
structures with that of the complex shows that the
structure of the F142A mutant complex resembles in
C2 the unbound structures of TEM1 and BLIP.10 The
mode of binding of C2 is a classical example of an
induced-fit mechanism of binding. To simulate such
induced-fit mechanism is a real challenge for
theoretical calculations. Initial MD simulations
using Gromacs failed to simulate the structural
rearrangement induced by the F142A mutation
(D.R. and G.S. unpublished results). Recently, the
structure of the complex between the TEM1 homo￾log, SHV1, and BLIP was solved.27 Mutagenesis of
homologous positions to C2 in the SHV1–BLIP
complex showed structural and energetic relation￾ships between SHV1 D104 and BLIP F142. A
mutation of SHV1 D104E increased affinity by
1000-fold, while mutating the same residue to Lys
did not change the affinity but caused a flip in the
loop near position F142 on BLIP, away from the
interface. Showing a second example of how a
mutation on TEM1 can move residues located on
BLIP.
Most of the biophysical work aimed to decipher
the energetical architecture of binding sites has been
done to analyze the case of mutations to Ala, which
can be seen as a simple deletion mutation. However,
in a biological context, or for the purpose of protein￾design, mutations to the other 18 amino acids are
more relevant. The difficulty in analyzing such
mutations is shown here for the case of the TEM1-
YN mutant. This mutation is very similar to the case
found in β-lactamase type SME-1 (where these
positions are occupied by YH), and does not change
the overall size or chemistry of the site. Indeed, the
structure of TEM1 of this mutant is very similar to
that of wild-type, however a major structural
rearrangement was observed for BLIP. The complex
between the TEM1YN mutant and BLIPWT was
crystallized in the same space group and with
similar cell dimensions as the previously solved
TEM1–BLIP complexes (PDB IDs 1JTG, 1SOW and
1XXM). Moreover, the two copies of the complex
found in the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure
show the same structural changes of the BLIP 46-53
loop. Therefore, this movement seems to be genuine,
and not a result of crystallization artifacts. The
structure rearrangement caused by the replacement
of E104Y and Y105N indicates a balance between
different parameters, such as good packing, increas￾ing in connectivity and thermodynamic cost for a
structural movement. The change between inter and
intra contact dots for this mutant is shown in Figure
8(d). Indeed, one cannot disconnect protein stability
from the stability of the complex, as ΔΔG is a
measure of the system as a whole, searching always
for the global, and not local minima of energy.
Interestingly, the mutation of SHV D104K led also to
untwisting of the hairpin loop (46-53) between
strands 2 and 3 in the BLIP,27 similarly to mutations
TEM1 E104Y-Y105N, done by us and further
confirms the metastability of this loop. Also in the
case of SHV D104E–BLIP WT the untwisting of the
loop occurs in such a way that allows the active
group BLIP-D49 to remain in the same position as in
the WT complex, thus keeping its crucial interactions
with four TEM1 amino acids in cluster C1 intact.
Structural prediction programs, such as ROSE￾TTA28 and SCCOMP29 were used in order to
predict the change in structure of the TEM1-YN–
BLIP-WT complex, but none of them succeeded to
predict the backbone movement and the accurate
side-chains positions. Also the experimental B￾factor of the loop in the unbound wild-type BLIP
structure is rather low, not hinting towards this
movement. The experimentally observed solution
of untwisting the hairpin loop results in the
reorganization of clusters C2 and C5 with a
number of new interactions being formed (Figure
8(c)). Multiple-mutant analysis of the TEM1-YN
mutant shows that indeed a new interaction is
formed between these residues and Y50 on BLIP,
while the interaction with F142 is lost. This fits the
contact map as displayed in Figure 8(c) and shows
that also in the new cluster arrangement of the
TEM1-YN mutant, clusters are additive to one
another but cooperative within themselves. How￾ever, this also shows that clusters are stable for
alanine mutations, but are more flexible when non￾Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interface 675alanine mutations are introduced. This is rather
logical, as alanine mutations remove interactions,
while non-alanine mutations can add new interac￾tions and structural constraints that may cause
major realignments in the interface (as is the case
here). While, theoretically, the loop untwisting is a
very simple structural and thermodynamic solu￾tion to overcome the effect of these two non￾alanine mutations, its predictability using calcula￾tions is a difficult task.
Alanine mutagenesis scan of the TEM1–BLIP
interface exhibited an additional interesting phe￾nomenon; the robustness of the TEM1 interface
relatively to BLIP. Mutations within the BLIP inter￾face had larger effects on the binding energy than
mutations on the TEM1 interface (Figure 5). Figure
5(b) shows the residues mutated on the TEM1 and
BLIP binding sites, color-coded according to their
contribution to binding. Only the side-chain beyond
Cβ was colored, the backbone and Cβ atom are the
same in Ala, and therefore not changed in the
mutant. Backbone atoms (+Cβ) were colored in grey.
The picture makes it clear that the exposed surface
on BLIP comprises mostly side-chain atoms, while
on TEM1 the backbone is exposed. This would
obviously lead to the robustness of TEM1 to
mutation, as backbone atoms are not mutated. The
same phenomenon was shown in other biological
systems, such as cytochrome c2 (cyt) and Rhodobacter
sphaeroides reaction center (RC).30
It is known that BLIP binds many types of TEM1
proteins with different specificity, but using the
same binding interface.24,27 A multifunctional bind￾ing site should be flexible, and therefore not
optimized to a single binding partner. Flexibility is
much more easily obtained through side-chain
rearrangement than through movements of the
rigid backbone. This fits well our observation of
flexibility and rearrangement of many of the BLIP
side-chains upon binding TEM1 (Figure 2). There￾fore, it may well be possible, that BLIP has a
physiological role in binding different TEM1 pro￾teins and inhibiting their action. These kinds of
biological functions are difficult to find, particularly
as we do not simulate in the laboratory the complex
ever changing and challenging natural environment
of the Gram-positive soil bacterium Streptomyces
clavuligeris that is producing BLIP. Therefore, it is not
surprising that until now no biological connection
was proven between these two proteins.31,32 The
scenario of optimizing binding to a set of other
proteins is very common in the biological setup, and
stems from the flexibility of the network character￾istics of the proteom.
Materials and Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis
Mutagenesis was performed using Kunkel mutagene￾sis.33,34 A plasmid for expression and single strand mu￾tagenesis was prepared by insertion of f1- origin sequence
into pET-9a plasmid (Novagen) containing either TEM1 or
BLIP genes. The TEM1 or BLIP plasmids were trans￾formed into dut–
/ung– Escherichia coli strain (CJ236), and
uracil-containing ssDNA of the plasmids was purified and
used as a template for mutagenesis. Appropriately
designed phosphorylated primers containing the mutated
codons in the center and >12 bp on each side were first
annealed to the ssDNA template by incubation at 95 °C for
2 min followed by 53 °C for 3 min, and then enzymatically
extended and ligated to form covalently closed dsDNA by
using T7 polymerase (NEB), T4 ligase (Fermentas), dNTPs
(Fermentas) and 0.04 M DTT (Sigma). Transformation of
the dsDNA plasmid into an ung+ E. coli strain (TG1 or XL￾1Blue cells) caused a destruction of uracil-containing wild￾type strand, and the in vitro replication of the mutated
strand. The insertion of the mutations were verified by
DNA sequencing.
Protein expression and purification
Expression and purification of TEM1 and BLIP were
undertaken as described.19 Protein quality (degree of
purity and activity) as well as its active concentration
was determined by running it alone or in complex
with wild-type protein using analytical gel filtration
chromatography.
Kinetic measurements
Kinetic constants were evaluated by SPR detection
using the ProteOn™ XPR36 Protein Interaction Array
System (BioRad) in PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.05% surfactant P20
at 25 °C. For all measurements, TEM1 was immobilized by
amine coupling to the sensor chip, and BLIP was the
analyte, applied at six different protein concentrations.
Data were analyzed using BIAeval 4.1 software using both
the Langmuir models for fitting kinetic data (global and
local fitting), and from the equilibrium response at each
concentration, fitted to the mass-action equation.10,35 The
change in free energy (ΔΔGKA) upon mutation was
calculated from:
DDGKA ¼ RT Kmut
A
Kwt
A
ð3Þ
with KA values being determined in two ways, the first (for
interactions of ka< 5 × 106 M−1 s
−1 and kd < 0.2 s−1
) being the
ratio of the kinetic constants (KA =ka/kd), and the second
(termed KA(ma)), by following the change in the refractive
index (RU) at the equilibrium-binding signal and then
fitting the data to the mass action expression:
RU ¼ ½CKAðmaÞRmax=½CKAðmaÞm1 ð4Þ
where C represents the protein concentration. Values of
ΔΔGKA (determined from ka/kd) and ΔΔGKA(ma) (deter￾mined by mass action) are highly correlated (with a
correlation coefficient of 0.99; Supplementary Data).
Significant values of ΔΔG (2σ) calculated from kd were
>0.7 kJ/mol and from KA > 1.4 kJ/mol. For further details
see Supplementary Data.
Double and multiple mutant analysis
The effect of a mutation on stability of the complex is
evaluated as the ratio of either the dissociation or affinity
constants of the wild-type and the mutant, or equivalently,
as the variation of the free binding energy, ΔΔG. The
676 Binding Hot Spots in the TEM1–BLIP Interface   change in free energy (ΔΔG) upon mutation was calcu￾lated from:
DDGmut ¼ DGwt  DGmut ¼ RTInðKwt=KmutÞ ð5Þ
The change in free energy was derived separately
from three constants: kd, dissociation constant, KA, as
calculated from the ratio of the kinetic constants
(KA =ka/kd) and KA(ma), which is the equilibrium
affinity constant, derived from the law of mass
action.10,35 One of the best approaches to study the
contributions of amino acids to binding and stability
involves the use of double and higher-order mutant
cycles, where interactions between amino-acids are
treated within their native contexts.6,19,36 Such cycles
reveal whether the contributions from a pair of
residues are additive, or whether the effects of
mutations are coupled. The interaction binding energy
ΔΔGint for a pair of residues (1 and 2) was calculated
as follows:
DDGint ¼ DGwt  DGmut1  DGmut2 þ DGmut1mut2
¼ DDGmut1 þ DDGmut2  DDGmut1mut2 ð6Þ
If there is no interaction between the two mutated
residues, the effects of the two substitutions should be
additive in respect to the double-mutation (ΔΔGint= 0). If
they form attractive interaction the interaction binding
energy is negative (ΔΔGint< 0), and a repulsive interaction
results in a positive interaction energy (ΔΔGint> 0).
Contributions of neighboring residues towards a given
pairwise interaction were evaluated by adding residues to
the pairwise interaction and calculating multiple mutant
cycle, as described in details before.6,19 The multiple
mutant cycle is calculated by equation (6), where the wild￾type complex is replaced by mutant. For example,
interaction free energy of mutation 1 and 2 in a back￾ground of a mutation of residue A is calculated by
equation (7):
DDGint ¼ DDGmutA  DDGmut1mutA  DDGmut2mutA
þ DDGmut1mut2mutA ð7Þ
Significant values of ΔΔGint (2σ) calculated from kd
were >1.0 kJ/mol and from KA >2.0 kJ/mol.
Crystallization and structure determination of BLIP
D49A–TEM1 wt complex
Crystals of BLIP D49A–TEM1 were grown using
hanging-drop vapor diffusion method of 20 mg/ml of
the complex in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8) equilibrated
against reservoirs containing 26% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M
Tris and 0.2 M lithium chloride at pH 8.5. The resulting
crystals grew spontaneously and belong to space group
P212121 (a= 45.5, b= 123.9, c= 156.6 Å), with two TEM1–
BLIP complexes in the asymmetric unit at 1.9 Å resolution.
The structure, solved by molecular replacement was
refined to an R-factor of 20.6% and an Rfree of 23.9%. For
further details see Supplementary Data.
Crystallization of TEM1 E104Y-Y105N–BLIP WT
complex
Single crystals of the complex were obtained by the
microbatch method under oil using the IMPAX 1-5 robot
(Douglas Instruments). The protein was crystallized at a
concentration of 11 mg/ml. Data collection and refine￾ment statistics of the TEM1-YN/BLIP-wt complex is
summarized in Supplementary Data. Crystal of the
complex were grown from a precipitating solution of
100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 25% PEG 3350 and 0.2 M
ammonium acetate. Crystals formed in space group
P212121, with cell constants a= 45.80 Å, b= 124.47 Å,
c= 157.26 Å, and contained two monomers in the
asymmetric unit diffracting to 1.65 Å resolution. The
structure was solved by molecular replacement using the
program MolRep, using the 1.73 Å refined structure of the
complex (1JTG in the Brookhaven Data Bank, PDB) as a
model. The structure was refined to an R-factor of 19.0%
and an Rfree of 22.2%.
Producing interface interaction maps
A flow diagram of this process is presented in Figure
1(b). Definition of interactions between residues was
based on the “all-atom contact” method, calculating the
detailed atomic contacts between protein residues. The
all-atom contact technique depends on adding the
hydrogen atoms, most of which are completely deter￾mined to a suitable accuracy by the positions of the
heavier atoms. This is done by the program REDUCE.37
With hydrogen atoms present, the PROBE program
calculated an all-atom contacts map.38 It uses a small
probe sphere of radius 0.25 Å, in an algorithm close to
the inverse of the Connolly solvent-accessible surface
calculation.39 The PROBE program defines “contact
dots” by rolling the probe sphere over the surface of
each atom, leaving a contact dot only when the probe
touches another non-covalently bonded atom. Density of
the dots is 16 contact dots per 1 Å2 of the interaction
area. PROBE forms discontinuous surfaces, the paired
patches of which directly show the location, extent, and
shape of close atomic contacts, as shown in Figure 1(a).
The dots are colored by local gap width between the
two atoms and by bond types: perfect Van der Waals
contact (0 Å gap) is colored by green, H-bond dots are
pale green and represented by lens shapes. Atom
overlaps (clashes) are yellow and red “spikes”, which
were transformed to dots format. An interaction
between two residues was defined by summarizing
shared dots. Although this method gives an excellent
quantitative description of H-bonds and Van der Waals
interactions, aromatic and electrostatic interactions are
not well defined by the PROBE program. In order to
calculate salt-bridge interactions, the PARE program was
used.23 Threshold of 4 Å was used for identification of
the electrostatic interactions. Non-canonical interactions
(pi–pi and cation–pi) were defined by the NCI
program40 with NCI default parameters (Figure 1).
Results of the above three programs were summarized
into an inter-residue interaction matrix, which was used
for defining the interface connectivity map by extracting
all inter-chain interactions. The interface interaction
network was plotted by the Pajek program†.
