The majority of adenovirus serotypes can bind to the
coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) on hu￾man cells despite only limited conservation of the amino
acid residues that comprise the receptor-binding sites of
these viruses. Using a fluorescence anisotropy-based as￾say, we determined that the recombinant knob domain
of the fiber protein from adenovirus serotype (Ad) 2
binds the soluble, N-terminal domain (domain 1 (D1)) of
CAR with 8-fold greater affinity than does the recombi￾nant knob domain from Ad12. Homology modeling pre￾dicted that the increased affinity of Ad2 knob for CAR
D1 could result from additional contacts within the
binding interface contributed by two residues, Ser408
and Tyr477, which are not conserved in the Ad12 knob.
Consistent with this structural model, substitution of
serine and tyrosine for the corresponding residues in
the Ad12 knob (P417S and S489Y) increased the binding
affinity by 4- and 8-fold, respectively, whereas the dou￾ble mutation increased binding affinity 10-fold. X-ray
structure analysis of Ad12 knob mutants P417S and
S489Y indicated that both substituted residues poten￾tially could form additional hydrogen bonds across the
knob-CAR interface. Structural changes resulting from
these mutations were highly localized, implying that the
high tolerance for surface variation conferred by the
stable knob scaffold can minimize the impact of anti￾genic drift on binding specificity and affinity during
evolution of virus serotypes. Our results suggest that
the interaction of knob domains from different adenovi￾rus serotypes with CAR D1 can be accurately modeled
using the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 crystal structure as a
template.
Interaction of animal viruses with their cellular receptors is
of particular interest because the viral proteins that function in
molecular recognition are subject to immunoselective pressure
to vary their antigenic structure. The potentially negative im￾pact of antigenic variation on recognition of the cellular recep￾tor is minimized in some virus families by protein structural
features that shield receptor-binding sites from attack by host￾neutralizing antibodies (1). In adenoviruses, by contrast, recep￾tor-binding sites are exposed and highly variable in sequence.
Therefore, adenovirus-receptor interaction presents an oppor￾tunity to observe the range of structural plasticity that can be
tolerated without loss of binding specificity.
Receptor-binding function in adenoviruses is associated with
viral fibers (2, 3), rod-shaped homotrimeric proteins (4) that
protrude from each vertex of the icosahedral virus capsid. The
distal end of viral fibers consists of a globular domain, the head
or knob domain, which has receptor binding activity (5, 6).
Human adenoviral fiber proteins have evolved to recognize
several different host cell receptors (7–9); however, to date only
one of these receptors has been molecularly characterized, a
46-kDa membrane glycoprotein known as the coxsackievirus
and adenovirus receptor (CAR)1 (10, 11). Representative sero￾types from adenovirus subgroups A, C, D, E, and F have been
shown to interact with CAR (12), suggesting that CAR may be
the most common receptor used by human adenoviruses. The
CAR protein spans the cell plasma membrane once and has two
extracellular Ig domains derived from the N-terminal region of
the polypeptide. The CAR N-terminal Ig variable-type domain
(D1) alone is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the
fiber protein knob domain (13–15). CAR has a broad tissue
distribution (16) and is found predominantly on the basolateral
surfaces of epithelial cells (17, 18). CAR is localized specifically
within tight junctions (19, 20), which hold lateral cell mem￾branes in close apposition to form an effective seal close to the
apical surface. Although interaction of viruses with receptors
such as CAR that have low expression levels on cell apical
surfaces appears paradoxical, recent studies suggest that this
arrangement could facilitate the spread of virus infection
within tissues and transmission of virus particles to new hosts,
because progeny virus particles are released preferentially
from the basal-lateral surfaces of infected cells (19, 21).
X-ray structures of recombinant knob domains from the fiber
proteins of adenovirus serotypes 2, 3, 5, and 12 have been
determined (22–25) and in all cases show that knob monomers
fold into similar 8-stranded -sandwich conformations. Knob
monomers assemble into remarkably stable trimers (26), re￾sulting from a large number of hydrogen bonds and hydropho￾bic interactions in the noncovalent trimer interface (23). Vari￾ations in polypeptide chain length are accommodated by
changes in the length of surface loops, whereas other sequence
variations appear to have had minimal effects on the underly￾ing -sandwich scaffold. Structures of CAR D1 alone and in
complex with the Ad12 knob also have been solved (24, 27).
CAR D1 has a -sandwich fold that is characteristic of Ig
variable domains (28, 29). The x-ray structure of the Ad12
knob-CAR D1 binary complex indicates that no conformational
rearrangement occurs in either molecule upon complex forma-

contacts involve residues within the knob AB loop, with the
knob DE and EG loops also providing additional contact resi￾dues (24). Mutational analysis of the CAR binding activities of
Ad5 and Ad12 knobs is consistent with the Ad12 knob-CAR D1
x-ray structure, suggesting that the location of the CAR D1-
binding sites on knob domains from different serotypes is con￾served (24, 30). The trimeric knob domain has three identical
binding sites for CAR D1 that can be occupied simultaneously,
as observed in the x-ray structure of the binary complex and in
surface plasmon resonance experiments (24, 31).
Alignment of the Ad12 knob amino acid sequence with se￾quences of knob domains from other CAR-binding serotypes
indicated that contact residues are not well conserved. For
example, of the 15 total contact residues in Ad12 knob, only six
are identical in the Ad5 knob, whereas eight are identical in the
knob from Ad41L (32). This extensive variation of contact res￾idues implies that the mechanism of knob-CAR interaction
could differ significantly among adenovirus serotypes. Individ￾ual contact residues at structurally analogous positions might
differ considerably in their relative contributions to binding
affinity, as suggested recently in a comparison of the interac￾tion of recombinant knob domains from Ad5 and Ad9 with CAR
D1 (31, 32). One question arising from such studies is whether
the relative positions of knob and CAR D1 in binary complexes
changes significantly with the variation of contact residues in
the knob component. This question could be addressed directly
by solving crystal structures of knob-CAR binary complexes,
but so far we have been unable to obtain diffracting crystals of
binary complexes involving knob domains from any adenovirus
serotypes other than Ad12, for reasons not presently under￾stood. In this study, we investigated the structural basis for the
difference in affinity between Ad2 and Ad12 knob for CAR D1
by first constructing homology models of Ad2 knob-CAR D1
binary complexes to predict important differences in contact
residues between the two serotypes. Ad12 knob mutants were
then constructed to test these predictions, both in functional
binding assays and ultimately in crystal structure determina￾tion of binary complexes of the mutant knob proteins with CAR
D1. Together, our results suggest that mutation of individual
contact residues, as might occur during antigenic drift, in many
cases only incrementally decreases affinity for the receptor.
Partial retention of binding affinity may enable mutant viruses
to successfully infect host cells and subsequently acquire sec￾ondary mutations that either restore high affinity binding or
shift binding specificity to a novel receptor. Avidity effects
resulting from the trivalent binding mechanism of knob may
further compensate for mutations that weaken binding affin￾ity, as suggested previously (31, 33, 34).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant knob domain
from Ad12 fiber protein and the N-terminal domain of CAR (CAR D1)
were prepared as described previously (15). The recombinant knob
domain from Ad2 fiber protein was prepared following the same proto￾col used for Ad12 knob. Briefly, PCR products encoding the Ad2 and
Ad12 fiber knob domains and several flanking amino acids from the
fiber shaft (Ad2 knob residues 387–582 and Ad12 knob residues 401–
587) were cloned between the NdeI and BamHI restriction endonucle￾ase cleavage sites of vector pET15b (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). The
constructs were transformed into strain BL21-DE3 (Novagen Inc., Mad￾ison, WI) for expression of the hexahistidine-tagged knob proteins. All
of the knob variants were constructed by primer-directed PCR mu￾tagenesis (mutagenic primers: Ad12 knob P417S, GCAGTTTGGTGAT￾GGGTCAGGAG; Ad12 knob S489Y, TCTATATCCCCAGTAAGCTTGA￾GGAA; Ad2 knob S408P, TGCAGTTAGGAGGTGGGTCTGGG; and Ad2
knob Y477S, TTCTAAAGTTCCAAGAATGTTTTTTAAGT) and cloned
as above. The proteins were purified via ion exchange and nickel￾nitriloacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA),
and the molecular weight of each construct was confirmed by mass
spectrometry. Each soluble expressed knob protein formed stable trim￾ers, as assessed by nondenaturing (native) polyacrylamide gel electro￾phoresis and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of unheated pro￾tein samples. PCR products encoding CAR D1 (CAR residues 21–143,
numbering from the N-terminal signal peptide) with and without the
S46C mutation were cloned between the NcoI and XhoI restriction
endonuclease cleavage sites of pET15b. A stop codon was omitted from
the reverse primer to extend the CAR D1 C terminus with a 22-residue
peptide encoded by vector sequences. This peptide extension was found
to increase folding of CAR D1 in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm (15).
CAR D1 proteins were expressed in strain BL21-DE3 and were purified
by ion exchange chromatography. CAR D1 mutation S46C was con￾structed by primer-directed mutagenesis, using the mutagenic oligonu￾cleotide primer GTCTTCGGGACAAAGCGTAAATTTG.
Labeling of CAR D1 S46C—Serine 46 of CAR D1 was converted to
cysteine by primer-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting protein was
purified by ion exchange chromatography. CAR D1 S46C protein was
covalently labeled with 6-iodoacetamidefluorescein through the intro￾duced reactive thiol group of C46. The S46C protein (2.4 mg/ml) was
reduced for 90 min in buffer A (20 mM NaPO4, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl)
containing 20 mM dithiothreitol. Excess dithiothreitol then was re￾moved on a Sephadex G-10 spin column equilibrated in buffer A. The
reduced protein was collected directly into a receiving tube containing
1.5 times molar excess of 6-iodoacetamide fluorescein, and the mixture
was incubated for 4 h at 25 °C in the dark with end-over-end tumbling.
Excess 6-iodoacetamide fluorescein was removed by gel filtration on a
Sephedex G-10 column (60  15 mm) in buffer A. The degree of labeling
was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of
the labeled protein at 280 and 492 nm. Wild type CAR D1 control
protein remained unlabeled after treatment by this procedure, indicat￾ing that only the introduced cysteine group of the S46C mutant was
reactive.
Fluorescence Anisotropy Experiments—Equilibrium binding experi￾ments were performed on a Tecan Ultra 384 plate reader (Tecan,
Salzburg, Austria) using flat bottomed, black, 96-well, untreated micro￾plates (Nalge Nunc Int., Naperville, IL). The reaction mixtures con￾tained 5 nM of fluorescein-labeled CAR D1 S46C in binding buffer (10
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.0125% Nonidet P-40) with
varying concentrations of knob proteins (10 nM to 5 M). The total
reaction volume was 300 l, and the plates were incubated at 25 °C for
30 min. The fluorometer was set up with excitation and emission
wavelength filters of 485 and 535 nm, respectively, and with a fluores￾cein dichroic mirror. The integration time was 40 s, with 10 lamp
flashes/measurement. The gain and optimal Z-position were deter￾mined manually using a control prior to the start of the experiment. The
anisotropy values were calculated as the ratio of the difference between
vertical and horizontal emission intensities (I// and I) normalized to
the total intensity (Equation 1). Factor G is the ratio of the sensitivities
of the detection system for vertically and horizontally polarized light.

The equilibrium binding curves were analyzed using Table Curve
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Binding curves obtained for the knob-CAR
interaction were fitted to an A  B 3 AB model that describes single￾site independent binding of ligand to the receptor. This model assumes
that complexes form with no multivalent avidity effects, because both
the receptor and the ligand are free in solution during the analysis.
Competitive displacement studies were performed by titrating 5 nM
of labeled CAR D1 S46C to 90% saturation with 650 nM knob domain
from Ad2 fiber protein and then back titrating the complexes with
unlabeled wild type CAR D1 while measuring the decrease in fluores￾cence anisotropy. The results of the concentration-dependent decrease
in anisotropy were fitted according to the equations of Huff et al. (35).
Because the concentration of CAR D1 in the anisotropy assays (5 nM)
was well below the reported dissociation constant for CAR D1 ho￾modimers (16 M) (27), the protein can be regarded as monomeric under
the conditions used.
Modeling—Homology modeling of Ad2 knob in complex with CAR D1
was performed using Swiss PDB Viewer (36). The Ad12 knob-CAR D1
binary complex was used as a template (PDB code 1KAC), and Ad2 knob
was superimposed on the structure, 1.04 Å root mean square deviation
for -carbon atoms. Visual inspection of this model indicated potential
contacts at the interface of Ad2 knob and CAR D1 that are not observed
in the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 structure. The residues at the complex
interface that were not conserved between Ad2 and Ad12 knob were
modeled in the context of Ad12 knob in all rotomer conformations.

Swiss PDB Viewer mutation tool.
Crystallization—Crystals of purified knob-CAR D1 complexes were
grown at room temperature by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method.
All of the reagents used were obtained from Hampton Research (Hamp￾ton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA). Protein drops contained 2 l of
protein solution and 2 l of reservoir solution, and the wells contained
500 l of crystallization buffer. Crystals of Ad12 knob P417S-CAR D1
were grown in 3.2 M ammonium sulfate in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.0. The
crystals of the Ad12 knob S489Y-CAR D1 were grown in 0.8 M ammo￾nium sulfate in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.0. The crystals were flash cooled
at 99 K with 50% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant.
Data Collection and Model Refinement—In each case, full data sets
were collected from single crystals using a 4 cell CCD on National
Synchrotron Light Source Beamline X25 at Brookhaven National Lab￾oratory (Upton, NY). The data were processed using the HKL Program
suite (37) as summarized in Table II. The protein coordinates of 1KAC
were subjected to rigid body refinement in CNS after a 5 Å region
around the mutant site had been omitted. A cycle of torsion angle
refinement at 5000 K was performed prior to initial Fo  Fc and 2Fo 
Fc electron density map calculation. The electron density for the sub￾stituted amino acids could be assigned unambiguously. The final re￾finement statistics are shown in Table II. The coordinates for the
P417S-CAR D1 and S489Y-CAR D1 structures were deposited in the
PDB and assigned PDB codes 1P69 and 1P6A, respectively.
RESULTS
Fluorescence Anisotropy Assay and Design of Knob Vari￾ants—The residues involved in the recognition of CAR D1 are
not strictly conserved within the knob domains of fiber proteins
from different adenovirus serotypes (Fig. 1). To assess the
effects of this variation on binding affinity, we developed a
fluorescence anisotropy-based assay that measures interaction
of knob and CAR D1 in solution. This assay limits multivalent
avidity effects that can arise when either knob or CAR D1 is
immobilized on a two-dimensional surface, because it measures
the affinity of individual binding sites on the trivalent knob
molecule. For this assay, a reactive sulfhydryl group was in￾troduced into CAR D1 to permit site-specific labeling with
fluorescein. Serine 46 was chosen for conversion to cysteine
based on its surface exposure and its location outside of the
knob-binding surface of CAR D1 (Fig. 2C). Spectroscopic anal￾ysis showed that the CAR D1 S46C mutant protein was quan￾titatively labeled after reaction with 6-iodoacetamide fluores￾cein, whereas no incorporation of fluorescein was detected in
control reactions containing wild type CAR D1 protein (data
not shown). Formation of knob-CAR D1 complexes was moni￾tored by the increase in fluorescence anisotropy upon incuba￾tion of fluorescein-labeled CAR D1 S46C with increasing, sub￾saturating concentrations of knob protein (Fig. 2A). To
determine whether the fluorescein label influenced the inter￾action of CAR D1 with the knob proteins, a competitive dis￾placement experiment was performed. Fluorescein-labeled
CAR D1 S46C was titrated to 90% saturation with Ad2 knob
protein, and the complexes were then back titrated with wild
type unlabeled CAR D1 (Fig. 2B). The data were fitted to a
displacement curve to determine the inhibition constant (Ki
).
The dissociation constant (Kd) of the forward titration and the
Ki of the back titration were equivalent to within 3% error,
indicating that the labeled CAR D1 S46C protein retained
binding activity similar to that of wild type CAR D1.
Using this anisotropy assay, we measured the binding affin￾ities of two different serotypes of adenovirus knob, Ad2 and
Ad12, toward CAR D1. Equilibrium binding affinities were
derived from binding isotherms, as reported in Table I. Ad2
knob bound to CAR D1 with a Kd of 35 nM, whereas Ad12 knob
bound to CAR D1 with a Kd of 295 nM. To investigate the basis
for this 8-fold difference in affinity, we constructed a homology
model (rigid body interaction) of the Ad2 knob-CAR D1 complex
(Fig. 3). Because the main chain conformations of Ad2 and
Ad12 knob are similar (-carbon atoms have root mean square
deviation of 1.04 ), Ad2 knob was built into the homology
model in the same relative orientation as that of Ad12 knob in
the crystallographically determined Ad12 knob-CAR D1 com￾plex. No steric clashes were observed at the binding interface,
suggesting that the homology model reasonably approximated
the actual structure of the Ad2 knob-CAR D1 complex.
Six contact residues of Ad12 knob are strictly conserved in
Ad2 knob, and all of these appear to contact CAR D1 in the
homology model of Ad2 knob-CAR D1. Seven contact residues
of Ad12 knob are conservatively substituted in Ad2 knob, and
three of these Ad2 knob residues (Asn482, Thr486, and Thr507)
appear to contact CAR D1, whereas three others (Ser442,
Lys475, and Gln508) are more distant from CAR D1 and thus
may contribute less to binding affinity. The final Ad2 knob
residue in this group, Ser408, appeared to form an additional
hydrogen bond with CAR D1 that is not observed in the Ad12
knob-CAR D1 complex. The remaining two contact residues of
Ad12 knob (Leu426 and Glu523) correspond to nonconservative
substitutions in Ad2 knob. Ad12 knob residue Leu426 forms a
main chain hydrogen bond with CAR D1, and the correspond￾ing Ad2 knob residue, Asn417, also is within hydrogen bonding
distance from CAR D1 in the homology model. Ad12 knob
Glu523 forms hydrophobic contacts with CAR D1, but the cor￾responding Ad2 knob residue (Thr511) is too distant from CAR
D1 to make similar contacts. However, small rearrangements
of the EG loop compared with its position in the model poten￾tially could enable Thr511 to contact CAR D1. In summary,
homology modeling suggested that 4 of the 15 residues of Ad2
knob that correspond to contact residues in Ad12 knob may not
be oriented favorably to contact CAR D1. Consequently, we
searched the homology model further for additional potential
contact residues that could account for the greater affinity of
Ad2 knob for CAR D1.
It was observed that one Ad2 knob residue in particular,

residues, seven correspond to conservative substitutions (indicated by

that its side chain was able to make additional contacts at the
complex interface. Tyr477 is positioned within a region that
forms a cavity in the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 complex (Fig. 3).
Modeling of tyrosine at the corresponding position in Ad12
knob, Ser489, indicated that a tyrosine residue at this position
could be accommodated in the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 interface
and could form two additional hydrogen bonds with CAR D1.
Therefore, the overall results of homology modeling suggested
that the increased affinity of Ad2 knob for CAR D1 could result
from additional contacts contributed by Ad2 knob residues
Ser408 and Tyr477.
To test the importance of Ser408 and Tyr477 in the interaction
of Ad2 knob with CAR D1, these residues were mutated to the
corresponding residues in Ad12 knob, proline and serine, re￾spectively, and the interaction of the resulting Ad2 knob mu￾tants S408P and Y447S with CAR D1 was characterized in the
fluorescence anisotropy assay (Fig. 4). The affinity of Ad2 knob
S408P was decreased by approximately a factor of 2, whereas
the affinity of Ad2 knob Y477S was decreased 100-fold (Table
I). The converse mutants also were constructed to determine
whether additional contacts contributed by these residues
would increase the binding affinity of Ad12 knob. Equilibrium
binding studies showed that the resulting Ad12 knob mutants
P417S and S489Y both had increased affinity for CAR D1
(Table I and Fig. 4), consistent with the model that the side
chains of both mutant residues make positive contacts with
CAR D1. A double mutant, introducing both point mutations
into Ad12 knob, further increased the binding affinity to 28 nM,

X-ray Structures of Ad12 Knob Mutants in a Binary Complex
with CAR D1—To further investigate the interactions that
contribute to the increased binding affinity of the Ad12 knob
mutants P417S and S489Y, x-ray structures of the two mutant
proteins in binary complexes with CAR D1 were solved to 3 Å
resolution (Table II). Data sets were essentially isomorphous to
the native data sets, resulting in corresponding structures that
are very similar to the native structure. Backbone atoms of
wild type Ad12 knob-CAR D1 and Ad12 knob P417S-CAR D1
were superimposable with a root mean square deviation of 0.1
Å, indicating that the overall main chain structures are iden￾tical and that CAR D1 was bound in the same conformation and
orientation in both the mutant and wild type complexes. Back￾bone atoms of wild type Ad12 knob-CAR D1 and Ad12 knob
S489Y-CAR D1 also were superimposable with a root mean
square deviation of 0.1 Å, again indicating identical conforma￾tions and orientation of bound CAR D1. The -hydroxyl group
of the serine residue introduced into the AB loop of Ad12 knob
(P417S) is within hydrogen bonding distance of the O1 atom of
CAR D1 residue Glu56 (Fig. 5b) and thus potentially could form
an additional hydrogen bond within the knob-CAR D1 inter￾face. No other conformational changes, with the exception of a
rotation of the side chain of CAR D1 residue Asp54 at the C
atom, were observed compared with the structure of the wild
type binary complex, suggesting that the increase in affinity of
this mutant may be a direct consequence of the serine residue
at position 417. The crystal structure of the Ad12 knob S489Y￾CAR D1 complex indicated that the extended length of the
tyrosine residue side chain at residue 489 increased its poten￾tial to form additional hydrogen bonds with CAR D1 that
cannot form by the corresponding serine residue in wild type
Ad12 knob. The OH group of knob residue Tyr489 was within
hydrogen bonding distance of the backbone oxygen and nitro￾gen atoms of CAR D1 residues Pro52 and Ala125 (Fig. 6b).
Rotation of the side chain of CAR D1 residue Asp54 again was
the only observed change in conformation as compared with the
wild type Ad12 knob-CAR D1 structure. The substantial in￾crease in affinity of Ad12 knob mutant S489Y for CAR D1
therefore likely results from formation of two additional hydro￾gen bonds and burial of the tyrosine aromatic side chain.
DISCUSSION
Evolution of adenoviruses under immunoselective pressure
has resulted in antigenic drift of surface residues, including
those within the receptor-binding sites of the fiber protein knob
domain. Despite this high degree of surface variation, many
adenovirus serotypes attach to cells through interaction with
CAR, a membrane glycoprotein that also serves as a cellular
receptor for group B coxsackieviruses. Investigation of the in￾teraction of fiber proteins from different adenovirus serotypes
with CAR D1 therefore presents an opportunity to estimate the
range of solutions to the molecular recognition problem that
occur in a natural system. With the exception of Ad12 knob, it
has so far not been possible to directly view the interaction of
knobs from other adenovirus serotypes with CAR by x-ray
crystallography. Here we circumvented this problem by using
the x-ray structure of Ad12 knob-CAR D1 binary complex as a
template to model contact residues on the surface of other knob
serotypes and predict how binding affinity and specificity
might be affected by variation of contact residues.
Ad2 knob was chosen for this initial modeling study because
it binds to CAR D1 with significantly greater affinity than does
Ad12 knob (Table I). Equilibrium binding studies were per￾formed using fluorescence anisotropy measurements of CAR
D1 labeled with fluorescein at a specific site. Affinity values
calculated from the anisotropy measurements were lower
(weaker) than have been previously observed in other in vitro
assays, such as surface plasmon resonance (31, 32). These
differences in affinity probably can be attributed to the absence
of avidity effects in complex formation. In binding assays such
as surface plasmon resonance, either the receptor or the ligand
is immobilized, thereby limiting the association event to a
two-dimensional surface. By contrast in the fluorescence ani￾sotropy assay used here, both interacting species are in solu￾tion, and the affinity values therefore reflect individual binding
events. Although the absolute affinity values obtained by fluo￾rescence anisotropy probably underestimate the actual overall
affinity of knob for membrane-associated CAR, the values ob￾tained by this method are useful for characterizing the contri￾bution of individual amino acid residues within the knob-CAR
interface. Equilibrium binding affinity measurements using
the fluorescence anisotropy assay showed that Ad2 knob bound
CAR D1 with an 8-fold greater affinity compared with Ad12
knob (Table I). The increased affinity of Ad2 knob indicates
that its receptor-binding sites overall make more favorable
contacts with CAR D1 than do the binding sites of Ad12 knob.
Binding site fitness could be improved either by increasing the
number of favorable contacts or by eliminating contacts that
interfere with stable binding.
The homology model of the Ad2 knob-CAR D1 complex pre￾dicted that two residues of Ad2 knob, Ser408 and Tyr477, could
contribute additional hydrogen bonds and other contacts that
may account for the greater affinity of Ad2 knob for CAR D1
(Fig. 3). These predictions were well supported by mutagenesis
studies, where substitution of serine and tyrosine for the cor￾responding residues in Ad12 knob increased its affinity for
CAR D1, whereas the converse mutations decreased the affin￾ity of Ad2 knob for CAR D1. Prior studies using kinetic-based
measurements indicated that Ad12 knob has a slower on-rate
but similar off-rate compared with Ad2 and Ad5 knobs (31, 32).

 at Univ of St Andrews on March 6, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from  Although kinetic parameters cannot be determined from the
equilibrium binding assay used here, it is likely that the P417S
and S489Y mutations increase the association rate of Ad12
knob through the formation of more favorable interfacial con￾tacts. The P417S and S489Y mutations are located in the Ad12
knob AB and DE loops, respectively, which is consistent with
the earlier conclusion that individual residues within these two
loops make substantial contributions to binding affinity (24,
30). Importantly, whereas several earlier studies have pre￾dicted contact residues in knob serotypes based on amino acid
sequence alignments with Ad12 knob (14, 24, 30, 32, 38), here
through the use of homology modeling we were able to identify
a novel contact residue in Ad2 knob (Y477) that does not have
a functionally equivalent counterpart in Ad12 knob. Substitu￾tion of tyrosine for the positionally equivalent residue in Ad12
(Ser489) resulted in an 8-fold increase in binding affinity.
To directly investigate the contribution of individual resi￾dues to binding affinity, we crystallized and solved the struc￾tures of two Ad12 knob mutants, P417S and S489Y, in complex
with CAR D1. No changes in the relative positions of knob and
CAR D1 components were detected in the resulting 3 Å reso￾lution structures, as compared with the wild type complex, and
no significant perturbations of the Ad12 knob structure were
detected for either mutant. The structures support predictions
from modeling studies that each substituted residue forms
additional hydrogen bonds with CAR D1. Homology modeling
also predicted that the protruding aromatic side chain of Ad2
knob residue Tyr477 would reduce the size of a cavity that forms
in the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 interface (24), possibly excluding
some nonstructural water molecules that become trapped in
the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 complex. Burial of an aromatic side
chain can play a critical role in stabilizing protein-protein
interactions. For example, in the interaction of human immu￾nodeficiency virus with its cellular receptor CD4, insertion of
CD4 residue F43 into a cavity on the surface of gp120 accounts
for 23% of interatomic contacts at the interface (39). The 100-

Variation in Adenovirus Affinity for CAR 26213
 at Univ of St Andrews on March 6, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from   fold decrease in Ad2 knob binding affinity resulting from mu￾tation Y477S indicates that Tyr477 also makes a large contri￾bution to binding affinity, although the precise role of the
residue cannot be fully understood without determining a high
resolution structure of the Ad2 knob-CAR D1 complex. The
relatively smaller effect of tyrosine at the equivalent position in
Ad12 knob (mutant S489Y) suggests that the contribution of
individual contact residues to binding affinity may be context￾dependent. At 3 Å resolution it was not possible to determine
the impact of the S489Y mutation on the size and solvent
content of interfacial cavities.
The high degree of variation in contact residues among CAR￾binding serotypes and the observed tight range of binding
affinities (variations over a 10-fold range have been meas￾ured by surface plasmon resonance (31, 32) with the exception
of Ad9 knob (32)) suggest that the knob domain architecture
may be specialized to minimize the impact of mutations on
binding site structure and function. The receptor binding sites
of knob consist of surface loops that are supported by an un￾usually stable, trimeric scaffold, and in this regard have a
similar architecture to the antigen binding sites of antibodies.
Although the range of molecular targets recognized by knob
domains of natural adenoviruses appears limited to a small
number of cellular receptors, this narrow range undoubtedly
reflects the strong selective pressure on the virus to retain
sufficient binding affinity to successfully infect host cells. It is
probable that the natural evolution of binding specificity is a
multi-step process where the loss of affinity for the initial
receptor and gain of affinity for a novel receptor occur simul￾taneously. Multivalent binding may compensate for relatively
weak or low affinity binding at individual sites, enabling virus
to bind tightly enough to infect host cells (31). In addition,
certain adenovirus serotypes have two independent fiber genes
(40), which may have provided an alternate means for inde￾pendent evolution of novel binding specificity. Changes in fiber
protein binding specificity during virus evolution likely contrib￾uted to the overall success of adenoviruses as human and
animal pathogens. The utility of adenovirus-based vectors for
use in gene therapy or as recombinant virus vaccines also
might be enhanced by rational modification of fiber protein
binding specificity. The availability of bacterial expression sys￾tems for recombinant knob domain (5) and of methods for
structure-guided mutagenesis and directed protein evolution
(41) now can be exploited to investigate the potential of the
knob scaffold to interact with a broad range of molecular
targets.
