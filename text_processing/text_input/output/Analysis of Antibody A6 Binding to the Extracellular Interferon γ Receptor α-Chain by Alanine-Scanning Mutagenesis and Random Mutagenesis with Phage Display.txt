ABSTRACT: The monoclonal antibody A6 binds a conformational epitope comprising mainly the CC′ surface
loop on the N-terminal fibronectin type-III domain of the extracellular interferon γ receptor (IFNγR).
The crystal structure of an A6 Fab-IFNγR complex revealed an interface rich in the aromatic side chains
of Trp, Tyr, and His residues. These aromatic side chains appear to interact with both polar and hydrophobic
groups at the interface, a property which, in general, may be advantageous for ligand binding. To analyze
these interactions in more detail, the affinities of 19 A6 alanine-scanning mutants for the IFNγR have
been measured, using engineered A6 single chain variable region fragments, and a surface plasmon
resonance biosensor. Energetically important side chains (∆Gmutant - ∆Gwt > 2.4 kcal/mol), that form
distinct hot spots in the binding interface, have been identified on both proteins. These include VLW92
in A6, whose benzenoid ring appears well situated for a π-cation (or π-amine) interaction with the side
chain of receptor residue K47 and simultaneously for T-stacking onto the indole ring of W82 in the
receptor. At another site, energetically important residues VHW52 and VHW53, as well as VHD54 and
VHD56, surround the aliphatic side chain of the hot receptor residue K52. Taken together, the results
show that side chains distributed across the interface, including many aromatic ones, make key energetic
contributions to binding. In addition, the receptor CC′ loop has been subjected to random mutagenesis,
and receptor mutants with high affinity for A6 have been selected by phage display. Residues previously
identified as important for receptor binding to A6 were conserved in the clones isolated. Some mutants,
however, showed a much improved affinity for A6, due to changes at Glu55, a residue that appeared to
be energetically unimportant for binding the antibody by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. An E55P receptor
mutant bound A6 with a 600-fold increase in affinity (KD ≈ 20 pM), which is one of the largest
improvements in affinity from a single point mutation reported so far at any protein-protein interface.
The extracellular portion of the interferon γ receptor
R-chain (1) (IFNγR)1 comprises two FBN-III domains that
together are responsible for binding IFNγ at the cell surface.
The crystal structure of a complex formed between the
neutralizing murine mAb A6 and the N-terminal FBN-III
domain showed that the surface of the receptor contacted
by A6 overlaps significantly with that bound by IFNγ in
the ligand-receptor complex (2, 3). The A6 epitope encom￾passes largely the CC′ hairpin loop on the receptor, although
contact is also made with the neighboring F-strand (Figure
1). The antigen-antibody interface buries ca. 1660 Å2 of
protein surface, which includes 22 antibody residues from 5
CDRs and 11 residues from the receptor.
Antibody-antigen complexes remain interesting targets
for mechanistic studies of protein-protein recognition, not
least because high-affinity protein-protein interactions un￾derlie many important processes in biology. Such studies are
also of interest in the context of designing proteins, and
smaller molecules, with novel recognition sites. One feature
of interest in this case is the high concentration of aromatic
groups (six Tyr, six Trp, and one His) located at the A6-
IFNγR interface (four in VL, six in VH, and three in the
receptor). This reflects a broader tendency for aromatic

Published on Web 12/01/2000groups to be over-represented statistically in antigen binding
sites on antibodies (4, 5) and also, more generally, at
protein-protein interfaces (6-8). The crystal structure of
the A6-IFNγR complex reveals several aromatic rings which
might participate in multiple types of interaction simulta￾neously, a property that may be relevant to their frequent
occurrence in antigen binding sites. The energetic importance
of such interactions is, therefore, of considerable interest.
We describe here new data on the contribution to binding
affinity of antibody side chains buried at the A6-IFNγR
interface, which complements earlier studies involving
mutagenesis of the receptor (9). An experimental system for
the study of an A6 scFv fragment is described, together with
affinity measurements of scFv alanine-scanning mutants (10)
using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor (BIACORE,
Biacore AB). In addition, the receptor CC′ loop has been
subjected to random mutagenesis and receptor mutants have
been selected by phage display that have almost 3 orders of
magnitude higher affinity for A6 than the wt. In particular,
an E55P mutant has an approximately 600-fold higher
affinity for the antibody, although the residue Glu55 appeared
by alanine-scanning mutagenesis to be energetically unim￾portant for binding to the antibody.
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
General. DNA and protein manipulations were as de￾scribed in ref 11.
Production of IFNγR with an Engineered C-Terminal Cys.
The phagemid pOCI656 described earlier (2) was used as
template DNA in a PCR with the primers: left 1, 5′-
GGATTGTTATTACTCGCGGC-3′; right 1: 5′-TTCTGCG￾GCCGCCTAACAAGAACCTTTTATACTGC-3′.
The left 1 primer binds to a sequence upstream of the SfiI
and NcoI sites, present also in the parent phagemid pHEN1
(12). The right 1 primer (NotI site underlined; Cys and stop
codons in italics) encodes the C-terminus of the receptor on
the complementary strand, i.e., ...Ser224-Ser225-Ile226-Lys227-
Gly228-Ser229-Cys-stop. When the PelB signal peptide is
cleaved, the receptor from Glu1-Met2
-Gly3... to Ser229 with
an additional Cys residue after Ser229 is produced and secreted
into the Escherichia coli periplasm. The PCR product was
digested with NotI and NcoI and cloned into NcoI/NotI
digested pHEN1 to give pOCI1110. The nt sequence of the
insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Plasmid pOCI1110 was introduced into E. coli HB2151.
The recombinant receptor was produced using a method
described earlier (2), except that after the periplasmic
extraction, â-mercaptoethanol (5 mM) was added to all
buffers, and purification included immunoaffinity chroma￾tography with antibody A6 coupled to CNBr-activated
Sepharose (Pharmacia). After purification, the receptor was
homogeneous by SDS-PAGE, gave an electrospray mass
spectrum consistent with the calculated mass (25 970 Da),
and the correct N-terminal sequence by Edman degradation.
The protein was stable for at least 2 months at 4 °C in
BIACORE buffer [sodium phosphate (50 mM), pH 7.2, NaCl
(150 mM) and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant p20] containing
â-mercaptoethanol (5 mM) and EDTA (5 mM). Upon
prolonged storage, proteolysis led to the partial loss of the
five N-terminal residues. This did not appear to affect
recognition by A6.
Production and Characterization of A6 wt scFV. The
primers left 1 and right 2 were used in a PCR with phagemid
pOCI455 (13) as template: right 2, 5′-CCGGAATTCGCG￾GCCGCTTACCGTTTCAGCTCCAGCTTGGTC-3′.
The primer right 2 encodes, on the complementary strand,
the C-terminus of VL up to VLR108 (14) followed im￾mediately by a stop codon (underlined) and further down￾stream an EcoRI site (underlined). The PCR product was
digested with SfiI and EcoRI and cloned between the same
sites in the vector pHB110 (15) to produce pOCI1103. This
encodes a PelB leader sequence fused to the N-terminus of
VH, followed by the (G4S)3 linker, and VL up to and including
VLR108. The leader peptide is cleaved during transport into
the periplasm to give A6 scFv with residues Q1V2K3
... at
the N-terminus.
The A6 scFv was produced by minor modifications to
methods described earlier (13). The plasmid pOCI1103 was
introduced into E. coli HB2151. The IPTG concentration for
induction was 1 mM, and after induction, growth was at 26
°C for ca. 16 h. A periplasmic extract was made using a
method described earlier for production of the IFNγR (2).
The A6 scFv was purified by immunoaffinity chromatog￾raphy with Trx-IFNγR1-108 (16) coupled to CNBr-activated
Sepharose, as described earlier (13). The protein from this
column was applied to a MonoS ion-exchange column
(Pharmacia) equilibrated in sodium phosphate buffer (50
mM, pH 6.8). The nativelike scFv eluted in the flow-through,
whereas impurities could be eluted from the column in a
salt gradient (0 to 0.5 M NaCl). The resulting protein showed
a single band by SDS-PAGE, gave an electrospray mass
spectrum consistent with the calculated mass, and the correct
N-terminal sequence by Edman degradation.
The concentration of A6 scFv in PBS buffer [sodium
phosphate 50 mM, NaCl (150 mM), pH 7.4] was determined
by absorption at 280 nm (A280), using A280 ) 2.9 mg mL-1
after calibration by quantitative amino acid analysis. Gel
filtration chromatography of A6 scFv was in PBS buffer on
a TSK-GEL G3000SW column (7.5 × 600 mm) (Tosohass,
Stuttgart) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. CD spectra were
recorded in PBS buffer using a Jasco J720 instrument at 25
°C. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed using a
Beckman XL-A instrument at 5 °C and 25 °C, at both 0.5
and 5 µM protein concentration in PBS buffer, at a rotor
speed of 22 000 rpm. Data were acquired by averaging 20
radial scans at a spacing of 0.001 cm, and analyzed assuming
FIGURE 1: Ribbon diagram of the IFNγR1-108-A6 Fab complex
(2). The Fv (VH + VL) region of A6 is shown complexed to the
N-terminal FBN-III domain of the receptor (PDB file 1JRH).

and at the meniscus, respectively, R is the gas constant, and

Production of Mutant scFV. Mutations were introduced
into the cDNA encoding the scFv by PCR with a mutagenic
primer, using the method described earlier for mutagenesis
of the receptor (9). The mutant scFvs were produced and
purified by the same method used for the wt protein (see
above), but also included gel filtration chromatography (see
above). Each mutant showed one band of ca. 26 kDa on
SDS-PAGE. CD spectra were recorded as for the wt (see
above).
BIACORE Binding Assays. The IFNγR1-229 containing a
C-terminal c-myc tag, produced and purified as described
earlier (9), was immobilized on a CM5 sensor surface
(Biacore AB) by random amine coupling, using a method
described earlier (2).
The IFNγR1-229 with an engineered Cys residue near the
C-terminus (see above) was immobilized on CM5 sensor
surfaces by thiol exchange. The surface was activated by
injection of N-hydroxysuccinimide (50 mM) and N-ethyl￾N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (200 mM) in water
for 3 min, followed by 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethylamine (80
mM) in borate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.5) for 1 min, and then
Cys-containing IFNγR1-229 (20 µg/mL) in sodium acetate
buffer (10 mM, pH 4.0) for 2 min. Excess disulfides were
blocked by injecting cysteine (50 mM) in formate buffer (0.1
M, pH 4.3) containing NaCl (1 M).
Binding curves were measured in BIACORE buffer at 25
°C. Association constants (KA) were determined under
equilibrium conditions from Scatchard plots according to the
following equation (17, 18):
where Req is the steady-state response, C is the protein
concentration in the flow buffer, and Rmax is the maximum
surface binding capacity. KA can be derived from the gradient
of a plot of Req/C versus Req at different analyte concentra￾tions (C). The standard deviation of the KA determination
upon repeated measurement with the same protein sample
was typically (5%. For kinetic analyses, an equation for a
simple 1:1 interaction (eq 3) was fitted globally to binding
curves collected at various analyte concentrations using the
BIAevaluation software (v.3.0) (Biacore AB) (19):
where R is the response in RU and kon and koff are the
association and dissociation rate constants.
Construction of pOCI1009. A PCR reaction was performed
using the oligonucleotides primer 1 and primer 2 (see Table
1 in Supporting Information) and pOCI656 (2) as template
DNA. A DNA fragment of the expected size (ca. 300 bp)
was isolated by gel electrophoresis, digested with NotI and
ClaI and subsequently ligated in NotI and ClaI digested
pOCI656, to afford pOCI1009 (Figure 2). The nt sequence
was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Preparation of Control Phage. A tetracycline resistance
gene was excised from pBR322 on a 1.4 kb EcoRI-AVaI
fragment and the 5′ ends were blunted using the Klenow
fragment of PolI. The fragment was ligated in DraI digested
pHEN1 (12) to afford pOCI1005. The ampicillin (amp)
resistance gene of pHEN1 is removed from the plasmid by
the DraI digestion.
ELISA Phage Panning. The method for phage panning was
modified from (20). ELISA plates were coated overnight at
4 °C with mAb A6 (200 µL of 10 µg/mL). After washing
three times with phosphate buffered saline [PBS; sodium
phosphate, 50 mM, pH 7.2, and NaCl (150 mM)], the wells
were incubated with PBS containing 1% BSA (200 µL) and
incubated 2 h at 37 °C. The ELISA plate was washed again
three times with PBS and finally the phagemid particles (ca.
109) were added in PBS containing 1% BSA and the plate
was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed 25
times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and 15 times
with PBS, incubated 30 min at 20 °C, and finally washed
10 times with PBS. Bound phagemid particles were eluted
with glycine buffer (200 µL, 50 mM, pH 2.5). The eluted
material was neutralized with phosphate buffer (2 M, pH
7.5) and used for transfection of logarithmic growing E. coli
XL1-blue cells.
Library Construction. A PCR was performed with the
oligonucleotides primer 3 and primer 4 (see Table 1 in
Supporting Information) and pOCI1009 as template. The
product of the PCR was gel purified and used together with
primer 5 in a second PCR again using pOCI1009 as template
DNA. The resulting PCR product (ca. 800 bp) was gel
purified, digested with NcoI, NotI, and cloned in NcoI/NotI
digested pOCI1009, yielding plasmid pOCI1010 in which
the cDNA encoding the central portion of the CC′ receptor
loop has been deleted (Figure 2).

A total of 31.9 pmol of each of the six oligonucleotides was
annealed in the appropriate combinations by 5 min heating
at 95 °C and slowly cooling to 30 °C (30 min). The
complementary strands were synthesized by extension of the
3′ ends by adding 1 mM dNTP and 20 units of klenow
fragment of PolI and continued incubation at 30 °C for 1 h.
The resulting double-stranded DNA was digested with
Asp718 and MluI and then ligated in Asp718 and MluI
digested pOCI1010. Introduction of the ligated DNA into
E. coli XL1-blue cells was by electroporation using a
genepulser (Bio-Rad). Colonies were pooled in fractions and
frozen in 20% glycerol.
Preparation of Phage. Frozen stocks were used to
inoculate 2YT (25 mL) containing 1% glucose and ampicillin
(100 µg/mL). The culture was grown for 4 h at 37 °C and
the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4000 rpm) and
washed once with 2YT. The cells were resuspended in 2YT
and M13KO7 phage was added at a multiplicity of infection
of 40. After 20 min incubation at 37 °C without shaking,
incubation was continued for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking. Then
kanamycin (20 µg/mL) was added to the culture, which was
20-fold diluted in fresh 2YT containing ampicillin (100 µg/
mL) and kanamycin (20 µg/mL) and grown overnight at 37
°C.
Glycine-eluted phage obtained after a round of panning
was directly used to infect logarithmic growing E. coli XL1-
blue. The cells were pregrown on 2YT containing 1%
glucose to an OD600 of 1.0. After 20 min incubation at 37
°C without shaking, incubation was continued at 37 °C with
shaking for 1 h. At this point ampicillin (100 µg/mL) was
added to the culture and incubation was continued for 4 h at
37 °C. Infected cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000
rpm and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2YT containing
ampicillin (100 µg/mL). Infection by M13KO7 phage was
as described above. Phagemid particles from liquid cultures
were obtained as described by (21).
Production of Mutant Receptor Proteins. The E55P mutant
IFNγR1-229 cDNA was prepared by site-specific mutagenesis
and PCR using methods described elsewhere (9). Production
and purification of wt IFNγR and mutant proteins, each fused
to a C-terminal c-myc tag, was as described previously (2).
For competition BIACORE, proteins were produced that
lacked the c-myc tag, and these were purified by immunoaf￾finity chromatography with A6. The homogeneity of purified
proteins were confirmed (>95%) by SDS-PAGE, and the
masses by electrospray mass spectrometry.
Competition ELISA. KDs of the wt IFNγR and mutant
proteins binding to A6 were determined by competition
ELISA as described earlier (9).
Competition BIACORE Measurements. The wt IFNγR1-229
was immobilized on CM5 sensor surfaces by random amine
coupling, as described earlier (2). The level of immobilized
receptor corresponded to g10 000 RU. The wt A6 scFv
together with various concentrations of wt IFNγR1-229 were
preincubated for at least 1 h at 4 °C, before injection over
the IFNγR1-229-sensor surface (flow rate 25 µL/min, injection
volume 150 µL). At least 10 binding curves with different
concentrations of IFNγR1-229 were measured. Each measure￾ment was performed at least in duplicate. The slopes of the
association phases were determined using BIAevaluation,
software v.3.0, and were plotted against the total antigen
concentration. The KD was determined by fitting to eq 4 (22)
using KALEIDAGRAPH (Synergy Software, PA):
where robs is the slope at a given [Agtot], rmax is the maximal
slope in the absence of inhibition by co-incubated antigen,
[Abtot] is the total scFv concentration, [Agtot] is the total
antigen concentration, and KD is the dissociation constant.
RESULTS
Expression of Extracellular IFNγR. The wt IFNγR,
residues 1-229 (IFNγR1-229), fused at the C-terminus via a
short -Ala3- linker to a c-myc peptide tag (23), was produced

Mutagenesis of A6 Antibody Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 51, 2000 15677in E. coli using a secretion expression system described
earlier (2). IFNγR1-229 with a cysteine residue engineered
at the C-terminus (but without the c-myc tag) was produced
in the same way. Both proteins were purified by immunoaf￾finity chromatography, using either immobilized A6 mAb
or the 9E10 mAb against the c-myc tag (23).
Expression and Properties of A6 scFV. The A6 scFv
fragment comprising the VH domain connected through a
linker [(G4S)3] to the VL chain with a c-myc tag attached to
the C-terminus (yield ≈ 0.3 mg/L), was produced and
purified as described earlier (13). However, the yields of
some A6 mutants made in this way were much lower, so an
improved expression system was implemented. The wt A6
scFv coding region was cloned into vector pHB110, which
also contains the E. coli skp gene (15). After purification,
the scFv was obtained in a yield of ∼1.2 mg/L. Eleven of
the 19 mutants were obtained in the same way in about the
same yield as wt, the VHH100bA, VLW92A, VLY91A, VH￾D54A, and VLW96A mutants were obtained in 5-6-fold
lower yield, and the VHW53A, VHW52A and VHD55A
mutants in ∼10-fold lower yields.
When micromolar solutions of wt A6 scFv were diluted
to 100 nM and injected over a biosensor surface displaying
immobilized IFNγR, the shape of the binding curve was seen
to change with elapsed time (over ∼60 min) after dilution
from the stock solution (data not shown). Freshly diluted
sample gave a pronounced biphasic binding curve with a
significant contribution from a component with a very slow
dissociation rate. The binding curves at later times resembled
those typical for a 1:1 interaction with a fast dissociating
species. Such behavior could be explained by a dynamic
equilibrium between monomeric and multimeric forms of
A6 scFv. Upon sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultra￾centrifugation, the fit of a model which assumed a single
molecular species to the sedimentation data was influenced
by the temperature and the protein concentration. At a higher
protein concentration (5 µM) and 5 °C, the apparent
molecular weight was higher than expected and the fitting
was poor. A 10-fold dilution to 0.5 µM and measurement at
25 °C, however, gave a molecular weight determination (27.9
kDa) close to the calculated mass with good fitting of the
model (Figure 3). Gel filtration chromatography of A6 scFv
at high protein concentrations also indicated the presence of
dimer, which disappeared from chromatograms upon dilution
of the scFv to <1µM protein concentration (data not shown).
Data from gel filtration, analytical ultracentrifugation and
biosensor measurements provide mutually supportive evi￾dence that the wt A6 scFv has a tendency to dimerize at
high concentrations. The propensity of scFvs to dimerize is
well-known, and has been demonstrated for several different
antibody fragments (20, 24-29).
The CD spectrum of the wt scFv (Figure 4) shows a trough
at 219 nm with a change to positive ellipticity below 211
nm, which is typical of all-â-proteins (30). A positive band
is seen at 233 nm, which is indicative of an exciton couplet.
Two pairs of Trp side chains have closely neighboring indole
rings, VHW47 with VLW96, and VHW53 with VHW52. In
CD spectra of scFv mutants VLW96A, VHW52A, and VH￾W53A, the positive peak at 233 nm is significantly reduced
in intensity relative to the band at 219 nm, consistent with
one or both of these Trp pairs being responsible for the
exciton couplet. In the near-UV CD spectrum of wt scFv, a
weak positive peak at 272 nm is also found (not shown).
The far-UV CD spectra of most other scFv mutants (except
VLY91A, VHD54A, and VHD55A, which were not measured)
were similar to that of the wt scFv (Figure 4). This group
includes mutants that show large changes in KD for the
receptor (e.g., VLW92A, VHH100bA, VHD56A) as well as
others where the KD is little changed (VLT94A and VHF98A).
The mutants VLS93A, VLE27A, VLD28A, and VHY58A,
whose KDs were also not significantly changed, showed small
differences in the relative intensity of the positive ellipticity
at 205 nm compared to wt.
The CD spectra indicate that the wt immunoglobulin fold
is retained in the mutants, although local changes in
conformation of the CDR loops cannot be ruled out.
Biosensor Measurements with wt scFV. In a first series of
experiments, the IFNγR1-229 protein with a c-myc tag at the
C-terminus was immobilized on the biosensor surface by
random amine coupling. Monomeric scFv was purified by
gel filtration, and the absence of dimer in the resulting protein
was confirmed upon rechromatography. When the scFv
concentration was varied in the range 3-100 nM, the binding

The residuals indicate the deviation of the data points from the

From the overlay it is apparent that the CD spectra of wt and
mutants are all very similar to each other.
15678 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 51, 2000 Lang et al.curves gave linear Scatchard plots and a KD of 12 nM. A
kinetic analysis of the data gave an apparent kon of 1.1 ×
106 M-1 s-1 and an apparent koff of 1.4 × 10-2 s-1
. A linear
Scatchard plot was also obtained from data on the binding
of IFNγR1-229 protein to immobilized A6 mAb, and the
measured KDs were 13 and 15 nM (composed of kon ) 6.1
× 105 M-1 s-1 and koff ) 0.87 × 10-2 s-1
) from steady state
and kinetic analyses, respectively. Determination of apparent
kon and koff values using three different densities of im￾mobilized IFNγR1-229 and three different flow rates showed
that mass transport effects had little influence on binding
under the conditions used to determine KD values.
In a second series of experiments, IFNγR1-229 with an
engineered Cys at the C-terminus was immobilized on the
biosensor surface through the free thiol. A steady-state
analysis of scFv binding to this surface gave a linear
Scatchard plot and a KD of 12 nM (Figure 5). Hence, the
random amine coupling procedure does not significantly
affect the affinity of A6 for its epitope on the receptor.
Biosensor Measurements with scFV Mutants. Nineteen
scFv mutants were prepared and their affinities to the receptor
analyzed (Table 1). Since biosensor assays can be signifi￾cantly affected by the presence of even small amounts of
dimeric species (31), the mutant scFvs were purified by gel
filtration prior to measurements with the BIACORE instru￾ment, and where possible, the scFv concentration was kept
below 500 nM. Dissociation constants (KD) were determined
by steady-state analyses from Scatchard plots (Table 1 and
Figure 5). The KD values measured in duplicate experiments
were generally within (20% of the mean value, the variation
probably reflecting the accuracy of the determination. Only
for several low affinity mutants was the standard deviation
higher. For the wt scFv and some mutants, the association
phase of the binding curves fitted well to a simple 1:1 binding
model using global kinetic analysis, whereas, for other scFv
mutants, significant biphasic association phases were appar￾ent under all conditions examined.
Display of the IFNγR on Phage. The phagemid pOCI1009,
encoding the extracellular IFNγR1-229 cDNA fused to a
truncated M13 gene III, was prepared such that the TAG
amber stop codon of IFNγR was directly adjacent to codon
246 of M13 gene III. In this way two GGGGS repeats were
placed between the IFNγR and the C-terminal domain of
gene III protein.
The ability of the recombinant IFNγR-phage to bind to
mAb A6 coated ELISA plates was assessed in competition
with a control phage (pOCI1005) without the receptor but
containing a tet resistance gene. After panning a 1:1 mixture
of pOCI1009- and pOCI1005-phage particles on immobilized
mAb A6, phage particles that displayed IFNγR (pOCI1009)
were enriched about 60-100 fold over the control phages
(pOCI1005). No specific enrichment of pOCI1009 was seen
when an excess (1 µM) of mAb A6 or IFNγR was added to
the starting phage mixture. These results indicated that
correctly folded and functional IFNγR extracellular domains
were present on the phage surface.
Library Construction. To facilitate random mutagenesis
of the CC′ loop, the phagemid pOCI1009 was modified such
that most of the DNA encoding the CC′ loop was deleted, a
stop codon was introduced in the reading frame of IFNγR,
and Asp718 and MluI restriction sites were introduced in the
flanking regions (Figure 2). The resulting phagemid (pO￾CI1010) does not encode a functional wt receptor protein.
Function can be restored by inserting a cassette between the
Asp718 and MluI restriction sites that encodes a loop of the
desired length with selected positions randomized.
Three separate libraries were constructed. In the first
library, the receptor residues E45.V46.K47.N48.Y49
were randomized, in the second, receptor residues
Y49.G50.V51.K52.N53, and in library three, residues
N53.S54.E55.W56.I57. The three libraries together encom￾pass the entire hairpin loop sequence bound by the A6
antibody (see Figure 11). Additional and different silent
mutations in the nt sequence were also introduced into the
flanking constant regions in each library as a distinguishing
feature to allow detection of cross-contamination, although
none was found.
The insert frequency for each library ranged from 86 to
93%. The codon usage determined from 105 clones was close
to random with no large bias in the inserted nucleotides and
no over representation of any specific codons. The sizes of
the libraries ranged from 1.8 × 107 to 4.3 × 107 independent
clones and were considered large enough to contain all or
almost all of the possible protein sequences.
Phage Panning. Phage panning was carried out for four
consecutive rounds. After the last round individual colonies
were randomly chosen for nt sequencing. Approximately 50
clones from each library were sequenced and the deduced
translated protein sequences are given in Table 2. A statistical

measurements with the wt A6 scFv. Inset is the same data presented
as a plot of equilibrium sensor response (Req) against analyte
concentration (M). B, is the same treatment of data for the VH￾H100bA mutant.
Mutagenesis of A6 Antibody Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 51, 2000 15679analysis of the occurrence of amino acid types at each
position in each library is shown in Figure 6.
IFNγR Mutants. Several of the most frequently found
mutant receptors in each library were produced as soluble
proteins, as described for the wt receptor and in similar
yields. The mutants EHKWY and ENKWY (from library 1,
Table 2) could not be purified, as they were unstable upon
acid elution from the 9E10 immunoaffinity column.
The affinity of mutant IFNγR for A6 was first assayed
by competition ELISA, and apparent KDs were determined
for mutants from libraries 1 and 2 (Figure 7). In the same
assay, the mutant receptors recovered from library 3 pos￾sessed a 2-3 orders of magnitude higher affinity for A6 than
the wt receptor. The single mutant E55P, although not
isolated from library 3, was generated by site-specific
mutagenesis, produced in E. coli, and its affinity for A6 was
also shown by competition ELISA to be much higher than
for the wt. For selected high-affinity mutants the KDs were
determined by competition BIAcore (Figure 8 and Table 3).
The results indicate an important effect of mutation at residue
E55 on affinity to the antibody.
Binding of IFNγ∆10 [lacking the 10 C-terminal residues
(32)] to wt IFNγR immobilized on the biosensor surface was
compared to its binding to immobilized E55P mutant.
Whereas the IFNγ∆10 bound to the wt receptor with
approximately nanomolar affinity (data not shown), binding
to the E55P mutant was largely abolished and could not be
determined by BIACORE.
DISCUSSION
It is noteworthy that the results presented here interlock
well with crystallographic data on the IFNγR-A6 complex
(2), and with the results of earlier alanine-scanning mutagen￾esis studies on the receptor (9). Upon alanine-scanning
mutagenesis of the A6 scFv, three mutations (VLW92A, VH￾W52A, and VHW53A) are seen to have a large impact (2.4-
2.8 kcal/mol) on affinity, nine others (VLY30A, VLW96A,
VHY32A, VHD54A, VHD55A, VHD56A, VHY58A, VHY99A,
and VHH100bA) show significant effects (1-2 kcal/mol),
while seven others (Table 1) have little or no effect (<1 kcal/
mol). The three most important all involve Trp residues, and
each of their side chains appears to be involved in multiple
types of interaction. The benzenoid ring of VLW92 appears
well situated for a π-cation (or π-amine) interaction with
the side chain CE and NZ atoms of receptor residue K47
[both atoms are ∼3.9 Å from the plane of the indole ring
(33)] and for simultaneous T-stacking onto the indole ring
of W82 in the receptor [5.1 Å between the ring centers shown
in Figure 9A (34, 35)]. The VLW92 side chain, therefore,
makes hydrophobic (with W82) and polar (with K47)

relative importance of these and other interactions cannot
presently be assessed. The receptor K47 and W82 side chains
were identified earlier as being energetically important
[affinity change relative to wt upon mutation to alanine, ∼3.6
and 4.5 kcal/mol (9)].
Two other hot residues in the antibody are VHW52 and
VHW53, which together with VHD54 and VHD56, surround
the aliphatic side chain of K52 (Figure 9B) [itself identified
earlier as a hot residue in the receptor (9)]. Many of the
mutations that exhibit significant effects (1-2 kcal/mol) (i.e.,
“warm spots”) surround VHW52 and VHW53 (Figure 10).

Mutagenesis of A6 Antibody Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 51, 2000 15681residues was made in studies of the HyHEL-10-lysozyme
complex (36). The side chain NZ atom of receptor K52 lies
close to the side-chain carboxylate groups of both VHD54
and VHD56 in the antibody. Mutation of either of these two
aspartate residues causes a significant loss in affinity, as does
mutation of VHD55 whose side chain points away from K52
toward bulk solvent (Figure 9B) (Table 1). One explanation
for the effect of the VHD55A mutation might be a change in
the conformation or dynamics of the CDR loop. It is often
unclear to what extent conformational effects influence
alanine-scanning mutagenesis data, although such effects
have often been discussed in the context of antibody-antigen
binding. The indole of VHW52 appears to participate in a
dense network of interactions, since one face lies close to
the four methylene groups of receptor K52, its indole NH
T-stacks with the phenol ring of VHY58, and its other face
(not in contact with K52) T-stacks with the side-chain
imidazole of VHH50. Here also, the relative energetic
importance of these interactions is presently unknown.
Residues Y49 and N53 have also been identified as hot
residues on the receptor (9). The aromatic ring of Y49 fills
a pocket formed between the VH and VL chains of A6. On
the other hand, the side-chain amide NH2 group of residue
N53 appears to be well situated for H-bonding to the
backbone carbonyl CO of VLY91 and the indole ring of VL￾W96 (Figure 9C), and mutation of the latter does have a
significant effect on affinity (Table 1).
The heavy chain residue VHH100b is buried in the
interface (Figure 9D), and its mutation to alanine also leads
to a significant drop in affinity (Table 1). On the other hand,
the buried guanidinium group of VHR95A appears to H-bond
to two backbone carbonyl CO groups of receptor residues
G50 and V51 (Figure 9D), although removal of this Arg side
chain results in only a small loss in affinity. This was
unexpected since the mutation presumably removes two
charged hydrogen bonding interactions.
In summary, the results of alanine-scanning mutagenesis
of both the receptor and A6 reveal that multiple side chains

15682 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 51, 2000 Lang et al.contribute significantly to the energetics of binding, including
both polar and aromatic ones, at different loci across the
interface (Figure 10).
In some protein-protein complexes, relatively few pro￾ductive interactions near the center of the interface dominate
the energetics of association, as found, for example, in the
growth hormone-receptor complex (37), the antibody D1.3-
hen egg white lysozyme complex (38, 39), and the HyHEL￾10-lysozyme complex (40-44). In contrast, the stabilization
of the D1.3-E5.2 antibody-antibody complex (38, 45) is
apparently achieved by the accumulation of several produc￾tive interactions of varying strength over the entire interface.
This also appears to be the case for a VEGF-Fab interface,
which is again rich in aromatic residues (46). However, in
all these cases hot residues on one protein pack against hot
residues on the other across the interface, as also found here
for the A6-IFNγR complex.
Additional interesting information about the A6-IFNγR
interface was obtained using phage display methods and
random mutagenesis. Three libraries of mutants were pre￾pared, in which the CC′ receptor loop was subjected to
random mutagenesis in three five residue sections.
In the first library, the residues E45.V46.K47.N48.Y49
were randomly mutated (Figure 11), so that each position
could be filled by any of the other 20 proteinogenic amino
acids. This region includes residues K47 and Y49, which
were shown by alanine-scanning mutagenesis to be energeti￾cally important (i.e., hot) side chains. These two hot residues,
K47 and Y49, were highly conserved in the clones isolated.
In only three different sequences was Y49 substituted by
His (Figure 6). Unfortunately, two of the most abundant
sequences recovered from this library (EHKWY and EN￾KWY) were refractory to purification as soluble proteins.
Four other mutants were produced, however, and their
affinities for A6, assayed by competition ELISA (Figure 7),
were approximately an order of magnitude higher than seen
for the wt. Since the changes occur in residues that do not
make significant contact with the antibody (E45, V46, and
N48), the origins of the improved affinities presumably lie
in changes to the conformation of the epitope.
In the second library, the residues Y49.G50.V51.K52.N53
at the tip of the CC′ hairpin loop (Figure 11) were
randomized. The hot residues Y49, K52, and N53 (9) were
strictly conserved, as was G50 which is important for
conserving the turn conformation at the tip of the loop
(Figure 6, Table 2). The affinities of six receptor mutants
from this library were shown by competition ELISA to be
about the same or slightly lower than found for the wt (Figure
7).
In the third library, the residues N53.S54.E55.W56.I57
were randomly mutated (Figure 11). Residue N53 was strictly

FIGURE 11: A6 epitope on the IFNγR (2).
Mutagenesis of A6 Antibody Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 51, 2000 15683conserved (Figure 6 and Table 2), consistent with its
identification earlier as a hot residue (9). The W56 residue
was also strongly conserved as either Trp, Tyr, or Phe. The
remaining three positions in the â-strand showed more
variability (Figure 6). S54 was in some cases replaced by a
residue with a small polar, but noncharged side chain (G, T,
A, or P). This side chain is largely buried under the CC′
loop in the antibody-antigen complex (Figure 11), which
presumably restricts the size of group that can be accom￾modated at this position. A Glu residue was not found at
position-55 in the recovered clones, but was most frequently
substituted by Pro. In the A6-IFNγR complex, the E55 side
chain is directed out from the CC′ loop toward bulk solvent.
Earlier studies revealed that S54A and E55A mutants each
have about the same or slightly improved affinity for A6
compared to wt (9). These side chains [beyond C(â)] appear,
therefore, to be nonessential for recognition by A6. Position
I57 in the library could be substituted by a variety of different
residues, with a somewhat stronger preference for polar/
charged residues (Figure 6). This is understandable, since
the side chain of I57 points away from A6 into bulk solvent
(Figure 11).
Six of the most frequently recovered clones from library
3 were produced as soluble proteins. Competition ELISA
clearly showed that all six had a significantly improved
affinity for A6 compared to the wt, by about 2-3 orders of
magnitude (data not shown).
An alternative method of measuring the KDs of these
mutants was investigated, since their affinities are at the
upper limits for accurate quantification by ELISA, and kinetic
BIACORE measurements. Using competition BIACORE, the
KD of the wt receptor for A6 scFv was 12 ( 0.6 nM (Figure
8). This value agrees very well with values determined for
A6 by equilibrium and kinetic BIACORE measurements (2,
9). By competition BIACORE, the KD of the single E55P
mutant for A6 scFv was 20 ( 5 pM (Figure 8), which
represents an increase in affinity of 600-fold (∆∆G ) -3.7
kcal/mol). Four other mutants isolated from library 3 were
analyzed in the same way and gave KDs in the same range
(Table 3). A visual comparison of binding curves from
BIAcore measurements (not shown) with the wt and the five
receptor mutants, under comparable conditions, show that
all have similar on-rates (kon) with A6, but that all mutants
have a much slower dissociation rate (koff). The large increase
in affinity, therefore, arises mainly due to the slower off￾rates.
To set this result in context, single mutations that improve
protein-protein binding have often been found in studies
of both antibody-antigen and growth factor-receptor com￾plexes, although typically the increases in affinity are around
a factor of 10 or less. Only infrequently have larger affinity
improvements arising from a single mutation been observed.
Although the affinity maturation of antibodies is not strictly
comparable to the strategy followed here, during somatic
mutation leading to the anti-lysozyme antibody D1.3, a single
change resulted in a 30-fold increase in affinity (47). Larger
increases in antibody-protein antigen affinity typically occur
only through multiple mutations. For example, affinity
increases of 1230- and 420-fold were seen during maturation
of antibodies against the tumor antigen c-erbB-2 (48) and
gp120 (49), respectively. The 600-fold increase in antigen
affinity seen here with the E55P mutant is one of the largest
increases in affinity reported so far arising from a single point
mutation at any protein-protein interface.
The increased affinity for A6 caused by the E55P mutation
cannot be explained by extra hydrophobic contacts made by
Pro at the interface. The most likely origin of the increase
in binding energy (∼3.7 kcal/mol) would seem to be a change
in the conformation or dynamics of the epitope on the
receptor. It is also possible that small changes in allowed
conformation may lead to an optimization of other interac￾tions (e.g., electrostatic) at the A6-IFNγR interface. A more
detailed explanation requires knowledge of the three￾dimensional structure of the mutant receptor-A6 complex,
which is currently under investigation. Finally, the E55P
mutation was also shown to essentially abolish binding of
the natural ligand IFNγ to the receptor, again most likely
due to a change in the preferred conformation of this
important receptor recognition loop.
The importance of individual interactions at the A6-IFNγR
interface should be amenable to analysis using double mutant
cycles. A practical limitation is the difficulty of accurately
measuring the low binding affinities of double mutants (J.X.,
unpublished work). However, using the receptor E55P mutant
as a starting point for double mutant cycles may allow a
more accurate estimation of binding constants for all mutant
combinations, assuming that the interface is largely unper￾turbed. Details of these double mutant cycles, as well as more
detailed crystallographic studies of the complexes, in par￾ticular to determine the structural consequences of changing
large aromatic residues to alanine at this interface, will be
the subject of future work.
