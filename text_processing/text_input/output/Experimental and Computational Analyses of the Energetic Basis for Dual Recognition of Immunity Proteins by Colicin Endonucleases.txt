Colicin endonucleases (DNases) are bound and inactivated by immunity
(Im) proteins. Im proteins are broadly cross-reactive yet specific inhibitors
binding cognate and non-cognate DNases with Kd values that vary between
10−4 and 10−14 M, characteristics that are explained by a ‘dual-recognition’
mechanism. In this work, we addressed for the first time the energetics of Im
protein recognition by colicin DNases through a combination of E9 DNase
alanine scanning and double-mutant cycles (DMCs) coupled with kinetic
and calorimetric analyses of cognate Im9 and non-cognate Im2 binding, as
well as computational analysis of alanine scanning and DMC data. We
show that differential ΔΔGs observed for four E9 DNase residues
cumulatively distinguish cognate Im9 association from non-cognate Im2
association. E9 DNase Phe86 is the primary specificity hotspot residue in the
centre of the interface, which is coordinated by conserved and variable
hotspot residues of the cognate Im protein. Experimental DMC analysis
reveals that only modest coupling energies to Im9 residues are observed, in
agreement with calculated DMCs using the program ROSETTA and
consistent with the largely hydrophobic nature of E9 DNase–Im9 specificity
contacts. Computed values for the 12 E9 DNase alanine mutants showed
reasonable agreement with experimental ΔΔG data, particularly for
interactions not mediated by interfacial water molecules. ΔΔG predictions
for residues that contact buried water molecules calculated using solvated
rotamer models met with mixed success; however, we were able to predict
with a high degree of accuracy the location and energetic contribution of
one such contact. Our study highlights how colicin DNases are able to
utilise both conserved and variable amino acids to distinguish cognate from
non-cognate Im proteins, with the energetic contributions of the conserved
residues modulated by neighbouring specificity sites.

Most biological processes involve the recognition
of one protein by another. High-throughput screen￾ing of protein–protein interactions in prokaryotic
and eukaryotic proteomes has shown cells to be a
conglomeration of interconnected complexes, the
principal components of which are ‘protein hubs,’
nodes with a larger-than-average number of inter￾action partners.1 Hubs tend to come in two flavours,
with recent studies indicating that each has distinct
evolutionary trajectories; hubs that simultaneously
accommodate multiple partners at distinct binding
sites appear to evolve slowly, while those that
distinguish multiple binding partners at a single
interaction site in a specific mutually exclusive
fashion evolve more quickly.2 This latter group of
protein–protein interaction complexes can be further
subdivided as those that bind unrelated partners at
the binding site, such as the Fc hinge region of
human immunoglobulin G,3 and those that distin￾guish members of a highly related protein family,
which is typical of protein inhibitors of enzymes and
intra- and intercellular signalling complexes.4,5 The
present work addressed the fundamental problem
of specificity in this latter type of complex, where,
using protein engineering and X-ray crystallogra￾phy in combination with kinetic, thermodynamic
and computational analyses, we dissected the
specific recognition of the colicin E9 endonuclease
(E9 DNase) by cognate and non-cognate immunity
(Im) proteins. Colicin DNase–Im protein complexes
are a powerful model system with which to study
discrimination at a single binding site since specifi￾city in this family of closely related complexes spans
the thermodynamic stability of all known protein–
protein interactions.6
The E colicin DNases E2, E7, E8 and E9 are 15-kDa
C-terminal domains of larger bacterial toxins pro￾duced by strains of Escherichia coli under times of
environmental stress that kill competing cells
through random degradation of genomic DNA.7,8
Cell suicide is prevented by the co-production of
small Im proteins (Im2, Im7, Im8 and Im9) that form
1:1 complexes with the corresponding DNase
domains, thereby neutralising their enzymatic activ￾ity in the host.6,9 One of the distinguishing features of
these complexes is that the inhibitors bind at an Im
protein exosite (IPE) on the DNase that, in contrast to
the majority of other protein inhibitors of enzymes,
results in inhibition through steric and electrostatic
occlusion of nucleic acid substrates.10,11 Colicin
DNases share a high degree of sequence identity
(∼65%) and structural conservation and so cleave
DNA by the same basic mechanism. Importantly,
however, much of the sequence variation is confined
to residues 72–98 in these 134 amino acid domains,
which coincides with the location of the IPE (Fig. 1a)
and explains how Im proteins have evolved to
recognise specific colicin DNases.6
Previous work from our laboratory had shown
that Im proteins, which share ∼50% sequence
identity, are specific, high-affinity inhibitors of
colicin DNases (Kd = 10−14–10−15 M), with cognate
complexes binding 106
- to 1010-fold tighter than
non-cognate complexes.14–16 Non-cognate Im pro￾tein binding, typically in the micromolar to nano￾molar range, has been attributed to a conserved
hotspot on the Im protein that is accommodated at
the sequence-variable DNase IPE largely through
backbone hydrogen bonds and van der Waals
interactions.13 Im proteins are helical proteins that
bind the DNase through a ‘dual-recognition’
mechanism; a long specificity helix (helix II)
preferentially stabilises cognate binding, while a
shorter conserved helix (helix III) forms a hotspot
that stabilises cognate and non-cognate complexes
alike and is responsible for the basal DNase cross￾reactivity of Im proteins.16,17,18 Although neither
protein undergoes substantial structural change on
binding, their association is a special case of a
conformational change-type mechanism where cog￾nate and non-cognate complexes alike form an
electrostatically steered encounter complex centred
on the conserved residues of helix III of the Im
protein, followed by rigid-body rotation, allowing
optimal alignment of specificity residues across the
interface.19 Such a mechanism has strong similarities
to recent theories of anchor residue binding in
protein–protein interactions, as described by Raja￾mani et al.,20 where conserved polar or aromatic
anchor residues, as are found in helix III of Im9, bind
to pre-organised pockets on the binding partner to
form the encounter complex and neighbouring latch
(specificity) residues contribute to forming the final
high-affinity complex.
While the kinetics of binding are conserved be￾tween the different DNase–Im protein complexes,16,19
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) has shown that
the underlying thermodynamics of binding vary
significantly.21 Specificity is enthalpically driven and
coupled to a reduction in side-chain or backbone
flexibility in the cognate complexes of colicins E2, E7
and E8. In contrast, changes in flexibility appear to
play a lesser role in Im9 binding to the colicin E9
DNase, where instead specificity is entropically
driven and coupled to the loss of hydrophobic
hydration.21
In addition to studies aimed at investigating the
kinetics and thermodynamics of colicin DNase–Im
protein complexes, the system has also served as a
model in a number of computational and evolu￾tionary studies aimed at understanding specificity
in protein–protein recognition. Goh and Cohen
showed how evolutionary trace methods could
correctly assign Im protein specificity to colicin
DNases.22 Bernath et al.23 devised a novel in vitro
compartmentalisation strategy for investigating the
directed evolution of Im protein specificity of
colicin DNases and showed that this correlates
with those isolated naturally. Baker and co-work￾ers redesigned colicin–Im protein specificity
through de novo computational methods, showed
that the structure of the redesigned complex
matched closely that predicted and demonstrated
746 Colicin DNase Immunity Protein Specificitya change in binding specificity of over 2 orders of
magnitude.24,25
Previous investigations of binding in colicin
DNase–Im protein complexes focused on how Im
proteins recognise the enzyme. The present study
addressed for the first time the role of E9 DNase IPE
residues in binding Im proteins through an alanine
scan, how these impact cognate (Im9) and non￾cognate (Im2) binding and the structural conse￾quences of the most destabilising mutations. We also
report our double-mutant cycle (DMC) analysis of a
subset of interfacial residues that play a critical role
in stabilising the complex in order to explore the role
of additivity. Importantly, we compared alanine
scanning and DMC data on the cognate E9 DNase–
Im9 complex with computationally derived calcula￾tions where we investigated the correlation between
experimental data and theoretical predictions for
alanine mutations, with and without explicit inter￾facial water molecules.
Results and Discussion
Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the E9 DNase
IPE and analysis of Im2 and Im9 binding
In order to investigate the importance of E9 DNase
IPE residues in affinity and specificity of Im protein

(shown in red) is defined as that where a change in solvent-accessible surface area N10 Å2 upon binding the Im protein
occurs. Numbered residues are those mutated to alanine.
Colicin DNase Immunity Protein Specificity 747binding, we conducted an alanine scan across the
surface of the enzyme, guided by the 1.7-Å crystal
structure of the E9 DNase–Im9 complex,13 and
determined changes in the free energy of binding
using kinetic methods (ΔΔGkin
obs). The E9 DNase IPE
is composed predominantly of a single contiguous
epitope (residues 72–98) but includes Arg54 at the
periphery of the Im protein binding site. Arg54
contacts substrate DNA and is required for catalysis;
its burial by Im9 largely accounts for the inhibition
of DNA binding by the acidic Im protein.26 Thirteen
residues were selected (Materials and Methods) and
mutated singly to alanine (Fig. 1b). All were purified
with the exception of E9 DNase Y83A, which was
not expressed to any detectable level in bacteria and
so could not be purified. The 12 mutants were folded
and adjudged not to be significantly destabilised by
the mutations as deduced by intrinsic tryptophan
fluorescence, far-UV CD spectroscopy and thermal
denaturation experiments, all of which were similar
to the wild-type protein (Materials and Methods).
Association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate con￾stants for both cognate (Im9) and non-cognate (Im2)
E9 DNase–Im protein complexes were determined
as described previously,14,15,19 from which the equi￾librium dissociation constant (Kd) for each complex
was obtained using Eq. (1).
Kd ¼ koff=kon ð1Þ
The kon data for the 12 E9 DNase alanine mutants
binding Im9 and those binding Im2 are shown in
Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The alanine mutations
generally decreased values of kon by less than 3-fold,
with the largest decrease accompanying removal of
charged groups. Notable exceptions are the accel￾eration of the kon values for several mutants (N72A,
N75A and F86A) binding Im2. Given that this rate
enhancement occurs upon truncation to alanine of
both polar (e.g., Asn72) and non-polar (Phe86)
residues, the origin is likely to be due to geometric
rather than electrostatic factors, consistent with the
studies by Janin29 and Schreiber.30 Hence, in these
instances, the mutations likely remove a restriction
to alignment of the E9 DNase and Im2 during
association. In contrast to the kon data, the koff data
for the 12 E9 DNase alanine mutants in complex
with cognate Im9 and non-cognate Im2 were
affected by up to 1000-fold (Tables 1 and 2,
respectively), indicating that koff provides the kinetic
discrimination between cognate and non-cognate
binding, consistent with previous mutagenesis
studies on Im proteins.14–16,19

748 Colicin DNase Immunity Protein Specificity ΔΔGkin
obs fall into three categories: those that affect
binding by (1) b1 kcal/mol, (2) 1–2 kcal/mol and (3)
2–4 kcal/mol (coloured blue, green and yellow,
respectively, in Fig. 2), with half of the mutants
analysed (S74A, S77A, S78A, S84A, T87A and
Q92A) being in the first category and so having
little or no effect on binding. These include the three
residues described above that, although buried by
Im9, make no direct contact with the protein.
Second, the three most important residues (Asn75,
Phe86 and Lys97) form a central belt on the surface
of the enzyme that comprises the hotspot, consistent
with other protein–protein interactions where the
binding energy is not distributed evenly across the
interface but localised.31–34 Third, previous alanine
scans of IPE contacting residues in Im9 showed that
Im protein mutations, particularly of conserved
hotspot residues from helix III, have a much greater
impact on binding than do mutations of Im protein￾contacting residues in the E9 DNase IPE reported
here. Mutation of the three helix III hotspot residues
in Im9 (Asp51, Tyr54 and Tyr55) generates ΔΔGkin
obs
N5 kcal/mol compared with b3 kcal/mol for most
DNase mutants, with the exception of E9 DNase
F86A (3.9 kcal/mol). Im9 Asp51 is accommodated at
the sequence-variable IPE of the DNase through
direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the
backbone, whereas DNase IPE residues mostly
engage in side-chain interactions.13 Notwithstand￾ing these differences, it is clear that the ‘hotter spot’
of Im9, in particular, Tyr54 and Tyr55, meets that of
the E9 DNase IPE centred on Phe86 (Fig. 2).
Several authors have stressed the importance of
validating alanine scanning data by computational
approaches.35 In the present work, we computed the
effects of these alanine substitutions on the free
energy of binding (ΔΔGcalc) for E9 DNase alanine
mutants binding Im9 for direct comparison with
ΔΔGkin
obs not only to further probe the physical basis
for binding but also as a test of the robustness of
computational approaches using this model system.
Computational strategies employing a simple phy￾sical model have successfully recapitulated experi￾mental alanine scanning data for many protein
interfaces36 and have paved the way for developing
tools aimed at the rational design of protein–protein
complexes.24,25,37–39 Here we applied the program
ROSETTA27 to compute binding free energies for a
set of alanine-substituted models of the colicin
DNase E9–Im9 complex. Agreement between the
experimentally determined ΔΔGkin
obs and predicted
ΔΔGcalc is reasonable over the 12 residues on the E9
DNase side of the interface (Fig. 3; Table 1), with a
linear fit yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.75.
These initial calculations did not take account of
buried, interfacial water molecules. Indeed, predic￾tion performance is dependent on whether a given
residue is involved in a water-mediated contact; if
the four residues that make water-mediated contacts
are excluded from the mutation set (Asn72, Asn75,
Gln92 and Lys97), the linear fit for the remaining
eight mutations yields a correlation coefficient of
0.94. In the field of design, we have had success
optimising the packing arrangement of non-polar
residues comprising the core to thermostabilise a
protein40 and in the design of protein–protein
interaction specificity by engineering a hydrogen
bond network.24,25 However, protein interfaces tend
to also be solvated; to this end, it is important to
develop tools able to capture the energetic contribu￾tion of water-mediated contacts. In all four cases of
residues that engage in water-mediated hydrogen
bond networks at the interface, the computed ΔΔGcalc
values are incorrectly assigned (Fig. 3a, data points
coloured red).
To try to capture the loss of the water-mediated
energetics, we used a solvated rotamer approach28
to hydrate the interface and compute ΔΔGH2O

of ΔΔGH2O

grossly underestimating the influence of the alanine
mutation, while in the case of Gln92, it causes
marginal overestimation. In the case of Asn75, the
positioning of the water molecule is accurately
predicted and the computed binding energy using
a solvated model gives a ΔΔGH2O
calc value of
1.33 kcal/mol (Fig. 3a, N75A_H2O, blue), hence
capturing some of the water-mediated energetics
(Table 1). This asparagine extends a hydrogen bond
network by donating to the backbone carbonyl of
Phe86 and a tightly bound water molecule (W2)
while accepting from a backbone amide of Phe86
(Fig. 3b). We conclude that while the solvated
rotamer approach can be useful in determining
placement of functionally important water mole￾cules that are tightly bound and buried (b2
hydrogen bonds and low B-factors) and their
energetic contribution to binding can be quantitated,
there is still a degree of variability in the success of
this approach. Likely reasons for the failure of the
solvated approach can be attributed to errors in the
energy model and are compounded by uncertainties
in the positions of the water molecules. Improved
prediction of water placement at protein interfaces
are likely to be achieved by using larger solvated
rotamer libraries and changes in the solvation and
water–van der Waals components of the energy
function.
Differential effects of E9 DNase IPE alanine
mutants on Im9 and Im2 binding reveal
contributions from both conserved and variable
residues to specificity
The Kd for Im2 binding the E9 DNase is 10−7 M, at
pH 7 in buffer containing 200 mM NaCl and at
25 °C, 7 orders of magnitude weaker than cognate
Fig. 2. The conserved hotspot of
Im9 meets the variable hotspot of the
E9 DNase. Molecular surface repre￾sentation of the E9 DNase, coloured
according to values of ΔΔG for ala￾nine mutants, in the context of the
complex with Im9 (Table 1). Only two
of the four helices of Im9 are shown
for simplicity. Colour code for values
of ΔΔGkin
obs: yellow, 2–4 kcal/mol;
green, 1–2 kcal/mol; blue, b1 kcal/
mol. With the exception of Arg54 and
Asn75, the surface of the IPE is largely
variable in the DNase family. By
contrast, the three Im9 residues of
helix III (shown as ribbon), Asp51,
Tyr54 and Tyr55, are all conserved
(underlined in the figure). Wallis et
al.
17 showed previously that mutation
of these residues to alanine generates
much greater values of ΔΔG
(N5 kcal/mol). The docking of helix
III into the concave cleft of the DNase
IPE positions the specificity helix of
the Im protein for the appropriate
recognition of residue 86 on the
DNase and to make additional speci￾ficity contacts, such as with Lys97.
The correct positioning of helix II is
thought to be through rotation about
the conserved hotspot of the Im
protein in the encounter complex,
possibly mediated by three conserved
water molecules, shown as red
spheres in the figure.
750 Colicin DNase Immunity Protein SpecificityIm9 binding.19 To determine whether our set of E9
DNase alanine mutants could provide information
on how the enzyme discriminates between these
close homologues, we obtained kinetically deter￾mined equilibrium dissociation constants and hence
ΔΔGkin
obs for all E9 DNase alanine mutants binding
Im2 (Table 2), determined according to Eq. (2). We
showed recently that complications in the analysis
of biphasic dissociation kinetics of E9 DNase–Im2
complexes have led to erroneous Kd determinations
due to misassignment of the rate-limiting step for
dissociation of the complex.19 We therefore checked
all kinetically derived values of Kd (Kd,kinetic) by ITC
(Kd,ITC), from which ΔΔGkin
obs and ΔΔGITC
obs (observed
change in the free energy of binding determined by
ITC) were obtained (Table 2). This analysis shows
that while kinetically and calorimetrically deter￾mined Kd values for Im2 mutants binding the E9
DNase show some variability (2- to 20-fold), there is
nonetheless reasonable agreement between values
of ΔΔGobs from the two approaches (b0.5-kcal/mol
discrepancy for 11/12 mutations). Since there is no
high-resolution structure for the E9 DNase–Im2 com￾plex or indeed any non-cognate complex, ΔΔGcalc
was not computed.
Figure 4 compares values of ΔΔGkin
obs for Im9 and
Im2 binding the 12 E9 DNase alanine mutants and
illustrates a number of key points concerning the
specific recognition of Im proteins. First, none of the
12 mutations affected Im2 binding by significantly
more than 1 kcal/mol (Table 2), with three-quarters
having a negligible effect. Second, two mutation
sites on the E9 DNase (Arg54 and Asn72) yield
similar changes in Im binding for Im2 and Im9, both
of which are on the periphery of the IPE. Third,
comparisons with Im9 data show clear evidence of
differential binding effects at the four positions
within the IPE (75, 86, 97 and 98; Fig. 4) and
therefore identify these as specificity sites, three of
which (Asn75, Phe86 and Lys97) form the central
hotspot belt for the cognate complex. The identifica￾tion of Lys97 and Val98 as specificity residues is
consistent with their contacting helix II residues,
with the specificity helix in Im9 (Glu41 and Val34,
respectively) and with previous alanine scanning
data of Im2 and Im9 showing that these positions
specify E9 and not E2 DNase binding.16 That these
sites are of more general importance to colicin
specificity comes from the data of Curtis and
James,12 who found that swapping residues 97 and
98 in colicin E9 DNase for those in colicin E8 resulted
in stronger protection by Im8 in vivo. Fourth, more
surprising are the context-dependent ΔΔGkin
obs effects
seen for conserved DNase residues on Im protein
specificity. Alanine mutation of Asn75, which is
conserved in all colicin DNases and, as described
above, only contacts the Im protein indirectly

a correlation coefficient of 0.94. See the text for details. (b)

Colicin DNase Immunity Protein Specificity 751through a conserved water molecule (Fig. 3b), has a
differential effect on Im9 versus Im2 binding. E9
DNase F86A shows the largest differential effect on
Im2 and Im9 binding, yet Phe86 is conserved in the
E2 and E9 DNases (Fig. 1a). Fifth, Fig. 4 suggests no
role for Ser77 and Ser78 in defining the specificity of
Im9 relative to Im2 for the E9 DNase, consistent
with a lack of stabilising interactions with Im9 re￾sidues at these sites. These positions are however
involved in mediating specificity in both the E7 and
E8 complexes as revealed by crystallography and
mutagenesis, respectively.10,12 This implies that
different combinations of residues are used by the
different colicins to achieve specific recognition of
their cognate Im proteins, which mirrors how Im
proteins recognise the different colicin DNases.16 In
summary, specific recognition of Im9 relative to Im2
by the E9 DNase is largely due to a group of four
residue contact points, with position 86 taking the
predominant role. The expectation is that a similar
distributive specificity mechanism will pertain to
other cognate colicin DNase–Im protein complexes
all having position 86 as their centrepoint (as seen in
the colicin E7 DNase–Im7 complex),10 albeit elabo￾rated with different combinations of other specificity
contacts.
Structures of mutant E9 DNase–Im9 complexes
reveal only localised structural changes
We determined the crystal structures of the four
most destabilising alanine mutations in the E9
DNase (R54A, N75A, F86A and K97A), which
largely define its specific recognition of Im9 relative
to Im2, in complex with Im9 at or below 2-Å
resolution (Fig. 5; Table 3). These structures were
used to ascertain the extent to which the complex
had been disrupted. RMSDs for a structural super￾position of the four mutants with the wild-type
complex based on the E9 DNase all had values
b0.7 Å; structural changes were generally localised
to flexible regions in the endonuclease, which have
been described previously by Kuhlmann et al.,
13 and
to the immediate vicinity of the mutation. Hence,
truncation of these side chains to alanine did not
propagate large-scale structural changes through
the interface. The amount of solvent-accessible
surface area buried at the mutant interfaces was
similar to the wild-type complex (1500–1600 Å2
).
The other main observation from the four structures
is that numerous water molecules flood into the
cavities created by the alanine mutations in order to
fill gaps at the interface, replace hydrogen bonding
interactions of deleted heteroatoms or shield
unpaired electrostatic interactions. None of these
water molecules corresponds to water molecules
previously observed in colicin DNase–Im protein
complexes.
E9 DNase F86A–Im9 complex
The mutation of the key specificity determinant
Phe86 for alanine generates a cavity in the interface
that is filled by two water molecules, W35 and
W153, with both water molecules completely buried
at the interface (accessibility values calculated with
AREAIMOL of 0.0 for W35 and 2.0 for W153). As
well as being hydrogen bonded to each other, W36 is
also hydrogen bonded to W59 and the hydroxyl of
Im9 Tyr54. The stacking interaction made by Tyr54
to the phenyl ring of Phe86 in the native complex is
only slightly rotated in the mutant, its orientation
stabilised by the hydrogen bond to W35. It is
interesting to note that the additional water mole￾cules are not present in the E7 DNase–Im7 complex
in which Phe86 is replaced by a lysine residue.
E9 DNase N75A–Im9 complex
Two water molecules substitute for the side chain
of the residue, W4 and W25, both having almost
zero accessibility to bulk solvent. In the native
complex, Asn75 is hydrogen bonded to W2, one of
the three conserved water molecules at the interface,
which mediates hydrogen bonds between the
DNase domain and Im protein. W2 is present in
the mutant structure (W34) and is hydrogen bonded
to W25.
E9 DNase K97A–Im9 complex
The side chain of Lys97 in the wild-type complex
is in a salt bridge with Im9 Glu41, one of only two
salt bridges at the interface. Substitution of the lysine
for alanine results in four water molecules, W35,
W52, W53 and W58, entering the interface, none of
which is found in the E7 DNase–Im7 complex where
this specificity residue is replaced by a threonine.
The accessibility values of these four water mole￾cules are slightly higher than those of the water
molecules in the other mutant complexes (accessi￾bility values of 3, 10, 2 and 11, respectively). Other
water molecules are also present in the mutant
complex but have much higher accessibility indices,
and so we do not consider them here. In the absence
of Lys97, Im9 Glu41 is slightly rotated and hydrogen
bonded to three water molecules: W35, W39 and
W42. This mutant was the only one to reveal long￾range structural changes wherein Arg54 from the
enzyme swivels away from its salt bridge partner,
Im9 Glu30, in order to form a salt bridge with a
sulfate ion that was present in the crystallisation
buffer. No other structure change was evident
between Lys97 and Arg54, which are 14 Å apart,
suggesting that the reorientation of Arg54 is solely
due to the fortuitous location of the sulfate ion.
E9 DNase R54A–Im9 complex
The second salt bridge at the interface of the wild￾type complex is formed between the side chain of E9
DNase Arg54 and Im9 Glu30. In the R54A mutant,
the side chain of the arginine is replaced by four
water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to other
water molecules and to Im9 Glu30, which is almost
in its native conformation. The side chain of E9
752 Colicin DNase Immunity Protein SpecificityDNase Asp51 is rotated in this mutant and hydro￾gen bonded to two water molecules.
Experimental and computational DMC analyses
of Im protein residues surrounding the key E9
DNase specificity determinant Phe86
The close interconnections between stabilising
hotspot residues of Im9 with its own specificity
residues and those of E9 DNase Phe86 prompted us
to use DMC analysis to investigate the energetic
linkage of these residues at the core of the protein–
protein interaction. We also investigated these
linkages for Im2 binding E9 DNase in a non-cognate
context to determine their importance to specificity.
DMCs have been used extensively for investigating
the architecture and organisation of protein–protein
complexes, where both super- and subadditivity of
alanine mutations have been recorded.4,41–44 In the
current analysis, the interaction energy (ΔΔGint)
between two side chains was calculated using Eq.
(3), which is the difference between the sum of ΔΔG
for each individual alanine mutant and that for the
double mutant.

Colicin DNase Immunity Protein Specificity 753 simple additive effects in DMCs, whereas complex
patterns of additivity can result in cases where
residues are in direct contact, signifying cooperative
effects.41,44,45 DMCs have the advantage over single
alanine mutant studies in that they allow individual
interactions to be quantified even if side chains
interact with more than one other residue. They are
also less sensitive to artifacts arising from mutations
destabilising the structure of proteins (rather than
binding directly) as these effects cancel out since
they are present in both single- and double-mutant
ΔΔG values. Lastly, we compared experimental
values of ΔΔGint (observed interaction energy
obtained from DMC analysis, ΔΔGint
obs) with values
calculated using ROSETTA (calculated interaction
energy obtained from DMC analysis, ΔΔGint
calc) for
the cognate complex, as described in Materials and
Methods and presented in Table 4, to determine
whether the program is able to capture interaction
energies for residues surrounding Phe86.

754 Colicin DNase Immunity Protein Specificitytabulated in Table 4, with ΔΔGint
obs data presented in
Fig. 6. Both experimental and computational values
of ΔΔGint for interactions centred on the specificity
hotspot residue E9 DNase Phe86 are small and
positive (∼1.3–1.6 kcal/mol), which indicates that in
each case the single mutations have a greater effect
than the double mutant but not by much rela￾tive to experimental error. Interestingly, the largest
interaction energies recorded for the phenyl ring
of E9 DNase Phe86 are toward the specificity sites
of Im9 and not Tyr54, which presents Phe86
toward the specificity sites, or Tyr55, which closes
off solvent access to the core of the interface.
ΔΔGint
calc correctly predicted the additive effects
between Phe86 and Leu33 in helix II and Tyr55 in
helix III and the mildly superadditive effects
between Phe86 and Val37 on Im9 (Table 4). How￾ever, ROSETTA did not capture the magnitude of
the additivity for the E9 DNase Phe86–Im9 Val34
interaction. Lastly, for the interaction between Phe86
and Tyr54, the experimental data indicate modest or
no cooperativity, whereas our calculations suggest
this to be superadditive, likely reflecting the over￾estimation of the alanine contribution. We note that
values of ΔΔGint
obs for hotspot residues in the colicin
E9 DNase–Im9 complex are much smaller than
those measured for other high-affinity nuclease–
inhibitor complexes, such as barnase–barstar, where
values of up to 7 kcal/mol have been recorded.41
This reflects the differences in chemistries at the
respective hotspots of these complexes, with loca￾lised non-polar interactions predominating at the
core of the E9 DNase–Im9 complex but highly
cooperative charge–charge interaction networks
dominating at the barnase–barstar interface. The
preponderance of van der Waals contacts for the
specificity residue Phe86 at the core of this protein–
protein interaction also explains the ability of
ROSETTA to correctly predict these interaction
energies with reasonable accuracy.
DMC data for the non-cognate Im2 protein
residues binding E9 DNase Phe86 reveal clear dif￾ferences from those for Im9 (Table 5). No binding
could be detected for either of the tyrosine substitu￾tions of Im2, reiterating the importance of these
conserved hotspots to non-cognate binding. In
contrast to Im protein specificity sites in the cognate
complex, which show mildly positive DMC values,
those in Im2 are predominantly negative, high￾lighting the destabilising influences of these Im2
side chains to E9 DNase binding that are alleviated
on substitution to alanine. In summary, DMC data
for Im protein binding the E9 DNase Phe86Ala
mutant emphasise the role Im protein residues 33
and 37 take in discriminating the key specificity
determinant at position 86 in cognate and non￾cognate DNases.
Conclusions
Discrimination of related proteins at a single
binding site is a common occurrence at hubs in
intracellular protein–protein interaction networks.
Dual recognition is a thermodynamic mechanism
that underpins such discrimination, first described
for colicin DNase–Im protein complexes13,17 but also
seen in other protein–protein interactions.46,47 A
conserved hotspot, which is a common feature of
protein–protein interactions,34,48 from the Im pro￾tein (helix III) provides broad colicin DNase cross￾reactivity, while neighbouring residues (helix II)
confer specificity. What remain unresolved are the
thermodynamic basis for cognate Im protein rec￾ognition by the enzyme IPE, which is variable in

We addressed these questions using a combina￾tion of experimental and computational alanine
scanning and DMC analysis. ΔΔGobs and ΔΔGcalc,
determined using ROSETTA, for Im9 binding 12 IPE
alanine mutants showed reasonable agreement. The
inclusion of solvated rotamer models for ROSETTA
calculations correctly predicted the location and
energetic contribution of one important conserved
water-mediated interaction between an E9 DNase
residue (Asn75) and Im9, although this was not
replicated for other water-mediated interactions.

substantially smaller than those for Im9, particularly
for conserved Im9 residues where many of the
contacts are to the DNase backbone.17 Four E9
DNase residues comprise the hotspot for the IPE,
forming a belt across the centre of the interface, three
of which are also the points of greatest discrimina￾tion between Im9 and Im2. The alanine mutation
with the greatest observed and predicted effects on
ΔΔG for Im9 binding was E9 DNase Phe86. Phe86 is
the centrepoint of the interface and is coordinated by
the conserved hotspot of Im9 (Tyr54 and Tyr55)
along with its hydrophobic specificity residues
(Val34 and Val37). The two tyrosines form a clamp
that docks helix III of the Im protein onto the DNase
IPE cleft and form the rotation axis that expedites
rigid-body rotations of the Im protein over the
DNase surface in the conformational search for
specificity contacts.13,19 Consistent with the hydro￾phobic nature of the contacts at the centre of the
interface, experimental and computational DMC
analyses suggested only minor additivity effects that
were nonetheless significantly altered in the non￾cognate Im2 complex, further supporting the role of
these contacts in conferring specificity. Although
Phe86 is a key specificity site in colicin DNases (Arg
and Lys in E8 and E7, respectively), phenylalanine is
nevertheless conserved between the E2 and E9
DNases, suggesting that the energetic contribution
of this residue is context dependent, the context
being the surrounding specificity residues. A similar
effect is seen for Asn75, whose water-mediated
interaction is conserved in colicin DNase–Im protein
complexes,13 which differentially stabilises the Im9
complex over that of Im2. Additional discrimination
of Im9 over Im2 is accomplished through neigh￾bouring specificity contacts, principally through
Lys97 and Val98 on the DNase contacting sites on
helix II on the Im protein.
In conclusion, colicin DNase specificity for Im
proteins is determined by both conserved and
variable amino acids within the IPE, with the
binding free energy contribution of conserved
contact points modulated by neighbouring variable
specificity sites. Such a mechanism has similarities
with the framework effects of constant heavy
regions on the affinity and specificity of antibodies
for antigens,49 although, in contrast to what we
observe in colicin DNase–Im protein complexes,
these effects are indirect.
Materials and Methods
Selection of E9 DNase IPE residues for alanine
mutagenesis
Thirteen IPE residues (Arg54, Asn72, Ser74, Asn75, Ser77,
Ser78, Ser84, Tyr83, Phe86, Thr87, Gln92, Lys97 and Val98)
were selected for alanine mutagenesis based on three
criteria: (1) significant burial upon Im9 binding (change in
accessible surface area, N10 Å2
); (2) readily identifiable con￾tacts with Im9 in the high-resolution structure (1.7 Å) of
the E9 DNase–Im9 complex13; and (3) implication in Im
protein specificity from previous studies.12 Some residues
that become buried in the complex with Im9 but whose
side chains make no discernible contact with the inhibitor
(Ser74, Ser84 and Thr87) were included. With the
exception of Arg54, all IPE residues reside within a single
linear epitope in the enzyme (residues 72–98), many of
which have previously been implicated in conferring Im
protein specificity (Ser77, Ser78, Tyr83, Lys97 and Val98).12
Arg54 was also mutated because, although not part of the
linear epitope of the IPE, it forms a salt bridge with Im9
Glu30, a helix II residue previously shown to be important
for E9 DNase binding.17 The 13 residues selected for
mutagenesis are underlined in the DNase domain
sequence alignment (Fig. 1a) and shown on the molecular
surface of the E9 DNase IPE (Fig. 1b).
Site-directed mutagenesis of the E9 DNase
Plasmid pRJ353 (based on pET21d from Novagen),
containing the gene for the wild-type E9 DNase and Im9,50
was used as the template for the mutagenesis, which was
carried out by the QuikChange PCR mutagenesis method
(Stratagene), with primers purchased from MWG Biotech
(Germany). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing
(MWG Biotech). In all cases, the identity of purified
proteins was confirmed by electrospray ionisation mass
spectrometry.
Protein purification and quantification
Purifications of E9 DNase, Im2, Im9 and tritiated Im9
([3
H]Im9) have all been described previously.14–16,51
Protein concentrations were by absorbance at 280 nm
using molar absorption coefficients of 17,550 M−1 cm−1 for
the E9 DNase domain and 11,400 M−1 cm−1 for Im
proteins determined previously.16
Biophysical characterisation of E9 DNase alanine
mutants
Preliminary assessment of the effect of alanine
substitution on the stability of the protein was under￾taken of all purified mutants by intrinsic tryptophan
fluorescence emission spectroscopy and far-UV CD
spectroscopy, as previously reported for colicin E9
DNase domain,51 and shown to be indistinguishable
from wild type. In addition, intrinsic tryptophan fluo￾rescence spectroscopy was used to follow the tempera￾ture denaturation of each protein, from which was
obtained the thermal denaturation midpoint.51 For all
mutants, the thermal denaturation midpoint was similar
to the wild-type protein.
Fluorescence spectra of 1 μM wild-type and alanine
mutant E9 DNases in 50 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.5 and
756 Colicin DNase Immunity Protein Specificity25 °C, were recorded on a Spex Fluoromax 3. Tryptophan
fluorescence was excited at 295 nm with fluorescence
emission monitored from 300 to 450 nm. In all cases, the
peak emission wavelength was close to 333 nm, typical of
a folded protein and close to that previously observed for
the E9 DNase51 under similar conditions.
CD spectra of metal-free E9 DNase alanine mutants
(typically at a concentration of 10 μM) were taken after
dialysis into 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, over￾night at 4 °C. Spectra were recorded every nanometer
from 190 to 260 nm in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter in a
1-cm pathlength cell, with 10 measurements averaged to
produce each final spectrum. In all cases, spectra recorded
at 25 °C resembled closely those previously observed for
the wild-type E9 DNase.51
Thermal denaturation profiles of mutant proteins were
also followed by far-UV CD spectroscopy. Proteins were
dialysed into 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and
put into a stirred 1-cm pathlength cell within a Jasco J-810
spectropolarimeter. Spectra were recorded as described
above every 5 °C from 15 to 75 °C, and the wavelength of
maximum change (typically 198 or 203 nm) was used to
quantify the change in CD signal with temperature. Fitted
Tm values were close to those previously observed for the
E9 DNase.51
E9 DNase–Im protein dissociation constant (Kd)
All experiments were carried out in 50 mM Mops buffer,
pH 7.0, containing 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT at 25 °C.
The bimolecular rate constant (kon) for E9 DNase–Im
protein association was measured by stopped-flow
fluorescence using pseudo-first-order or second-order
binding kinetics as appropriate as described by Wallis
et al.
14 and Li et al.
16 The koff was determined by radioactive
subunit exchange for slow koff values (b10−3 s
−1
) or from
fluorescence chase stopped-flow experiments for fast koff
values (N10−3 s
−1
) as described by Li et al.
16 and Keeble and
Kleanthous.19 The equilibrium dissociation constant was
calculated from the ratio of the koff and kon (Kd =koff/kon). In
the case of non-cognate E9 DNase–Im2 complexes, all
equilibrium Kd data were verified by ITC, as described by
Keeble and Kleanthous.19
Protein crystallography of E9 DNase mutants in
complex with Im9
Crystals for the four mutants of E9 (R54A, N75A, F86A
and K97A) in complex with Im9 were grown by the
hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystallisa￾tion condition was 2.9 M ammonium sulfate and 100 mM
Bis–Tris, pH 5.5, with diffraction-quality crystals
obtained by iterative seeding in fresh equilibrated drop.
Crystals were flash-cooled using sodium malonate as
cryo-protectant. A data set at 1.8-Å resolution was
collected at the beamline 10.1 at the Daresbury Synchro￾tron Radiation Source (Daresbury, England) for the
mutant complex E9 K97A–Im9, while the other three
mutant complex data sets were collected using the
beamline ID14.1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility (Grenoble, France). All data sets were integrated
and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA.52 Table 3 shows
the final statistics for each of the four structures. All
crystals belonged to space group P21, as per the wild￾type complex, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit.
The structures were solved by molecular replacement
using the program MOLREP53 and the structure of the
wild-type E9 DNase–Im9 complex (Protein Data Bank
code 1EMV) as the model. Structures were refined using
REFMAC,54 and rebuilding was done with Coot.55 The
final electron density map allowed us to identify most
of the residues from the sequence. For the E9 DNase
K97A–Im9 complex, six molecules of ammonium sulfate
were modeled; for each of the other three complexes,
three molecules of malonic acid were identified, all
originating from the crystallisation conditions or cryo￾protectant.
Computational alanine scan on interfaces
Binding free energy changes upon alanine mutation
were calculated using previously described equations.36
For modeling side-chain conformational changes on
complex formation and mutation, side chains were
represented as rotamers on a fixed backbone template.
Rotamers were taken from a backbone-dependent
library by Bower et al.,56 with additional rotamers
added by rotations around the λ1 and λ2 angles by
5°–20° and extra rotamers for λ3 and λ4 angles as
described by Dahiyat and Mayo.57 The X-ray coordi￾nates of the native side chains at each position were
included in the library for both the complex and the
isolated partners. All residues having at least one side￾chain atom within a sphere of 5-Å radius of the site of
mutation were repacked. All other amino acid side
chains were left in the conformations observed in the
parent crystal structures. Energies were computed for
each rotamer with the constant part of the molecule (the
template backbone and all unchanged side chains) and
for all pairwise rotamer–rotamer combinations by using
the free energy function described by Kortemme and
Baker.36 Global optimisation of side-chain conforma￾tions was performed using a Monte Carlo simulated
annealing procedure,27 in which a move consisted of
the replacement of a randomly picked side-chain
rotamer at a single position by another rotamer from the
library.
Application of the model to computational alanine
scanning on protein interfaces
The energy function was parametrised using a data set
of experimentally determined stability changes taken from
the PROTHERM database as described previously.36 The
parameterised free energy function was used to compute
ΔΔGcalc and Gint
calc for the E9 DNase–Im9 Im protein
complex and compared with the experimentally measured
changes in binding energy on alanine mutagenesis and
experimentally derived interaction energies from the
DMC analysis.
Solvated rotamer approach
For the solvated rotamer approach, we started with the
backbone-dependent library compiled by Bower et al.
56
and added water molecules at allowed backbone and
polar side-chain atoms as described by Jiang et al.
28
Energies were computed using the free energy function
described by Kortemme and Baker36 with an additional
protein–water interaction composed of a Lennard–Jones
repulsive potential and a water-mediated hydrogen
bonding potential. Global energy optimisation was
performed as in the work of Kuhlman and Baker.27 The
Colicin DNase Immunity Protein Specificity 757free energy function was parametrised as previously
described by Kortemme and Baker.36
