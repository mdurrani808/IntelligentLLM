Abstract 
The hen (chicken) egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) epitope for the monoclonal antibody HyHEL-IO Fab (Fab-IO) was 
investigated by alanine scan mutagenesis. The association rate constants (/con) for the HEWL.Fab-10 complexes were 
obtained from the homogenous solution method described in the preceding paper (Taylor et al., 1998). A new method 
for determining the dissociation rate constant (kOff) for the complex, by trapping nascent free antibody with an inactive 
HEWL mutant is described. The values of k,, fall within a factor of 2 of the wild-type (WT) HEWL value (1.43 f 
0.13 X lo6 M” s-’), while the increases in kc,w more nearly reflect the total change in free energies of the complex 
(AAG”). The dissociation constants (KO) were measured directly in those cases where satisfactory kinetic data could not 
be obtained. The Y20A, K96A, and K97A HEWL.Fab-IO complexes are destabilized by more than 4 kcal/mol 
compared to the WT complex. The R21A, L75A, and DlOlA antibody complexes are moderately destabilized (0.7 < 
AAGo 5 1 .O kcal/mol). Additional mutations of the “hotspot” residues (TYRO, Lys96, Lys97) were constructed to probe, 
more precisely, the nature of their contributions to complex formation. The results show that the entire hydrocarbon side 
chains of Tyr20 and Lys97, and only the s-amino group of Lys96, contribute to the stability of the complex. The value 
of AAG,] for the R21A mutant complex is a distinct outlier in the Arg2l replacement series demonstrating the importance 
of supplementing alanine scan mutagenesis with additional mutations.

Protein-protein interactions are fundamental to cellular regulatory 
pathways, enzymatic catalysis, and the immune response. The 
achievement of a quantitative comprehension of the contributions 
of the individual amino acid side chains to the stability and kinetics 
associated with complex formation is critical to a full understand￾ing of these phenomena. Recently, a number of such directed in￾vestigations have been focused on antigen-antibody complexes

Fab (HEWL.Fab-10) (Padlan et al., 1989), shows that an area of 
774 A’ on HEWL is buried on complexation. This high affinity com￾plex (KO - 0.1 nM) is characterized by 1 1 1van der Waals contacts, 
14 hydrogen bonds, and a partially solvent exposed salt bridge. 
Biochemical investigation of the HEWL.Fab-IO system are fa￾cilitated by the heterologous expression of HEWL (Malcolm et al., 
1989). The antibody partially occludes the HEWL active site caus￾ing the HEWL.Fab-10 complex to be nearly devoid of lysozyme 
activity. Thus, the kinetics of complex formation (Taylor et al., 
1998) and decomposition can be monitored in homogeneous 
solution. 
1868 Evaluation of lysozyme epitope for HyHEL-10 Fab 
Some of the immunodeterminants in the epitope for HyHEL-IO 
were identified by serological analysis of natural lysozyme vari￾ants (Smith-Gill et al., 1984b). The quantitative contributions of 
Asnl9, Arg21, AsplOl, and Gly102 were evaluated earlier by site￾directed mutagenesis (Kam-Morgan et al., 1993). Complementary 
site-directed mutagenesis investigations of some of the HyHEL-IO 
Fv paratope residues have been published (Tsumoto et al., 1995, 
1996). The present work was undertaken to extend the previous 
investigations by systematically probing the roles of the remaining 
amino-acid residues in the discontinuous epitope for HyHEL-IO. 
Each of the nonglycyl residues in the epitope was mutated to 
alanine, and the effects on the stability and kinetics (where possi￾ble) of the HEWL variant. Fab- 10 complexes were evaluated. 
Alanine scan mutagenesis (Wells, 1991) is a facile method for 
identification of important epitope residues in protein-protein in￾teractions. Immunochemical applications include inter alia human 
growth hormone-antibody interactions (Jin et al., 1992) and anti￾idiotypic antibody E5.2 and HEWL-antibody Dl .3 interactions 
(Dall'Acqua et al., 1996). We show here that alanine scan muta￾genesis needs to be supplemented with additional mutations in 
order to understand fully the role of a given residue. Finally, the 
results are compared with theoretical calculations (Novotny, 1991 ; 
Novotny et al., 1997). 
Results and discussion 
General effects of HEWL epitope mutations on the kinetics 
and equilibria associated with the HEWL,Fab-10 complexes 
The epitope in the HEWL.Fab-IO complex was identified crys￾tallographically by Padlan et al. (1989). Thirteen nonglycine HEWL 
residues are in contact with the antibody. They are Hisl5, Tyr20, 
Arg21, Trp63, Arg73, Leu75, Thr89, Asn93, Lys96, Lys97, Ile98, 
Ser100, and Asp101 . The individual contributions of the side chains 
of these contact residues were probed by alanine scan mutagenesis. 
The association and dissociation kinetics for the reactions of 
HEWL with Fab-IO are characterized by the two rate constants kon 
and koff as shown below.

Typical data for k,,, and kOff determinations of the WT

The wide range of the KO values restricted the number of mu￾tations for which accurate kinetic parameters could be determined. 
Table 1 reports the KO values for all 13 alanine replacements. The 
values of k,, for nine of them, and those of kOE for 10 alanine mu￾tations are also listed. The k,, values for the reactions of the HEWL 
alanine mutants that could be measured vary from (0.70 to 1.89) X 
IO6 M" s" , and are very similar to that of WT HEWL (1.43 ? 
0.13 X IO6 M" s-I ). There is a larger range in the k,, values for 
the dissociation of HEWL alanine mutant .Fab- 10 complexes ((0.62 
to 4.4) X s-'). The value for the WT HEWL.Fab-10 complex 
is 1.0 & 0.2 X lop4 s". The logarithms of the rate constants for 
formation and dissociation of the complexes are plotted against AAGD 
in Figure 3. The linearity of the relations is artifactually enhanced 
by autocorrelation of the data (Exner, 1972; Estell, 1987), because 
AAGD was calculated from the constituent rate constants, and not 
determined independently. The most perturbing mutation shown in

lines show the individual tits to the model (see Equation 3 in Taylor et al., 
1998). Data collection was initiated 50 s after mixing WT HEWL and 
Fab-10, in the presence of the substrate M. luteus, to eliminate mixing 
artifacts. Conditions: 4 nM WT HEWL; 20 nM (-), 30 nM (- - - - -),

details). 
Figure 3, R21M, yields a 14 and 2.4-fold reduction in dissociation 
and association rate constants, respectively. The reflections of mu￾tation induced variation in k,, and koff values are discussed in Tay￾lor et al. (1998). 
The large perturbation in AAG, values effected by the Y20A, 
K96A, and K97A mutations precluded the determination of the 
rate constants associated with formation of their respective Fab-IO 
complexes. Their values of AAG, were determined directly by the 
method previously described (Kam-Morgan et al., 1993).

kcal/mol) for the Y20A, K96A, and K97A complexes are signif￾icantly larger than those for the rest of the epitope alanine substi￾tutions. Residues Tyr20, Lys96, and Lys97 are, therefore, the major 
immunodeterminants ("hotspots") of this complex as revealed by 
this methodology. Complexes formed with R21A, L75A, and DlOlA 
HEWL are moderately destabilized (0.7 < AAGD I 1 .O kcal/mol). 
Arg21, Leu75, and Asp101 are, thus, the minor immunodetermi￾nants, or "warmspots." The remaining alanine mutants do not per￾turb the equilibrium significantly (AAGD 5 0.3 kcal/mol). Thus, 
Hisl5, Trp63, Arg73, Thr89, Asn93, Ile98, and SerlOO are called 
the "nullspots." The hotspots are shown in red in Figure 5, and 
occupy the center of the epitope surrounded by the warm and 
nullspots in gold and blue, respectively. The central location of the 
hotspots in the interface of protein-protein complexes has been 
noted for other systems (Cunningham & Wells, 1993; Dall'Acqua 
et al., 1996; Goldman et al., 1997). Clackson and Wells (1995) 
report that the hotspots on the surface of human growth hormone 
pack together to form a hydrophobic patch surrounded by hydro￾philic residues, while the immunodeterminants on the surface of 
HEWL form a charged hydrophilic cluster with both hydrophobic 
and hydrophilic amino acids in the periphery (Fig. 5). The present 
results are in line with those obtained for the antibodies D1.3 and 
E5.2 (Goldman et al., 1997). Only those mutations that gave re￾sults of particular interest are discussed individually in the follow￾ing sections. 
Tyr2O 
The Tyr20 hydroxyl group hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl ox￾ygen atom of Ser9IL in the crystal structure of the complex (Pad￾lan et al., 1989). The Y20A mutant has a sharply reduced affinity 
for the antibody (AAGD = 4.27 * 0.15 kcal/mol). The phenylala￾nine mutant was constructed to isolate the role of the phenolic 
hydroxyl group. The KD value of the Y20F.Fab-10 complex is 
nearly indistinguishable experimentally from that of the WT com￾plex (Table 2, AAGD = -0.47 f 0.10 kcal/mol). This result dem￾onstrates that the contribution of the hydrogen bond is insignificant, Evaluation of lysozyme epitope for HyHEL-IO Fab 1871

and that the carbon side chain is entirely responsible for the en￾hanced stability of the complex. Y20L was made to evaluate fur￾ther the energetic contribution of the aromatic ring at this position 
to the stability of the complex. The Y20L lysozyme has an inter￾mediate affinity (between Y20A and Y20F, Table 2) for the anti￾body (AAG, = 2.19 f 0.14 kcal/mol). This result confirms that the 
aromatic ring provides most of the interaction energy at this po￾sition, presumably through a variety of local and/or remote con￾tacts. Conservation of gr20 in the avian lysozymes investigated 
by Smith-Gill et al. (1984b) precluded its earlier identification as 
a major immunodeterminant. Possibly for this reason, the role of 
5r20 was not evaluated in a computational analysis of the epitope 
(Novotny, 1991). 
Arg2I 
The crystal structure shows that both the side- and main-chain 
heteroatoms of Arg2l are involved in hydrogen-bond contacts with 
the antibody. The 71 and 72 nitrogen atoms interact with the 
5196~ and Tyr50H phenolic oxygen atoms, respectively (Padlan 
et al., 1989). The backbone nitrogen atom of Arg2l forms a hy￾drogen bond with the main-chain oxygen atom of A~n92~. The 
R21A.Fab-10 complex (AAG, = 0.86 * 0.12 kcal/mol) is mod￾erately destabilized compared to the WT HEWL complex. Previ￾ous work in our laboratory has shown that several mutations at this 
position (R21G, R21N, R21E, R21Q, R21H, R21K, and R21W) 
perturb the energetics of binding to the antibody by approximately 
2.2 kcal/mol (Kam-Morgan et al., 1993). Thus, the alanine re￾placement stands out as an anomaly. (See below for further dis￾cussion.) The R21V and R21M mutants were made to help to 
understand the discrepancy in the free energies of complex forma￾tion between the alanine and other mutations at this position. While 
the AAG, of the R21M-Fab-10 complex (2.05 k 0.07 kcal/mol) 
(Taylor et al., 1998) falls on the horizontal line established by 
Kam-Morgan et al. (1993) that for the R21V complex (1.70 f 0.07 
kcal/mol) is below the line (Fig. 6). The valine and alanine data 
points indicate that some compensation is introduced for the loss in 
the specific Arg21 interactions only by the smaller aliphatic side 
chains (Fig. 6). This result emphasizes the value of constructing a 
large replacement set of mutations (id addition to alanine) at cer￾tain positions to elucidate fully the role of a given amino acid side 
chain in protein function (Climie et al., 1990). 
Lys96 
The Lys96 side chain is completely buried within the HEW .Fab-lO 
interface, and the &-amino group makes hydrogen-bonding contacts 
with the His 15 backbone carbonyl oxygen atom and the side chain 
061 atom of Asn31L (Padlan et al., 1989). The mutation K96A ef￾fects the greatest change in free energy of complex formation with 
the antibody of all the alanine substitutions in the HEWL epitope 
(AAG, - 6.5 kcal/mol). K96M was constructed to attempt to isolate 
the free-energy contribution of the hydrogen bond formed by the 
&-amino group from that of the rest of the side chain. The result is 
that the AAG, value (6.7 k 0.15 kcal/mol) is virtually unchanged 
from that of the K96A complex. The K96R. Fab- 10 complex, which 
retains the positive charge of the original lysine residue, is slightly 
more stable (AAG, = 5.8 k 0.12 kcal/mol) than the corresponding 
alanine and methionine complexes. Strict conservation of Lys96 in 
avian lysozymes precluded identification of it as a major immuno￾determinant in previous studies (Smith-Gill et al., 1984b). The latest 1872 A. Rajpal et ul.

the formation of such a complex requires desolvation of the indi￾vidual components, association, and the specific solvation of the 
complex. The AG for the first step is positive while those for the 
second two are negative, but the magnitudes will vary. Hendsch 
and Tidor (1994) have addressed the contributions of salt bridges 
to protein stability computationally. They find that in a majority of 
cases the expected stabilization of salt bridges is compromised by 
large unfavorable desolvation contributions, and, therefore, sug￾gest that replacing salt bridges with “hydrophobic bridges” may 
increase stability.

empirical free energy simulations do not account for the destabili￾zation of the complex caused by the methionine mutation. The com￾puted value for the AAGD of the K96M .Fab-lO complex is only 0.7 
kcal/mol (Novotny et al., 1997). These workers noted that the side 
chain of Lys96 lies mostly buried within an intramolecular hydro￾gen bonding network with both His15 and the side-chain carbonyl 
oxygen atom of Asn93. As a result of this internal network within 
the free lysozyme, it is possible that substitutions at position 96HEWL 
could result in significant structural rearrangements in lysozyme (No￾votny et al., 1997). However, such conformational changes, should

and K, of the K96M mutant toward substrate M. Zuteus are within a 
factor of 2 of what is observed for the WTenzyme (data not shown). 
Lys97 
The &-amino group of Lys97 forms a salt-bridge with the side-chain 
carboxylate moiety ofAsp32” (Padlan et al., 1989). Calculations de￾rived from the crystal structure indicate that 18% of this residue 
is solvent exposed in the complex (Novotny et al., 1997). The 
K97A. Fab- 10 complex is 5.6 kcal/mol less stable than the WT com￾plex. Taylor et al. (1998) constructed K97M and K97R lysozymes 
to investigate the role of the intermolecular salt bridge. The in￾creased affinity of K97M and K97R for Fab-10 (Table 2), in com￾parison to K97A, suggests that the &-amino group of the Lys97 side 
chain contributes very little energetically to the stability of the com￾plex. The van der Waals contacts made by the remaining atoms of 
the side chain contribute significantly to the free-energy of com￾plex formation. The calculated value for AAGD of the K97M.Fab- 10 
complex (Novotny et al., 1997) of 4.2 kcal/mol is 3.4 kcal/mol 
greater than the experimental figure of 0.8 k 0.2 kcal/mol. 
The free energy contribution of a given salt bridge to the sta￾bility of a protein-protein complex can be highly variable, because 
Limitations of alanine scan mutagenesis 
Since its introduction by Wells (1991), alanine scan mutagenesis is 
finding increasing application in the investigation of protein￾protein complexes (Jin et al., 1992; Cunningham & Wells, 1993; 
Dall’Acqua et al., 1996; Pearce et al., 1997). While elegant in its 
simplicity, a single substitution may yield results that give an 
incomplete measure of how a given residue contributes to the 
stability of a complex. For example, R21A HEWL has a substan￾tially higher affinity for the antibody Fab-10 in comparison to nine 
other position 21 substituted lysozymes (Fig. 6). This particular 
case, which might be idiosyncratic, shows that subtraction of the 
entire side chain beyond the p carbon produces less of an effect 
than partial removal. 
In another example, Tsiang et al. (1 996) identified four residues 
in thrombin by alanine scan mutagenesis, which when mutated to 
alanine, yield an enzyme with increased specificity for the sub￾strate, protein C. One of these mutations E229A increased the 
specificity by 27-fold. The construct E229K, responsible for a 
130-fold change in specificity, was found only after saturation 
mutagenesis of the four positions. 
There is additional concern over the replacement of large side￾chain amino acids (e.g., Tyr or Trp) by alanine because of the 
possibility of associated structural changes in the mutated pro￾tein effecting remote interactions. For example, the Y20A and 
Y20L.Fab-10 complexes are 4.3 and 2.2 kcal/mol less stable, 
respectively, than that of the WT HEWL. In this case, it is clear 
that alanine scan mutagenesis gives a measure of the contribu￾tion of the entire side chain minus the p carbon to complex 
stability. By this measure “hotspots” will almost invariably be 
identified with large or charged amino acids. It is rather un￾likely, for example, that a Val -+ Ala mutation could result in a 
AAGD that is as large as that observed when larger, or charged 
amino acids are replaced by alanine. The largest Val -+ Ala 
effect, of which we are aware, is a AAG of 2.3 kcal/mol in the 
stability of gene V protein (Sandberg et al., 1995). We thank a 
reviewer for bringing this example to our attention. 
Furthermore, alanine scan mutagenesis does not dissect the con￾tributions of individual components of the replaced side chain. 
This point is illustrated by two examples from the present study. 
The contribution of the Tyr20 side chain to the stability of the 
Fab-I0 complex could arise from a combination of donations from 
the hydrocarbon and hydroxyl moieties. The Y20F mutation iso￾lated the hydrocarbon component as the critical one. Similarly, the 
K96A and K97A mutations each resulted in a greater than 5 kcal/ 
mol decrease in stability of their corresponding complexes with 
Fab-IO. However, the K96M and K97M constructs revealed that 
the &-amino group of Lys96 is solely responsible for that residues 
contribution to free energy of complexation while that of Lys97 is 
mostly from the alkyl portion of the side chain. Evaluation of lysozyme epitope for HyHEL-10 Fab 1873 
Materials and methods 
Materials 
The yeast expression vector pAB24 (Barr et al., 1987) and Sac￾chromyces cerevisiae strain GFWl8O (Donahue et al., 1983) were 
gifts from Chiron Corp. (Emeryville, California). Helper phage 
R408, for the generation of single-stranded U-labeled template, 
was obtained from Stratagene Corp (La Jolla, California). Esche￾richia coli strain DH5 -+ a F'lac 14 was from Gibco-BRL (Gaith￾ersburg, Maryland). CM-Sepharose, Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden), 
and hydroxyapatite, Bio-Rad (Hercules, California), chromatogra￾phy resins were used for protein purification. Centriprep ultrafil￾tration units, Amicon (Beverly, Massachusetts), were used to 
concentrated purified protein. Lyophilized M. luteus (ATCC 
no. 4698) and WT HEWL (E.C. 3.2.1.17) were purchased from 
Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Missouri). Oligonucleotides were 
synthesized by the DNA synthesis facility of the Department of 
Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley. 
Monoclonal antibodies (IgG) HyHEL-10 and HyHEL-5 were ob￾tained as described earlier (Smith-Gill et al., 1984a). Antigen bind￾ing fragments (Fab) for HyHEL- 10 (Fab- 10) and HyHEL-5 (Fab-5) 
were obtained by proteolyzing whole IgG with papain, and puri￾fying with a protein A column as outlined in the Fab generation kit 
(Pierce, Rockford, Illinois). 
Site-directed mutagenesis and protein expression 
All of the alanine mutants as well as K96M, K97M, and K97R 
were constructed and expressed in S. cerevisiae as described by 
Matsumura and Kirsch (1996). The Y20F, R21V, R21M, and K96R 
HEWLs were constructed by cloning the HEWL gene into plasmid 
pPIC9 (Invitrogen, California), and expressed in Pichia pastoris 
according to the protocol developed by S.-Y. Chen in this labora￾tory (unpubl. results). 
Protein purification 
Standard protein purification protocols were followed (Matsumura 
& Kirsch, 1996). HEWL containing fractions were identified by 
absorbance = 38,500 M" cm" (Sophianopoulos et al., 
1962)) and catalytic activity (Shih et al., 1993). Some preparations 
were purified further by hydroxyapatite column chromatography 
with a 50-500 mM potassium phosphate elution gradient (pH 6.2). 
The purity of all enzymes was verified by SDS-PAGE. Y20A, 
R21A, K96A, Y20F, R21V, K96R, and WT HEWL were purified 
by reversed phase HPLC employing a water-acetonitrile gradient. 
The appropriate fractions were pooled, lyophilized, and verified 
for molecular weight by electrospray mass spectrometry by the 
facility of the Department of Chemistry, University of California, 
Berkeley. 
The concentrations of HEWL variants were determined as de￾scribed by Taylor et al. (preceding paper). Mutants with weak 
affinity for Fab-10 were titrated with Fab-5. 
Determination of k,,, 
The rate constants for association (/con) of the HEWL variants and 
Fab-10 were determined as described by Taylor et al. (1998). Data 
for the first 50 s were discarded due to the turbulence of mixing 
with heterogeneous substrate. All data were obtained on a Uvikon 
860 (Kontron Instruments, San Diego, California) spectrophotom￾eter, and fitted by nonlinear regression to their respective models 
utilizing the Kaleidagraph application (Synergy Software, Read￾ing, Pennsylvania). 
Determination of k, 
Equimolar concentrations of the lysozyme variant and Fab- 10 (10- 
20 nM each, total volume of 18 mL) were maintained in 66 mM 
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) for 1 h at 25 "C to allow 
complex formation to proceed to completion. A 1 mL aliquot of the 
mixture was assayed for activity under V,,, conditions in order to 
determine the initial complex concentration. The complex was 
then challenged with a 20- to %fold molar excess of the inactive 
lysozyme mutant, E35Q, which has a KO similar to that of WT, in 
order to scavenge irreversibly the free Fab-IO released upon dis￾sociation of the original complex. Glu35 is outside of the HyHEL-10 
epitope (Padlan et al., 1989) and E35Q has near-wild-type affinity 
for the antibody (data not shown). Aliquots of the above reaction 
mixture were assayed as a function of time. The time-dependent 
increase in enzyme activity was fit by nonlinear regression analy￾sis to Equation 2 in order to determine the dissociation rate con￾stant, kOff. 
where vlnif represents the enzyme activity due to the complex and 
residual free HEWL at t = 0 before addition of excess E35Q, and 
[HEWL,] is the total concentration of the enzyme in the assay, 
and vhl the nonenzymatic settling rate of the substrate. The sole 
fitted parameter is kOR. Data were obtained with Uvikon 860 and 
Lambda-6 (Perkin-Elmer, San Jose, California) spectrophotom￾eters and fitted to the model by nonlinear regression with the 
Kaleidagraph application. 
Determination of KO 
The competitive inhibition assay of Kam-Morgan et al. (1993) was 
used to obtain the equilibrium constant for dissociation for those 
HEWL variants whose low affinity for the antibody prevented the 
determination of k,, and kOE. Typically, 1 mL aliquots of 2-10 nM 
HEWL variant was incubated with varying concentrations (0.1 to 
10 X the expected KO) of Fab- 10 in 66 mM potassium phosphate 
buffer at 25 "C for at least 1 h. The reaction mixtures were assayed 
for HEWL activity with a large excess of substrate (100 pg/mL). 
The initial velocity data were fitted to the model of Equation 3, 
which accounts additionally for the observed -5% residual activ￾ity of the complex. 
where 8 = [HEWL,] + [Ab,] + KO, and kl and k2 are the rate 
constants for activity of HEWL and the complex toward the sub￾strate, respectively. Total concentrations of HEWL and the anti￾body are represented by [HEWL,] and [Ab,]. The settling rate of 
the substrate in the absence of enzyme is vhl. The fitted parameters 
are k,, k2. and KD. Data were obtained with Uvikon 860 and 1874 A. Rajpal et al. 
Lambda-6 spectrophotometers, and were fitted to Equation 3 by 
nonlinear regression with the Kaleidagraph application.
