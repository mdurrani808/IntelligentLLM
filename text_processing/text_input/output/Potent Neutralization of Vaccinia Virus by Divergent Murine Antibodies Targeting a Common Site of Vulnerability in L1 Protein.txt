ABSTRACT
Vaccinia virus (VACV) L1 is an important target for viral neutralization and has been included in multicomponent DNA or pro￾tein vaccines against orthopoxviruses. To further understand the protective mechanism of the anti-L1 antibodies, we generated
five murine anti-L1 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), which clustered into 3 distinct epitope groups. While two groups of anti-L1
failed to neutralize, one group of 3 MAbs potently neutralized VACV in an isotype- and complement-independent manner. This
is in contrast to neutralizing antibodies against major VACV envelope proteins, such as H3, D8, or A27, which failed to com￾pletely neutralize VACV unless the antibodies are of complement-fixing isotypes and complement is present. Compared to non￾neutralizing anti-L1 MAbs, the neutralization antibodies bound to the recombinant L1 protein with a significantly higher affin￾ity and also could bind to virions. By using a variety of techniques, including the isolation of neutralization escape mutants,
hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography, the epitope of the neutralizing antibodies was
mapped to a conformational epitope with Asp35 as the key residue. This epitope is similar to the epitope of 7D11, a previously
described potent VACV neutralizing antibody. The epitope was recognized mainly by CDR1 and CDR2 of the heavy chain, which
are highly conserved among antibodies recognizing the epitope. These antibodies, however, had divergent light-chain and heavy￾chain CDR3 sequences. Our study demonstrates that the conformational L1 epitope with Asp35 is a common site of vulnerability
for potent neutralization by a divergent group of antibodies.
IMPORTANCE
Vaccinia virus, the live vaccine for smallpox, is one of the most successful vaccines in human history, but it presents a level of
risk that has become unacceptable for the current population. Studying the immune protection mechanism of smallpox vaccine
is important for understanding the basic principle of successful vaccines and the development of next-generation, safer vaccines
for highly pathogenic orthopoxviruses. We studied antibody targets in smallpox vaccine by developing potent neutralizing anti￾bodies against vaccinia virus and comprehensively characterizing their epitopes. We found a site in vaccinia virus L1 protein as
the target of a group of highly potent murine neutralizing antibodies. The analysis of antibody-antigen complex structure and
the sequences of the antibody genes shed light on how these potent neutralizing antibodies are elicited from immunized mice.
Variola virus and monkeypox virus are orthopoxviruses that are
highly pathogenic to humans, are considered to be potential bio￾terrorism agents (1), and are emerging pathogens (2). A related or￾thopoxvirus, vaccinia virus (VACV), serves as the vaccine against
these pathogens. Live VACV immunization is capable of eliciting
neutralizing antibodies against a variety of targets on two antigeni￾cally distinct forms of virions, the intracellular mature virions (MV)
and the extracellular enveloped virions (EV) (3, 4). Vaccinia vaccine
is arguably the most successful vaccine in human history, having led
to the eradication of smallpox (5). However, it was also associated
with a relatively high rate of adverse events (6). Consequently, safer
multicomponent DNA or protein vaccines that include a subset of
MV and EV antigens (Ag) have been developed, and they showed
protection against orthopoxvirus challenges in mice and nonhuman
primates (7–10). While many MV antigens have been shown to be
neutralization targets (11, 12), the MV antigen that is invariably in￾cluded in these subunit vaccines is L1. L1 is an immunodominant
neutralizing antibody target in mice, although it is a less common
target in humans (13). It is a 250-amino-acid myristoylated protein
with a C-terminal transmembrane domain that spans residues 186 to
204 (14,15). L1 associates with the virus-encoded multiprotein entry￾fusion complex (EFC) and plays an essential role in viral entry (16).
Despite the importance of L1 as a neutralizing target and sub￾unit vaccine component, relatively little is known about its neu￾tralizing epitopes and the corresponding paratopes. A conforma￾tional epitope with Asp35 as the key residue is recognized by
several murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (17), which po￾tently neutralize MV. The sequence of one of the MAbs, 7D11, has
been reported, and a structure of the Fab domain of 7D11 bound
to L1 has been determined (18). A linear epitope (residues 118 to
128) of L1 is recognized by several antibodies, which neutralized

gain a more comprehensive understanding of neutralizing
epitopes on L1 and the neutralizing mechanism of anti-L1 anti￾bodies, we developed additional MAbs against L1, examined their
neutralizing abilities in vitro and in vivo, and determined their
epitopes and the corresponding paratopes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Viruses and antibodies. VACVWR stocks were grown on HeLa cells in
T175 flasks, infecting them at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5. Cells were
harvested at 60 h, and virus was isolated by rapidly freeze-thawing the cell
pellet three times in a volume of 2.3 ml RPMI plus 1% fetal calf serum
(FCS). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Clarified supernatant
was frozen at 80°C as virus stock. Titers of VACVWR stocks were deter￾mined on Vero cells (2  108 PFU/ml). VACVACAM2000 was obtained
from the CDC. Strain Mos-3-P2 (Moscow strain) of ectromelia virus, as
described in Chen et al. (20), was used for ectromelia in vivo studies.
Monoclonal antibodies used in the study are the following: anti-B5, B126
(21); anti-A10, BG3.1 (22); anti-H3, JH4 (22) and 41 (23); anti-A27, 1G6
and 12G2 (unpublished data); anti-D8, JE10 (22) and LA5 (24).
Hybridoma generation and characterization. The generation and
characterization of the hybridomas were performed as described previ￾ously (22), except for some changes in the immunization procedure de￾scribed below. BALB/c mice initially were infected intranasally with 5 
103 PFU of VACVWR. Subsequently, the mice were boosted twice with
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 100 g of recombinant L1 proteins to￾gether with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant. Recombinant L1 proteins were
either a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of L1(1-185) or His￾tagged L1(1-185). Both forms of recombinant L1 proteins were expressed
in Escherichia coli, and the His-tagged L1(1-185) protein was refolded as
described below. The hybridomas were screened with enzyme-linked im￾munosorbent assays (ELISAs) against recombinant L1 proteins and with
an immunofluorescence assay of VACVWR-infected cells as described pre￾viously (22).
L1 expression and purification. The VACV-L1 (residues 1 to 185)
expression construct was kindly provided by David Garboczi, and expres￾sion and refolding was carried out as reported previously (15). Refolded
protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity
chromatography (5-ml HisTrap FF column; GE Healthcare) by elution
with 0.2 M imidazole, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl. The eluted protein
then was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Super￾dex 200 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare). Proper protein folding
was verified by ELISA using three different anti-L1 antibodies.
Cross-blocking ELISA.Refolded L1(1-185) was prepared at 0.5g/ml
and used to coat Nunc polysorbent flat-bottom 96-well plates with 100 l
per well. Plates were incubated overnight at 4°C and washed four times
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.05% Tween 20. One hundred
l of blocking buffer (PBS plus 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) was added
to the plate and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. Blocking
buffer was discarded, and 100 l of the antibodies of interest was added to
the plate at 10 g/ml and incubated for 90 min. Horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated antibodies of interest (Innova Biosciences lightning￾link HRP conjugation kit) were prepared at 0.5 g/ml and added to the
plates for 20 min. The plates were developed using o-phenylenediamine
(OPD), and optical density (OD) at 490 nm was read on a SpectraMax 250
(Molecular Devices).
Flow cytometry-based in vitro neutralization. Vero E6 cells (1  105
cells/well) were seeded in 96-well Costar plates (Corning Inc., Corning,
NY) and incubated for 5 h to adhere. Subsequently, cells were infected
with 12.5 l purified VACV-green fluorescent protein (GFP) at 1  106
PFU/ml (final PFU of 1.25  104
) and 12.5 l MAbs at 80 g/ml (final
concentration of 20 g/ml) for 12 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a total volume
of 50l in the presence (2% final concentration) or absence of sterile baby
rabbit complement (Cedarlane). Samples were prepared in duplicates.
Cells subsequently were tested using flow cytometry as described previ￾ously (21).
Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). Vero E6 cells were
seeded into 6-well Costar plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and used
within 2 days of reaching confluence. Purified antibodies were prepared in
duplicates at 20 g/ml, and 5-fold serial dilutions were performed in PBS.
Ten l of sonicated VACVWR at 1  105 PFU/ml was added to 970 l for
every titrated antibody sample, resulting in a final concentration of 1 
103 PFU/sample. For samples to be tested in the presence of complement,
20 l of complement was added, resulting in a final concentration of 2%.
PBS was used instead for other samples. Samples were incubated for 1 h at
4°C with shaking. Medium was aspirated from 6-well plates, and 1 ml of
sample mixtures was added to each well to adsorb for 60 min at 37°C with
periodic swirling. The mix was aspirated, 2 ml of Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium (DMEM) with 1% FBS plus 1% penicillin-streptomycin
was added, and the plates were incubated for 2.5 days for the plaques to
develop. The medium was aspirated, the cells were fixed and stained in
one step with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% ethanol, and the plaques were
quantified over white-light transillumination. The data were plotted, and
a curve of best fit was applied by eye. The neutralization ability was inves￾tigated as a comparison of the samples, including antibody to the mean
number of plaques of controls with no antibody.
Vaccinia intranasal infections and protection studies. Female
BALB/c mice were used at an age of 7 to 8 weeks. Animal husbandry and
experimental procedures were approved by the Department of Labora￾tory Animal Care and the Animal Care Committee of the La Jolla Institute.
To infect the mice, a Pipetman was used to place 10 l of VACVWR on
each nare of an isoflurane-anesthetized mouse (total volume, 20 l), and
the liquid was rapidly inhaled by the mouse. Mice were weighed daily to
assess disease progression. After intranasal infection with VACVWR, mice
develop a systemic infection and exhibit severe weight loss. Mice were
euthanized if and when 25% weight loss occurred. A dose of 1  105 PFU
of VACVWR was the standard lethal dose given to 7-week-old BALB/c
females. For L1 MAb protection studies, mice were treated by i.p. injec￾tion with 100 g of antibodies 1 day before infection. Control mice re￾ceived anti-A10 BG3.1 antibody, which is known to provide no protec￾tion. An additional group received anti-B5 B126 as a positive control.
Vaccinia intravenous infection protection studies. To infect mice,
1  105 PFU of VACVACAM2000 was injected retro-orbitally. Mice were
weighed daily to assess disease progression. The clinical score, a composite
score of the pox lesion abundance on the four paws plus the tail, was
evaluated as described previously (23). For L1 MAb protection studies,
mice were inoculated i.p. with 100 g of antibodies 1 day before infection.
Control mice received anti-A10 BG3.1 antibody. An additional group
received anti-H3 number 41 as a positive control.
Ectromelia infection and protection studies. Four- to 6-week-old
female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Indianap￾olis, IN), housed in filter-top microisolator cages, and fed commercial
mouse chow and water ad libitum. The mice were housed in an animal
biosafety level 3 containment area. Animal husbandry and experimental
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Saint Louis University. The day before challenge, mice were
treated i.p. with 100 g of the specified antibody. Immediately before
challenge, mice were anesthetized with 0.1 ml/10 g body weight of ket￾amine HCl (6 mg/ml) and xylazine (0.5 mg/ml) by i.p. injections. One
thousand PFU of ECTV (Moscow strain) in PBS without Ca2 and Mg2
was slowly loaded into nares (5 l/nare). Mice subsequently were left in
situ for 2 to 3 min before being returned to their cages (25, 26). Mice were
monitored daily for mortality and morbidity, as measured by weight
change.
Epitope mapping by ELISA. Overlapping 20-mer peptides for the L1
antigen were synthesized (AnaSpec) and tested for MAb binding using an
ELISA. Flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 100 l of
neutravidin biotin-binding protein (1 mg/ml) diluted in PBS overnight at
4°C (ThermoScientific Pierce). Coated plates were washed with washing

(PBS, pH 7.2, 1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at
room temperature (RT). Plates were incubated with 100l of overlapping
linear biotinylated peptides (200 ng/ml) in blocking buffer for 90 min at
RT. Plates were washed and incubated with purified MAb at 10 g/ml for
90 min at RT. Plates were washed, and the bound MAb was detected by
adding a streptavidin-HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to mouse im￾munoglobulin G (Invitrogen) and incubated for 60 min at RT, followed
by incubation in OPD substrate (Sigma-Aldrich).
Peptide truncation and alanine scan. Variant peptides with N- or
C-terminal truncations and/or alanine substitutions were tested for their
ability to block binding to the parent 20-mer peptides in ELISA. Ninety￾six-well plates were coated with 100 l neutravidin per well at a concen￾tration of 0.5 g/ml. Plates were incubated overnight at 4°C and washed 4
times with PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20. One hundred l of blocking buffer
(PBS plus 10% FBS) was added to the plates and incubated for 90 min at
4°C. Blocking buffer was discarded, and 100 l of biotinylated 20-mer
peptides was added to the plate at 200 ng/ml and incubated for 90 min at
4°C. Simultaneously, selected antibodies were incubated with variant pep￾tides. We used 30 l/well of MAb at 600 ng/ml and incubated it with 30
l/well of alanine-modified peptides at 100 g/ml for 90 min at 4°C. After
washing the plates, 50l of the antibody/alanine peptide mix was added to
plate-bound peptides and incubated for 20 min at 4°C. Plates were
washed, and 100 l/well of secondary goat anti-mouse anti-IgG HRP
(1:1,000 diluted in blocking buffer) was added and incubated for 90 min at
4°C. A final wash step was performed, plates were developed using o￾phenylenediamine, and the OD at 490 nm was read on a SpectraMax 250
(Molecular Devices).
Epitope mapping by deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. To
maximize peptide sequence coverage, the optimized quench and proteol￾ysis conditions were determined prior to deuterium exchange mass spec￾trometry (DXMS) experiments (27). For each sample, 0.4 l of stock
solution of L1 at 6.2 mg/ml was diluted with 7.6 l of H2O buffer (8.3 mM
Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, in H2O, pH 7.2) at 0°C and then quenched with
12 l of a quench solution containing 0.8% formic acid, 16% glycerol, 1.4
M guanidine HCl, and 100 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP).
The quenched samples were incubated on ice for 5 min, frozen on dry ice,
and stored at 80°C. Procedures for pepsin digestion from DXMS have
been described elsewhere (28). In addition, nondeuterated samples (in￾cubated in the H2O buffer mentioned above) and equilibrium-deuterated
back-exchange control samples (incubated in D2O buffer containing
0.5% formic acid overnight at 25°C) were prepared as described elsewhere
(29). The centroids of the isotopic envelopes of nondeuterated, function￾ally deuterated, and fully deuterated peptides were measured using
HDExaminer and then converted to corresponding deuteration levels
with corrections for back exchange (30).
Isolation of neutralization escape mutants. A crude stock of mutant
VACV was prepared from cells that were infected with VACVWR in the
presence of ethyl methanesulfonate (Sigma-Aldrich). Ethyl methanesul￾fonate was present in the culture medium at 500 g/ml from 2 h to 6 h
postinfection. The mutant viral stock was mixed with M12B9 antibody at
a final concentration of 100 g/ml for 1 h, and the mixture was applied to
fresh cells. After 2 h of incubation, the mixture was removed from the cells
and crude viruses subsequently were prepared. This process was repeated
3 to 4 times with a constant antibody concentration but with increasingly
less crude viruses than the previous round. Clones of viruses were plaque
purified from the final viral stock, and individual clones were tested for
neutralization by M12B9. Clones that resisted M12B9 neutralization were
selected, and their L1 gene was sequenced.
Fab digestion and purification. Purified M12B9 and 8C8 MAbs
(mouse IgG2a and IgG2b, respectively) at 1 mg/ml were incubated with
2% (wt/wt) activated papain for 4 h at 37°C in digestion buffer (50 mM
sodium acetate [NaOAc], pH 5.5). Papain was activated by incubating
24.4 l papain solution (Sigma stock solution at 20.5 mg/ml) with 100 l
10 papain buffer (1 M sodium acetate [NaOAc] [pH 5.5], 12 mM
EDTA) and 100 l cysteine (12.2 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37°C. The papain
digestion was stopped by adding 13 mM iodoacetamide (IAM). Samples
were dialyzed overnight against PBS. Subsequent protein A purification
was performed to remove any uncleaved IgG and Fc fragments. The pro￾tein A flowthrough containing Fab was concentrated and purified by size￾exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 200 column using 20
mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl.
Fab-Ag complex preparation. L1 and M12B9-Fab were mixed to￾gether at a L1:Fab stoichiometric ratio of 1.5:1 and at a low concentration
(1 mg/ml). The L1/Fab complex then was concentrated to a volume of
1.2 ml using centrifugal filtration devices (Amicon Ultra 15; 10-kDa-mo￾lecular-weight cutoff) and subjected to SEC purification (Superdex 200
16/60) to separate the L1/Fab complex from any excess of L1. Before
crystallization, the nature of the complex was verified by nonreducing
SDS-PAGE. Fractions corresponding to the complex were pooled and
concentrated to 6.2 and 9.5 mg/ml in SEC buffer using centrifugal filtra￾tion devices.
Crystallization and structure determination. Initial crystallization
experiments were carried out by sitting-drop vapor diffusion in a 96-well
format, using a Phoenix liquid-handling robot (Art Robbins Instru￾ments), with a panel of commercial sparse-matrix screens (PEG/Ion 1 and
2 from Hampton Research, Wizard 2 from Emerald Biosciences, JCSG

IMGT’s V-Quest service (40).
Alternatively, an Illumina MiSeq library preparation was performed
by standard Illumina methods. Briefly, the Nextera XT DNA sample prep￾aration kit uses an engineered transposome to fragment and tag (“tag￾ment”) input DNA simultaneously, adding unique adapter sequences in
the process. A limited-cycle PCR using those adapter sequences was per￾formed to amplify the inserted DNA. The PCR also adds index sequences
on both ends of the DNA, enabling dual-indexed sequencing of pooled
libraries on the Illumina MiSeq instrument to generate approximately
100,000 to 300,000 paired-end reads per sample. Data then were analyzed
via IMGT/HighV-QUEST.
L1 site-directed mutagenesis. Three individual L1 mutants, N27A,
Q31A, and D35A, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the L1
wild-type expression vector using the QuikChange II mutagenesis kit
(Agilent Technologies) and verified by sequencing. The protein was pro￾duced as reported above and used for subsequent binding studies.
Real-time binding assay using BLI. To test the effect of the single￾alanine mutations on antibody binding, biolayer interferometry (BLI)-
based assays using the OctetRED96 instrument (ForteBio, Inc.) were per￾formed. As L1 nonspecifically bound to mouse Fc antibody capture chips,
all assays were performed by immobilizing L1 on Ni-NTA biosensors via
its C-terminal hexahistidine tag. There was no measurable dissociation of
L1 from the Ni-NTA tips. Binding kinetics of WT-L1 and mutants to
M12B9-Fab, 8C8-Fab, and 39D4-IgG were determined using Octet Data
Analysis 7.1 software (Forte Bio, Inc.) with curve-fitting statistics. Ni￾NTA biosensors were loaded with 20 nM L1 protein in 1 kinetics buffer
(PBS, pH 7.4, 0.002% Tween 20, 0.01% BSA) over 5 min. L1-loaded tips
were tested against 2-fold serial dilutions of Fab and IgG analytes with a 50
nM starting concentration of M12B9-Fab and 8C8-Fab and 400 nM start￾ing concentration of 39D4-IgG. The association steps were performed
over 10 min, and dissociation steps were performed over 15 min. The
buffer control was subtracted from raw data, and curves were aligned to
the baseline. The dissociation constant (KD), on rate (kon), and off rate
(koff) were determined by global fitting of association and dissociation
steps for all dilutions using a 1:1 binding model.
Fluorescence microscopy. BHK cells grown on coverslips were in￾fected with WT-GFP, a strain of VACVWR that expresses GFP (41), at 0.5
PFU/cell. At 8 h postinfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformalde￾hyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5
min, blocked with 10% FBS for 60 min, and stained with 1 g/ml of
anti-L1 MAb for 1 h and goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Cy3
for one additional hour. The DNA was stained with 4=,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen). For virion staining, sucrose gradient￾purified VACVWR virions were absorbed to glass coverslips coated with
fibronectin (BD Biosciences) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The
virions then were stained with anti-L1 MAb and DAPI as described above.
Accession numbers. The GenBank accession numbers for the anti￾body sequences determined in the course of this work were deposited in
GenBank under accession numbers KM116467, KM116468, KM116469,
KM116470, KM116471, KM116472, KM116473, and KM116474.
RESULTS
Generation of anti-L1 MAbs. In our previous screens of B cell
hybridomas derived from mice immunized with live VACV (22),
no anti-L1 hybridomas were found. To increase the chance of
getting anti-L1 MAbs, we modified the immunization strategy by
performing additional boosting with recombinant L1 protein af￾ter immunizing the mice with live VACV. Initially, a GST fusion of
L1(1-185) was used in the boosting, and 2 anti-L1 MAbs (8C8 and
39D4) were obtained. Subsequently, a His-tagged L1 (1-185) pro￾tein that had undergone refolding was used, and 3 additional an￾ti-L1 MAbs (M12B9, M2E9, and M7B6) were obtained (Table 1).
All 5 L1 antibodies bound refolded L1 protein in ELISA (shown
later) and immunoprecipitated L1 protein from VACV-infected
cells (data not shown). Cross-blocking ELISA was performed, and
the MAbs clustered into three distinct groups (Fig. 1). 8C8
and 39D4 each have a unique epitope, whereas M2E9, M7B6, and
M12B9 share a mutual binding site.
Group I anti-L1 MAbs potently neutralized MV. We tested
the ability of the anti-L1 MAbs to neutralize VACV MV in two
different neutralization assays (Fig. 2). First, Vero E6 cells were
incubated overnight with purified VACVWR MV expressing a
green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the presence or absence of
antibody and complement. Samples were evaluated the next day
using a flow cytometer. Group I MAbs (M12B9, M2E9, and
M7B6) neutralized more than 70% of the viruses at 20 g/ml (Fig.
2A). In contrast, 8C8 did not neutralize the virus, while 39D4
neutralized less than 20%. The level of neutralization achieved by
the group I MAbs was significantly higher than that by any other
in-house MV neutralizing antibodies at similar concentrations. In
the absence of complement, MAbs against other major MV anti￾gens, like A27, H3, and D8, neutralized a maximum of 15% MV.
They neutralized closer to 70% only in the presence of comple￾ment. In contrast, complement did not further enhance the neu￾tralization by 39D4, although 39D4 was of the complement-fixing
isotype.
We then tested the ability of the group I anti-L1 MAbs to neu￾tralize VACVWR MV with a plaque reduction assay to confirm our
initial results. Purified VACVWR MV was incubated in the pres￾ence or absence of antibody and complement for 1 h and then
tested for infectivity in a plaque assay. L1 antibodies reduced
plaque numbers dramatically in the absence and presence of com￾plement, showing strong neutralizing ability (Fig. 2B). Anti-H3
MAb 41 did not neutralize the virus in the absence of complement
(Fig. 2B, top) but provided excellent neutralization in the presence

lethal ectromelia virus challenge. Survival of C57BL/6 mice treated with an￾ti-L1 M12B9 MAb at D1, followed by a 1,000-PFU ECTV challenge at D0. By
day 12 of the experiment, all mice of group M12B9 were dead, but B126-
treated mice were protected. There were 5 mice per group.

small effect in this particular assay. However, a neutralization￾enhancing effect was detectable in the presence of complement.
Anti-D8 MAb JE10 showed similar results. Based on those results,
we conclude that group I anti-L1 MAbs can potently neutralize
MV in a largely complement-independent manner. Although
complement is not required for potent neutralization of VACV by
the group I MAbs, it did enhance the neutralization by the MAb of
the complement-fixing isotype (M12B9) at low antibody concen￾tration.
Group I anti-L1 MAbs protected against vaccinia virus infec￾tion. Anti-L1 MAbs were tested in two in vivo vaccinia virus pro￾tection systems. First, they were assessed for their ability to protect
BALB/c mice against a lethal intranasal dose (105 PFU) of
VACVWR. Anti-B5 MAb B126 provided outstanding protection
against weight loss at day 7 (P  0.0001) and death (P 	 0.005)
after lethal VACVWR infection (Fig. 3A and B). As expected, anti￾A10 MAb BG3.1 had no effect, and neither did anti-L1 MAb 39D4
(P 	 0.27 for weight loss, P 	 0.60 for death). 8C8 had very
modest efficacy (P 	 0.0088 for weight loss, P 	 0.0005 for death).
Anti-L1 MAbs M12B9, M2E9, and M7B6 all provided significant
protection against death (50%, 100%, and 80%, respectively) but
poor protection against weight loss (P 	 0.062, P 	 0.0075, and
P 	 0.011, respectively). This indicates that EV is the primary
virion form important in lung infection of BALB/c mice, and there
are limited opportunities for anti-L1 Abs to neutralize virus in the
FIG 5 Linear epitope determination of 39D4 MAb. (A) Summary of epitope mapping of VACV anti-L1 MAbs by linear peptide ELISA. All 5 MAbs bind to the
full-length L1 protein, but only 39D4 binds an individual peptide (121-140). (B and D) Truncation assay discovered the epitope to be amino acids 123 to 132 of
peptide 121-140. A low optical density (OD) indicates that the peptide fragment preincubated with the antibody fully occupies the antibody’s episome and
prevents it from binding to plate-bound full-length peptide. (C and E) Alanine scan of the linear (lin.) epitope 123-132 revealed N124, K125, I128, and I132 to
be key residues for antibody binding. A lowered OD indicates the decreased ability of the antibody to bind to that particular peptide; thus, the alanine-substituted
residue in the original peptide has a large effect on the binding ability. Dashed lines indicate a cutoff for positive results (OD of 1.0). w/o, without.

model, SCID mice infected with 105 PFU ACAM2000 retro-orbit￾ally (Fig. 3C to E). This model is much more MV dependent than
intranasal infection with VACVWR (12, 23, 42, 43). Anti-A10 MAb
BG3.1 was used as a negative control, and anti-H3 #41 was used as
a positive control. In this model, M12B9, M2E9, and M7B6 each
provided outstanding protection against weight loss (P  0.001)
(Fig. 3C), death (P 	 0.0002) (Fig. 3D), and pox lesions (clinical
score) at day 46 (23) (Fig. 3E). 8C8 again had modest efficacy (P 	
0.042 for weight loss, P 	 0.068 for death, and P 	 0.0026 for pox
at day 21). 39D4 had some measurable activity but was the least
effective of the MAbs, as measured by protection against weight
loss (P 	 0.098) or pox development at day 21 (P 	 0.22). From
these two studies, we conclude that anti-L1 MAbs M12B9, M2E9,
and M7B6 are highly effective in vivo at neutralizing MV but not
EV and provide excellent protection in proportion to the involve￾ment of MV in disease pathogenesis.
Group I anti-L1 MAbs failed to protect against ectromelia
virus infection. One goal of researching immunity induced by
smallpox vaccination is to be able to develop vaccination or treat￾ment strategies that work across different poxviruses in order to be
able to quickly deploy such strategies in the event of a different
poxvirus emerging as a human health threat. Given that the an￾ti-L1 antibodies in group I were highly protective against vaccinia
FIG 6 Epitope mapping of anti-L1 M12B9 MAb using DXMS. Deuterium exchange data show differences in deuteration levels in the presence compared to the
absence of MAb binding at four time points (10 s, 30 s, 100 s, and 1,000 s). Slower deuterium exchange is marked in blue, and faster exchange is marked in red.
Residues 25 to 34 and 113 to 131 (red boxes) show the most marked slowing, indicating regions likely incorporating epitope binding sites.
FIG 7 Identification of Asp35 as a key epitope residue for group I MAbs. (A) Part of the L1 sequence of two VACV mutants that are resistant to neutralization by M12B9.
The two mutants were plaque purified from VACV that had been mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate and escaped the neutralization by M12B9. The L1 coding
sequence of the mutants was determined. Shown in the dashed box is a single-nucleotide substitution compared to the wild-type sequence. (B) VACV mutants with
D35N or D35Y substitution in L1 were resistant to neutralization by all group I anti-L1 MAbs. The abilities of the anti-L1 MAbs to neutralize wild-type or mutant VACV
were determined with the plaque reduction assay. The labels below the x axis indicate the viruses that were used for neutralization. (C) Amino acid comparison of L1 and
its ectromelia ortholog (EVM072) shows four differences, one of which is residue 35 (D35 in vaccinia versus N35 in ectromelia).
Kaever et al.
11346 jvi.asm.org Journal of Virologyvirus challenge, we asked if they also could protect from infection
with ectromelia virus (ECTV). We chose M12B9 as a representa￾tive for our group I antibodies.
C57BL/6 mice were intranasally challenged with 1,000 PFU of
ECTV on day zero (D0) (10 50% lethal dose [LD50]). Mono￾clonal antibodies (100 g) were administered by intraperitoneal
injection 1 day prior to challenge (D1). As shown in Fig. 4, B126
provided protection against a lethal challenge with ECTV (P 	
0.002); however, M12B9 did not protect against death (P 	 0.13),
as all animals were dead by D12. The reason why M12B9 did not
protect against ectromelia virus will become clear later.
Epitope mapping of group III anti-L1 MAb. To understand
why the anti-L1 MAbs have such a big difference in neutralization
abilities, we continued characterization of those MAbs by map￾ping their epitopes. ELISAs were performed with a series of 20-
mer peptides spanning L1, overlapping by 10 residues. All anti-L1
MAbs recognized L1 protein (1-185). However, except for 39D4,
no other MAbs recognized any L1 peptides, indicating that they
bind conformational epitopes. 39D4 recognized a linear peptide
spanning residues 121 to 140 (Fig. 5A). Truncation analysis of the
peptide showed that the binding site was contained in residues 123
to 132 (Fig. 5B and D). Alanine substitutions of peptide 123-132
identified four residues (N124, K125, I128, and I132) as critical for
binding by 39D4 (Fig. 5C and E).
Epitope mapping of group I anti-L1MAb.As group I antibod￾ies potently neutralize MV, we next focused on mapping the
epitopes of group I MAbs. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass
spectrometry experiments were performed with M12B9. L1 (1-
185) alone and in complex with M12B9 was incubated with deu￾terium for 10, 30, 100, and 1,000 s. Following pepsin digestion, L1
peptide fragments were detected by mass spectrometry. The rate
of deuterium exchange is highest in solvent-exposed amino acids.
Regions 25-34 and 113-131 of L1 have the most slowing of deute￾rium exchange in the presence of M12B9 (Fig. 6), suggesting that
they are part of the epitope.
To identify key epitope residues of group I MAbs, VACV mu￾tants that resisted the neutralization by M12B9 were selected. Cells
infected with VACVWR were incubated in the presence of ethyl
methanesulfonate (EMS) to induce transition mutations in viral
DNA. M12B9 then was used to neutralize the mutant viruses. The
titer of the initial viral stock was greatly reduced by M12B9. How￾ever, after passaging the viruses three times following M12B9 neu￾tralization, the passaged viral stock was no longer significantly
neutralized by M12B9. Clones of the mutants were plaque puri￾fied, and two of the clones showed complete resistance to neutral￾ization by M12B9. The L1 coding sequences of the mutants were
determined and found to have a single-amino-acid substitution
mutation at residue D35. One mutant had a D35N substitution,
while the other one had a D35Y substitution (Fig. 7). Both escape
mutants also were resistant to neutralization by the other two
group I MAbs (M2E9 and M7B6) (Fig. 7B), indicating that D35 is
essential for the binding of all group I MAbs. Previously, D35N
substitution in L1 was found to be responsible for escaping the
neutralization by a highly potent anti-L1 MAb, 2D5 (17). There￾fore, the group I MAbs and 2D5 target a similar epitope that in￾cludes D35 as a critical residue. Amino acid comparison of L1 and
its ectromelia ortholog (EVM072) showed four differences (Fig.
7C), one of which is residue 35 (D35 in vaccinia versus N35 in
ectromelia). This difference could explain the lack of in vivo pro￾tection against ectromelia virus by M12B9.
Crystal structure of M12B9/L1 complex. We also determined
the structure of L1 in complex with the Fab domain of M12B9 at a
resolution of 3.1 Å and compared its mode of L1 binding with that
of the previously determined 7D11 antibody (18) (Table 2). Four
copies of the Fab/L1 complex were present in the asymmetric unit.
M12B9 Fab binds to four long loops that connect the 4-helix bun￾dle at the tip of L1, presumably away from the viral membrane, in
an orientation that is very similar to that of the antibody 7D11
(Fig. 8A).
L1 residues E25, N27, A28, S29, Q31, T32, K33, D35, S58, A59,
D60, A61, D62, K125, K127, and S153 are bound directly by the
M12B9 heavy chain (Fig. 8B) (residues in boldface elicit salt bridges).
The heavy chain forms a total of 11 hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), five
salt bridges, and 99 Van der Waals (VdW) interactions. The HC-L1
interface is characterized by a buried surface area of 1,366 Å2 and a
shape complementarity (Sc) of 0.70 versus 0.65 for the 7D11 heavy
chain (44). As expected from previous Ag-Fab structures, the heavy
chain dominates Ag-MAb interactions (45).
The LC-L1 interface has a much lower buried surface area (219
Å2
), and it has an Sc value of 0.62; that of the 7D11/L1 complex is
0.26, suggesting the light chain, despite forming fewer contacts,
also interacts specifically with L1. In total, the M12B9 light chain
forms one potential salt bridge between complementarity-deter￾mining region (CDR) L3 residue D98 and L1 residue K33 and one
hydrogen bond between L1 residue Q31 and N34 of CDR L1 (Fig.
8B). In the 7D11/L1 structure, there were no interactions between
the light chain and L1 within a 4-Å distance (18).

atoms (L1, 0.53 Å; HC, 1.00 Å; LC, 1.51 Å), which correlates well
with the sequence identity, especially within the CDRs of the
heavy chain that binds L1 (Fig. 8). Despite the relatively high
structural homology of the Fab domains, Fv light chains present a
relatively low sequence identity (67.6%), consistent with the fact
that it barely participates in L1 binding. The heavy chains display
a high sequence identity even for CDRs H1 and H2 (83.2%), along
FIG 8 M12B9-MAb targets the same epitope as 7D11-MAb. (A) Superimposed structures of L1 bound to M12B9 or 7D11-Fab domains. Models were

Kaever et al.
11348 jvi.asm.org Journal of Virologywith a low RMSD (1.00 Å), with the exception of H3 residues that
are not conserved (Fig. 8). Therefore, we compared how these
subtle sequence differences affect binding to the same epitope. In
the M12B9-Fab/L1 complex, H3 elicits a few extra VdW contacts
compared to L1/7D11; while 7D11 uses H3:D102 to form an H
bond with L1 residue K33, M12B9 instead uses H3:Q101 to hy￾drogen bond to the backbone oxygen of N27 of L1 (distance [d],
3.2 Å). Also, we observed increased VdW contacts relative to CDR
H3 in our model, elicited by H3 residues 101 to 104 and L1 resi￾dues 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, and 33. This contrasts with the fewer inter￾actions found in the 7D11 complex (VdW interactions between L1
residues Q31 and T32 and H3 residues D102 and Y104).
However, the bulk of specific interactions (H bonds and salt
bridges) are formed by CDRs H1 and H2 in a manner very similar
to that reported for the 7D11 complex, while CDR H3 adopts an
orientation similar to that of 7D11 but almost exclusively contacts
L1 through nondirected VdW interactions (Fig. 8E). H1 elicits five
hydrogen bonds and 36 VdW contacts the L1 antigen, while H2
forms four hydrogen bonds, one salt bridge (E59 with L1 residue
K127), and 36 VdW contacts. A detailed Ag-Fab interface contact
comparison of M12B9/L1 and 7D11/L1 complexes is shown in
Fig. 8B to F. L1 residue D35 was suggested to be a critical residue
for viral escape (18) (Fig. 7). Both antibodies 7D11 and M12B9
interact with the D35 carboxyl group via two hydrogen bonds
(H1:W33 side chain Nε and H2:Y50 hydroxyl). Therefore, those
interactions appear to crucial for antibody binding. Interestingly,
an additional salt bridge is formed by non-CDR heavy-chain res￾idue R74 with L1 residue D62 (d, 2.80 Å), which appears not to be
formed in the 7D11 structure (Fig. 8F).
Sequence characteristics of highly potent neutralizing MAbs
targeting L1. Our group I MAbs and the previously described L1
MAb 7D11 are highly potent MV neutralization antibodies, and
they target a similar epitope. To gain some insight on antibody
sequences that determine the recognition of the epitope, the se￾quences of the three group I MAbs were determined and com￾pared to that of 7D11. The heavy chains also were compared to the
germ line IGHV1S26*01, as all four MAbs originate from this
germ line. CDR3 regions of the heavy chains are quite different,
but CDR1 and CDR2 regions of the heavy chains are highly con￾served between the four MAbs (Fig. 9A). The light-chain se￾quences of the four L1 MAbs were quite divergent (Fig. 9B). Ac￾cording to 7D11/L1 and M12B9/L1 structures, the heavy chain
dominates the binding with L1. 7D11 has 12 heavy-chain residues
contacting L1 in the crystal structure (T30, R31, W33, Y50, N52,
S54, T55, G56, Y57 T58, D102, and Y104), while M12B9 has four
additional heavy-chain residues contacting L1 in the structure
(F32, E59, Q101, and N103). Among these residues, the CDR1 and
CDR2 residues are nearly identical between the four MAbs except
for a G56D substitution for two of the MAbs (M7B6 and M2E9), a
conservative Y32F substitution for M12B9, and a conservative
Y57F substitution for M2E9. In contrast, while one of the CDR3
residues that contact L1 in the crystal structure is conserved (Y104
or W104), the rest (residues 101, 102, and 103) are not conserved
between the four MAbs, suggesting that the CDR3 residues play a

Identical amino acids are marked by a dot, green boxes are marked CDR1 through CDR3, and dashes indicate where the germ line sequence ends. Residues in

Binding of anti-L1 MAbs with L1 protein and virion. To as￾sess whether differences in binding affinity could account for dif￾ferences in neutralization among the 3 groups of anti-L1 MAbs,
we measured binding affinities of the MAbs with recombinant L1
protein by biolayer interferometry (BLI). Refolded L1(1-185) pro￾tein was immobilized on an Ni-NTA tip, and its binding to differ￾ent MAbs was monitored in real time with BLI (Fig. 10). For
M12B9 (group I) and 8C8 (group II), purified Fab fragments gen￾erated by papain digestion of IgG were used for the binding study.
The binding affinity was approximately 200-fold higher for
M12B9 (KD, 0.09 nM) than for 8C8 (KD, 17 nM), predominantly
due to the difference in off rate (Table 3). For 39D4 (group III), its
Fab fragment had a very low binding signal due to a much lower
binding affinity. Therefore, undigested 39D4 IgG was used for the
binding study, and it had a modest affinity to L1 (KD, 32 nM).
To assess the contribution of predicted epitope residues to
the binding of the antibodies, we performed similar BLI studies
with recombinant L1 proteins containing single-alanine sub￾stitution (Fig. 10). Residues N27, Q31, and D35 were chosen
for substitution based on the M12B9/L1 crystal structure. Re￾markably, D35A substitution completely disrupted binding
with M12B9, while it had no effect on binding with 8C8, illus￾trating the specific importance of D35 in binding with the
group I antibodies. N27A or Q31A, however, had no significant
effect on the binding with any of the L1 MAbs, suggesting that
those residues are not crucial binding hot spots for any of the
tested antibodies (Table 3).

11350 jvi.asm.org Journal of VirologyVACV was assessed by immunofluorescence analysis. The group I
MAb M12B9 stained viral factories (site of virion assembly) and
many virion-size particles in infected cells (Fig. 11). It also stained
purified virions, indicating that the MAb binds to native L1 and its
epitope is well exposed on the MV surface. In contrast, group II
MAb 8C8 stained viral factories but not virion-size particles in
infected cells. It also failed to stain purified virions, indicating that
while 8C8 binds to native L1, its epitope is either not exposed on
the surface of the MV or the binding affinity is very low. The
staining of infected cells by group III MAb 39D4 was barely above
the level of background staining in uninfected cells, indicating that
39D4 has a very low binding affinity to native L1. These results are
consistent with the different binding affinities of the antibodies to
the recombinant L1 proteins shown in the BLI assay.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we developed and comprehensively characterized
five anti-L1 MAbs. Group I of three MAbs (M12B9, M2E9, and
M7B6) potently neutralized VACV in a largely complement-inde￾pendent manner, while group II and III MAbs failed to neutralize
VACV in the presence or absence of complement. By using a va￾riety of techniques, the epitope of the group I MAbs was mapped
to a conformational epitope with Asp35 as the key residue. The
crystal structure of L1-M12B9 complex showed that the epitope is
surface exposed and distal to the transmembrane domain. Indeed,
M12B9 was able to bind to purified virion in an immunofluores￾cence assay. Thus, the potent neutralization by the group I MAbs
could be explained by their high-affinity binding to a critical re￾gion of L1 that is well exposed on the virion surface. The epitope of
group III MAb (39D4) was mapped by peptide ELISA to residues
123 to 132, which are largely surface exposed and adjacent to the
group I epitope in the L1 structure. The 39D4 epitope overlaps
extensively with the linear epitope (residues 118 to 128) of several
previously described, potent VACV neutralizing antibodies (19).
However, 39D4 binds to L1 with low affinity. Only the intact 39D4
IgG showed some binding to the recombinant L1 protein, while
the Fab fragment did not bind at all. 39D4 also failed to bind
significantly to the native L1 protein expressed by VACV in the
cells or displayed on virions in an immunofluorescence assay.
Therefore, we conclude that 39D4 fails to neutralize MV due to its
low affinity to L1 on the virions. We have not mapped the confor￾mational epitope recognized by the group II MAb 8C8. While 8C8
binds to recombinant L1 as well as native L1 protein expressed by
VACV, its affinity to recombinant L1 is at least 200-fold less than
that of the group I MAbs, and it does not bind to virions in an
immunofluorescence assay. Therefore, we propose that 8C8 fails
to neutralize MV mostly because its epitope is not well exposed on
the virion.
An initial goal of our study was to expand the knowledge of
immune epitopes in L1, an important neutralizing target in small￾pox vaccine. Quite unexpectedly, we found that all three of our
anti-L1 neutralizing MAbs recognized the same conformational
epitope that was known to be the target of previously described
murine anti-L1 MAbs, 2D5, 7D11, and 10F5 (17, 46). Our anti-L1
MAbs appear to have a lower virus neutralizing potency than that
reported for 7D11 (50% inhibitory concentration of 400 ng/ml
for M12B9 versus 16 ng/ml for 7D11 [19]), which could explain
why the group I MAbs appear to be less protective than 7D11 in
mouse models (47). Since antibodies targeting this common L1
epitope represent the most potent MV neutralizing antibodies
ever reported in the literature and L1 is an important component
of experimental subunit vaccines against orthopoxviruses, our
study is important in that it provides a better understanding of the
molecular basis of epitope recognition by these antibodies and
how these antibodies could be elicited through immunization.
Previously, only the 7D11 sequence had been reported, and its
molecular basis for epitope recognition had been revealed by the
crystal structure of 7D11 and L1 complex (18). In this study, we
determined the sequences of three additional antibodies targeting
this epitope and solved the structure of one of those antibodies in
complex with L1. Sequence comparison between the 4 MAbs
showed that the light chain and CDR3 of the heavy chain are quite
different, but CDR1 and CDR2 of the heavy chain are highly con￾served. The structures of 7D11/L1 and M12B9/L1 also showed
that CDR1 and CDR2 of the heavy chain are used predominantly
for binding the epitope. Together, these studies show that the
binding of this neutralizing L1 epitope requires antibodies that
have the appropriate heavy-chain CDR1 and CDR2 and can tol￾erate divergent light-chain and heavy-chain CDR3. Since heavy￾chain CDR1 and CDR2 of these anti-L1 antibodies are highly ho￾mologous to a mouse germ line gene, IGHV1S26*01, only a very
limited number (3 nonconservative substitutions) of somatic mu￾tations would be required for the germ line gene to evolve into
antibodies that recognize this L1 epitope. In contrast, the closest

Kaever et al.
11352 jvi.asm.org Journal of Virologymatching human germ line gene (IGHV1-8*02) would require 6
nonconservative substitutions. This may be one reason why L1 is
an immunodominant neutralizing antibody target in mice but a
less common target in humans (13). This also highlights the need
for caution in extrapolating results of vaccine studies in mice to
human vaccine design.
While antibodies targeting this L1 neutralizing epitope are
among the most potent MV neutralizing antibodies, they are also
vulnerable to neutralization escape due to their heavy reliance on
a single L1 residue for binding. Previously, VACV with an L1
D35N substitution was found to escape neutralization by 2D5
(17). We discovered in this study that VACV with either L1 D35N
or D35Y substitution completely escaped the neutralization by
three anti-L1 neutralizing MAbs. While M12B9 binds with L1
protein with very high affinity, a single D35A substitution in L1
was able to completely abolish the binding. These results demon￾strate that while D35 side chain is not critical for L1 function
during viral replication, it is essential for the binding of a group of
potent neutralizing antibodies. While alkylating agents were used
to induce the escape mutants in previous and current studies,
similar mutants may emerge naturally and be selected by neutral￾izing antibody response. L1 D35N substitution resulted from a
transition mutation of guanine to adenine, which is the type of
mutation that is expected to be caused by alkylating agents. In
contrast, L1 D35Y substitution resulted from a guanine-to-thy￾mine mutation, which is unlikely to be caused by alkylating agents
and may have emerged spontaneously. Even more interestingly,
although L1 orthologs in different orthopoxviruses have almost
identical sequences, all ectromelia virus strains have Asn instead of
Asp at residue 35 of the L1 orthologs. This explains why passive
administration of M12B9 failed to protect mice from ectromelia
virus challenge. As discussed above, it may be relatively easy to
elicit in mice neutralizing antibodies targeting the L1 epitope with
D35. Since mouse is the natural host for ectromelia virus, it is
tempting to speculate that the D35N substitution in the L1 or￾tholog is an adaptation for ectromelia virus to escape this partic￾ular neutralizing antibody response.
At least 8 MV proteins (D8, H3, A26, A27, A13, L1, A28, and
A17) are known to be the targets of neutralizing antibodies. How￾ever, for practical and technical reasons, vaccine formulation can
only include a few selected immunogens. Therefore, it is impor￾tant to know whether all MV targets are equally valuable or if some
are much more important than others as targets for protective
immunity. Anti-L1 MAbs are known to be very potent neutraliz￾ing antibodies, but they have rarely been compared directly with
MAbs against other MV targets for their neutralization potency.
We have recently developed a large panel of MAbs against VACV,
including MV neutralizing antibodies targeting H3, D8, A13, and
A27 (12, 22). This allows us to directly compare anti-L1 and many
other anti-MV antibodies in terms of their neutralization potency.
We find that the anti-L1 MAbs are distinct from other MV neu￾tralizing antibodies in that they can completely neutralize MV
independent of complement. In contrast, MAbs against H3, D8,
A13, and A27 can achieve a high level of neutralization only if the
antibodies are of the complement-fixing isotypes and comple￾ment is present in the experiment. This is despite the fact that
there are more binding sites available on the surface of MV for
these antibodies than for anti-L1 antibodies, as D8, H3, A13, and
A27 are major MV proteins and are present on the MV at a molar
ratio of at least 10:1 with respect to the L1 protein (48). The re￾quirement of complement does not appear to be an unusual re￾quirement for antibodies targeting a particular epitope, as multi￾ple anti-D8 MAbs targeting four different epitopes all require
complement for potent MV neutralization (data not shown). The
reason for this difference in complement requirement may be that
anti-L1 antibodies use a different mechanism than other antibod￾ies in neutralizing MV. L1 plays an essential role in viral entry, so
antibodies binding to a critical functional region of L1 should be
sufficient to prevent viral entry. In contrast, A13 plays no direct
role in viral entry, while D8 (49), H3 (50), and A27 (51) play a
redundant role in viral attachment to cell surface receptors; thus,
the occupation of all functional sites of these proteins by antibod￾ies is not sufficient to prevent viral attachment or entry. Antibod￾ies against these major MV proteins may have to rely on the bind￾ing of the complement to increase their footprints on the viral
surface, so there will be sufficient steric hindrance to block the
functions of other envelope proteins that are essential for viral
binding or entry. The entry of VACV into cells requires virus￾encoded multiprotein entry-fusion complex (EFC), which con￾sists of at least 11 proteins (52). It is possible that antibodies
against EFC members L1 or A28 could neutralize MV directly in a
complement-independent manner, while antibodies against non￾EFC membrane proteins (D8, H3, A13, A17, A26, and A27) neu￾tralize MV by a different, complement-enhanced mechanism.
