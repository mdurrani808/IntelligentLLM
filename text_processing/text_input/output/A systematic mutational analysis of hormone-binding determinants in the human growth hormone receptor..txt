ABSTRACT A mutational strategy is presented that al￾lowed us to identify hormone-binding determinants in the
extracellular portion of the human growth hormone receptor
(hGHbp), a 238-residue protein with sequence homology to a
number of cytokine receptors. By systematically replacing side
chains with alanine we probed the importance of charged
residues (49 total, typically located on the surface), aromatic
residues (9 total), and neighbors of these (26 total). The alanine
substitutions that were most disruptive to hormone binding are
located predominantly in four segments of a cysteine-rich
domain in the hGHbp, and collectively they form a patch when
mapped upon a structural model proposed for cytokine recep￾tors. Control experiments with monoclonal antibodies con￾firmed that most of these alanine substitutions do not disrupt
the overall antigenic structure of the hGHbp. This high￾resolution functional analysis will complement structural stud￾ies and provides a powerful basis for evaluating and engineer￾ing the energetics of hormone-receptor interactions. More￾over, the hormone-binding determinants identified here may
be similarly located in other, homologous, receptors.
Human growth hormone (hGH) is homologous to a large
family of hormones that includes prolactins, placental lacto￾gens, and proliferins (for review see ref. 1). Collectively,
these hormones regulate a vast array of physiological effects,
including growth, lactation, differentiation, and electrolyte
balance (for reviews see refs. 2 and 3). These biological
effects begin with the binding of hormone to specific cellular
receptors. Systematic mutational studies have revealed func￾tionally important residues in hGH for binding to the hGH
receptor (4-6). In contrast, virtually nothing is known of the
hormone-binding determinants in the hGH receptor.
The hGH receptor cloned from liver (7) consists of a single
polypeptide chain (620 residues total) containing an extra￾cellular hormone-binding segment (246 residues), a single
transmembrane region (23 residues), and a cytoplasmic seg￾ment (351 residues). The extracellular portion of the hGH
receptor is found naturally in the blood stream (8) as an
hGH-binding protein (hGHbp). Recent comparative se￾quence analyses suggest that the hGHbp is structurally
related to a large family of cytokine receptors (9-11).
The hGHbp (containing residues 1-238) has been ex￾pressed in Escherichia coli in large quantities (12), and it
retains the same high affinity for hGH as its natural glyco￾sylated counterpart. Here, using a combination of mutational
and biophysical analysis, we have identified important hor￾mone-binding determinants in the hGHbp. These determi￾nants are chemically complementary to those previously
identified in hGH, and they map predominantly to a cysteine￾rich region of the receptor and to loop regions on one side of
a structural model proposed for cytokine receptors (10). This
mutational strategy should be applicable to probing other
hormone-receptor and protein-protein interactions for
which little or no structural information is available.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Restriction enzymes, DNA polymerase I large fragment, T7
DNA polymerase, T4 DNA polymerase, and polynucleotide
kinase were from New England Biolabs, Bethesda Research
Laboratories, or United States Biochemical. Genentech pro￾vided hGH, synthetic oligonucleotides, and monoclonal an￾tibodies (mAbs), except mAbs 5 and 265, which were pur￾chased from Agen Biomedical (Parsippany, NJ).
The plasmid phGHbp(1-238) (ref. 12), coding for residues
1-238 of the wild-type hGHbp sequence (7), contains the fl
origin to allow preparation of single-stranded DNA for mu￾tagenesis (13) and sequencing (14). Mutants of the hGHbp
were expressed in E. coli and purified as described for the
wild-type hGHbp (12). Briefly, cultures of E. coli KS330 (15)
carrying plasmid phGHbp(1-238) secreted properly folded
and processed hGHbp into the periplasm. Periplasmic pro￾teins were released from the cells by a freeze-thaw and
extraction into hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris HCI, pH 7.5)
containing 2 mM EDTA and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride to inhibit metallo- and serine proteases, respectively.
The hGHbp was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (45%
saturation), resuspended in the same buffer, and clarified by
centrifugation. At this point the affinity of each hGHbp
mutant for hGH was determined. Controls show that con￾taminating proteins from E. coli do not interfere with the hGH
binding assay (5). Mutant binding proteins with decreased
binding affinity to hGH were purified to homogeneity as
previously described (12) except for W104A, which was
purified by Q-Sepharose chromatography (Pharmacia) fol￾lowed by a mono-Q column (Pharmacia).
Purified binding proteins were dialyzed against 10 mM
Tris HCI, pH 7.5/100 mM NaCI for circular dichroic spectra.
Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance
spectrum using A`1t° = 2.35 for hGHbp (12) and AO-'% = 2.11
for W104A and W104F. Spectra were obtained on an Aviv
Associates (Lakewood, NJ) Cary 60 spectropolarimeter in
the near-UV (320-250 nm) at a 0.5-nm interval and in the
far-UV (250-190 nm) at a 0.2-nm interval. All spectra were
averaged over 5 scans with a 2-sec averaging time for each
datum.
Binding constants were determined from competitive dis￾placement assays using 125I-labeled hGH as a tracer (16). An

protein hormone complex after equilibration overnight at
250C (12). Under these conditions hGH and the hGHbp form
a one-to-one complex.
RESULTS
Binding of Natural Variants of the hGHbp to hGH. North￾ern analysis and cDNA cloning from human hepatocytes
producing the hGH receptor revealed a messenger RNA that
is lacking the exon 3 sequence encoding residues 7-28 (ref.
18; W. Wood, personal communication). We constructed a
binding protein missing residues 7-28. This protein has the
same affinity for 125I-labeled hGH as does full-length hGHbp
(Table 1), suggesting these amino-terminal residues are not
essential for hGH binding.
Goossens and coworkers (19) sequenced the coding region
of the hGH receptor from one family with Laron-type dwarf￾ism and found a single phenylalanine-to-serine substitution at
position 96 (F96S) in the extracellular domain of the hGH
receptor. They postulated this mutation resulted in produc￾tion of a receptor defective for hGH binding. We produced
the F96S mutant hGHbp in E. coli and found it to have a Kd
for hGH that was identical to that of the wild-type hGHbp
(ref. 20; Table 1), suggesting that this defect does not affect
hGH binding directly.
Scanning-Mutational Analysis of Charge Clusters. To de￾termine if charged residues of the hGHbp are involved in
hGH binding, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace
systematically all arginine, lysine, aspartic, and glutamic
residues with alanine. We substituted charged side chains
with alanine because in the absence of other structural
information we anticipated charged residues to be exposed to
solvent and the alanine substitutions to cause minimal per￾turbation in the folding of the protein. Alanine, the most
common amino acid (21), is small and is found in both buried
and exposed positions in proteins (for reviews see refs. 22 and
23).
The charged residues were mutated in clusters of 2-5
residues to maximize the efficiency of our analysis. Fourteen
clustered charge-to-alanine mutants were prepared that col￾lectively mutated all of the charged residues (except Lys-110)
from position 31 to 217 in the hGHbp (Table 1). Eight of these
multiple mutants expressed sufficient quantities in E. coli to
be analyzed, and two of them (RRE 70-75 and KDKEE
203-209) showed reductions in binding affinity to hGH of
about 6-fold.
We next dissected the six nonexpressing and two disrup￾tive binding variants by producing single-alanine mutants (30
total) in these segments (Table 1). Ofthese mutants, only one
(D85A) could not be expressed in quantities that allowed
analysis. Nine of the single-alanine mutants, E42A, E44A,
R70A, R71A, E82A, D126A, E127A, D132A, and K215A,
caused reductions in binding affinity to hGH of 2- to 8-fold.
The disruptive effects in the RRE 70-75 mutant can be
accounted for by R70A and R71A. In contrast, dissection of
the pentamutant KDKEE 203-209 did not single out a single
residue prominent in disrupting binding, although slight ef￾fects were observed for K203A and K206A. We interpret
these data to mean that side chains in this charged segment
are not substantially involved in binding to hGH.
Alanine-Scanning of Tryptophans and Tyrosines in the Cys￾teine-Rich Domain. Fluorescence experiments show that
binding of hGH to the hGHbp causes changes in the tryp￾tophan fluorescence spectra of the hGHbp (M.G.M., unpub￾lished results). The charged-to-alanine-scan data indicate
that the strongest binding interactions with hGH are located
in the cysteine-rich region of the hGHbp (Fig. 1). Of the four
tryptophan residues in this region (Trp-50, Trp-76, Trp-80,
and Trp-104), only the WSOA mutant could not be expressed

Residue
In contrast, we could not detect any binding to the W104A
mutant (reduced more than 2500-fold) and a more conserva￾tive variant (W104F) was reduced in binding by 110-fold.
These reductions in binding affinity for mutating Trp-104 are
by far the largest in the entire set.
Such a large change in binding could be a result of
structural change in hGHbp. To assess the structural effects
of these mutants we determined the circular dichroic (CD)
spectra for the mutants W104A and W104F and wild-type
hGHbp (Fig. 2). Both the near- and the far-UV CD spectra are
similar for each of these proteins. A comparison of the
near-UV CD spectra of the wild type with the spectra of both
mutants indicates that the substitution of the tryptophan
results in virtually no change except for an expected decrease
in the intensity of the tryptophan spectrum. The far-UV CD
shows some alterations in intensity but the overall shape
appears to be the same for each of the proteins, indicating
they are not grossly misfolded.
lodination of the hGHbp disrupts binding to hGH (J.A.W.,
unpublished results). We therefore mutated the four ty￾rosines to alanine in the cysteine-rich domain including
Tyr-68, Tyr-86, Tyr-95, and Tyr-107. However, only Y95A
could be expressed in amounts sufficient for analysis, and it
yielded a dissociation constant essentially the same as that of
the wild-type hGHbp (Table 1). Although Tyr-95 does not
appear to be involved in binding to hGH, we do not know
about the importance of the others.
Alanine-Scanning of Residues Flanking Disruptive Charged
and Tryptophan Residues. Protein-protein interfaces often
contain several binding segments each contributing more
than one side-chain determinant of hydrophobic or hydro￾philic character (for reviews see refs. 24 and 25). Thus, we
replaced with alanine the neutral and hydrophobic residues
that closely flank those charged and tryptophan residues
found to be most disruptive to binding (Table 1). Within the
first disulfide loop no additional residues were identified
beyond Glu-42 and Glu-44 that disrupted binding; however,
we were unable to express S40A, T45A, and F46A in quan￾tities suitable for analysis. In the region around Arg-70 and
Trp-76, no other disruptive alanine mutants were identified.
However, we identified four mutants, N72A, T73A, Q74A,

data in Table 1. Sites of alanine substi￾tutions causing effects ranging from a

and Q78A, that slightly increased affinity for hGH. The
region flanking Trp-104 contained four other residues, Thr￾101, Ser-102, Ile-103, and Pro-106, where alanine substitu￾tions caused a loss in binding affinity of 2- to 85-fold, and one
(S99A) that slightly increased affinity, about 2-fold. Finally,
the region from Asp-126 to Asp-132 contained two additional
disruptive alanine mutants, V125A and I128A.
Binding of mAbs to Mutants of hGHbp. To evaluate the
structural integrity of hGHbp mutants that were reduced in
affinity for hGH, we analyzed their binding properties with a
panel of six different anti-hGHbp mAbs, whose affinities
ranged from about 0.5 to 6 nM (Table 2). These mAbs were
prepared by immunizing with the natural rabbit or rat, growth
hormone receptors (mAb 5, ref. 26; and mAb 263, ref. 17), or

An ELISA format was used in which microtiter plates were coated with mAb, then incubated with 3-fold serial dilutions
ofthe purified hGHbp mutant. The extent of binding was quantified by incubating with purified rabbit polyclonal anti-hGHbp
antibody, then a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Results are mean ± SEM.
with the native hGHbp expressed and purified from E. coli
(mAbs 3B7, 3D9, 12B8, and 13E1).
Most of the hGHbp mutants reacted with all of the mAbs
as well as the wild-type hGHbp (Table 2). However, the
TlOlA variant was reduced in binding by >200- and 45-fold
to mAbs 3B7 and 3D9, respectively, and by about 2-fold with
three out of the remaining four mAbs. Similarly, the binding
affinity of the P106A mutant to the same five mAbs is lowered
by 2- to 5-fold. It is unlikely that all of these effects are
mediated by direct effects that the TiOlA and P106A muta￾tions have on the antibody binding epitopes. Typically, direct
effects show up as a highly selective disruption pattern (4, 5).
For example, the E82A variant is reduced in binding affinity
to mAb 263 by 9-fold, yet it is virtually unchanged in binding
to the other five mAbs. Of the mAbs tested 13E1 and 12B8
completely block binding of hGH to the hGHbp. The fact that
most of the alanine mutants that disrupt receptor binding do
not disrupt binding of the mAbs that block hGH binding is
consistent with these being overlapping but nonidentical, as
was typically seen for hGH (4, 5).
DISCUSSION
We have presented a scheme to systematically identify
hormone-binding determinants where little structural infor￾mation was available. This analysis has identified four seg￾ments located in the cysteine-rich domain of the hGHbp that
are important to binding of hGH (Fig. 1). In order of decreas￾ing importance to binding these segments include residues
Thr-101 to Pro-106 >> Val-125 to Asp-132 > Arg-70 to
Glu-82 Glu-42 to Glu-44. The segments Thr-101 to Pro-106
and Val-125 to Asp-132 should be in close proximity because
they are bridged by the Cys-108 Cys-122 disulfide.
Recent sequence analyses suggest that the extracellular
binding domains of the growth hormone and prolactin recep￾tors are structurally homologous to a large number of cytok￾ine and other receptors including the interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3,
IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, erythropoietin, and granulocyte-macroph￾age colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors (refs.
9-11 and references therein). Bazan (10) predicted that the
extracellular portions of these receptors contain two immu￾noglobin-like domains, each consisting of seven P-strands
and connecting loops. When the alanine mutants that cause
a 2-fold or greater effect upon binding to hGH are placed upon
the topographic map predicted for the cysteine-rich domain
of the hGHbp (Fig. 3) they form a patch in the four loops at
one end of the model. By comparison, residues altered away
from these putative loop regions have virtually no effect upon
binding.
Our data do not support the hormone-binding site that was
predicted (10) to span the G-,8 strand of the N-terminal
domain (residues 119-125) and the D-,3 strand in the C-ter￾minal domain (residues 184-195). Moreover, the CD spectra
(Fig. 2) do not substantiate the extensive (3-sheet structure
predicted for the hGHbp. The far-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 2A)
is similar to the spectrum of the kringle of tissue plasminogen
activator (27), which is composed mainly of turns or loops
that are held together by disulfide crosslinks. The CD spec￾trum of the hGHbp is different from that of the T-cell
receptor, CD4 (28), which has a (-sandwich type fold exhib￾iting -50%,p-sheet structure overall (29, 30). However, we
note that p-sheet content is more difficult to quantify accu￾rately than a-helix by CD measurements and that the aro￾P - Q~P7

FIG. 3. Location of residues in the hGHbp causing a 2-fold or
greater effect upon binding to hGH mapped upon an immunoglob￾ulin-like folding diagram predicted for the cysteine-rich domain (10).
Seven antiparallel 13-strands (A-G) compose a ,3-sandwich by folding
the G strand around the back until it hydrogen bonds to the A strand.
Residues causing less than a 2-fold reduction (0), a 2- to 4-fold
reduction (0), a 4- to 10-fold reduction (0), a 10- to 100-fold
reduction (0), and >100-fold reduction (*) in binding are indicated.
Those residues that gave low expression yields are indicated by C).

matic residues and disulfides can contribute substantially to
the far-UV CD spectrum. Thus, our data are consistent with
the positioning of the loops in the structure predicted for
cytokine receptors (10) but cannot confirm the degree of
,a-sheet structure predicted.
Several lines of evidence suggest that the changes in
binding affinity for the hGHbp mutants are not a result of the
proteins being grossly misfolded. First, these proteins can be
expressed at levels comparable to wild-type hGHbp. Poor
expression can be correlated with an unstable or misfolded
protein (31). Second, mAb binding to most of the mutant
proteins parallels the binding found for wild-type hGHbp. We
do not know that the mAbs raised to native hGHbp react only
with the native hGHbp, because denatured or reduced
hGHbp aggregates in solution (data not shown). However,
structural analyses of antibody-antigen complexes (for re￾view see ref. 32) and epitope mapping of hGH (4) and CD4
(29, 30) show that virtually all of these epitopes are highly
discontinuous. Third, the CD spectra in both the near- and
far-UV of the W104A and the W104F mutant are similar to the
spectrum of wild-type hGH (Fig. 2). The fact that the W104F
mutation is reduced in affinity by 100-fold, whereas the
W104A mutant is reduced >2500-fold, demonstrates the keen
requirement for a large hydrophobic side chain at position 104
for tight binding to hGH. Although we do not believe the
mutations cause enormous changes in the folding of the
mutant proteins, it is possible that for some of these mutants
(perhaps T1OlA or P106A) the reduction in binding affinity
results from indirect structural effects as opposed to making
direct side-chain contacts with hGH. It is notable that neither
of these later mutants cause substantial changes in the CD
spectra (data not shown), suggesting the CD in this case is
less sensitive than the mAb binding analysis.
The combined mutational analyses of hGH (5) and the
hGHbp show there is a great deal of functional complemen￾tarity at the interface. Of the 10 charged-to-alanine substitu￾tions in the hGHbp causing a 2-fold or greater reduction in
hormone binding affinity, 7 are acidic residues; any one of the
top 5 of these (E42A, E44A, E82A, D126A, and D132A) is
more disruptive than any of the three disruptive basic resi￾dues (R70A, R71A, and K215A). By comparison, alanine￾scanning mutagenesis of hGH has revealed that 3 of the top
5 disruptive binding mutants are basic residues (R64A,
K172A, R178A) and none are acidic residues. Thus, there is
electrostatic complementarity between an electropositive
binding epitope on hGH and an electronegative epitope on
the hGHbp. Moreover, both epitopes contain important
hydrophobic determinants as well.
The distribution of strong and weak binding determinants
is not identical between the epitope on hGH as compared to
the hGHbp. For example, of the 17 disruptive alanine mu￾tants in the hGHbp, 10 cause 2- to 4-fold reductions in
binding, 5 cause 4- to 10-fold reductions, 1 residue causes a
10- to 100-fold disruption, and 1 causes greater than 1000-fold
reduction in affinity for hGH. By comparison, of the 20
disruptive alanine mutants in hGH, 8 cause 2- to 4-fold
reductions, 7 cause 4- to 10-fold reductions, 5 cause 10- to
100-fold reductions, and none cause over 100-fold reduction
in binding to the hGHbp (5, 6). These data suggest that there
is not a simple one-to-one side-chain to side-chain interaction
between hGH and the hGHbp.
In conclusion, the mutational analyses provide a functional
map of side chains in the hGHbp important for binding of
hGH. We cannot be sure that additional side-chain binding
determinants are present because not all residues were
tested. A high-resolution structure of the hormone-receptor
complex will be necessary to determine if these residues
modulate binding by direct or indirect effects and to define
main-chain interactions. The functional data provided here,
when combined with high-resolution structural information,
should provide a solid basis from which one may begin to
rationally design small-molecule mimics of hGH.
