The mechanisms of inhibition of two novel scFv antibody inhibitors of the
serine protease MT-SP1/matriptase reveal the basis of their potency and
specificity. Kinetic experiments characterize the inhibitors as extremely
potent inhibitors with KI values in the low picomolar range that compete
with substrate binding in the S1 site. Alanine scanning of the loops
surrounding the protease active site provides a rationale for inhibitor
specificity. Each antibody binds to a number of residues flanking the active
site, forming a unique three-dimensional binding epitope. Interestingly, one
inhibitor binds in the active site cleft in a substrate-like manner, can be
processed by MT-SP1 at low pH, and is a standard mechanism inhibitor of
the protease. The mechanisms of inhibition provide a rationale for the
effectiveness of these inhibitors, and suggest that the development of
specific antibody-based inhibitors against individual members of closely
related enzyme families is feasible, and an effective way to develop tools to
tease apart complex biological processes.

Introduction
Of the 22 families of naturally occurring, protein￾based protease inhibitors known to inhibit the
S1 clan of serine proteases, 18 use an identical
mechanism of inhibition.1 Standard mechanism
(also known as canonical, or Laskowski mechan￾ism) inhibitors all insert a reactive loop into the
active site of the protease, which binds in an ex￾tended β-sheet in a substrate-like manner.2 While
some of these inhibitors have developed secondary
mechanisms,3 the primary mechanism of inhibition
is extremely well conserved; so much so that
crystal structures of unrelated inhibitors overlay
perfectly in the protease active site.4 As evidenced
by this remarkable example of convergent evolu￾tion, the standard mechanism is an efficient, robust
way to inhibit serine proteases. However, this
robustness often comes at the expense of specifi￾city. With the exception of a small number of
parasitic anti-thrombin inhibitors that also bind
to protease exosites,5 the majority of standard
mechanism protease inhibitors have a relatively
broad specificity. For example, bovine pancreatic
trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) inhibits efficiently almost
all trypsin-fold serine proteases with P1-Arg
specificity, but can inhibit chymotrypsin (P1-Phe
specificity) with a KI of 10 nM.6
Much effort has been expended on the develop￾ment of specific protease inhibitors for use both as
biological tools and as potential therapeutic agents.
As attempts to make specific small molecules have
beset by difficulties,7 researchers have often at￾tempted to gain specificity using peptide or protein￾based scaffolds. Constrained peptide phage display
libraries have yielded extremely potent exosite
inhibitors of factor VIIa,8,9 and standard mechanism
inhibitors of chymotrypsin,10 and urokinase-type
plasminogen activator (uPA),11 with moderate
potency and specificity. An alternate approach has

protease inhibitors.12–14 For example, maturation of
Alzheimer's amyloid β-protein precursor inhibitor
Kunitz domain, a canonical serine protease inhibitor,
via competitive phage display improved its specifi￾city for factor VIIa by increasing its KI against a panel
of some related serine proteases by two to five orders
of magnitude.13 A third approach has been to mature
specific protease inhibitors on other natural protein
scaffolds, such as ankyrin repeats or antibodies.15
Until now, the characterized protease antibody
inhibitors have been monoclonal antibodies raised
from hybridomas, and have tended towards two
types of inhibitors; those that interfere with multi￾merization (and thus activation) of the protease,16–18
and those that bind to loops and protein–protein
interaction sites19–22 and occlude substrate binding,
instead of interfering with the catalytic machinery of
the enzyme, and ensuring complete inhibition.23
Earlier, we reported the development of single￾chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody inhibitors
of the serine protease membrane-type serine pro￾tease 1 (MT-SP1).24 MT-SP1 (also called matriptase)
was discovered and cloned in a search for serine
proteases expressed in the PC-3 prostate cancer cell
line,25 and was determined independently to be a
highly expressed protease in breast cancer tissue.26
Work by a number of groups has since shown that
MT-SP1 may be a key upstream factor involved in
the ECM remodeling, and in signal transduction
cascades involved in cell transformation.27 Abla￾tion of MT-SP1 activity has been shown to decrease
the invasiveness of both ovarian and prostate
tumor cells, and modest orthotopic over-expression
of MT-SP1 in mouse epidermal tissue led to
spontaneous squamous cell carcinomas,28 further
cementing the role of MT-SP1s in cancer, and sug￾gesting the enzyme is causally involved in malignant
transformation.
Here, we have characterized the mechanism of
inhibition of the two most potent scFv inhibitors of
MT-SP1, E2 and S4. The inhibitors were selected
from a fully synthetic human combinatorial anti￾body library in the scFv format (HuCAL, Mor￾phoSys AG). HuCAL-scFv contains consensus
frameworks with diversified light and heavy chain
CDR3 regions reflecting the natural human amino
acid composition.29 A combination of mutagenesis
experiments, steady-state kinetics, and stopped￾flow kinetics reveal that, while the inhibitors gain
specificity by making a number of critical interac￾tions with surface loops on the protease, they can be
standard mechanism inhibitors, which insert a re￾active loop in a substrate like manner into the active
site of the protease. This work suggests that an
antibody scaffold can be used to create extremely
specific standard mechanism protease inhibitors.
Furthermore, the design of inhibitors that utilize
macromolecular recognition factors (variable loops,
protein–protein interaction sites) can help to differ￾entiate highly homologous proteases, and can thus
impart specificity upon the inhibitors.
Results
Earlier, we described the maturation and initial
characterization of a number of scFv inhibitors of
MT-SP1.24 The scFvs bound tightly to the catalytic
domain of MT-SP1, and showed a high degree of
specificity, as they showed no appreciable inhibi￾tion of a panel of closely related serine proteases,
including factor Xa, thrombin, kallikrein, tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA), and uPA at inhibitor
concentrations of 1 μM. Here, we characterize the
mechanism of inhibition of E2 and S4, the two most
potent members of this novel class of serine protease
inhibitors.
Steady-state kinetics
Previous experiments showed that E2 and S4 had
KD values of 160 pM and 500 pM (as determined by
surface plasmon resonance), and were potent
inhibitors of MT-SP1. In the current study, a number
of steady-state kinetic experiments were performed
in an attempt to understand the mechanism of
inhibition of these inhibitors. The results of these
experiments are summarized in Table 1. Double
reciprocal plots revealed that both E2 and S4 are
competitive inhibitors of MT-SP1 with respect to
Spectrazyme-tPA, a small molecule para-nitroanilide
(pNA) substrate of P1 arginine serine proteases. To
further characterize the tight-binding nature of these
inhibitors, accurate KI values were determined; E2
and S4 are extremely tight-binding competitive
inhibitors of MT-SP1, with KI values of 8.0( ± 1.3)
pM and 140( ± 6.0) pM, respectively.
To verify that the mode of inhibition is similar in
the context of a macromolecular substrate, a discon￾tinuous assay was developed to measure the activa￾tion of uPA. The KM of uPA as a substrate for MT-SP1
was determined to be 1.7( ± 0.2) μM, and the kcat of
MT-SP1 activation of sc-uPA was 0.89( ± 0.09) s−1
.
Double reciprocal plots showed that the inhibitors
were indeed competitive with respect to macromo￾Table 1. Kinetic parameters of scFv inhibitors

values of 12 pM for E2 and 160 pM for S4 could be
extrapolated (Table 1). Since the substrate (uPA)
concentration could not be increased above KM, the
errors associated with KI values are large; none￾theless, they confirm that the inhibitors inhibit
MT-SP1 equally well, regardless of the size of the
protease substrate.
Pre-steady-state kinetics
A closer examination of the progress curves of
the steady-state reactions when enzyme was added
to a mixture of substrate and inhibitor revealed
different binding mechanisms for E2 and S4 (Figure
1). The progress curves for S4 are linear, suggesting
the binding of scFv to enzyme comes to equili￾brium rapidly. Conversely, the progress curves for
E2 inhibition are curved, suggesting slow binding
inhibition.30 To define the binding mechanisms of
these scFvs, stopped-flow experiments were per￾formed to evaluate the onset of inhibition during
turnover at higher concentrations of enzyme.
Stopped-flow experiments measured the appearance
of pNA, and were carried out as described in
Materials and Methods.
The stopped-flow traces from the S4 inhibitor
experiments were fit by nonlinear regression to the
rate equations for reversible, tight-binding inhibi￾tion to obtain observed rate constants (kobs) for the
onset of inhibition (equation (5)).31 Plots of kobs
versus [S4] are linear with positive y-intercepts
(Figure 2(a)), consistent with a one-step reversible
mechanism for binding the inhibitor. The y-inter￾cepts of the plots give an average off-rate of k−1=
1.7 × 10−2 s

, and a secondary plot of the slopes
versus substrate concentration (Figure 2(a), inset)
defined the on rate as k1= 1.2 × 108 M−1
s
−1
. The KI
calculated from k−1/k1= 147 pM, which is in very
good agreement with the experimentally deter￾mined steady-state KI of 140 pM. From these data,
it can be concluded that S4 binds and inhibits MT￾SP1 with an extremely fast on-rate, and has a one￾step binding mechanism as shown in Scheme 1.
The stopped-flow traces from the E2 inhibitor
experiments (Figure 2(b)) revealed a more com￾plicated binding mechanism. In this case, the prog￾ress curves fit well to a sum of two exponentials
(equation (7)), indicating the presence of at least two
steps in the binding process, which leads to the onset
of inhibition. At minimum, a double-exponential
decay is consistent with a two-step binding mechan￾ism. This occurs when the first step in the binding
process is more rapid than the second and, as
a result, the first observed rate constant (kobs1)
shows a linear dependence on the concentration of
inhibitor.32 If kobs1 shows a hyperbolic dependence
on inhibitor concentration, the mechanism of inhibi￾tion involves more than two steps. Unfortunately,
due to the extremely tight nature of the enzyme–
inhibitor interaction, the concentration of inhibitor
could not be increased sufficiently to distinguish
between a linear or hyperbolic dependence of kobs1
on the concentration of inhibitor. But, due to the
presence of two exponential decays, an absolute
minimal mechanism of E2 inhibition has two steps,
and E2 can be classified as a slow, tight-binding
inhibitor.30
p-Aminobenzamidine competition assay
p-Aminobenzamidine (pAB) has been reported as
a weak competitive inhibitor of P1-arginine-specific
serine proteases,33 and can be used as a fluorescent
probe to monitor substrate or inhibitor binding in
the S1 site. The hydrophobic nature of the S1 site
causes pAB to fluoresce with a maximum emission
around 360 nm when bound to the enzyme, while
pAB in aqueous solution has both a lower intensity
and longer wavelength of emission at 376 nm. pAB
has been used as a probe to monitor binding of
inhibitors in the S1 site of inhibitors; competitive
inhibitors displace pAB from the protease active site
and reduce emission at 360 nm,33,34 while non￾competitive inhibitors do not.35 pAB has a KI of
28.8 μM for MT-SP1 (data not shown), and 1 μM MT￾SP1 incubated with 270 μM PAB (to saturate the
enzyme) shows a characteristic emission peak at
361 nm when excited at 325 nm (Figure 3). When one
equivalent of either E2 or S4 is added to the pre￾Figure 1. Progress curves of MT-SP1 inhibition by scFv
inhibitors reveal multiple mechanisms of inhibition. The
addition of 0.2 nM enzyme to a mixture of substrate
(300 μM Spec-tPA) and inhibitor results in a decrease in
proteolytic activity. S4 inhibition results in a linear
progress curve, suggesting rapid-equilibrium inhibition,
while the curved nature of the E2 progress curve suggests
slow-binding inhibition.
Scheme 1.
Antibody Inhibitors of a Protease 1043incubated MT-SP1/pAB, the fluorescence is
decreased sharply (Figure 3). This suggests that
both inhibitors bind at or near the S1 site, and most
likely insert an arginine or lysine side-chain into the
pocket.
MT-SP1/inhibitor digest
The reactive site of many standard mechanism
serine protease inhibitors has been determined by
incubating protease and inhibitor at low pH, where
the inhibitor can be cleaved in a substrate-like
manner, causing a processing of the inhibitor into
two fragments, with the cleavage occurring between
the P1 and P1′ residues.36,37 When MT-SP1 and E2
are incubated at pH 6.0 for an extended period of
time (>120 h), E2 is processed into two bands
(Figure 4). This processing is not seen at pH 8.0, or
without MT-SP1 at pH 6.0. MT-SP1 shows no pro￾teolytic activity below pH 6.0, making this the
lowest pH at which processing can occur. Electron
spray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry verifies
that the processing event takes place between R131
and R132 in E2. The N-terminal fragment has a
mass of 12,013 Da (expected 12,014 Da) and the
C-terminal fragment has a mass of 15,624 Da
(expected 15,627 Da). This places the reactive loop
in the CDR3 of the heavy chain of E2, which would
be expected from the HuCAL library from which
these scFvs were matured, as the scaffold has large,
diverse CDR3s.29 No S4 processing was observed
upon incubation with MT-SP1 for extended periods
of time at low pH, suggesting a different, non￾canonical mechanism of inhibition for the S4 scFv.
Figure 2. Stopped-flow experi￾ments confirm disparate mechan￾isms of inhibitor binding to MT￾SP1. (a) Linear plots of kobs versus S4

one-step binding mechanism, as

1044 Antibody Inhibitors of a ProteaseInhibitor point mutants
To verify the mechanism of inhibition of the scFv
inhibitors, point mutants of the arginine residues in
the CDR3 loops of the inhibitors were constructed. It
would be expected that mutations to residues that
bind in the S1 site of the protease would have the
greatest effect on binding affinity. The mutational
data are summarized in Table 2. E2 R131A and
R132A had KI values of 78 nM and 454 pM,
respectively (KI= 12.3 pM for the wild-type E2). The
mutation of R131 to alanine has a 6500-fold effect on
protease inhibition, as would be expected from a
residue that binds in the S1 site. This is consistent
with the data from the inhibitor digest at low pH.
The mutation of R132 caused a 38-fold increase in KI,
suggesting that the P1′ arginine also makes signifi￾cant contacts with the protease. The CDR3 loop of S4
also has a double arginine motif, R128 and R129.
Both arginine residues were mutated to alanine and
had significant effects on protease inhibition: S4
R128A had a KI of 2.8 μM, while the R129 alanine
mutant had a KI of 3.9 nM, a 4 × 104
-fold and a 56-fold
difference, respectively.
MT-SP1 point mutations
To footprint the binding site of the inhibitors, site￾directed mutagenesis was used to alanine scan the
surface of the protease domain.38 On the basis of the
crystal structure of MT-SP1,39 30 point mutants
were identified as potential partners in macromo￾lecular interactions (Table 3). The majority of these
residues were located on the loops flanking the
protease active site. Proteolytic activity against
Spec-tPA was used to assure that the point muta￾tions did not drastically affect MT-SP1 structure or
function. The differences between the mutant and
wild-type protease kcat/KM values were less than
twofold in most cases, suggesting that the muta￾tions had minimal effect on protease structure. MT￾SP1 T98A was a sixfold less efficient enzyme than
the wild-type, which could be attributed primarily
to a lower kcat. MT-SP1 D217A had a threefold
decrease in protease specific activity, which was
due to an increased KM of 210 μM. The F99A,
Q192A, and W215A substitutions in MT-SP1 all
resulted in inactive enzymes. The inactive variants
eluted from a gel-filtration column at the same size
as the zymogen protease, suggesting they are
inactive because they could not autoactivate (data
not shown).
The KI values for E2 and S4 were determined
against the MT-SP1 point mutants. As a positive
control, the fold-specific serine protease inhibitor
Figure 3. Inhibitors displace pAB from the MT-SP1
active site. pAB (270 μM) incubated with 1 μM MT-SP1
emits a strong emission peak with a maximum at 361 nm
when excited at 325 nm, due to hydrophobic interactions
between pAB and the P1 pocket of the protease. When one
equivalent of either S4 (blue trace) or E2 (green trace) is
added to 1 μM MT-SP1 saturated with pAB, the fluo￾rescence decreases, suggesting pAB is released into the
aqueous environment, where it is weakly fluorescent.
Therefore, binding of both S4 and E2 are competitive with
pAB binding, and both inhibitors bind in or near the P1
pocket in a manner that precludes binding of pAB.
Figure 4. E2 is processed by MT-SP1 at pH 6.0. E2
(2 mM) was incubated at pH 6.0 with (lane 3) and without
(lane 1) 0.1 μM MT-SP1 for 120 h. Samples were run on a
12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomas￾sie brilliant blue. At pH 6.0, E2 was processed into two
products, with molecular masses determined to be 15,624
Da, and 12,013 Da by ESI mass spectrometry. These
masses, when added together, account for the mass of the
full-length inhibitor (27,219 Da) and the water molecule
added to the products during the hydrolysis reaction. This
processing does not take place when E2 and MT-SP1 are
incubated at pH 8.0 (lane2). The diagram below shows the
site of the scissile bond in the middle of the heavy chain of
E2.

Antibody Inhibitors of a Protease 1045BPTI was screened against the protease point mu￾tants, since the mechanism of inhibition is known40
and a the structure of a co-crystal of BPTI and MT￾SP1 has been solved.39 As would be expected from a
fold-specific protease inhibitor, most point mutants
had little effect on BPTI inhibition. The I41A
substitution moderately improved BPTI binding to
MT-SP1, F94A, F97A, and E169A moderately
decreased BPTI inhibition (corresponding to < 1
kcal/mol binding energy), and D60bA and D217A
mutations had a more significant affect on BPTI
inhibition (Figure 5(b)). Analysis of the crystal
structure suggests that the increased KI of MT-SP1
D60bA could be due to D60b hydrogen bonding
with R20 of BPTI, and forming an intramolecular
H-bond with R60c, which packs against BPTI. A
deletion of the H-bonding ability of this side chain
would account for the moderate increase (12.6-fold)
in KI. The structure does not readily explain the
43-fold increase in the KI of BPTI for MT-SP1 D217A,
but it is possible that the mutation affects the struc￾ture of the 220s loop, which would account also for
the increased KM of Spec-tPA for D217A.
The alanine scanning data suggests S4 makes
contacts of moderate strength with a number of
residues on the six surface loops surrounding the
active site (Figure 5(a) and (d)). Interactions with the
side-chains of I41, D60b, T98, and Q175 account for
modest binding energy (pink residues, Figure 5(d));
alanine mutations of these residues increased the KI
values of S4 3–6 fold, corresponding to a decrease in
free energy of binding of 0.5–1 kcal/mol. S4 makes
stronger interactions with the side-chains of F94,
D96, H143, Y146, and D217 (red residues, Figure
5(d)), decreasing the free energy of binding by 1.5–
2.0 kcal/mol. Interestingly, a mutation of R60c to
alanine decreased the KI of S4 6-fold. This suggests
that the protease/scFv interaction has not been
optimized completely. Taken together, the muta￾tional data suggest that S4 makes a number of
moderate contacts with the loops flanking the active
site, making the strongest interactions with the 140s
and 90s loops, and thereby bridging the active site.
E2 makes interactions with a number of loops
surrounding the MT-SP1 active site (Figure 5(c)),
including the base of the 60s loop, the 90s loop, the
170s loop, the 220s loop, and the 140s loop. In
contrast to S4, which makes a number of interactions
of moderate strength, E2 gains much of its binding
energy from interactions with two residues, D96 and
F97. Mutations of each of these residues to alanine
increased the KI of E2 to > 1 μM, corresponding to a
decrease in free energy of binding of > 7.5 kcal/mol.
The Q175A variant, on the loop adjacent to the 90s
loop, also has a significant effect on E2 inhibition,
increasing the KI of E2 by 69-fold (3.0 kcal/mol). The
90s loop and 170s loop flank the extended binding
sites of MT-SP1,39,41 and F97 helps form the S4
pocket, suggesting E2 binds in the extended binding
pockets of MT-SP1. Though E2 makes minor
interactions with Y146, Q221a, and K224, the
majority of the binding energy of E2 for MT-SP1
comes from interactions with the 90s loop, and
minor interactions with residues flanking the 90s

1046 Antibody Inhibitors of a Proteaseloop (I60, Q175). This defines the 90s loop as a hot￾spot for E2 binding; and as the 90s loop sequence is
unique to MT-SP1, it helps explain E2s specificity for
MT-SP1.
Discussion
We have described the mechanism by which two
novel scFv antibodies inhibit the cancer-associated
serine protease MT-SP1/matriptase. The S4 antibody
has a fast association rate with MT-SP1 (1.2 × 108
M−1
s
−1 as measured by stopped-flow kinetics) and
binds very tightly to the protease, making numerous
contacts with the loops surrounding the active site of
MT-SP1. The fast on-rate is likely influenced by
electrostatic steering, which can increase kon by
more than 104 over the basal diffusion-controlled
association rate.42 Mutational data support this
hypothesis, as nearly all the residues S4 makes
significant contacts with are polar or charged. The
inhibitor competes with pAB for the S1 site, and the
R128A variant of S4 nearly abolishes protease
inhibition. Despite these data, S4 cannot be consi￾dered a standard mechanism inhibitor of MT-SP1
without further structural characterization. Stan￾dard mechanism inhibitors have a characteristic
two-step binding mechanism; an initial binding
step, followed by a tightening of the enzyme–
inhibitor complex and, as such, have an association
rate approximately two orders of magnitude slower
than S4. Furthermore, S4 is not processed by MT-SP1
at low pH, meaning the substrate-like binding
cannot be assumed.
E2, on the other hand, displays all the character￾istics of a standard mechanism serine protease
inhibitor. While a crystal structure would help to
determine the mechanism of inhibition definitively,
the data here are consistent with E2 being a
standard-mechanism inhibitor. The enzyme–inhibi￾tor complex reaches equilibrium slowly, E2 binds in
a substrate-like manner, and inserts an arginine
residue into the S1 site of MT-SP1 (R131), which is
important for, but not absolutely critical to, inhibi￾tion. Furthermore, E2 shows a slight degree of fold
specificity; it inhibits the mouse homolog of MT-SP1,
epithin, with a KI of 40 nM,24 and can inhibit trypsin,
a digestive protease with extremely broad specifi￾Figure 5. MT-SP1 alanine point mutants and their effect on protease inhibition by (b) BPTI, (c) E2, and (d) S4. (a) The 6

MT-SP1 point mutants have a minimal effect on BPTI inhibition, S4 interacts with moderate affinity to all six protease
loops surrounding the active site, and E2 binds with high affinity to the 90s and 170s loop. This Figure was prepared using
PyMoL [http://www.pymol.sourceforge.net/].
Antibody Inhibitors of a Protease 1047city, with an IC50 of 45 μM (data not shown). In
contrast to most standard mechanism serine pro￾tease inhibitors, E2 is highly specific for a single
serine protease, MT-SP1. E2 gains much of its
specificity through interactions with the 90s loop
of MT-SP1, and makes significant interactions with
residues D96 and F97 of the protease. Perhaps not
surprisingly, known protease inhibitors that do
exhibit a high degree of specificity, such as antic￾oagulant protease inhibitors from ticks and leeches,
often employ a similar mechanism of inhibition;
they combine the robustness of competitive, active
site inhibition with protein extensions that bind to
recognition sites on target enzymes.5,43
To our knowledge, these scFvs are the first docu￾mented case of mechanistic protease inhibitors on
an antibody scaffold that bind in the active site. A
number of monoclonal antibody protease inhibitors
have been reported17–19,21,22,44 but, despite diverse
mechanisms, all have the same underlying mode of
action; they bind to a small, linear peptide sequence
and prevent either a protein–protein or an enzyme–
substrate interaction. While often sufficient for
inhibition, these monoclonal antibodies can have
curious inhibitory profiles in which they cannot
inhibit the hydrolysis of small-molecule substrates,
or have different levels of inhibition against different
substrates.19,21 Because they are selected in vitro
against the active form of the enzyme, antibodies
developed by phage display have the inherent
advantage of recognizing three-dimensional epi￾topes and the topography of the enzyme active site.
With this comes the opportunity for tighter binding
due to greater buried surface areas and minimal
entropic penalties upon binding, and more complete
inhibition through insertion of residues into the
protease active site. E2 and S4 have clearly used
these advantages; they have fast on-rates, very low
KD values, bind in the active site groove, and make
contact with a number of loops flanking the active
site.
The HuCAL-scFv library contains consensus
framework sequences for all frequently occurring
VH and VL subfamilies with a germline sequence for
the CDR1 and CDR2 in each subfamily.29 Both the
heavy and light chain CDR3 regions were diversi￾fied according to the natural amino acid composi￾tion and cover the natural length variation of the VH
and VL CDR3 regions. In retrospect, this proves to
be an ideal scaffold for serine protease inhibition; it
allows for a large, rigidified reactive loop to be
inserted into the protease active site, while the rest of
the antibody stabilizes the CDR3 of the heavy chain
and makes additional contacts with the protease.
While only the most potent scFv inhibitors of MT￾SP1 were characterized, all inhibitors had heavy
chain CDR3 loops of at least 17 residues, suggesting
that large heavy chain CDR3s were critical to MT￾SP1 inhibition.
The explosion in antibody research over the past 15
years has revolutionized biotechnology. Antibodies
have been developed into extremely useful drugs
and imaging devices, and have become critical tools
in many areas of biological research. Here, scFv
fragments have shown the ability to inhibit speci￾fically a single member of a family of closely related
enzymes. While these molecules will be useful in
helping dissect the complex biology of MT-SP1,45
the mechanisms through which they work once
again reveals the innate binding flexibility of anti￾bodies, and the power of protein engineering. That
these inhibitors have developed the robust inhibi￾tion mechanism of standard mechanism serine
protease inhibitors, suggests that we can develop
antibodies to mimic any protein–protein inter￾action, and precisely modulate nearly any biological
process.
Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification, and mutagenesis
MT-SP1 and MT-SP1 mutants were expressed in
Escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies as
described.25 Antibodies were selected from the HuCAL
scFv library (MorphoSys AG, Martinsried, Germany).29
Expression and purification of inhibitory scFv antibodies
were as described.24 Point mutants were made using the
Stratagene Quickchange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). One
or two base changes were sufficient to create the point
mutant in each case, and all sequences were verified by
DNA sequencing.
Steady-state kinetics
All reaction volumes were 120 μl and were carried out
in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.8), 50 mM NaCl, 0.01% (v/v)
Tween-20 unless stated otherwise and all reactions were
carried out in triplicate. Reactions were run in 96-well,
medium-binding, flat-bottomed plates (Corning), and
cleavage of substrate was measured with a UVmax
Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Palo
Alto, CA.). MT-SP1 and mutant protease concentrations
were determined by 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidino￾benzoate active-site titration with a Fluormax-2 spectro￾fluorimeter.46 Kinetic parameters of MT-SP1 and mutant
proteases were determined at 0.2 nM enzyme, with
concentrations of Spectrazyme-tPA (hexahydrotyrosyl￾Gly-Arg-pNA, American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT)
varying from 1 μM to 400 μM. KM and kcat were
determined using the Michaelis–Menten equation.
Tight-binding inhibitors require that the effective
decrease in free enzyme be taken into account when
determining KI values.31 This is accomplished by incubat￾ing enzyme and inhibitor so that the system can reach
equilibrium, adding substrate, and then measuring
steady-state velocities at various concentrations of inhi￾bitor and fitting the data to:
vi=vs¼ ½ET  IT  KI* þ ½ðIT þ KI*  ETÞ
2 þ ð4KI*ETÞ1=2
2ET
( )
ð1Þ
KI* values are then plotted against substrate concentra￾tion to extrapolate the KI at zero substrate concentration:
KI* ¼ KIð1 þ ½S=KmÞ ð2Þ
1048 Antibody Inhibitors of a Protease      When measuring the effect mutations had on the
strength of the interaction between the protease and in￾hibitor, IC50 values were used instead of KI as determined
above. Though less accurate than KI,
47 IC50 is easier to
calculate when screening large numbers of inhibitor point
mutants, and is sufficient to monitor relative changes in
inhibition versus the wild-type system. IC50 was deter￾mined by incubating inhibitor and 0.2 nM enzyme for at
least 5 h at room temperature to assure steady-state
behavior of the system.3 There was no appreciable
decrease in protease activity during the incubation period.
Steady-state velocities were then plotted against inhibitor
concentration and fit to:
v ¼ vmin þ ðvmax  vminÞ
ð1 þ 10ð½IIC50Þ
Þ ð3Þ
Relative KI was calculated from IC50 values according
to:
KI ¼ IC50
ð1 þ ½S=KMÞ ð4Þ
Though nearly all protease mutants had a minimal (less
than twofold) effect on substrate KM, and the substrate
concentration was held well above the KM, this correction
normalizes the IC50 with respect to the strength of the
protease/substrate interaction. All graphs and equations
were fit using Kaliedagraph 3.6 (Synergy Software, Read￾ing, PA).
Macromolecular substrate assay
In an assay analogous to that used to monitor factor
VIIa activation of FX,8 we developed a coupled assay
that monitors MT-SP1 activation of uPA in which 50 pM
MT-SP1 was incubated with various concentrations (final
concentrations, 12.5–400 nM) of single-chain uPA (Amer￾ican Diagnostica). At various time-points (0–150 min),
aliquots of the reaction were removed and quenched with
10 nM E2. There was no residual MT-SP1 activity after
the quench, and E2 showed no inhibition of uPA at a
concentration of 10 nM. The amount of active uPA was
measured by monitoring the activity for uPA against the
para-nitroanilide uPA substrate Spectrazyme-UK (Amer￾ican Diagnostica). The mode of inhibition was determined
from double reciprocal plots, and kinetic parameters and
inhibition constants were determined using the Michaelis–
Menten equation. The KM of Spec-UK for uPA was
determined to be 42 μM, and the kcat of uPA turnover
was 1.0 s−1
.
Stopped-flow kinetics
Stopped-flow experiments were conducted using a
HiTech SF-61DX2 instrument (TgK Scientific Ltd., Brad￾ford on Avon, U.K.). Data were collected in dual beam
mode using photomultiplier detection of absorbance data
at 405 nm. MT-SP1 (10 nM for E2 experiments, 1 nM for S4
experiments) was mixed rapidly with a solution of
substrate (Spec-tPA, 200–800 μM) and inhibitor (10–
300 nM for S4, 100–340 nM for E2) and the appearance
of pNA was monitored for 20 s (for S4) or 150 s (for E2).
Concentrations of enzyme and length of experiments were
varied between the two systems to ensure robust signal
and equilibration of the system.
The stopped-flow traces from the S4 inhibitor experi￾ments were fit by nonlinear regression to the rate
equations for reversible, tight binding inhibition:31
P ¼ vst þ ðvi  vsÞð1  ekobs t
Þ=kobs ð5Þ
The appearance of the product (P) is a function of the
initial (vi) and final (vs) velocities, and an apparent first￾order rate constant, kobs for the onset of inhibition. Plots of
kobs versus inhibitor concentration were linear, and fit to
equation (6), as would be expected when the inhibitory
mechanism consists of one reversible binding step, as in
Scheme 1:
kobs ¼ k1 þ k1½I=ð1 þ ½S=KMÞ ð6Þ
E2 stopped-flow traces fit poorly to equation (5),
but fit well to a mechanism with two observed rate
constants:32
P ¼ vst þ ðvi  vsÞð1  ekobs1t
Þ=kobs1
þ ðvi  vsÞð1  ekobs2t
Þ=kobs2
ð7Þ
p-Aminobenzamidine fluorescence
Experiments were carried out in PBS with a Fluorolog 3
(Instruments SA Inc. Edison, NJ) fluorimeter. Emission
spectra of MT-SP1/pAB were obtained by excitation at
325 nm using a 4 nm excitation and 2 nm emission
bandpass, and were scanned from 335–430 nm. Spectra
were corrected for emission due to free pAB and protease.
Data corrections were performed with Datamax 2.20
software (Instruments SA).
Inhibitor digest
E2 (2 μM) or S4 (2 μM) was incubated with 0.1 nM
MT-SP1 for 120 h at room temperature. Proteins were
incubated in 100 mM Mes (pH 6.0), 100 mM NaCl or in
50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl. Proteolysis
was monitored by gel mobility-shift on a 12% (w/v)
polyacrylamide gel with a 4.5% stacking gel, and
stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. ESI mass spectro￾metry was carried out with an LCT Premier mass spec￾trometer (Waters Corp. Milford, MA), and molecular
masses were determined using MassLynx (Waters) decon￾volution software.
