ABSTRACT: Alanine scanning mutagenesis of tissue factor, the initiating receptor and cofactor molecule for 
the coagulation pathways, was used to define residue side chains with functional contributions. Approximately 
half of the residues were exchanged, and several stretches of functional residues throughout the entire 
extracellular domain were identified which contributed to overall coagulant function. Mutants were further 
characterized with respect to their affinity for binding of ligand, providing evidence that identified functional 
sequence spans are involved in ligand interaction. The tissue factor extracellular domain is suggested to 
adopt the folding pattern of the cytokine receptor homology unit, which is typically composed of two 
seven-@-strand modules. Evaluation of the mutational analysis within this structural context suggests that 
functionally important residues are spatially proximate and clustered at the boundary of the predicted 
@-strand modules. Residues contributing to ligand binding by tissue factor were identified in positions 
corresponding to ligand interactive residues in the growth hormone receptor and contact residues of other 
cytokine receptors, consistent with a conserved structural region for ligand interaction throughout the 
cytokine receptor family. 
Cellular initiation of the coagulation pathways in vivo is 
mediated by the cell surface receptor tissue factor (TF)' (Davie 
etal., 1991;Edgingtonet al., 1991). TFservesasthereceptor 
for coagulation factor VIIa (VIIa) and the zymogen precursor 
factor VI1 (VII) which is rapidly activated in the TFeVII 
complex by selected proteases, including factors Xa or IXa 
and the TFmVIIa complex (Rao & Rapaport, 1988; Nakagaki 
et al., 1991). TF is a macromolecular catalytic cofactor for 
VIIa by changing the catalytic efficiency of the bound protease, 
as evaluated with small peptide analogue pseudosubstrates 
(Ruf et al., 1991c; Lawson et al., 1992). Independent of the 
enhancement of catalytic function determined with small 
peptidyl substrates, TF supports the cleavage of protein 
substrates, and this function has been assigned to specific 
residues in the sequence 156-174 by scanning alanine 
mutagenesis (Ruf et al., 1992a,b). The residues in TF which 
mediate the assembly of the TFaVIIa complex have not been 
identified. However, antibody mapping (Ruf et al., 1991b; 
Ruf & Edgington, 1991a), chemical cross-linking of receptor 
and ligand (Ruf & Edgington, 1991b), functional charac￾terization of proteolytic fragments (O'Brien et al., 1993), and 
structurally disruptive mutational analysis (Rehemtulla et 
al., 1991) suggest that there is not a single linear sequence 
span that mediates the interaction with the ligand protease 
VIIa and that residues distributed through the extracellular 
domain of TF contribute to ligand binding. In this study, we 
provide a mutational mapping to search for functional residues 
of TF. On the basis of Ala exchange mutagenesis, we propose 
an overall topographical assignment of functional and non￾functional regions in TF. We further identify residues which 
are required for binding of VIIa providing an initial localization

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
Mutagenesis and Expression of TF. Mutants of TF were 
generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the 
TF coding sequence cloned into the expression vector CDM8 
as the template DNA, as previously described in detail (Ruf 
et al., 1993). For functional analysis, the mutants were 
expressed by transiently transfecting Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells with the expression plasmid. Transfected cells 
were harvested 48 h after transfection and stored in appropriate 
aliquots at -70 OC for functional analysis and immunoassay. 
For circular dichroism (CD) and 'H nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the mutants and wild-type 
TF were expressed as soluble truncation mutants (residues 
1-21 8) in Saccharomyces cereuisiae. The coding sequence 
for residues 1-218 was recovered from the mammalian cell 
expression plasmid employing the polymerase chain reaction, 
and the same step was used to change the triplet encoding 
residue 219 to a termination codon. The amplified product 
was subcloned into the StuI site of the Escherichia colils. 
cerevisiae shuttle vector pMFa8 (Miyajima et al., 1985) by 
in vivo recombination (Jones & Howard, 1991). Yeast strain 
GRY697 (MATa, trpl-1 A, ura3-52) was transformed with 
the expression plasmid, and transformed cells were selected 
on Trp deficient culture plates. TF was purified from the 
yeast culture broth by immunoaffinity chromatography (Ruf 
et al., 1991c) followed by ion exchange chromatography on 
MonoQ (Ruf et al., 1992~). 
Immunoassay. The concentration of mutant or control wild￾type TF in the transfected CHO cells was determined by 
immunoassay, as described in detail (Ruf et al., 1992a, 1993). 
Briefly, a defined aliquot of pelleted cells was lysed in 6 mM 
CHAPS (3- [ (3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]- 1 -pro￾panesulfonate), and the cell lysate was serially diluted for 
0 1994 American Chemical Society 1566 Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 6, 1994 
immunoassay based on two monoclonal antibodies to non￾overlapping epitopes. Typically two or three of the serial 
dilutions gave concordant results in TF concentration, and 
the mean of these data points derived from the linear part of 
the calibration range was calculated. Assays were repeated 
at least three times for each mutant, and the presented data 
are mean values calculated from determinations on different 
occasions. In cases where specific antibody epitopes were 
affected by the Ala exchange (see below), the immunoassay 
was based on different pairs of monoclonal antibodies which 
did not reveal decreased binding of the respective mutant. 
Evaluation of Overall Function by Coagulation Assay. 
Mutants were analyzed for function by a one-stage coagulation 
assay. Assay procedure and precision for the coagulation 
assay have been described in detail (Ruf et al., 1992a). Briefly, 
an aliquot of pelleted cells was lysed with 15 mM octyl 6-D￾glucopyranoside in 10 mM Hepes, 140 mM NaC1, pH 7.4, 
byvigorousvortexing for 1 min followed by a 15-min incubation 
at 37 OC. Serial dilutions were analyzed and coagulant activity 
was derived from double logarithmic calibration curves of 
clotting times versus serial dilutions of wild-type TF. Typ￾ically, two dilutions from the linear portion of the calibration 
range were used to calculate the coagulant activity, and assays 
were repeated on three separate occasions. Coagulant activity 
was normalized on the basis of the antigen concentration to 
yield the specific activities for mutant and wild-type TF. Loss 
of specific activity was calculated relative to wild-type TF 
which was transfected and analyzed in parallel. The data 
represented are based on the mean values from the replicate 
determinations. 
Determination of ko,,. To analyze the importance of 
specific residues for binding of VIIa, a linked chromogenic 
assay with purified recombinant VIIa (Novo Nordisk) and 
factor X which was purified as previously described (Ruf et 
al., 1991c) was used. Wild-type or mutant TF (1-6 pM) 
from octyl glucopyranoside cell lysate prepared as described 
above was assembled with recombinant VIIa (0.5 pM to 15 
nM) at 5 mM Ca2+ for 10 min at 37 "C. In preliminary 
experiments, maximum functional activity of the TF-VIIa 
complex was obtained within 3 min, suggesting that equi￾librium within the 10-min preincubation was approximated. 
Formed TFSVIIa complexes were quantified with substrate 
factor X added at 100 nM for a fixed time at 37 OC, followed 
by quenching of the reaction with 50 mM EDTA (Ruf et al., 
1992a,b). The rate of chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme 
FXa hydrolysis by the formed factor Xa was determined in 
a 96-well multichannel ELISA reader in the kinetic mode at 
ambient temperature (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). 
The rate of substrate hydrolysis was converted to formed 
TFeVIIa complexes using the hydrolysis rate at saturation 
and the concentration of TF determined by immunoassay. 
Enzfitter (Elsevier Biosoft) programs were employed to 
calculate the KD~~~ from the experimentally determined bound 
VIIa and free VIIa, which was obtained by subtracting bound 
VIIa from the initial VIIa concentration. The calculated KD~~~ 
values for mutant TFs represent the mean values from at least 
three independent determinations with coefficients of variation 
<25%. The Kppp was not influenced by increasing or 
decreasing the time period for the activation of factor X by 
2-fold, suggesting that the equilibrium of the TF-VIIa complex 
does not change slowly following the addition of substrate. 
Further, increasing or decreasing the factor X concentration 
4-fold did not result in detectable changes of the KDapp, 
indicating that substrate was not limiting and that the substrate 
factor X does not influence the functional KD~~~ determination 
Ruf et al. 
under these assay conditions, consistent with other studies 
(Krishnaswamy, 1992). 
Western-Blot Analysis and Assessment of Antibody Re￾activity. Mutant and wild-type proteins expressed in mam￾malian cells were assessed for post-translational modification 
and intracellular degradation by Western-blot analysis of cell 
lysate. Typically, a pellet of 1 X lo6 CHO cells was 
resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and separated by poly￾acrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic 
transfer to nitrocellulose. A polyclonal antibody to human 
TF was used to provide immunochemical detection of intact 
as well as degraded TF in the cell lysateusing standard alkaline 
phosphatase technology, as previously described (Ruf et al., 
1991b). For specific mutants (see Results), this analysis 
revealed evidence for increased intracellular degradation and 
for changes in the glycosylation pattern relative to wild-type 
TF. This has previously been observed upon structurally 
disruptive mutations in TF (Rehemtulla et al., 1991), and 
these criteria have been adopted here as indications of 
misfolded mutant protein. As additional screening for global 
conformational alteration, the reactivity of mutants with 
monoclonal antibodies was analyzed by inhibition of function. 
Briefly, mutant or wild-type TF in an octyl glucopyranoside 
cell lysate were incubated for 30 min with each of the previously 
characterized inhibitory and conformation-dependent mono￾clonal antibodies (30 pg/mL) to three nonoverlapping 
epitopes on TF (Ruf et al., 1991b), followed by quantitation 
of residual coagulant activity in comparison to a noninhibited 
sample. Reduction in antibody inhibition by 10% compared 
to wild-type TF was considered evidence for loss of structure 
necessary for antibody reactivity. 
Structural Analysis of TF Mutants. The indirect ap￾proaches employed to evaluate potential structural alterations 
were complemented by direct physicochemical analysis of 
selected dysfunctional mutants in the amino-terminal and 
carboxyl-terminal halves of the TF extracellular domain. The 
isolated extracellular domains of wild-type and mutant TFs 
were analyzed by CD and 600-MHz 'H-NMR spectroscopy. 
CD spectra were generated on an Aviv 61DS spectropola￾rimeter at a protein concentration of =20 pM in 50 mM NaCl, 
2.5 mM phosphate, 50 pM EDTA, pH 7.0. 'H-NMR spectra 
were recorded on a Bruker AMX600 spectrometer with 
samples (50-200 pM) in DzO, 50 mM NaCI, 2.5 mM 
phosphate, 50 pM EDTA, pH 7.0. The residual H20 
resonance was suppressed by preirradiation. 
RESULTS 
Mapping of Regions Critical for TF Function. We used 
scanning Ala mutagenesis to identify residue side chains which 
are important for function of TF. We randomly chose residues 
for exchange throughout the TF extracellular domain se￾quence, but we excluded the 24 Gly, Pro, and Cys residues 
from the analysis presented here, because of the frequently 
observed importance of Gly and Pro residues for the peptide 
backbone conformation and resulting structural alterations 
upon Ala replacement. From the remaining 188 non-Ala 
residues of the TF extracellular domain, we exchanged 104 
with Ala, including 12 of the 24 aromatic residues and 40 of 
the 54 charged residues, Initially, multiple substitutions were 
employed to expedite the search. These were followed in 
regions yielding significant loss of function by single Ala 
substitutions.

function. The functional activity was normalized on the basis 
of the mutant concentration established by immunoassay. The 
loss in specific functional activity relative to wild-type TF 
which was transfected and analyzed in parallel is illustrated 
in Figure 1. For comparison, Figure 1 also shows the results 
from the scanning Ala mutagenesis of the 156-174 region 
(hatched bars), which has previously been analyzed in detail 
and shown to specifically support the activation of macro￾molecular substrate (Ruf et al. 1992a,b). Besides this 
prominent region of functionally important residues, loss of 
function appeared to be associated with mutations of various 
residues in thesequences 16-26,103-106,129-147, and 197- 
201. A 30-98% loss of specific function was observed for the 
Ala mutants replacing residues Ser16, Thr17, Phelg, Lys20, Ile22, 
and Gl~~~/Glu~~. Approximately 50% lossof function followed 
the replacement of Tyrlo3/Leulo4, Glu105, or Thrlo6. Reduc￾tions of 30-50% in function were observed upon exchange of 
Arg131, Arg135, Arg136, Thr139/Ser142, Phe140, Asp145, Val146, 
or Phe147. Replacement of Val198, or Arg200/Lys201 
reduced function 30-80%. 
Other mutants which lost overall function appeared to be 
not embedded in a longer linear stretch of functionally 
important residues. In particular, a triple mutant incorpo￾rating the Ser39, Thr40, and Ser42 exchange to Ala exhibited 
a 43% loss of function, and a double mutant replacing Thr53 
and Th+ lost function by 40%, suggesting that at least one 
of the replaced residues in each mutant contributed to function. 
Single-residue exchanges of Val6' and Tyr7I decreased function 
by 53% and 98%, respectively. The mutational analysis thus 
identified clusters in which more than 50% of the residues 
were required for function as well as functionally important 
residues which appear to be isolated in the context of linear 
sequence. Mutational exchange of the other residues shown 
in Figure 1 failed to diminish function by more than 25%. The 
negative results are also considered relevant, since some of 
the regions, e.g., residue sequence 1 16-1 21, were systematically 
mutated and none of the mutants showed loss of function. 
Structural Integrity of Dysfunctional Mutants. In order 
to investigate whether reductions in function resulted from 
global structural alterations, the structural integrity of mutants 
was assessed. For all mutants the indirect criteria of efficient 
cellular expression as well as glycosylation by the mammalian 
cells in a pattern typical for the control wild-type TF were 
adopted as evidence for the highly discriminating cellular 
recognition and processing of a properly folded protein. The 
severely dysfunctional mutant Phe19 + Ala (Figure 1) was 
expressed at low levels and, on the basis of Western-blot 
analysis of cell lysate, exhibited significant fragmentation, 
suggesting structural alterations leading to increased intra￾cellular degradation. TheTyr71 +Ala mutant was also poorly 
expressed, but appeared to be properly glycosylated without 
evidence of significant intracellular degradation, implying that 
the global folding of this mutant was unaltered. All other 
mutants were expressed at levels and with apparent glyco￾sylation patterns comparable to those of control wild-type 
TF. Reactivity of the mutants with characterized inhibitory 
monoclonal antibodies to three nonoverlapping and confor￾mation-dependent epitopes in both structural modules was 
analyzed as additional evidence for properly folded mutant 
protein. These monoclonal antibodies to both structural 
modules were reactive with all mutants except for those where 
sequence spans were mutated which have previously been 
assigned to the antibody epitope (Ruf et al., 1991b). On the 
basis of these independent criteria, all but the PheIg mutant 
adopted proper global folding. The diminished function can 
therefore be attributed either to subtle local conformational 
alterations in an interactive site or to the removal of amino 
acid side chains directly contributing to function. 1568 Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 6, 1994

FIGURE 2: Circular dichroism spectra (panel A) and aromatic regions of the 600-MHz 'H-NMRspectra (panel B) of selected TF mutants. 
The isolated and soluble TF extracellular domains (residues 1-21 8) 
of wild-type and mutant TF were expressed in yeast for structural 
analysis. Spectra were obtained in 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM phosphate, 
50 HM EDTA, pH 7.0 buffer, either in H2O for circular dichroism 
or in D20 for NMR analysis. 
Structural integrity of selected dysfunctional mutants was 
further directly evaluated by CD and 'H-NMR spectroscopy. 
We chose to analyze mutants with multiple amino acid 
substitutions and hence a greater (>97%) loss of specific 
function in order to increase the probability for identification 
of structural alterations. We analyzed the Ser17 + Ala/ 
Thr18 + Ala/Lys20 + Ala and the Arg135 + Ala/Phe147 + 
Ala mutants as prototypes for the functionally relevant regions 
16-26 and 129-147, respectively. The CD spectra (Figure 
2A) of these mutants exhibited typical 233-nm maxima as 
found in wild-type TF, although the intensity of the signal for 
the mutant Arg135 + Ala/Phe14' - Ala was somewhat 
decreased, presumably due to the removal of the aromatic 
side chain in this mutant. We further employed the extreme 
sensitivity of NMR chemical shifts (Osapay & Case, 1991) 
as an additional and reliable probe of structural alterations. 
The 'H-NMR spectra of the multiple mutants all exhibited 
features typical of wild-type TF (aromatic regions shown in 
Figure 2B). In particular, well-resolved peaks in the 6.9-6.5 
ppm region, presumably shifted upfield by ring currents in 
the hydrophobic core, are unchanged in all mutants. Slight 
spectral changes in the 6.7-7.2 ppm region may be attributed 
to removal of aromatic residue side chains or possibly local 
conformational alterations, but these spectra are inconsistent 
with a mutant protein with significantly altered overall 
structure. These analyses are thus consistent with the indirect 
criteria used to assess the conformational integrity of the 
mutants. 
Importance of TF Residues for Binding of VIIa. In order 
to assess the effect of the mutations on binding of ligand VIIa, 
we determined an apparent dissociation constant (KD~~~) in 
a functional assay applicable to the necessity for replicate 
analyses of the large number of generated mutants. We 
established assay conditions to generate a reproducible estimate 
for a functional KD~~~. Considering the large differences in 
reported KD values for VIIa binding to TF and the recently 
reported tight binding with a KD of 7 pM (Waxman et al., 
1992), we evaluated the possibility that some of the higher KD 
values reported in the literature represent upper limits due to 
a high receptor concentration in the assay. The functional 
KD~~~ was observed to progressively decrease when the TF 
concentration in the assay was reduced. At 1-6 pM TF, a 
KD~~~ for wild-type TF of 4.1 f 1.0 pM (mean f standard 
deviation, n = 16) was determined, and no further decrease 
was observed when the TF concentration was lowered to 0.5 
pM. The KD~~~ determined by the functional assay is thus 
consistent with the lower limit described under equilibrium 
conditions (Waxman et al., 1992). Further, there is no 
evidence for an influence of substrate factor X on the KD~~~ 
determination, as demonstrated by the analysis of mutants in 
the 156-174 region. If the KD~~~ would depend on factor X 
hydrolysis, one would expect changes in the KD~~~ of mutants 
which are defective in providing full support for activation of 
macromolecular substrate, as in the case of the TyrlS7 + Ala 
and Ly~*~~+Ala/Lys~~~+Ala mutants. However, theKDapp 
determined for these mutants here was found to be indistin￾guishable from that of wild-type TF (Figure 3). This is 
consistent with extensive previous analysis indicating normal 
binding of VIIa to these mutants (Ruf et al. 1992a,b) and 
argues that the KD~~~ assay is not dependent on the macro￾molecular substrate used to quantify the formed TFeVIIa 
complexes under the conditions employed here. 
Theanalyses of the site-directed mutants identified residues 
which were important for binding of VIIa. Several key residues 
were clustered in the 16-26 sequence. The Lys20+Ala, Ile22 
- Ala, or the G~u~~ + Ala/Glu26 + Ala mutants exhibited 
35, 12-, or 3.8-fold increases in the KD~~~ compared to wild￾type TF (Figure 3). The Asp5* + Ala exchange increased 
the KD~~~ 41-fold. Although the single Tyr71 +Ala exchange 
could not be adequately evaluated due to low expression levels, 
the KD~~~ was increased 2.1-fold for the VaF4 - Ala/Tyr71 
- Ala double mutant. A 2.2-fold increase in KD~~~ was 
observed for the Glu91 - Ala/Gl~~~ - Ala mutant. Arg135 
or Phe140 substitutions by Ala increased the KDapp 7.4- and 
18-fold, respectively, whereas the Arg196 replacement resulted 
in a 3.1-fold-increased KD~~~. All other mutants shown in 
Figure 3 had <2-fold changes in the KD~~~ compared to wild￾type TF. Some of the subtle increases in KD~~~ are nevertheless 
considered significant. In particular, the Leu133 +Ala/Va1134 
- Ala and the GlulZ8 + Ala/Glu130 - Ala double mutants 
are localized within the functionally important region 129- 
147 and demonstrated a 1.9- or 1.7-fold-increased KD~~~, 
respectively. In summary, analyses of the apparent dissoci￾ation constants identified key residues throughout the TF 
extracellular domain sequence which contribute to the binding 
of VIIa. 
Residues which contribute to coagulant as well as VIIa 
binding function appear to be colocalized, in particular in the 
sequences 16-26 and 129-1 47. However, single residues with 
significant contributions to binding of VIIa frequently ex- Ligand Recognition by Tissue Factor

FIGURE 3: Functional KD~~~ for site-directed Ala mutants in TF. Mutants in the sequence 10-109 (panel A) and 110-210 (panel B) are identified by the replaced residue in single letter amino acid code. Linked bars indicate multiple Ala substitutions in a single mutant. The 
change in apparent KD (ratio of KD mutant to KD wild-type) is shown. Data presented are mean values from at least three determinations 
at different occasions with coefficients of variation <25%. 
hibited only minor decreases of overall coagulant function. A 
rationalization for this observation may be provided by the 
fact that the VII/VIIa concentration in the clotting assay is 
well in excess of 1 nM and thus close to 103-fold above the 
functional KD~~~. Even a 41-fold-increased KD~~~, as for the 
Asp58 - Ala mutant, could be without a significant effect on 
the coagulant activity, because the concentration of VII/VIIa 
would still considerably exceed the KD~~~ and saturation of 
the added TF could be achieved. To address this hypothesis 
experimentally, the activity of selected mutants was analyzed 
in VII/VIIa-depleted plasma supplemented with 1% (-0.1 
nM VII/VIIa) or 10% (- 1 nM VII/VIIa) normal human 
plasma. Compared to the activity of wild-type TF, the specific 
activities of the Lys20 - Ala, Asp58 - Ala, or Phe140 - Ala 
mutants were now decreased to 8%, 25%, or 15% at 10% normal 
plasma and to 0.9%, 2%, or 0.2% at 1% normal plasma, 
respectively. These data are consistent with the hypothesis 
that the only slightly reduced coagulant activity of mutants 
which have significant loss of binding function is a consequence 
of the relatively high plasma concentration of VII/VIIa 
compared to the KDapp. 
DISCUSSION 
This study was designed to develop an overall assignment 
of functional and nonfunctional regions in the TF extracellular 
domain using the side chain capping approach of site-directed 
Ala replacement mutagenesis. In addition to the previously 
characterized functionally important residues in the sequence 
156-174 (Royetal., 1991;Rufetal. 1992a,b) whichcontribute 
selectively to the activation of macromolecular substrate, we 
here identify several residues which were required for full 
overall functional activity of TF. These residues were found 
in discrete and discontinuous sequence spans throughout the 
TF extracellular domain (Figure 1). Several of the residues 
suggested to be involved in overall function also demonstrated 
loss of affinity for VIIa, based on a functional KD~~~ estimate 
for the Ala replacement mutants. Key residues which are 
characterized by loss of both coagulant and VIIa binding 
function were thus identified throughout the sequence, in 
particular within sequence spans 16-26 and 129-147. This 
analysis thus provides an overall assignment of key residues 
and regions presumed to form the ligand binding site in TF. 
The presented mutational mapping of functional residues 
in TF is consistent with previous analyses to delineate, though 
less precisely, the ligand binding structures in TF. Proteolytic 
amino-terminal truncation of TF at residue 35 reduced the 
affinity for binding of ligand (O’Brien et al., 1993) in 
agreement with the assignment of the sequence 16-26 as a 
major site for binding of VIIa. Asp5* is localized within the 
recognition sequence of anti-peptide antibodies against residues 
40-71. These antibodies and monoclonal antibodies to the 
carboxyl-terminal aspect of the sequence 1-83 both strongly 
inhibit binding of VIIa to TF (Ruf et al., 1991b), consistent 
with a role of AspS8 as a contact residue for VIIa. The spatial 
proximity of residues 44-84 to ligand is further supported by 
chemical cross-linking to VIIa after complex formation (Ruf 
& Edgington, 1991b). Antibodies to residues 94-121 of TF 
inhibit binding of ligand (Ruf et al., 1991 b), supporting some 
contribution of Glu91 and/or Glu95 or the sequence 103-106 
to ligand interaction. The ligand binding residues within the 
129-147 sequence are contained within a site in the carboxyl￾terminal half of the TF extracellular domain which has been 
found to be spatially close to VIIa by chemical cross-linking 
(Ruf & Edgington, 1991b). The mutational analysis and 
independent experimental approaches thus concordantly 
implicate specific sequence spans in the binding of ligand VIIa, 
which lends support to the overall assignment of ligand binding 
structure suggested here. 
A large number of mutants with loss of overall function 
demonstrated <Zfold-decreased affinity for VIIa. The reason 
for loss of overall function of these mutants requires evaluation 
on an individual basis in more extensive analyses. One needs 
to consider that these residues may serve one or several of the 
following specific functions: (i) Residues may play a role in 
the assembly and desolvation of the ligand interface, when 
localized in spatial proximity to key ligand interactive residues. 
The coagulant assay used for assessment of overall function 
may be exquisitely sensitive to these on-rate effects. (ii) 
Similarly, ligand assembly with TF may involve subtle 
conformational rearrangement which could be perturbed by 
residue exchange within or in locations distant from the ligand 
interface. (iii) Specific residues of TF may selectively support 1570 Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 6, 1994 Ruf et al. 
Tissue Factor Growth Hormone Receptor 
FIGURE 4: Alignment of functional residues in TF with a topology diagram based on the growth hormone receptor structure. Left: Residues 
with loss of coagulant function (circled) and with >2-fold-increased KD~~~ (boxed) are aligned in a topology diagram based on the alignment 
of the TF sequence (Bazan, 1990) with the growth hormone receptor (De Vos et ai., 1992). Some residues are depicted based on the analysis of mutants incorporating multiple residue exchanges, Le., G~u~~ - Ala/Glu26 - Ala, Ser39 - Ala/Thr4 - Ala/Ser42 - Ala, ThP - 
Ala/ThrS5 - Ala, Gluql - Ala/Glug5 - Ala. Right: Residues in the growth hormone receptor which form hydrogen bonds or salt bridges 
with the hormone (boxed) or which have decreased solvent accessibility (circled) in either of the hormone interfaces are displayed in a similar 
diagram with data taken from the crystallographic solution of the structure of the receptor with growth hormone (De Vos et al., 1992). 
the binding of VI1 and the conversioon to VIIa, and this 
function would be evaluated in the coagulation assay where 
VI1 is present, but not in the KD~~~ determination which 
employed VIIa. (iv) Specific residues in the ligand interface 
may be selectively required to enhance the catalytic efficiency 
of the bound VIIa. Single Ala replacement may reduce the 
catalytic efficiency only slightly, but this reduction in catalytic 
efficiency could be amplified in the coagulation reaction. 
Unamplified, as in the KD~~~ determination, the slightly 
decreased catalysis may not have been apparent. (v) There 
could be interactions of TF unrelated to VII/VIIa binding 
which influence the overall coagulant function; e.g., certain 
mutant TF-VIIa complexes may become more susceptible to 
inactivation by inhibitors present in plasma. 
The present analysis identified a limited number of residues 
which contribute to the binding of VIIa. It is worthwhile to 
consider that the observed changes in the KD~~~, typically less 
than 2 orders of magnitude, are frequently observed when 
single residues are replaced by alanine in protein interactive 
sites (Bass et al., 1991; Ito et al., 1993; Kelley & O’Connell, 
1993). Further, the most significant mutants, LysZ0 - Ala, 
IleZ2 - Ala, Asp5* - Ala, Arg’35 - Ala, and PheI4O - Ala, 
could account for more than a 1 06-fold loss of affinity, assuming 
additivity of the mutational effect, as demonstrated in other 
studies (Kelley & O’Connell, 1993; Wells, 1990). The 
seemingly small number of residues which were found to 
contribute to binding of ligand may thus represent a reasonable 
percent of the key ligand interface residues. Because the three￾dimensional structure of TF has yet to be solved, it is unclear 
to what extent these residues form a contiguous ligand 
interface. However, the TF extracellular domain has been 
predicted (Bazan, 1990; Edgington et al. 1991) to adopt the 
architectural folding pattern of the cytokine receptor homology 
domain which consists of a pair of seven-0-strand modules. 
One can use the predicted alignment of the TF sequence to 
this type of folding pattern as an initial approach to consider 
some of the three-dimensional proximity relationships of 
residues which contribute to function. 
The TF sequence is aligned in a topology diagram of two 
@-strand modules connected by a short sequence from the 
amino-module strand GN to the carboxyl-module strand Ac, 
as shown in Figure 4. This folding topology was found in the 
structure determination of the growth hormone receptor 
extracellular domain (De Vos et al., 1992), which is a 
prototypical cytokine receptor homology domain and predicted 
to be related to TF (Bazan, 1990). Using this topographical 
alignment applied to TF, most of the residues which are 
required for overall function of TF (circled) or VIIa binding 
(boxed) are in close spatial proximity at the boundary of the 
two predicted structural modules of the TF extracellular 
domain. These residues are found predominantly in predicted 
loops which connect the 0-strands. Some of the residues 
implicated in VIIa binding are also found in putative @-strands, 
in particular the 0-strands BN and EN. It is possible that the 
functional residues clustered at the boundary between the 
two modules may form a more or less contiguous surface area, 
which may serve as the ligand interface. 
The residues presumed to form the ligand interface in TF 
are localized in a topographical alignment similar to the ligand 
interface residues of the growth hormone receptor derived 
from the crystallographic solution of the growth hormone 
receptor in complex with its ligand (De Vos et al., 1992). 
Figure 4 depicts the residues in both structural modules of the 
receptor which form hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with the 
hormone (boxed) or which are localized within the desolvated 
interface (circled). Both growth hormone receptor and TF 
appear to employ the same loops for contact with their 
respective ligands. In particular, the loops connecting 
@-strands AN-BN, CN-C’N, EN-FN, Bc-Cc, or Fc-Gc and 
the sequence connecting the amino and carboxyl modules 
appear to be conserved regions for binding of ligand. Despite 
this overall similarity of the presumed ligand interactive areas, Ligand Recognition by Tissue Factor 
some differences are apparent. For example, the growth 
hormone receptor seems to involve more residues in proximity 
of @-strand FN and the sequence which connects the two 
structural modules compared to the findings from mutational 
analysis of TF. In TF it appears that the @-strands BN and 
EN are important contributors to ligand binding, in contrast 
to the findings in the growth hormone receptor. It is unclear 
to what extent these differences result from variations in the 
actual ligand interface or from uncertainties in the predicted 
sequence alignment. TF has been assigned to the subclass I1 
of the cytokine receptor family, which includes the interferon 
receptors, because of structural features distinct from those 
of the growth hormone receptor and other subclass I cytokine 
receptors. It is therefore possible that TF and the interferon 
receptors may adopt a variation of the theme provided by the 
paradigm of the growth hormone receptor structure and ligand 
interface. 
Other members of the cytokine receptor family may also 
employ the same regions for ligand recognition. This can be 
demonstrated at some key residue positions from emerging 
mutational analyses of members of this receptor family. In 
the Bc-Cc loop at the position of Arg135 and Arg136 in TF, 
contact residues have been identified not only in the growth 
hormone receptor (Ile165, Gln166) but also in two other cytokine 
receptors, the interleukin-2 receptor @-chain (Imler et al., 
1992) and the murine interleukin-3 receptor (Wang et al., 
1992). The prolactin receptor, which is closely related to the 
growth hormone receptor, employs the AN-BN loop for binding 
ligand (Rozakis-Adcock & Kelly, 1992). This is also found 
for TF and the growth hormone receptor. Extensive muta￾tional analysis of the interleukin-6 receptor further provided 
data consistent with an assignment of the ligand interface at 
the boundary of the two predicted structural modules (Yawata 
et al., 1993). This comparison of the ligand interactive area 
in TF with other cytokine receptors thus suggests that ligand 
recognition by the two structural modules is architecturally 
conserved throughout the receptor family. Indeed, molecular 
recognition through a tandem pair of structural modules may 
be more widely used in protein-protein interactions, as 
demonstrated by the suggested involvement of at least two 
adjacent type I11 repeats in fibronectin for interaction with 
integrins (Main et al., 1992; Kimizuka et al., 1991; Bowditch 
et al., 1991) or by antigen recognition in the immunoglobulin 
family (Hunkapiller & Hood, 1989). Similar to immuno￾globulin modules, the cytokine receptors appear to employ 
several surface loops to create structure with specificity for 
recognition of ligand. In immunoglobulins, the paired rec￾ognition of ligand is achieved by parallel alignment of light 
and heavy chains; thus loops at the same pole in both modules 
are used for binding of ligand. In contrast, the cytokine 
receptor family employs tandem alignment of a similar 
structural framework. This results in recognition of ligand 
at the boundary between modules which contribute surface 
loops from opposite poles. Diversity in recognition of ligands 
may be generated by variability in the primary sequence and 
in the length of loops which form the ligand interface. In 
addition, the architecture of the recognition site can be 
predicted to depend on the relative orientation of the two 
structural modules at the intermodule boundary. 
The ligand binding site of cytokine receptors appears to 
recognize helical ligands. Although very short helical stretches 
may be associated with the predominant @-structure of 
epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains (Hommel et al. 
1992), recognition of a paired helical motif appears to be 
replaced by recognition of two EGF modules of VIIa in the 
Biochemistry, Vol. 33, No. 6, 1994 1571 
example of TF (Toomey et al., 1991). However, further 
complexity is introduced by the proposed contribution of 
protease domain residues in VIIa to the interaction with TF 
(O’Brien et al., 1991; Kazama et al., 1993) and a potential 
role of the y-carboxyglutamic acid rich domain in factor VI1 
in TF interaction (Sakai et al., 1990; Ruf et al., 1991a). The 
complementary binding site in VIIa may thus be formed by 
residues in different structural modules which associate to 
form a contiguous interactive structure. Although built from 
protein modules with structural scaffolds different from the 
helical cytokines, the interactive site in VIIa could potentially 
share some of the structural characteristics of the receptor 
interface of cytokine ligands. The structural elucidation of 
the TF-VIIa interface and the comparison with ligand 
interfaces of other members of the cytokine receptor family 
promise to provide more general rules for how the structural 
scaffold of two @-strand modules allows both diversity and 
specificity of ligand recognition.
