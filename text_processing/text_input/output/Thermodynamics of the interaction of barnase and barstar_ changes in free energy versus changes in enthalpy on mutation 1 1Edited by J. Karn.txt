We have studied the thermodynamics of the interaction between the riboï¿¾nuclease barnase and its natural polypeptide inhibitor barstar. The contriï¿¾bution of speciÂ®c residues and interactions within the barnase-barstar
interface to the enthalpy of binding has been examined using isothermal
titration calorimetry and protein engineering. The enthalpy of association
of the wild-type proteins is Ã¿18.9 (0.1) kcal/mol at pH 8 and at 25C.
The enthalpy of binding remains favourable for 31 different combinations
of mutations in the interface. The effects on the binding enthalpy upon
replacing a side-chain involved in the interaction of barnase and barstar
are, however, always unfavourable and in most cases larger than the
effects on the free energy of binding. Interaction enthalpies calculated by
double mutant cycle analysis are in some cases much larger than the
interaction free energies. The interaction enthalpies for complexes
between different barnase mutants with amino acid substitutions of the
general base residue glutamic acid 73 and a barstar variant (D39A) vary
by as much as 8.3 kcal/mol while the coupling free energies differ only
by 1 kcal/mol. The use of enthalpies for the analysis of structure-activity
relationships appears to be complicated by enthalpy-entropy compenï¿¾sation of weak intermolecular interactions. These tend to cancel out in
measurements of free energy, which is thus the preferred quantity for
simple analysis of interactions.

Introduction
Barnase and barstar are, respectively, the extraï¿¾cellular ribonuclease and its intracellular inhibitor
produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Barstar inhiï¿¾bits barnase by binding to its active site, forming a
1:1 complex (Figure 1: Hartley & Smeaton, 1973;
Buckle et al., 1994). The crystal structure of the
complex of barnase with the barstar (C40A/C82A)
double mutant has been solved by Guillet et al.
(1993) at 2.6 AÃŠ resolution and by Buckle et al.
(1994) at 2.0 AÃŠ resolution. The three-dimensional
structures of the free proteins are also known: for
barnase both from X-ray crystallography (Mauï¿¾guen et al., 1982) and from NMR studies in solï¿¾ution (Bycroft et al., 1991); and for barstar from
NMR studies in solution (Lubienski et al., 1994).
Detailed protein engineering studies on the interï¿¾action of barnase and barstar have revealed the apï¿¾parent contributions of speciÂ®c residues to the free
energy and kinetics of binding (Hartley, 1993;
Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a, 1995; Schreiber et al.,
1994). In this study, we complete the thermodynï¿¾amic characterisation of this interaction using isoï¿¾thermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the
enthalpy of formation of barnase-barstar comï¿¾plexes with single amino acid substitutions in the

et al., 1984; Horovitz, 1987; Fersht et al., 1992) and
compared with the corresponding coupling free
energies. Changes in protonation on the interaction
of barnase with barstar were measured as were the
heat capacity for the interaction and its change on
mutation.
These direct calorimetric measurements reveal
the contributions of enthalpy and entropy to the
free energy of binding. Changes in the free energy
and enthalpy on mutation are generally not correï¿¾lated (Sturtevant, 1994), however, and any inï¿¾terpretation of the effects on enthalpy and entropy
in structure-activity relationships is complicated by
the involvement of solvent (Hammett, 1940; Jencks,
1969). Mark & van Gunsteren (1994) have stated
that the theoretical basis for the assignment of enï¿¾thalpic contributions to the free energy to speciÂ®c
atom-atom or residue-residue interactions is Â®rm
while the free energy of these interactions can not
be determined but this has been challenged by Borï¿¾esch & Karplus (1995) and Brady & Sharp (1995).
The binding enthalpy of the association of barnase
and barstar can be determined as accurately as
the binding free energy using isothermal titration
calorimetry. The barnase-barstar complex constituï¿¾tes, therefore, an ideal system to compare experï¿¾imentally determined values of coupling enthalpies
and coupling free energies for residue-residue
interactions.
Results
Enthalpy and stoichiometry of interaction of
barnase and barstar
The enthalpy of association of barnase and barï¿¾star at 25C and at pH 8 is Ã¿18.9 (0.1) kcal/mol.
The stoichiometry and enthalpy of interaction of
barnase and barstar are independent of protein
concentration (data not shown) or whether barnase
is titrated with barstar or vice versa (Table 1). These
observations indicate that all the proteins are fully
folded and capable of binding the other comï¿¾ponent. More importantly, it eliminates the possiï¿¾bility that one component of the system is
aggregated. It also conÂ®rms the accuracy of the exï¿¾tinction coefÂ®cients of mutant barnase and barstar
proteins. The average value for the stoichiometry
of binding (n) from all ITC measurements
performed in this study is 0.95 (standard
deviation Âˆ  0.03; total number of experiments
was 220).
The ITC measurements shown in Table 2 were
performed at an ionic strength of 0.018 M while all
other ITC measurements and all measurements of
association and dissociation rate constants were at
an ionic strength of 0.029 M. The difference in
binding enthalpy between the two ionic strengths
for the barnase-barstar and barnase-barstar(D39A)
complexes was in both cases 0.4 kcal/mol with the
lower (more negative) binding enthalpy being at
low ionic strength (see Tables 2 and 3). The H of
the interaction of barnase and barstar increases
further at ionic strengths of 0.2 and 0.5 M, respectï¿¾ively (Table 3). This is in good agreement with the
ionic strength dependence of the free energy of
binding (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a).

Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 697Protonation changes during the interaction of
barnase and barstar
The contribution of the heat of protonation to
the heat of binding of barnase and barstar can be
determined from the binding enthalpies obtained
from ITC measurements of interaction of barnase
and barstar in buffers with different heats of ionizï¿¾ation. Association of barnase and barstar was
measured at 25C in three different buffers at pH 8
(Table 3). The enthalpies of ionization (for the proï¿¾cess HA ! HÂ‡ Â‡ AÃ¿) at 25C for these buffers are:
7.7 kcal/mol for Tes, 4.9 kcal/mol for Hepes and
0.8 kcal/mol for phosphate buffer (Cooper &
Johnson, 1994a). The binding enthalpies measured
in Hepes and phosphate buffer were virtually idenï¿¾tical, whereas in Tes buffer H was decreased by
0.6 kcal/mol, which is slightly larger than the exï¿¾perimental error. A similar difference of 0.7 kcal/
mol and 0.4 kcal/mol in Tes buffer was found for
the complexes between barstar and barnase(E73Q)
and barstar and barnase(E73W), respectively
(Table 3). This decrease, however, is not very high
and since the binding enthalpies of the interaction
of barnase and barstar in Hepes and sodium phosï¿¾phate buffer were the same, no correction for the
contribution of buffer titration to the observed H
was made. The net Â¯ux of protons for the interï¿¾action of barnase and barstar at pH 8 must be
around zero, which means that the inÂ¯uence of the
heat of buffer ionization is negligible.
Association constants for the interaction of
barnase and barstar
Binding was too strong for most of the comï¿¾plexes to allow the association constant to be deterï¿¾mined by ITC measurements (Figure 2). For
complexes where Ka could be determined (barnaseï¿¾barstar (D39A) and barnase(K27A)-barstar(D39A))
there is good agreement with values determined
from kinetic measurements of the association and
dissociation rate constants (Table 2). For one comï¿¾plex between barnase(H102A) and barstar(D39A),
however, these Ka values were different. This may
reÂ¯ect the difÂ®culty in determining Ka from ITC
measurements when the H of the interaction is
small.
Effects of mutation on the thermodynamics
of interaction
The thermodynamic parameters of complexes
between barnase and barstar mutants of which the
free energy of interaction had been determined
previously (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995) are summarï¿¾ized in Table 2. There is always an increase of

698 Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstarbinding enthalpy (i.e. less favourable) upon muï¿¾tation of one residue of the barnase-barstar binding
site, which is in most cases larger than the correï¿¾sponding increase of binding free energy. This inï¿¾dicates that there must be a compensating gain in
the entropy of binding. The exceptions are the
complexes between barnase(R87A) and barstar,
and between barnase(R87A) and barstar(D39A),
where the increase of free energy of binding is
larger than the increase of binding enthalpy.
The interaction enthalpy (Hint) between sevï¿¾eral pairs of residues was determined using the
double mutant cycle method (Carter et al., 1984;
Horovitz, 1987; Fersht et al., 1992). In this proï¿¾cedure, two residues, X and Y, are mutated singly
and pairwise and the interaction energy (Gint)
is calculated as:
Gint Âˆ GXY Ã¿ GX!A
Ã¿GY!A Â‡ GX!A;Y!A Â…1Â†
where GXY is the free energy of the wild-type,
GX ! A and GY ! A are the free energies of the
two single mutants and GX ! A, Y ! A the free enï¿¾ergy of the double mutant. If the effects of the two
mutations are independent, Gint should be zero.
If the effects are coupled, the change in energy
for the double mutant should be different from
the sum of the changes in G of the two single
mutants. A negative value of Gint indicates a
favourable interaction. Interaction free energies beï¿¾tween residues on barnase and barstar have been
observed only between residues that are located
at a distance of less than 8 AÃŠ from each other,
suggesting that possible changes in structure or
solvation resulting from mutagenesis are limited to
a short distance from the site of mutation (Schreiï¿¾ber & Fersht, 1995). The double mutant cycle methï¿¾od can also be used to calculate an interaction
enthalpy or interaction entropy (Sint). In an
ideal situation, the interaction energies of X and Y
with the rest of the protein and with solvent and
possible reorganisation energy terms will cancel
out to leave just the interaction energies between X
and Y (Fersht et al., 1992). The coupling enthalpies
between residues His102(bn) and Tyr29(b*) and
between Lys27(bn) and Asp39(b*) are Ã¿7.6 and
Ã¿9.4 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 3A). ((bn) indiï¿¾cates that the residue is in barnase, and (b*) indiï¿¾cates that it is in barstar). These are Ã¿4.3 and
Ã¿4.6 kcal/mol higher than the corresponding free

For the G values obtained from the association and dissociation rate constants, the standard error of the
mean (s) was calculated from three to Â®ve repetitions of each experiment for all of the data for mutant proteins
and for more measurements on wild-type proteins. The standard error of the mean for association and dissociaï¿¾tion rate constants is about 12%. Accordingly, 2s, the 95% conÂ®dence level, for G is 0.2 kcal molÃ¿1
, for
Gwt-mut the 2s is 0.2 kcal molÃ¿1 (since the error for the wild-type data is substantially smaller).
For the H and G values obtained by ITC, the standard error of the mean was calculated from at least three
repetitions of each experiment and the 2s is between 0.1 and 0.4 kcal mol
Ã¿1 as is for 2s for Hwt-mut. For
complexes where both possible calorimetric titrations have been performed (see Table 1), all data were averï¿¾aged.
Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 699                 energy interaction values. The interaction between
Arg87(bn) and Asp39(b*) has an interaction enï¿¾thalpy of Ã¿8.0 kcal/mol while the Gint is
Ã¿6.1 kcal/mol. These enthalpy values are far too
high for the interaction of His102(bn) with the pheï¿¾nyl ring of Tyr29(b*) or for the long-range electroï¿¾static interaction (charged atoms are 4.5 AÃŠ apart)
between Lys27(bn) and Asp39(b*) or the hydrogen
bond between Arg87(bn) and Asp39(b*). There are,
therefore, probably additional effects (solvent or
other reorganisation effects) that lead to a decrease
in binding enthalpy in the complexes between the
barnase and barstar single mutants (``double muï¿¾tant complexes'') compared with at least one of
the corresponding complexes between barnase or
barstar wild-type and a single barstar or barnase
mutant (``single mutant complexes'') that does not
cancel out in the double mutant cycle.
Values of Hint of the barnase(H102A)-barï¿¾star(Y29F) and barnase(R59A)-barstar(D39A) comï¿¾plexes should be zero, since the side-chains of
Arg59(bn) and Asp39(b*) are too far apart to interï¿¾act and the hydroxyl group of Tyr29(b*) does not
interact with His102(bn) (Buckle et al., 1994;
Schreiber & Fersht, 1995). In both cases, however,
signiÂ®cant interaction enthalpies of Ã¿1.6 kcal/mol
for barnase(H102A)-barstar(Y29F) and Ã¿1.7 kcal/
mol for barnase(R59A)-barstar(D39A) were found.
The free energy of association of the latter complex
was determined only by ITC, which could not be
done very accurately, since the enthalpy of associï¿¾ation is only Ã¿1.7 kcal/mol. For this reason, no
interaction free energy has been determined for
this complex.
Changes in H and G of binding for different
barnase(E73) mutant-barstar complexes
To investigate possible contributions of solvent
and reorganisation to the measured binding enthalï¿¾py that do not seem to cancel out in the double
mutant cycles, the binding energetics of a series of
barnase mutants at one position in the binding inï¿¾terface were determined. Glutamic acid 73 of barï¿¾nase was chosen for this study since its side-chain
reaches into a large water-Â®lled cavity at the centre
of the barnase-barstar interface (Buckle et al., 1994).
The side-chain of Glu73 makes three interactions
with water molecules that are buried in the interï¿¾face but it is not involved in a direct interaction
with barstar (Figure 1; Buckle et al., 1994). Compuï¿¾ter modelling suggests that Glu73 could even be
substituted by tryptophan without causing clashes
with neighbouring residues. Glu73 was substituted
by Gln, Trp, Tyr, Phe, Ser, Cys and Ala (unpubï¿¾lished results). The binding thermodynamics of the
complexes between these barnase mutants and barï¿¾star and barstar mutants are summarized in
Table 3. Thermodynamic parameters of interaction between various barnase(E73) mutants and barstar mutants

700 Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar                    Table 3. While the destabilizing effect on G for
the interaction of the different barnase(E73) muï¿¾tants with barstar varied only between Ã¿1.4 and
Ã¿3 kcal/mol, the change in H was between Ã¿8.2
and Ã¿11.6 kcal/mol. Considering the large change
in H in all the barnase(E73) mutant-barstar comï¿¾plexes (compared with the barnase-barstar comï¿¾plex), the differences between them are relatively
small.
The values of Gint of the complexes between
different barnase(E73) mutants and barstar(D35A)
or barstar(E76A) are all around zero within experï¿¾imental error (Figure 3B). The values of Hint for
these complexes are on average slightly higher but
they are in all cases lower than 1 kcal/mol. This is
the expected result because these residues are not
involved in direct interactions (and Asp35(b*) does
not interact with Lys27(bn), which might be afï¿¾fected by the mutation of Glu73(bn)). The value of
Gint of the complexes between different barnï¿¾ase(E73) mutants and barstar(D39A) is on average
Ã¿2.5 kcal/mol and varies only between Ã¿1.9 and
Ã¿2.9 kcal/mol for the four different barnaseE73
mutants analysed (Figure 3B). This interaction free
energy could result from either a perturbation of
the water network within the binding site or a loss
(or a weakening) of the interaction of residues
Arg83(bn), Arg87(bn) and Lys27(bn) with barstar
(especially with Asp39(b*)) caused by reorganisï¿¾ation. The large and similar increase of binding

mutants and barstar, barstar(D35A) or barstar

20 ml injections (20 seconds injection time each) were
performed at four minute intervals. B, The data points
were obtained by integration of the above peaks plotted
against the molar ratio of barstar to barnase in the reacï¿¾tion cell. The observed H (heat of injections before
saturation) was corrected for the heat of dilution (averï¿¾age heat of injections after saturation).

and EY ! A are the energies of the two single mutants
and EX ! A, Y ! A the energy of the double mutant.
G and H values were taken from Table 2 and
Table 3, respectively. For Gint the standard error (2s)
is 0.3 kcal/mol and for Hint it is between 0.2 and
0.5 kcal/mol.
Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 701and Glu76(b*) suggests a reorganisation conÂ®ned
to the region around residue 73 of barnase, which
should be similar in all cases.
In contrast, the value of Hint of the complexes
between different barnase(E73) mutants and barï¿¾star(D39A) is very large and varies between Ã¿8.2
and Ã¿16.5 kcal/mol (Figure 3B). This results from
a decrease in binding enthalpy of the double muï¿¾tant complexes compared with at least one of the
single mutant complexes of the cycle, as has been
observed for the other double mutant cycles with a
very high interaction enthalpy (Tables 2 and 3).
The heat capacity of the interaction of barnase
and barstar
The change in heat capacity, Cp, is related to
solvation changes between two states of a system
and it can be determined from ITC measurements
performed over a range of temperatures from the

different from that of the barnase-barstar wild-type complex, since the two cysteine residues in barstar are relatively buried
(Lubienski et al., 1994) and the structures of wild-type barstar and barstar(C40A/C82A) are identical (Wong et al., 1996). For the barï¿¾nase(E73)-barstar complexes, Glu73 was replaced by the respective residue using the software package Insight II (Biosym Technoloï¿¾gies Inc., San Diego, CA), and the buried accessible surface area was calculated as for the complex between the wild-type proteins. f In 10.25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 1 mM DTT (m Âˆ 0.029 M).
702 Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstarand barstar and for six different barnase(E73) muï¿¾tant-barstar complexes were performed at Â®ve
different temperatures (8, 16.5, 25, 31 and 37C).
The H of binding of all of these complexes deï¿¾pends strongly on temperature. The binding enï¿¾thalpies were plotted against temperature (Figure 4)
and the data were Â®t both to a linear function and
to a second-order polynomial to obtain values for
Cp. All the data Â®t better to a second-order polyï¿¾nomial, indicating a small temperature dependence
of the Cp of binding. The slight curvature in the
plots becomes especially apparent on examining
the residuals of the linear and the polynomial Â®ts
(Figure 4); the residuals of the polynomial Â®ts are
randomly distributed while the residuals of the
linear Â®ts show a systematic curvature. The differï¿¾ences, however, between the Cp values from
the linear Â®t and the Cp values at 25C from
the second-order polynomial Â®t are very small
(Table 4).
The Cp values of the complexes analysed are
relatively large and negative and they are all very
similar (the Cp values are almost all smaller
than the experimental error: Table 4). Glu73 conï¿¾tributes only 11 AÃŠ 2 to a total of 1600 AÃŠ 2 of accessï¿¾ible surface area buried upon complex formation
between barnase and barstar. Hence, the expected
changes in the burial of polar and non-polar accesï¿¾sible surface area on mutation of Glu73 are small
(Table 4). The very similar Cp values suggest that
there is no large structural perturbation within
the interface of the barnase-barstar complex on
mutation of Glu73(bn).
Discussion
The binding enthalpy of the interaction of barï¿¾nase and barstar can be measured accurately by
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The values
do not depend on protein concentration and the
same values are obtained for both the calorimetric
titration of barnase with barstar and vice versa.
There is only a negligible protonation change upon
association at pH 8, which is, according to the theï¿¾ory of linked functions (Wyman, 1964), consistent
with the Â®nding that the dissociation constant of
the barnase-barstar complex between pH 7 and 9 is
practically invariant (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a).
For two complexes (barnase-barstar(D39A), barï¿¾nase(K27A)-barstar(D39A)) the Ka values could be
determined accurately by ITC. These are in good
agreement with the Ka values determined indepenï¿¾dently from the association and dissociation rate
constants (Table 2; Schreiber & Fersht, 1995). The
ITC measurements have, therefore, conÂ®rmed the
proposed scheme of complex formation, in which
one association/dissociation equilibrium for barï¿¾nase-barstar complex formation is involved (Schreiï¿¾ber & Fersht, 1993a). Hence, Ka values of the
interaction of barnase and barstar from direct
measurements should be generally the same as
the Ka values determined from the association and
dissociation rate constants.
The Cp value represents the difference in heat
capacity at constant pressure that is related to solï¿¾vation changes between two states of a system. It
was shown that most of the heat capacity change
associated with the unfolding of the native state of
a protein can be expressed as a linear combination
of the differences in polar and non-polar solventï¿¾accessible surface areas between those states (Murï¿¾phy & Freire, 1992; Spolar et al., 1992), and it was
suggested that this approach applies also to proï¿¾tein-protein interactions, since the atomic interï¿¾actions involved are similar in both cases (Murphy
et al., 1993; GoÃ‚mez & Freire, 1995). The following
equation, derived from model compound studies,
relates Cp to the polar (Ap) and non-polar
(Anp) surface area buried upon folding or interï¿¾action (Murphy & Freire, 1992; Murphy et al.,
1993):
Cp Âˆ 0:45Anp Ã¿ 0:26Ap cal molÃ¿1 KÃ¿1 Â…3Â†
For the barnase-barstar complex the polar and
non-polar surface area buried between the interface
is about 894 AÃŠ 2 and 706 AÃŠ 2
, respectively (Table 4).
Hence, the calculated Cp is Ã¿85 cal molÃ¿1 KÃ¿1
.
The Cp of binding of the barnase-barstar comï¿¾plex, however, was estimated to be Ã¿363 cal
molÃ¿1 KÃ¿1 assuming that it is independent of temï¿¾perature and Ã¿384 cal molÃ¿1 KÃ¿1 (at 25C) assumï¿¾ing it is temperature dependent. A lack of
correlation between the measured and the calcuï¿¾lated Cp values (using the same equation) was
also found for other protein-protein interactions
(Raman et al., 1995; Schwarz et al., 1995; Pearce
et al., 1996). This suggests that while the heat caï¿¾pacity change for protein folding often correlates
well with the burial of non-polar and polar surface
area, a similar correlation may not apply to proï¿¾tein-protein interactions.
For most of the mutant complexes between barï¿¾nase and barstar the increase of the enthalpy of
binding is larger than the increase of the free enï¿¾ergy of binding. This indicates enthalpy-entropy
compensation, which seems to be a characteristic
of weak intermolecular interactions (Dunitz, 1995).
Coupling enthalpies of non-interacting residues are
on average larger than the corresponding coupling
free energies, which are all smaller than 1 kcal/
mol, but none is larger than 1.7 kcal/mol. Coupï¿¾ling enthalpies of directly or indirectly (through
stabilization of neighbouring residues) interacting
residues are, however, in most cases much larger
than the corresponding coupling free energies and,
in contrast to the interaction free energies, they
vary considerably for the different barnase(E73)
mutant-barstar(D39A) complexes.
Mark & van Gunsteren (1994) claim that,
whereas the enthalpy of interaction of individual
residues may in principle be determined by calcuï¿¾lation or experiment, the associated free energies
cannot, because of difÂ®culties in the calculation of
Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 703entropy: there are changes in the entropy of the
protein and solvent on mutation that are non-addiï¿¾tive. Thus, the total free energy of a system cannot
be expressed in terms of a sum of components.
Boresch & Karplus (1995) and Brady & Sharp
(1995) have set out the counter arguments that G
can be usefully calculated and measured. There is
also an experimental justiÂ®cation of why measureï¿¾ments of G are more meaningful than those of
H because of entropy-enthalpy compensation.
For over 50 years, G has been preferred by physiï¿¾cal-organic chemists for analysing reactions in solï¿¾ution and is even considered a more accurate
measure of changes in enthalpy than is the
measured value of H (Hammett, 1940). This
stems from the large number of observations, sumï¿¾marized by Jencks (1969) and Lumry & Rajender
(1970), that changes in values of H (and S) on
changes in structure for processes in solution conï¿¾tain contributions from changes in the enthalpy
and entropy of water that are compensating. It has
also been shown theoretically that on forming a
cavity in water to accommodate a solvent molï¿¾ecule, the change in the enthalpy of water (the solï¿¾vation or cavity term) is exactly balanced by the
entropy of the cavity (Ben-Naim, 1975; Yu &
Karplus, 1988). Thus, measured values of H and
S contain contributions from H(solv) and S(solv),
which may obscure them but cancel out in G beï¿¾cause G(solv) (ÂˆH(solv) Ã¿ TS(solv)) is zero. Dunitz
(1995) has analysed entropy-enthalpy compenï¿¾sation semi-quantitatively and has shown that it
extends to all weak interactions so that there is
nearly complete enthalpy-entropy compensation at
300 K for interactions of about 5 kcal molÃ¿1
. The reï¿¾sults in this study show that the changes in G are
reasonable and rational, but that those in enthalpy
can be large and erratic, as are those for changes in
protein stability (Sturtevant, 1994). Thus, measureï¿¾ments of G are preferable to those of H for
analysing structure-activity relationships.
Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification
Barnase and barstar were expressed and puriÂ®ed as
described (Mossakowska et al., 1989; Serrano et al., 1990;
Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a; Lubienski et al., 1994). All barï¿¾nase and barstar mutants used in this study have been
described (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995; G.S., C.F. & A.R.F.,
unpublished results).
Isothermal titration calorimetry
Barnase and barstar samples were dialysed exhausï¿¾tively at 4C against the same batch of buffer, previously
Â®ltered using 0.2 mm Â®lters (Sartolab V-500, Sartorius,
GoÃˆttingen, Germany). After dialysis, the proteins were
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for ten
minutes and then diluted with dialysis buffer to the reï¿¾quired concentration. Protein samples were degassed
under vacuum for Â®ve minutes with gentle stirring imï¿¾mediately before use. Experiments were performed in
Hepes buffer (pH 8), 1 mM DTT because barstar tends to
aggregate in the cell of the calorimeter in Tris buffer at
pH 8 (data not shown). Tris buffer was used for
measurements of the interaction of barnase and barstar
in previous studies (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a, 1995,
1996; Schreiber et al., 1994). The DTT was added to the
buffer to prevent oxidation and dimerization of barstar
(Frisch et al., 1995).
Measurements were also performed in sodium phosï¿¾phate buffer (pH 8), 1 mM DTT and Tes buffer (pH 8),
1 mM DTT, to examine the contribution of the heat of
buffer ionization to barnase-barstar binding. Measureï¿¾ments were not routinely performed in phosphate buffer
because the active site of barnase binds phosphate with
a Kd of 1.3 mM (Meiering et al., 1992), which could comï¿¾plicate the determination of the binding enthalpy of
barstar and barnase.
ITC measurements were performed as described
(Wiseman et al., 1989; Cooper & Johnson, 1994a) using
an OMEGA isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal,
Northampton, MA, USA). The protein concentration in
the cell of the calorimeter ranged from 0.01 to 0.06 mM,
while the titrant solutions were about nine times higher.
Figure 2 shows data from a typical calorimetric titration
experiment of the association between barnase and barï¿¾star. The binding data were analysed using OriginTM
software (Microcal, Northampton, MA, USA) and were
Â®tted either with a Â®xed value of Ka, which was calcuï¿¾lated from independently measured values of the associï¿¾ation and dissociation rate constants to obtain values for
the stoichiometry of binding (n) and H, or with no
parameters Â®xed to obtain n, H and Ka.
The calculation of the enthalpy of association from
ITC measurements is based on the concentration of the
titrant (sample in the injection syringe). Errors in its conï¿¾centration or the presence of aggregated and/or inactive
material can lead to large deviations from the true enï¿¾thalpy of association. Hence, for a number of combiï¿¾nations of mutants, barnase was titrated with barstar
and vice versa (see Table 1).
The protein concentration was determined from absorï¿¾bance measurements at 280 nm, corrected for light scatï¿¾tering (Drake, 1994). Extinction coefÂ®cients (e280
MÃ¿1 cmÃ¿1),
determined by the method of Gill & von Hippel
(1989), are: barstar, 22171 MÃ¿1 cmÃ¿1
; barstar(Y29A),
20643 MÃ¿1 cmÃ¿1
; barstar(Y29F), 20798 MÃ¿1 cmÃ¿1
; barnase,
27404 MÃ¿1 cmÃ¿1
; barnase(E73W), 33863 MÃ¿1 cmÃ¿1
; and
barnase(E73Y), 28769 MÃ¿1 cmÃ¿1
. The extinction coefÂ®-
cients of all other mutants were calculated from the
wild-type values. (The amino acid substitution(s) of muï¿¾tant proteins are indicated in parentheses).
Kinetic and equilibrium measurements
Association and dissociation rate constants for the barï¿¾nase-barstar complexes were measured in 50 mM Trisï¿¾HCl (pH 8) at 25C as described (Schreiber & Fersht,
1993a, 1995, 1996; Schreiber et al., 1994).
