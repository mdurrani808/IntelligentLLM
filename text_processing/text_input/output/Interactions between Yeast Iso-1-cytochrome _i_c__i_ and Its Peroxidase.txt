ABSTRACT: Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to study the formation of 19 complexes involving
yeast iso-1-ferricytochrome c (Cc) and ferricytochrome c peroxidase (CcP). The complexes comprised
combinations of the wild-type proteins, six CcP variants, and three Cc variants. Sixteen protein combinations
were designed to probe the crystallographically defined interface between Cc and CcP. The data show
that the high-affinity sites on Cc and CcP coincide with the crystallographically defined sites. Changing
charged residues to alanine increases the enthalpy of complex formation by a constant amount, but the
decrease in stability depends on the location of the amino acid substitution. Deleting methyl groups has
a small effect on the binding enthalpy and a larger deleterious effect on the binding free energy, consistent
with model studies of the hydrophobic effect, and showing that nonpolar interactions also stabilize the
complex. Double-mutant cycles were used to determine the coupling energies for nine Cc-CcP residue
pairs. Comparing these energies to the crystal structure of the complex leads to the conclusion that many
of the substitutions induce a rearrangement of the complex.
Iso-1-cytochrome c (Cc)1 from the yeast Saccharomyces
cereVisiae and Cc peroxidase (CcP) are physiological redox
partners. Cc, a 12.5 kDa single-domain protein with a
covalently bound heme c, is the penultimate electron-transfer
protein of the eukaryotic respiratory chain whose main
function is to accept electrons from Cc reductase and donate
them to Cc oxidase (1). CcP is a 35 kDa monomer with a
noncovalently bound heme, which undergoes a two-electron
oxidation by peroxide (2). The oxidized CcP is re-reduced
to its resting state by two ferroCc molecules in consecutive
one-electron steps.
The Cc-CcP complex is one of the most well studied
protein complexes. An important role for electrostatic
interactions in the CcP reaction was recognized 60 years ago
from studies of ionic strength dependence (3). A high-affinity
Cc-CcP complex was postulated in 1964 (4) and observed
in 1971 (5). Chemical modification studies in the 1970s
identified the positively charged residues on Cc that are
important for forming the high-affinity complex (6), while
chemical cross-linking and protection studies helped to
identify the important negatively charged residues on CcP
(7, 8). These results have been confirmed by more recent
site-directed mutagenesis studies (9-17).
The pioneering molecular modeling study of Poulos and
Kraut (18) suggested a structure for the complex. A refined
version of this model (2), as well as the results from
Brownian dynamics simulations (19) and analyses of electron￾transfer pathways (20), is generally consistent with the results
from experiment (6-17). However, steady-state kinetic
experiments (21), electron-transfer studies (20, 22), poten￾tiometric titration experiments (23), and a recent isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) study (10) have identified a
second, weak Cc binding site on CcP that was predicted by
simulation data (19, 20).
A great deal is now known about the structure of the Cc￾CcP complex. In 1987, Poulos et al. reported the production
of crystals with a 1:1 molar Cc:CcP ratio, but defined electron
density for the Cc could not be located (24). In 1992, Pelletier
and Kraut reported high-resolution crystal structures for the
horse Cc-CcP complex and the yeast iso-1-Cc-CcP com￾plex (25). Both complexes possess one well-defined binding
site on each protein, and the residues shown to be important
for promoting high-affinity binding are found at the crys￾tallographically defined binding sites.
The goal of the present studies is to quantify the
thermodynamics of several interprotein interactions between
yeast iso-1-ferriCc and ferriCcP. The interactions involve
D34, V197, and E290 on CcP and K87, A81, and K72 on
Cc. These Cc residues are part of the crystallographically
defined CcP binding site in both the yeast (Figure 1) and
horse Cc-CcP complexes, but the Cc binding sites on CcP
are slightly different (25). We used ITC (26) to measure the
thermodynamic parameters, protein variants to assess the
contribution of individual residues, and double-mutant cycles
(27) to examine specific side chain-side chain interaction
energies (28-30).
To ensure that our analyses of the high-affinity site on
CcP are not complicated by binding to other sites (10, 20-
23), we also studied CcP variants with amino acid changes
at D217, L182, and D148. Modeling (24), dynamics simula￾tions (19), and electron-transfer pathway analyses (20)
suggest that D217 and L182 define part of the Cc binding
site. The simulations also suggest that D148 is part of a
second Cc binding site. As shown in Figure 1, these side
chains are adjacent to the crystallographically defined site,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein Variants. Cc and CcP refer to the ferri forms of
these recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli.
The C102T variant of recombinant yeast iso-1-Cc is termed
the wild-type (WT) protein; all other Cc variants also carry
this mutation. The Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to construct the mutants
(extension temperature of 70 °C, 16 cycles per reaction). Cc
mutants were constructed on the pBTR2(C102T) plasmid,
which carries the gene for the C102T mutant (31). The
original plasmid (32) was a gift from G. Mauk. CcP mutants
were constructed on a plasmid containing the WT CcP gene,
which was a gift from T. Poulos. The DNA sequence of the
entire coding region of each mutant was confirmed by
automated DNA sequencing. No additional mutations were
found.
Sample Preparation. Recombinant Cc and its variants were
expressed and purified from freshly transformed BL21 DE3
E. coli cells as described by Morar et al. (31). Recombinant
CcP and its variants were expressed and purified from E.
coli by using a modified version (33) of a published protocol
(34). The ratio of the absorbance at 408 nm to that at 280
nm ranged between 1.20 and 1.30, showing that the CcP
has a five-coordinate high-spin heme (35). Aliquots of CcP
crystals were stored in deionized, distilled water at -80 °C
and dissolved in buffer before use.
ITC. Experiments were performed with a Microcal MCS
calorimeter (Northampton, MA). Solutions were buffered
with 50 mM dimethylglutaric acid (DMG) (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO), adjusted with NaOH to pH 6.0. Cc was treated as the
ligand and injected with a 250 µL syringe, which was rotated
at 300 or 400 rpm for the duration of each experiment. The
injection volume was 5-15 µL depending on the protein
concentrations, but was constant for each experiment. The
time between injections was 360 s. Experiments were
performed at 25 °C, with an external water bath temperature
of 20 °C. The calorimeter was calibrated by titrating 2′-CMP
into ribonuclease A as recommended by Microcal. Other
details are given by Wang and Pielak (33).
Error Analysis. Uncertainties in ∆H and ∆G are reported
as the standard deviation of the mean from repetition of the
experiment. In all instances, the sample standard deviations
obtained from the quality of the fits were smaller than the
sample standard deviations obtained from repeating the
experiment. This observation indicates that the data are well
fit by the model, and suggests that the uncertainties arise
from random errors. For experiments that were performed
fewer than three times, the uncertainties in ∆H and ∆G were
assumed to be (0.3 and (0.7 kcal mol-1
, respectively, the
largest measured uncertainties for experiments performed
three or more times (Table 1). The uncertainties in ∆∆G
and ∆∆H were estimated by using standard propagation
procedures (36). The uncertainty in ∆∆S was estimated by
using standard procedures to propagate the uncertainties in
∆∆H and ∆∆G through a modified form of the Gibbs
equation [∆∆S ) (∆∆H - ∆∆G)/T]. Uncertainties for
comparing the distribution of ∆∆G values and ∆∆H values
were computed as the sample standard deviation.
Coupling Energies. ∆∆Hc and ∆∆Gc were calculated by
using eq 1 (29).
where J represents H or G, X and Y represent the WT
residues in Cc and CcP, respectively, and A/G represents a
change to alanine or glycine. The contribution of the coupling
entropy to ∆∆Gc (-T∆∆Sc) was calculated by using the

(charged side chains) or green (nonpolar side chains). The porphyrin
rings are colored red.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Three ITC data sets are shown in Figure 2. Panel A shows
high-quality data representative of most of the experiments.
Panel B shows the lowest-quality data that could be reliably
fit to the binding model. Panel C shows a data set that could
not be fit. The parameters derived from all the titrations are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. ∆G, ∆H, and ∆S represent
standard state values, where the standard state refers to 1 M
reactants and products at pH 6.0, and are presented in terms
of complex formation. ∆∆G, ∆∆H, and ∆∆S are presented
as the values for a complex minus the values for the WT
Cc-WT CcP complex. The results are reported as averages
when multiple experiments were performed. See Materials
and Methods for a complete description of error analysis.
Authentic Versus Recombinant Yeast Iso-1-Cc. Authentic
yeast iso-1-Cc, which contains a trimethylated lysine at
position 72 (26), was used in the crystallographic study (25).
This protein also contains a free cysteine at position 102,
which causes covalent homodimer formation in solution (37).
In the studies reported here, we used a recombinant version
of the C102T variant expressed in E. coli (32). The C102T
variant from yeast is structurally identical to the authentic
WT protein (38-40), but is not prone to dimerization (41).
The E. coli-expressed C102T variant is also monomeric and
structurally identical to the C102T variant from yeast (42),
but K72 is unmodified (32). This lack of modification does
not affect in vivo stability or function (43, 44), but it does
decrease the pK of the alkaline transition from ∼8.6 to ∼8.0
(32). This change in pK does not affect our results because
the pH used in the present studies, 6.0, is much lower than
the pK.
We previously studied the interaction between authentic
C102T iso-1-Cc and CcP (33). Under the same conditions
used here, the stoichiometry, enthalpy, and free energy of
complex formation are 0.97 ( 0.02, -6.2 ( 0.3 kcal mol-1,
and -8.1 ( 0.1 kcal mol-1
, respectively. Comparing these
values to those for the E. coli-expressed protein (Table 1)
shows that deleting the K72 methyl groups increases ∆H
by 3.6 ( 0.1 kcal mol-1
, but has no effect on ∆G.
Removing the K72 methyl groups makes the binding
surface of recombinant iso-1-Cc more like that of horse Cc,
but the thermodynamics of complex formation remains
distinct. Specifically, binding is exothermic for the reactions
of WT CcP with authentic C102T iso-1-Cc (33), recombinant
C102T iso-1-Cc (Table 1), and variants of recombinant
C102T iso-1-Cc (Tables 1 and 2), but binding is endothermic
for the reactions of CcP and its variants with horse Cc (11,
45). Therefore, removing the K72 methyl groups does not
convert the iso-1-Cc-CcP complex into the horse Cc-CcP
complex.
Stoichiometries. Although 2:1 Cc-CcP binding has been
detected by other techniques (20-23), and in ITC studies

424 Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 2, 2001 Pielak and Wangof the horse Cc-CcP complex (10), we find no evidence of
2:1 binding for the yeast Cc-CcP complex under the
conditions used here. We fit our ITC data to models with
both 1:1 and 2:1 stoichiometries. In all instances where
sufficient heat was evolved to allow analysis, the data were
well fit by a 1:1 model, and could not be fit by a 2:1 model.
The average stoichiometry for five trials involving the WT
proteins is 1.06 ( 0.04, and the average for all 53 titrations
is 1.02 ( 0.01, with a range of 0.88-1.16. Furthermore, if
a low-affinity site existed, disrupting an interaction at the
high-affinity site might be expected to increase the contribu￾tions from lower-affinity sites (10), but such contributions
are absent. Given the protein concentrations used here, we
could not detect a second binding site if |∆H| e ap￾proximately 0.5 kcal mol-1 or if ∆G g approximately -1.5
kcal mol-1
. However, our data provide no information about
possible kinetic roles for weak sites.
Other Binding Sites. Our goal is to analyze the crystallo￾graphically defined yeast Cc binding site on CcP. To ensure
that the high-affinity site on CcP does not include residues
from the other proposed sites discussed in the introductory
section, we studied the reactions between Cc and the D217A,
L182A, and D148A variants of CcP. As shown in Table 2,
the D217A and D148A variants do not affect binding. We
conclude that D217 and D148 are not part of the high-affinity
binding site. The L182A variant has a small effect on ∆G
and a larger effect on ∆H, but L182 is the closest of these
three residues to the crystallographically defined site. Taken
together, these observations suggest that our analysis will
not be affected by binding at these other sites. We now turn
to analysis of the crystallographically defined binding site
(Table 1).
Analysis of ∆G, ∆H, and ∆S. Complex formation is
exothermic in all instances where binding could be evaluated,
but |∆H| is greater than |∆G|, with one exception (the WT
Cc-E290A CcP complex). Therefore, complex formation
is mostly driven by a favorable entropy change. Given the
entropic penalty incurred by bringing two molecules together,
this favorable entropic contribution suggests an important
role for solvent reorganization.
We could not determine ∆G values for three of the 16
protein combinations shown in Table 1 (K87A Cc-E290A
CcP, K72A Cc-D34A CcP, and A81G Cc-E290A CcP)
because ∆H approaches zero (Figure 2C). When ∆H is near
zero, weak binding cannot be differentiated from strong
entropy-driven binding. We assume that binding is weak for
these three complexes because other protein combinations
harboring at least one of these variants yield interpretable
ITC data. The three instances all involve the change of at
least one charged residue, consistent with the idea that
electrostatic interactions are important for stabilizing the
complex.
Analysis of ∆∆G, ∆∆H, and ∆∆S. As shown by the data
in Table 1, nearly all the targeted residues stabilize the
complex. From this observation, we conclude that the high￾affinity site includes the crystallographically defined site, a
conclusion consistent with all studies of complex formation
between Cc and CcP (6-17, 46-48).
The data in Table 1 also provide more specific information
about the contribution of charged and nonpolar residues
located at the interface. Changing a charged residue to alanine
causes a constant and destabilizing change in ∆H, but the
change in ∆G depends on the location of the residue. In seven
of the eight examples in which one charged residue is
changed to alanine, ∆H increases by an average of 1.8 kcal
mol-1 with a standard deviation of only (0.3 kcal mol-1
.
This sign of ∆∆H suggests that complementary electrostatic
interactions impart enthalpic stabilization. The constant value
of ∆∆H is more difficult to explain, but this finding suggests
that individual charge-charge interactions contribute equally
to ∆H. The situation is completely different for ∆∆G, which
ranges from 2.1 to -0.9 kcal mol-1
. The large range shows
that the entropic contribution depends on the location of the
substituted residue.
The data for formation of the WT Cc-E290A CcP
complex are the exception to the above observation about
∆H. For this pair, ∆H decreases by 3.2 ( 0.7 kcal mol-1
compared to that of the WT pair. The residue following E290
in CcP is D291. We speculate that changing E290 to alanine
allows D291 to form a new, enthalpically stabilizing interac￾tion with a positively charged residue on Cc. This new
interaction would be expected to disrupt the alignment or
the solvation of the two proteins. Such a disruption would
be expected to decrease the stability of the complex, as is
observed. As discussed in the section about coupling
energies, mutation-induced rearrangements appear to be
present in several of the complexes, especially those involv￾ing the E290A variant.
Burying nonpolar residues at the interface also stabilizes
the complex, but for these residues, there is a uniform
contribution to ∆S. Table 1 shows data for three complexes
where one, two, or three methyl groups have been removed
but the charge on the complex is held constant (WT Cc￾V197A CcP, A81G Cc-WT CcP, and A81G Cc-V197A
CcP). For these complexes, both ∆∆H and ∆∆G are
constant, 0.3 ( 0.1 and 2.0 ( 0.1 kcal mol-1
, respectively,
but ∆∆H is nearly zero. These results are consistent with
what is known about the hydrophobic effect (49); ∆H is
nearly zero for transferring a nonpolar group from water to
a nonpolar liquid at room temperature, while the free energy
of transfer is unfavorable. Like the model studies, burial of
nonpolar groups stabilizes the complex by decreasing the
entropy of complex formation.
In summary, both electrostatic and nonpolar residues are
important for stabilizing the complex. However, it is not
possible to state which type of interaction is more important
because the effect of changing charged residues depends on
the location of the charge.
Coupling Energies. Nine interprotein interactions (Figure
1) were quantified by using double-mutant cycles (27-30).
In this approach, the side chains of both residues are
truncated and the thermodynamics of the interactions between
all four protein pairs is determined. Equation 1 gives the
coupling free energy, ∆∆Gc, and the coupling enthalpy,
∆∆Hc. The entropic component, -T∆∆Sc, is evaluated from
∆∆Hc and ∆∆Gc by using the Gibbs equation. The results
are shown in Table 3.
Provided that the assumptions inherent in this analysis are
valid, a negative coupling energy suggests that the interaction
stabilizes the complex, while a positive value suggests
destabilization. Comparing coupling energies to the crystal
structure of the complex then reveals relationships between
energetics and structure. Such analyses have provided
Mutational Analysis of a Protein-Protein Complex Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 2, 2001 425valuable information about protein complexes (28-30), but
it is important consider the assumptions, which are discussed
below.
(1) The Structure of the IndiVidual Proteins Does Not
Change upon Complex Formation. If a structural change
occurs, then the coupling energies contain contributions from
both the structural change and binding. This complication
is probably not important for the Cc-CcP complex because,
except for a few surface side chains, the structures of Cc
and CcP in the complex are the same as the structures of
the individual proteins (25).
(2) The Amino Acid Substitutions Do Not Alter the
Structure of the IndiVidual Proteins. This assumption should
be valid because the substitutions are on the protein surface.
That is, the substituted side chains interact more with the
solvent than with the protein interior.
(3) The Model Used To Fit the ITC Data Reflects the
Equilibrium Mechanism of Complex Formation. This as￾sumption is important for interpreting ∆∆Gc and -T∆∆Sc
(interpreting ∆∆Hc is model-independent because ∆H is the
difference between the horizontal baselines in Figure 2B).
The fact that the data can only be fit by a 1:1 model (Figure
2) suggests that our simple binding model is appropriate. It
must be borne in mind, however, that the calorimetric
enthalpy for the WT pair does not equal the van’t Hoff
enthalpy (33), an observation also made for other reactions
(50). These differences suggest the model used to determine
the van’t Hoff enthalpy is inappropriate, but the source of
the difference is unknown (51). For the purposes of this
paper, we assume that the simple model is correct.
(4) The Crystal Structure of the Complex Is the Same as
Its Solution Structure. Although this assumption can only
be completely tested by determining both structures, an
indication of its validity comes from comparing ∆∆Gc to
the distance between the two residues. In several studies,
residues more than 8 Å apart do not exhibit significant ∆∆Gc
values (28-30). A second indication comes from comparing
the structure to the results of solution-based cross-linking
studies. The observation that interprotein interactions present
in the crystal are also present in cross-linked areas supports
the assumption of structural identity. The results from cross￾linking the horse Cc-CcP complex are consistent with its
crystal structure (7, 8).
(5) The Amino Acid Changes Do Not Induce a Rearrange￾ment of the Structure or SolVation of the Complex. There is
no easy way to define structural changes short of structural
analysis, but comparing ∆∆Gc to the distance between the
residues provides confidence. We have attempted to avoid
structural changes by substituting large residues with small
residues so as not to increase steric bulk. Changes in
hydrophobic solvation are also difficult to prove, but because
they are often accompanied by enthalpy-entropy compensa￾tion (52), the observation that |∆∆Hc| is much greater than
|∆∆Gc| provides an indication (29). Changes in the solvation
of charged groups can also complicate interpretation if the
substitutions affect complex-induced changes in pK (53, 54).
Such effects cannot be ruled out because we studied complex
formation at a single pH.
Additional CaVeats. Interpretation can be difficult even
when the above assumptions seem valid. For instance, Pons
et al. (30) showed that interpreting ∆∆Gc for the interaction
between oppositely charged residues separated by less than
8 Å in terms of electrostatics is confounded by the fact that
nonpolar interactions are also disrupted by changing a large
charged side chain to a small uncharged side chain. Fur￾thermore, Lockless and Ranganathan have observed evolu￾tionarily conserved coupling between residues separated by
more than8Å(55). Finally, Mark and van Gunsteren have
warned against over interpreting ∆∆Gc and ∆∆Sc because
decomposition of ∆∆Gc in terms of specific interactions is
not possible (56), but this idea is controversial (29, 57, 58).
With these issues in mind, we turn to the analysis of the
coupling energies (Table 3).
K87-D34. ∆∆Gc for this interaction is indistinguishable
from zero, despite a significant and stabilizing ∆∆Hc. In
studies of the barnase-barstar complex, the observation of
negative ∆∆Hc values for residues more than 8 Å apart
despite the fact that ∆∆Gc is near zero was taken as evidence
for local solvation changes accompanied by enthalpy￾entropy compensation (29). Taken at face value, these
observations suggest that the side chains must be separated
by more than 8 Å. However, inspection of the structures
shows that they are separated by 3.8 Å in the yeast Cc
complex (Figure 1) and by 5.3 Å in the horse Cc complex.
These observations suggest either that the crystal structure
and the solution structure of the complex are different or
that a rearrangement has occurred in one or more of the
variant-containing complexes. Since an interaction between
K87 and D34 is suggested in many other studies (2, 6-8,
19, 20, 25), a rearrangement seems more likely because
nearby residues (K86 on Cc and D33 and E35 on CcP) could
replace the K87-D34 interaction.
K87-V197. ∆∆Gc for the K87-V197 pair is -1.5 ( 0.7
kcal mol-1
, suggesting that this interaction stabilizes the
complex. However, inspection of the structures shows that
the side chain atoms on these residues are separated by more
than 16.7 Å. These results suggest either that the solution
and crystals structures differ, that the residues are involved
in a long-range interaction, or that at least one of the amino
acid substitutions causes a rearrangement. Unfortunately,
there is no way to decide between these alternatives.
K87-E290. ∆∆Gc could not be calculated because ∆G
for the K87A Cc-E290A CcP variant cannot be determined
(Table 1). If we assume that ∆G is greater than or equal to
the estimated detection limit (-1.5 kcal mol-1
), ∆∆Gc would
be at least -0.5 kcal mol-1
. In the crystal structures, the
side chains are separated by more than 16.7 Å. These
observations suggest that the interaction is unimportant
because the residues are far apart, but analysis of ∆∆Hc
provides additional insight. The positive value of ∆∆Hc (3.6

determined because one of the parameters is missing (see Table 1).
426 Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 2, 2001 Pielak and Wang( 0.5 kcal mol-1
) suggests that the interaction is enthalpically
destabilizing. One would expect that interactions between
oppositely charged residues would be enthalpically stabilizing
even at distances of more than8Å(29). We conclude that
at least one of the substitutions causes a rearrangement. A
rearrangement is consistent with the presence of other nearby
charged residues (K86 on Cc and E291 on CcP).
K72-D34. ∆∆Hc is negative, but ∆∆Gc could not be
calculated because ∆G for one complex could not be
determined (Table 1). If it is assumed that ∆G is greater
than or equal to the detection limit, ∆∆Gc would be g7.2
kcal mol-1, an extremely large and positive value. In both
crystal structures, the atoms on these residues are separated
by more than 16.9 Å. These observations suggest either that
the crystal and solution structures differ and the K72-D34
interaction destabilizes the complex or that at least one of
the amino acid substitutions causes a rearrangement. A
rearrangement seems more likely because, even if the
structures differ, a lysine-aspartate interaction would be
expected to stabilize the complex. A third explanation, that
salt bridges impart specificity, not stability, is also reasonable,
but a rearrangement seems more likely because of the local
availability of other charged residues (K73 on Cc and D33
and E35 on CcP).
K72-V197. For this pair, all the coupling energies are
indistinguishable from zero. The distance between the nearest
γ-carbon on V197 and the side chain nitrogen atom of L72
is 5.2 Å in the yeast Cc complex. The simplest explanation
is that the K72-V197 interaction is not important for
complex formation.
K72-E290. This residue pair gives the most negative
measured ∆∆Gc (-5.4 ( 0.4 kcal mol-1
). The shortest
distance between the side chain nitrogen atom of K72 and
the nearest side chain oxygen atom of E290 is 10.3 Å in the
yeast Cc complex and 3.2 Å in the horse complex. The
simplest explanation is that K72 and E290 form a stabilizing
interaction because the orientation of the K72 side chain in
the yeast Cc complex in solution is slightly different from
its orientation in the crystal. As for the K87-E290 interac￾tion, ∆∆Hc is large and positive, which is unexpected for
an interaction between complementary charged residues. We
conclude that a rearrangement has occurred because of the
other charged residues in the vicinity of both K72 and E290.
A81-D34. ∆∆Gc is slightly stabilizing, and atoms on these
residues are separated by more than 16.7 Å in both structures.
We conclude that the interaction between A81 and D34 is
not important.
A81-V197. This interaction involves two uncharged
residues. ∆∆Gc is -1.9 ( 0.7 kcal mol-1
, and all the
stabilization arises from ∆∆Sc. In the yeast Cc complex, the
â-carbon of A81 is 4.4 Å from the nearest γ-carbon of V197
(the distance between the closest γ-carbon of I81 of horse
Cc and the nearest γ-carbon of V197 is 7.4 Å). A large
entropic contribution and a small enthalpic contribution are
exactly what is expected from the hydrophobic effect (49).
We conclude that the interaction stabilizes the complex by
the mutual and specific burial of nonpolar surface.
A81-E290. ∆∆Gc for this pair could not be calculated
because ∆G for the A81G Cc-E290A CcP complex could
not be determined (Table 1). If it is assumed that ∆G is
greater than or equal to the detection limit, ∆∆Gc would be
at least -1.5 kcal mol-1
. The closest approach between the
oxygen atoms on E290 and the â-carbons of A81 is more
than 9.4 Å. Given this distance, the large positive ∆∆Hc,
and our conclusions about other E290 interactions, it seems
likely that one of the amino acid substitutions causes a
rearrangement.
CONCLUSIONS
The high-affinity binding sites on Cc and CcP correspond
to the crystallographically defined interface between the two
proteins, and two alternative Cc binding sites on CcP do not
interfere with our study of the high-affinity site. Comparison
of the data for the variants that probe the high-affinity site
to the data for the recombinant WT complex reveals two
patterns. First, the enthalpic effect of changing a charged
residues is constant and destabilizing, but the entropic effect
depends on the location of the substitution. The one exception
suggests that some of the substitutions change the structure
or the solvation of the complex. Second, changing nonpolar
residues imparts an inconsequential enthalpy change and a
larger destabilizing entropy change, as is expected from
model studies of the hydrophobic effect. Coupling energies
were determined for nine residue pairs. For seven pairs, the
data are most consistent with mutation-induced rearrange￾ments of the complex caused by the availability of other
charged residues close to the sites of the amino acid
substitutions.
