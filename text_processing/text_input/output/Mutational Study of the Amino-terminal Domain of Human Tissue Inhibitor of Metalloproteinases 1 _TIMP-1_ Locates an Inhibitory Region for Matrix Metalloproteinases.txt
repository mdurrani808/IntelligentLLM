A bacterial expression system for the inhibitory N￾terminal domain of human tissue inhibitor of metallo￾proteinases 1 (N-TIMP-1) (Huang, W., Suzuki, K., Nagase,
H., Arumugam, S., Van Doren, S. R., and Brew, K. (1996)
FEBS Lett. 384, 155–161) has been used to produce 20
single- and double-site mutants that probe the roles of
different residues in its inhibitory action on metallopro￾teinases. Mutations that produce the largest increases
in the Ki for a C-terminally truncated form of stromely￾sin 1, MMP-3(DC), but do not disturb the conformation
involve substitutions of residues that are located in a
ridge that is centered around the disulfide bond be￾tween Cys1 and Cys70. Specific residues that have a large
influence on activity include Cys1
, Thr2
, Met66, Val69,
and Cys70. Of the mutations introduced, the greatest
functional disturbances, reflected in Ki increases of 2–4
orders of magnitude, are generated by changes that dis￾rupt the Cys1
–Cys70 disulfide bond and by substitution
of Ala for Thr2
. Most mutations that perturb the inter￾action with MMP-3 have parallel effects on the affinity
of N-TIMP-1 for MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase) and
MMP-2 (gelatinase A). However, the Thr2 to Ala muta￾tion produces an inhibitor that is 17-fold more effective
against MMP-3 than MMP-1, suggesting that it is feasible
to engineer TIMP-1 variants that are more specifically
targeted to selected matrix metalloproteinases. The re￾active site identified by these studies is a structurally
constrained but elongated region of TIMP that can fit
the matrix metalloproteinase substrate-binding site.
Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)1 are the only
known protein inhibitors that are specific for the family of
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of endopeptidases
that are responsible for the breakdown of components of con￾nective tissue (1–3). Four paralogous TIMPs (TIMP-1, TIMP-2,
TIMP-3, and TIMP-4), which differ in cellular expression, reg￾ulation, and localization, have been identified in mammals and
birds (4–9). All four TIMPs consist of two domains, each sta￾bilized by three disulfide bonds (10). The N-terminal domain is
responsible for their inhibitory action against active MMPs,
and the C-terminal domain modulates the interaction of TIMPs
with pro-MMPs (11). TIMPs also have growth factor activity for
erythroid and other cells (12–14).
MMPs play critical roles in biological processes associated
with connective tissue turnover, and the balance between lev￾els of TIMPs and active MMPs is important in normal pro￾cesses such as tissue remodeling and wound healing. Imbal￾ances in the activities of TIMPs and MMPs are associated with
pathological conditions such as arthritis, tissue ulceration, and
tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Because of their biomedical
significance, the mechanisms by which TIMPs regulate the
activity of MMPs in vivo and in vitro have been the focus of
many previous studies. Aspects of the expression of TIMPs in
different tissues or cells and its regulation have been investi￾gated intensively (see Ref. 10 for a review) as well as the role of
TIMPs in modulating the activation of MMPs (15). However,
less progress has been made in determining the molecular
basis of the inhibitory mechanism of TIMP.
Previously, mutagenesis has been carried out in attempts to
identify key residues for the inhibitory activity of TIMP-2 (16).
Since there was no information available on the three-dimen￾sional structure of TIMP, the design of mutations was based on
chemical modification data (17) and sequence conservation.
The results suggested that the region between Cys3 and Cys13,
particularly His7 and Gln9
, of TIMP-1 is important for its
interaction with MMPs. However, because amino acid substi￾tutions at these sites increase Ki values by a factor of 3–7,
reflecting a loss of ,10% of the free energy of binding, they do
not appear to account for the high affinity binding of TIMPs
with MMPs.
The region of TIMP that is important for its inhibitory ac￾tivity has also been investigated using synthetic peptides and
antibodies to inhibit its interaction with interstitial collagen￾ase, MMP-1 (18). The results were interpreted as indicating
that the second “disulfide knot” (Cys13–Cys124 and Cys127–
Cys174) plays a major role in activity. However, low molecular
weight peptides generally have little structure in solution and
can potentially inhibit TIMP-1 action by nonspecific binding or
by acting as alternative substrates for the metalloproteinase.
Such mechanisms appear likely since peptides were required at
concentrations in the millimolar range to exert effects as com￾pared with nanomolar concentrations of TIMP-1. The reliabil￾ity of information obtained with antibodies is also suspect since
immunoglobulins are very large as compared with TIMP-1
(Mr 5 150,000 as compared with 25,000), and their binding can
impede the access of the metalloproteinase to a large surface
area around their epitope on TIMP.

multidimensional NMR (19). This shows that N-TIMP-2 has a
fold similar to that of the OB-fold family of oligonucleotide/
oligosaccharide-binding proteins (see Fig. 1) and gives a basis
for designing and interpreting the results of structure-function
relationships in N-TIMP-1. With the goal of studying structure￾function relationships of TIMP, we have developed a bacterial
expression system for producing high yields of recombinant
human N-TIMP-1 that has been characterized as having a fully
native fold by CD spectroscopy and two-dimensional NMR (20).
This system is convenient for designed mutagenesis studies to
probe structure-function relationships and allows appropriate
physical characterization of the structural state of variants. We
describe here 20 mutants of N-TIMP-1 that have been ex￾pressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, refolded suc￾cessfully in vitro, and characterized with respect to activity and
CD spectra. Their functional properties emphasize the impor￾tance of a region that includes Met66–Cys70 and Cys1
-Thr2 for
TIMP inhibitory activity. Substitution of Thr2 differentially
influences the activity of TIMP-1 for binding to MMP-1, MMP-2
(gelatinase A), and MMP-3 (stromelysin 1), suggesting that it
may be possible to engineer TIMPs that are selective inhibitors
of MMPs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Materials—Ultima DNA polymerase with proofreading function was
purchased from Perkin-Elmer. Wizard™ PCR Preps purification kits
were purchased from Promega. Other reagents, separation media, and
kits were from the same sources as described in a previous work (20).
Dr. R. Werner (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,
University of Miami School of Medicine) provided synthetic oligonucleo￾tides. MMP-1 and MMP-2 were isolated as zymogens as described
previously (21, 22). C-terminally truncated pro-MMP-3(DC) was ex￾pressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, from which it was extracted,
folded, and purified.2 Pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-3(DC) were activated
with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate and pro-MMP-1 with MMP-3 in
the presence of 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (21). The MMP-3 used
for pro-MMP-1 activation was removed by anti-MMP-3 affinity chroma￾tography (23).
Construction and Expression of N-TIMP-1 Mutants—Mutations were
introduced using the polymerase chain reaction megaprimer method
(24) with the pET3a-N-TIMP-1 expression vector as the template (20).
The amplification to generate the megaprimer was performed in each
case with the synthetic T7 promoter primer or the T7 terminator primer
together with an appropriate mutagenic primer. Megaprimers were
purified using the Wizard™ PCR Preps purification kit and used in a
second amplification with the cognate T7-based primer. After purifica￾tion by agarose gel electrophoresis, the final amplification product was
digested with BamHI and NdeI, and the product was cloned into pET3a
as described for N-TIMP-1. The coding sequences of all mutants were
checked by DNA sequencing of the expression vector. N-TIMP-1 mu￾tants were expressed as inclusion bodies and extracted, folded, and
purified as described previously (20).
Kinetic Studies—The synthetic fluorogenic substrates (7-methoxy￾coumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Val-Glu-norvalinyl-Trp-Arg￾Lys-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-NH2 (kindly provided by Dr. G. B. Fields, Uni￾versity of Minnesota) for MMP-3 (25) and (7-methoxycoumarin-4-
yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-N-3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminoprop￾ylAla-Arg-NH2 (Bachem Bioscience Inc., King of Prussia, PA) for
MMP-1 and MMP-2 (26) were used to assay TIMP-1 activity as de￾scribed previously (20). The inhibition of each of the above MMPs by
N-TIMP-1 and its mutants was assayed by preincubating MMP (0.1–1
nM) and TIMP (at various concentrations) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
containing 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.02% Brij 35 at 37 °C for 1 h.
The time required for equilibration was determined by following the
progress of inhibition after mixing MMPs and TIMP at similar concen￾trations to those used in the assay. An aliquot (60 ml) of substrate (15
mM) was then added to 540 ml of preincubated MMP/TIMP mixture, and
activity was determined at 37 °C by following product release with time.
Inhibited rates were measured from the initial 10 min of the reaction
profile where product release was linear with time. Ki values were
calculated using a treatment of data for slow tight-binding inhibitors
(27) or, in some cases, by a standard treatment for reversible lower
affinity inhibitors.
CD Spectroscopy—Near- and far-UV CD spectra of N-TIMP-1 and its
mutants were determined with a Jasco J-710/720 spectropolarimeter as
described previously (20). Near-UV CD spectra (250–320 nm) were
determined using a cell with a 1-cm path length, and far-UV spectra
(200–250 nm) were determined using a cell with a 0.1-cm path length.
Proteins were dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 M
NaCl.
RESULTS
Rationale for the Design of N-TIMP-1 Mutants—Our strat￾egy has been to probe regions of TIMP-1 that have been impli￾cated in its activity by chemical modification studies and by
analogy with other OB-fold proteins that share structural sim￾ilarities to N-TIMP-2. Trace labeling studies3 have indicated
that groups of residues in the second disulfide loop between
Cys13 and Cys70 are perturbed in reactivity toward acetic an￾hydride on binding to MMP-3. To investigate this region, a
series of residues in this region (residues 16, 18, 22, 35, 38, 42,
45, 46, and 66) were mutated to Ala or to amino acids with
similar polarity. Tyr35 and Tyr38 were chosen for replacement
because, in the low resolution solution structure of TIMP-2,
their equivalents are components of a surface loop that is
adjacent to the binding site in other OB-fold proteins. Addi￾tional evidence that influenced our experimental design was
the observation that human neutrophil elastase inactivates
TIMP-1 by cleaving the Val69–Cys70 peptide bond, whereas this
bond is protected and TIMP-1 activity is preserved by forma￾tion of the TIMPzMMP-3 complex.4 These results and the per￾turbed Ki
, observed in the M66A mutant, prompted us to probe
residues that are close to this region in covalent structure and
in the solution NMR structure. This led us to construct mu￾tants with substitutions of Val69, Cys70, Cys1
, Thr2
, and Pro5
.
The locations of the corresponding residues in N-TIMP-2 are
shown in Fig. 1.
Preparation of N-TIMP-1 Mutants—The polymerase chain
reaction method introduced some unwanted mutations adja￾cent to the sequence derived from the mutagenic primer, which

Inhibitory Site of TIMP-1 22087
 by guest on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from can be attributed to the terminal transferase activity of Taq
DNA polymerase. These were minimized by the use of a ther￾mostable polymerase with proofreading activity (Ultima DNA
polymerase) and by designing primers so that all substitutions
at the susceptible site are silent. A few additional mutations
were found outside the primer presumably because of errors
made by the polymerase, which generated the double mutants
C1S/F12Y, M45A/F49V, N14S/V69T, and V69A/A103V.
Wild-type and mutant forms of N-TIMP-1 were expressed in
E. coli, solubilized, partially purified, and folded in vitro as
described above. The final purification was carried out by cat￾ion-exchange chromatography with CM52. The yields ranged
from 5 to 20 mg of purified protein/liter of bacterial culture,
with the exception of the mutant Y38A, for which the yield was
;2 mg/liter of culture. Concentrations of the mutant proteins
were calculated from the absorbance of solutions at 280 nm
using extinction coefficients calculated from their contents of
tryptophan, tyrosine, and cystine (28).
Activity Studies—Initially, all mutants were assayed for
their activities as inhibitors of a C-terminally truncated form of
MMP-3 (MMP-3(DC)). The assay was developed to provide a
facile means of comparing different mutants. In this assay,
preincubation at 37 °C is performed for 1 h to ensure that the
binding of inhibitor and metalloproteinase reaches equilib￾rium, but the addition of substrate results in a 10% dilution of
the two proteins. Re-equilibration after this dilution will be
slow and is expected to have little effect on the results. Since
the substrate concentrations are very low relative to the Km
(1.5 mM compared with 25 mM), any correction of the apparent Ki
determined directly from the kinetic study for competition by
substrate is expected to be negligible. Table I lists the apparent
Ki values mostly calculated using the treatment for tight-bind￾ing inhibitors (27), except with mutants for which very large
reductions in affinity became apparent; the data for the latter
group were analyzed as low affinity reversible inhibitors. Sub￾stitutions of Asp16, Val18, and Lys22 produced only minor
changes in affinity compared with the wild type. Substitutions
of the methionines at positions 42 (M42T) and 45 (M45A/F49V)
and of the tyrosines at positions 35 (Y35A) and 38 (Y38F)
produced significant but not major (4–6-fold) reductions in
affinity, whereas substitution of Ala for Met66 had a larger
effect (14-fold loss of binding). Mutations at positions 2 (T2A)
and 38 (Y38A) reduced the affinity for MMP-3(DC) by .2 or￾ders of magnitude. Substitutions of either of the two disulfide￾bonded cysteines, Cys1 and Cys70, produced a decrease of .3
orders of magnitude in the affinity for MMP-3(DC). To put
these mutations into perspective in relation to the proportion of
molecular contacts between the inhibitor and protease affected
by the substitution, the change in the Gibbs free energy change
for the protein-protein interaction produced by the mutation
(DDG) was calculated for each mutation using the relationship
DG 5 2RT ln(Ki(wild-type)/Ki(mutant)); these values are shown in
Fig. 2. C70S, C1S/F12Y, T2A, and Y38A lost 3–4 kcal/mol of
their free energy of interaction with MMP-3(DC).
Mutants with moderate to large decreases in affinity toward
MMP-3(DC) were selected for further investigation with
MMP-1 and MMP-2 (Table II). Interestingly, whereas most
mutations had parallel effects on the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for
the three proteinases, T2A was more selective than other mu￾tations, showing in particular a 17-fold higher affinity for
MMP-3(DC) as compared with MMP-1 (Fig. 3).
CD Spectroscopy—The mutants that displayed major
changes in Ki were further characterized by UV CD spectros￾copy to see if the loss of activity was a direct result of the
sequence change or the indirect consequence of a global change
in secondary or tertiary structure in N-TIMP-1. The only fea￾ture of the far-UV CD spectrum of N-TIMP-1 is a trough with
a minimum at 208 nm (20), which is not characteristic of any
known type of secondary structure. Consequently, changes in
the CD spectrum in this wavelength range do not provide
useful information about the structural effects of mutations. In
contrast, N-TIMP-1 has a complex near-UV CD spectrum with
multiple peaks that reflect the fixed environments of aromatic
side chains and disulfide bonds in the native structure. The
spectrum of this region in N-TIMP-1 is therefore a preferable
indicator of changes in tertiary structure introduced by muta￾tions and can help to identify mutants with partially folded
conformations (29). The near-UV CD spectra of mutants that
show large changes in functional properties are shown in Fig.
4. Although the mutations affected the magnitude of the larg￾est peak centered at 290 nm, the multiple peaks and inflections
between 255 and 285 nm were preserved in most of the mu￾tants, including M66A/C70F, which had the lowest activity of
all of the mutants constructed in this study. In contrast, the
T2A mutant showed some signs of being structurally per￾turbed, whereas Y38A and the C1S/F12A double mutant lost
much of the detail in their CD spectra. It seems likely that
some of the loss of activity in these variants results from a loss
of fixed tertiary structure. Tyr38, in particular, is an improba￾ble candidate as a component of the interaction site because
substitution with phenylalanine has little effect on activity
(Table I).

22088 Inhibitory Site of TIMP-1
 by guest on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from DISCUSSION
In the absence of a three-dimensional structure for the com￾plex of a TIMP with a MMP, site-directed mutagenesis provides
an effective approach for investigating the roles of individual
residues in the inhibitory action of TIMP-1. Mutation of a
series of sites between Cys13 and Met45 produced relatively
small reductions in affinity for MMP-3. As discussed above, the
Y38A variant, which has a greatly reduced affinity for MMP￾3(DC), also has a disturbed tertiary structure that may account
for the reduction in activity. The fact that substitution with
Phe at this site has little effect on inhibitory activity supports
this hypothesis. In the solution structure of TIMP-2, the side
chain of the residue corresponding to Tyr38 of TIMP-1 is par￾tially buried (Fig. 1). Substitution of a large hydrophobic side
chain with a small methyl group (Y38A) will introduce a cavity
in the interior of the protein and destabilize the structure. The
low yield of this protein obtained after folding is consistent with
the effect of the mutation on folding and stability.
Substitution of Ala for Met66 close to the C-terminal section
of the same disulfide loop produced a 14-fold increase in Ki
.
Evidence for the location of the interaction site in TIMP-1
derived from a “footprinting” experiment correlates well with
this observation. TIMP-1 loses its inhibitory function upon
incubation with human neutrophil elastase as a result of cleav￾age of the peptide bond between Val69 and Cys70.
4 Cleavage of
this peptide bond by neutrophil elastase and the loss of TIMP
activity are prevented when TIMP-1 is preincubated with
MMP-3. Although this does not prove that Val69 and Cys70 are
in direct contact with MMP-3, it does suggest that they are
sufficiently close for MMP-3 to block access of the peptide bond
by MMP-3.4 In the three-dimensional structure of TIMP-2, two
sections of polypeptide chain, from Met66 to Cys70 and from
Cys1 to Pro5
, are connected by a Cys1
–Cys70 disulfide bridge
and form a continuous surface ridge (19). Because the disulfide

 by guest on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from bond arrangements are conserved in all known TIMPs, a sim￾ilar structure must also be present in TIMP-1. The mutational
and protection results discussed above suggest that this ridge
forms part of the binding site. The sequence of this region is
well conserved in different TIMPs; besides the conserved dis￾ulfide-bonded cysteines (Cys1 and Cys70 of TIMP-1), the only
amino acids found at the position corresponding to Val69 of
TIMP-1 are Val and Leu, and only Thr and Ser are found at
position 2. Proline is conserved as residue 5 throughout the
TIMP family. To probe the roles of these conserved residues,
the effects of substitutions of Cys1
, Thr2
, Pro5
, Val69, and Cys70
were investigated. Replacement of either cysteine, which pre￾vents the formation of the disulfide bond between these resi￾dues, produces a loss of affinity of .3 orders of magnitude. The
near-UV spectra of the disulfide bond mutants are qualita￾tively different from but similar in magnitude to those of the
wild-type protein. The change in CD spectrum may be partly
attributable to the loss of the disulfide bond since disulfides
contribute to the spectrum in this wavelength range (29), but
some localized change in structure may also be introduced by
the mutation. However, the change in CD spectrum is small
compared with that of the misfolded Y38A mutant, suggesting
that the disulfide bond between Cys1 and Cys70 is not essential
for the overall fold of N-TIMP-1; mutants lacking this bond
probably have structures that are slightly distorted versions of
the wild-type structure. Treatment with Ellman’s reagent in￾dicates that no free thiol groups are present in the folded
disulfide bond mutants (data not shown), so the remaining
cysteinyl residue is present as a mixed disulfide with mercap￾toethanol or has become oxidized during the purification proc￾ess. Various substitutions of Val69 produce moderate changes
in affinity, but replacing the totally conserved Pro5 with Ala
had little effect. A striking functional change arose from sub￾stitution of Ala for Thr2
, which reduced the affinity for MMP-3
by 2 orders of magnitude. Since this residue is conserved as Thr
or Ser in different TIMPs, it is possible that the hydroxyl group
is important for the formation of complexes between N-TIMP-1
and MMP-3(DC). The CD spectrum suggests that substitution
with Ala perturbs the tertiary structure. However, the effects
of this substitution on TIMP-1 specificity (see below) support
the view that residue 2 plays a key role in TIMP action.
There are indications that different TIMPs vary quantita￾tively in inhibitory activity toward different MMPs (11, 30). We
were therefore interested to determine if mutations that affect
the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for MMP-3(DC) have similar effects on
its interactions with other metalloproteinases. Table II shows
that most substitutions have approximately parallel effects on
the affinity for MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3 even when the Ki
values are increased by .3 orders of magnitude, with the
exceptions of T2A and, to a much lesser extent, V69A/A103V.
The former has a particularly striking 17-fold discriminatory
inhibitory action on MMP-3 over MMP-1 (see Fig. 3) as well as
a 7-fold higher affinity for MMP-2 relative to MMP-1. The
structural basis of this selectivity is currently unclear; a simple
explanation could be that the interaction with MMP-1 involves
a hydrogen bond between the Thr2 hydroxyl group and the
enzyme that is less important in binding to MMP-2 and
MMP-3. However, this result lends support to the proposal that
a region that includes residues 66–70 and residues 1 and 2,
linked by the Cys1
–Cys70 disulfide bond (TIMP-1 numbering),
forms part of the inhibition site in TIMP. Bodden et al. (31)
have previously suggested that this disulfide bond is particu￾larly important for structure and/or activity in TIMP. Figs. 1
and 5 show that the disulfide bond links the N-terminal region
and residues 66–70 to form a distinct ridge on the surface of the
TIMP-2 solution structure.
Analyses by Jones and Thornton (32) show that, in high
affinity heterologous protein-protein interactions that are com￾parable in nature and strength to the TIMP-MMP interaction,
a large surface area of each component is buried on complex
formation (785 6 75 Å2 for other protease-inhibitor systems).
The interaction site defined by our current results has a surface
area of ,200 Å2
, smaller than expected for an interaction with
a nanomolar dissociation constant. Although the extended
ridge defined by our studies represents a suitable structure for
fitting the MMP substrate-binding groove and appears to be a
major component of the interaction site, additional residues in
N-TIMP-1, adjacent to this region, are likely to contribute to
the interaction with MMPs. A contribution to binding by a
larger part of the N terminus is consistent with the previously
published observation (16) that substitutions of His7 and Gln9
in TIMP-1 produce moderate 2–6-fold reductions in the Ki for
MMP-7 (matrilysin). Our results also indicate that similar
modest reductions in affinity are produced by substitutions of
Tyr35, Tyr38, Met42, and Met45.
Amino-terminal disulfide-bonded cysteines are uncommon in
proteins. The bond between Cys1 and Cys70 appears to be
functionally significant as a linker between the two key sec￾tions of the reactive site. Additional residues N-terminal to
Cys1 could potentially disrupt the substrate mimetic character
of this region. Cys1 and Cys3 together with their associated
disulfide links will also constrain the flexibility of the N-termi￾nal region of TIMP. Structural rigidity in the reactive site may

N-TIMP-1 residues that influence activity. Residues shown in red,

the catalytic action of MMPs and preventing proteolysis of the
inhibitor by its target. The properties of the T2A mutant pro￾vide an initial indication that residue 2 of TIMP is a key to
specificity and that TIMP-1 variants that are specifically tar￾geted to individual MMPs can be potentially constructed. Such
proteins could be used therapeutically against pathological pro￾cesses (such as tumor cell metastasis) that are associated with
the activity of specific MMPs. Mutational studies are in pro￾gress to further investigate this possibility.
