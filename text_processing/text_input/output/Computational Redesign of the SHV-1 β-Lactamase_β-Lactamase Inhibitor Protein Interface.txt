β-lactamases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of β-lactam
antibiotics. β-lactamase/β-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) complexes
are emerging as a well characterized experimental model system for
studying protein–protein interactions. BLIP is a 165 amino acid protein that
inhibits several class A β-lactamases with a wide range of affinities:
picomolar affinity for K1; nanomolar affinity for TEM-1, SME-1, and BlaI; but
only micromolar affinity for SHV-1 β-lactamase. The large differences in
affinity coupled with the availability of extensive mutagenesis data and
high-resolution crystal structures for the TEM-1/BLIP and SHV-1/BLIP
complexes make them attractive systems for the further development of
computational design methodology. We used EGAD, a physics-based
computational design program, to redesign BLIP in an attempt to increase
affinity for SHV-1. Characterization of several of designs and point mutants
revealed that in all cases, the mutations stabilize the interface by 10- to 1000-
fold relative to wild type BLIP. The calculated changes in binding affinity for
the mutants were within a mean absolute error of 0.87 kcal/mol from the
experimental values, and comparison of the calculated and experimental
values for a set of 30 SHV-1/BLIP complexes yielded a correlation coefficient
of 0.77. Structures of the two complexes with the highest affinity, SHV-1/
BLIP (E73M) and SHV-1/BLIP (E73M, S130K, S146M), are presented at 1.7 Å
resolution. While the predicted structures have much in common with the
experimentally determined structures, they do not coincide perfectly; in
particular a salt bridge between SHV-1 D104 and BLIP K74 is observed in the
experimental structures, but not in the predicted design conformations. This
discrepancy highlights the difficulty of modeling salt bridge interactions
with a protein design algorithm that approximates side chains as discrete
rotamers. Nevertheless, while local structural features of the interface were
sometimes miscalculated, EGAD is globally successful in designing
complexes with increased affinity.

Introduction
SHV-type β-lactamases from Klebsiella pneumoniae
hydrolyze penicillins and cephalosporins, and are
largely responsible for bacterial resistance to these
antibiotics. Thus, new SHV-1 inhibitors are despe￾rately needed to combat resistance to β-lactam anti￾biotics in these Gram negative bacteria.1 β-Lactamase
inhibitor protein (BLIP) competitively inhibits sev￾eral class A β-lactamases, including SHV-1 and TEM￾1. SHV-1 shares 67% sequence identity with TEM-1,

the dissociation constant for the SHV-1/BLIP com￾plex is in the micromolar rather than the nanomolar
range as for the TEM-1/BLIP complex.2 Gaining a
quantitative understanding of the interactions under￾lying BLIP affinity and specificity for the β-lacta￾mases is an important step towards the development
of new potent inhibitors. Here, we use computational
protein design to study this interface, and to engineer
BLIP variants with increased affinity for SHV-1. The
TEM-1 β-lactamase/BLIP complex has been well
studied both experimentally and computationally.
These investigations include mutagenesis studies of
protein interface modularity,3,4 rational design expe￾riments,5 a protein–protein docking benchmark,6
electrostatics calculations to predict association rate
constants,3,4,7 and investigations of protein associa￾tion in polymer solutions.8 Notably, several alanine￾scanning mutagenesis studies were undertaken to
determine the specificity determinants for BLIP
association with TEM-1, SHV-1, SME-1 and BlaI β￾lactamases. Experimental dissociation constants have
been determined for more than 120 TEM-1/BLIP
mutant complexes, and over 25 SHV-1/BLIP mutant
complexes.2–5,9–14 High-resolution crystal structures
of both the TEM-1/BLIP and SHV-1/BLIP complexes
are available.12,15 This extensive collection of struc￾tural and experimental data is invaluable for inform￾ing the present computational design efforts.
In previous work, we conducted mutagenesis and
crystallographic studies of the SHV-1/BLIP complex
to define the underlying basis for the 1000-fold
difference in BLIP affinity for SHV-1 and TEM-1. β￾Lactamase residue 104 (Ambler residue numbering)
is one of eight amino acid differences between SHV￾1 and TEM-1 at the β-lactamase/BLIP interface.16
Mutating this residue from aspartate (the residue
identity in SHV-1) to glutamate (the residue identity
in TEM-1) results in a 1000-fold enhancement in the
affinity of BLIP for SHV-1.12 It was hypothesized
that the small increase in side chain volume from
Asp to Glu allowed improved formation of van der
Waals (vdW) contacts and salt bridge interactions
across the interface with BLIP, as seen in the TEM-1/
BLIP structure. In particular, a salt bridge between
TEM-1 E104 and BLIP K74 is absent from the
analogous SHV-1/BLIP structure (Fig. 1).
Given that β-lactamase position 104 is now esta￾blished as a major specificity determinant for the
free energy of association of BLIP with SHV-1 versus
TEM-1, we investigate here whether the opposing
side of the interface may be redesigned to compen￾sate for the reduced volume of D104 in SHV-1. Can
computational methods be used to suggest BLIP
mutations in the vicinity of D104 that increase
affinity for SHV-1? And further, if BLIP is rede￾signed to bind with high affinity to SHV-1, what
effect will this have on the affinity and specificity of
BLIP for TEM-1? The designed BLIP mutants
presented here bind SHV-1 with nanomolar affinity,
while wild type BLIP exhibits micromolar affinity
for SHV-1. Though the designed BLIP variant with
the highest affinity for SHV-1 retains a low nano￾molar Kdiss for TEM-1, several of the other designs
show a modest specificity reversal, in that they
associate with SHV-1 approximately five times more
tightly than they do with TEM-1.
Structures of the SHV-1/BLIP (E73M) and SHV-1/
BLIP (E73M, S130K, S146M) complexes at 1.7 Å
resolution were solved in order to help evaluate the
accuracy of the design predictions. Despite a good
correlation between the calculated and experimentally
determined effects of the design mutations, the crystal
structures were not in perfect agreement with the

Results
Computational interface redesign
The SHV-1/BLIP interface was redesigned with the
EGAD software library.17 This method requires a
fixed protein backbone, and optimizes the sequence
and rotamer conformation of the side chains accord￾ing to a physics-based energy function parameterized
on a large set of protein interface binding affinity
data.18,19 A two-state design process was implemen￾ted that compares the stabilities of the bound SHV-1/
BLIP complex to that of the free species. In this
algorithm, the bound and unbound states of the
complex are conformationally optimized for each
interface mutation, and the energy difference
between the states is calculated. The value of this
energy difference is maximized throughout the
design process. This differs from a typical design
run, which considers only the stability of the bound
complex, and does not perform side chain conforma￾tional optimizations following each mutation (see
Materials and Methods, and Fig. 2 for details). As the
two-state method is computationally expensive, it
was necessary to redesign smaller sections of the
interface separately to reduce processor time and to
improve convergence of the search algorithm. Reich￾mann et al. showed earlier that the TEM-1/BLIP
interface is divisible into energetically independent
modules or residue clusters.4 They demonstrated
experimentally that the changes in binding affinity
upon mutation (ΔΔGdiss, mut) are highly cooperative
for combinations of mutants within a module, and
are additive for combinations of mutations in
separate modules. The decomposability of the inter￾face suggests that individual clusters can potentially
be treated as separate design problems. Here, as a
preliminary evaluation of our design software on the
β-lactamase/BLIP interface, EGAD was used to
redesign the five interface clusters (C1–C5) described
by Reichmann et al.
4 that are given in Table 1. A later
publication from Reichmann et al. added a sixth
interface cluster, but this publication was not available
when the design work presented here was initiated.3
For each cluster, the amino acid identities compos￾ing the BLIP side of the interface were varied, while
the sequence of the β-lactamase remained fixed.
Residues in both proteins underwent conformational
optimization. Separate designs were conducted for
BLIP association with TEM-1 and with SHV-1. The
C1 cluster contains only a single BLIP residue, which
participates in four hydrogen bonding interactions
with SHV-1. This cluster was not redesigned, as this
interaction is highly important for interface affi￾nity.10 BLIP position E73 was added to the C2 cluster
as it is an important specificity determinant for SHV￾1 versus TEM-1 binding affinity, and is in the imme￾diate vicinity of β-lactamase position 104 (Fig. 1). An
additional cluster referred to as C2_Plus was created
by including BLIP residues S130 and S146 in the C2
cluster. These residues were also selected because of
proximity to position 104.
Fig. 2. The two-state optimization procedure used to redesign the SHV-1/BLIP interface.
Redesign of the SHV-1 BLIP Interface 1267Ten BLIP designs were generated for clusters C2–
C5 and C2_Plus, where each cluster was optimized
for association with either TEM-1 or SHV-1 (Table 2).
In three cases the design recapitulated the wild type
sequence. For the TEM-1/BLIP designs, the EGAD￾proposed BLIP mutations are conservative, and
yield little change in the calculated free energy of
association with TEM-1. As the wild type TEM-1/
BLIP complex has a Kd = 1.3 nM, the interface
residues may already be near optimal. Interestingly,
redesign of BLIP for association with SHV-1 also
yields conservative mutations, with the exception of
the C2 cluster. Both the C2 and C2_Plus designs
include several mutations predicted to increase affi￾nity for SHV-1 and decrease affinity for TEM-1.
These computational results coincide with the expe￾rimental observation that the C2 cluster (and, in
particular, β-lactamase residue 104) is a major
specificity determinant. Thus, the C2 cluster designs
were selected for experimental characterization.
Experimental determination of dissociation
constants
The values of the C2 and C2_Plus BLIP /SHV-1
dissociation constants are summarized in Table 3.
The C2 design yields an approximately tenfold
increase in affinity compared to wild type, while
the C2_Plus design results in an ∼100-fold augmen￾tation. Several point mutants and combinations of
design mutations were characterized in order to de￾fine the roles of the individual mutations. The
F142W, Y143F, and S146M proteins expressed
poorly, and therefore were not tested. The S130K
mutation stabilizes the SHV-1/BLIP complex by –
1.5 kcal/mol relative to wild type. Interestingly, the
E73M point mutant increases complex stability more
than either C2 design, resulting in a –3.5 kcal/mol
improvement. This implies that one or more of the
mutations included in the designs adversely affects
complex stability. Given this result, we considered
the effects of the other mutations in the E73M
context. The E73M/S130K double mutant has a
somewhat decreased affinity for SHV-1 compared to
E73M alone. The E73M/S146M double mutant also
results in little change in Kd from the E73M point
mutant, and both the E73M/Y143F and E73M/
F142W/Y143F variants have considerably higher Kd
values relative to BLIP E73M. Thus, the E73M point
mutation appears to drive the improved affinity of
the designed BLIP variants to SHV-1.
TEM-1/BLIP dissociation constants were deter￾mined for BLIP mutants that exhibit high SHV-1
affinity. In contrast to the results obtained with SHV￾1, all of the characterized variants decreased the
affinity of the TEM-1/BLIP complexes. The E73M
point mutant destabilizes the TEM-1/BLIP complex
the least (0.5 kcal/mol). This is consistent with the
computational design of BLIP for TEM-1, which
includes the E73L mutation, suggesting that a
hydrophobic residue at this position is desirable.
Although the remaining mutations provide little
additional stability to the SHV-1/BLIP complex,
they do contribute to complex specificity: the E73M/
S130K, E73M/S130K/S146M, and the C2 plus
designs associate with SHV-1 ∼5-fold more tightly
than they do with TEM-1.

when the six indicated outliers were excluded. The
error is increased to 1.9 kcal/mol, and R= 0.52 when
the outliers are included. The outlier points are
identical with those identified in our previous
work,12 and include the following mutant com￾plexes: SHV-1/BLIP (Y50A), SHV-1/BLIP (Y50A,
Y143A), SHV-1/BLIP (E73A, Y50A), SHV-1/BLIP
(W112A, Y143A), SHV (D104E)/BLIP, and SHV-1/
BLIP (F142A). It was suggested that the destabiliza￾tion of these complexes is overestimated because
many of these mutations involve large changes in
side chain volume (Y50A, W112A, F142A) and thus
may effect changes in backbone conformation. The
EGAD algorithm assumes a fixed backbone: there￾fore, mutations affecting backbone conformation are
not modeled accurately.
None of the designed complexes is considered to
be an outlier. The mean absolute error for the design
mutations alone is 0.9 kcal/mol, which is lower than
the error for the full data set. However, the stabilizing
effects of the two highest-affinity BLIP variants were
underestimated. The BLIP E73M mutation was
shown experimentally to stabilize the SHV-1/BLIP
complex by –3.5 kcal/mol relative to the wild type, in
comparison to a calculated value of –1.4 kcal/mol.
Similarly, the experimental and calculated values of
ΔΔGdiss, mut for BLIP (E73M, S130K, S146M) are -3.5
and -1.8 kcal/mol, respectively.
Determination of crystallographic structures for
mutant complexes
Structures were determined for the two most
stable SHV-1/BLIP complexes: E73M and E73M/
S130K/S146M, to 1.75 Å and 1.70 Å resolution,
respectively. The crystals used for the determination
contained the same symmetry, P63, and possess
nearly identical unit cell dimensions (see Table 4) as
the previous wild type structure; though the crystals
formed under slightly different conditions. There is
little to no change in backbone structure, with an α￾carbon RMSD to the wild type of 0.2 Å for both the
E73M complex and the triple mutant. The RMSD
between the wild type and mutant interface side
chains is 0.7 Å for both the E73M and E73M/S130K/
S146M complexes. However, unlike the native
structure, both mutant complexes include a salt
bridge between SHV-1 D104 and BLIP K74, like that
seen between TEM-1 E104 and BLIP K74 in the wild
type TEM-1/BLIP complex (Fig. 4). The E73M muta￾tion appears to remove an electrostatic clash with
D104, allowing the salt bridge to form. In the TEM-1/
BLIP complex, the longer E104 side chain is able to
avoid this clash, and form the E104/K74 salt bridge
in the presence of E73. This observation is consistent
with the proposal by Zhang and Palzkill, offered to

arising from alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies, while
others include up to five mutations. The designed
complexes and point mutants were both computationally
predicted and measured to increase the binding affinity of
the SHV/BLIP complex, and fall in the lower left quadrant
of the graph (red squares). For several complexes, the
destabilizing effects of mutation were overestimated by
our model; these are denoted as outliers and are shown as
open black diamonds.
Redesign of the SHV-1 BLIP Interface 1269explain the alanine-scanning mutagenesis results for
E73.2 The E73A mutation results in very little change
in Kd for the TEM-1/BLIP complex, while E73A
causes a –1.97 kcal/mol stabilization in the SHV-1/
BLIP complex. The E73M mutation is more stabiliz￾ing than E73A, perhaps because E73M is a more
conservative substitution with respect to side chain
volume. Additionally, a lower dielectric environ￾ment due to the methionine side chain may enhance
the affinity of the salt bridge.
Comparison of the predicted design conforma￾tions with the experimental structures provides an
explanation for the underestimated stabilizing
effects of E73M in the design calculations. The
computationally predicted conformations fail to
include the D104/K74 salt bridge, and thus neglect
this energetic contribution to the interface. In the
predicted structure of the triple mutant, D104 is seen
to point toward S130K (Fig. 4b), while in the
predicted structure of E73M, D104 retains the con￾formation seen in the wild type protein (Fig. 4a).
Additionally, the conformation of Y143 is incorrectly
placed in the triple mutant — the designed structure
predicts that Y143 will be pushed out of the interface
by the S146M mutation, while the experimental
structure shows that it remains in the native con￾formation. The conformations of the remaining side
chains are fairly well described by the calculated
structures. Comparison of the predicted and experi￾Table 4. Crystallographic data collection, refinement and

Discussion
The computational design protocol resulted in two
designs (C2 and C2_Plus) with increased SHV-1
affinity. The calculated changes in free energy of
association for the design mutations reproduce the
experimental values within an average error
b1 kcal/mol. The design algorithm was successful
in terms of these global measures, but closer scrutiny
by mutagenesis and structural characterization
revealed a significant flaw in the predicted structures
of the designs. A single mutation, E73M, is respon￾sible for most of the increase in stability. The crystal
structures show that this mutation facilitates the
formation of a salt bridge between D104 (SHV-1) and
K74 (BLIP), a feature that escaped the calculation
procedure. Why was this salt bridge overlooked?
And how can the calculation be improved to capture
this feature more accurately? The potential sources of
error and strategies for increasing the accuracy of the
design methodology are discussed below.
It is important to mention that the predicted values
of ΔΔGdiss, mut for the designs and design point
mutants span a range of 1.3 kcal/mol, close to the
observed error in our calculations. Thus, only an
approximate rank ordering of designs and point
mutations is expected. Several contributing factors
including inaccuracies in the energy function, the
fixed backbone assumption, the discrete rotamer
representation of side chains, and a reduced search
space that includes only a subset of the interface
residues might be responsible. The striking factor,
however, is the failure to identify the effect of the
E73M mutation on the formation of the D104/K74
salt bridge. Two reasons may contribute to the
incorrectly predicted conformation of D104/K74:
(1) inaccuracies in the energy function, causing the
stabilizing effects of the salt bridge to be under￾estimated relative to other interactions; (2) lack of
proper rotamer conformations to model salt bridge
formation. Importantly, when the crystallographic
side chain conformations of D104 and K74 are
included as part of the rotamer library, and the
SHV-1/BLIP E73M backbone is used as a template,
the salt bridge is predicted correctly by EGAD
rotamer optimization. Conversely, when the crystal￾lographic conformations are not included, or the
backbone template is taken from the wild type SHV￾1/BLIP structure (rather than from the mutant
complex) the salt bridge is not identified. The closest
pair of side chains from the rotamer library exhibits a
side chain RMSD of 0.5 Å to the experimental
conformation. The relative frequency of these rota￾mers within the PDB was calculated using Coot; the
K74 rotamer has a frequency of 3%, and the D104
rotamer a frequency of 21%.20 Neither of these rota￾mers is considered rare. While the crystallographic
side chain conformations are not conformationally
distinct enough from the rotameric conformations to
qualify as new rotamer entries within the library,
building the D104/K74 rotamer pair onto the wild
type SHV-1/BLIP complex backbone (used as the
template for the designs) further increases the RMSD
to 0.6 Å (Fig. 5a). This displacement increases the
distance between the K74 amide nitrogen and D104
oxygens, disfavoring the salt bridge. To further
assess how slight differences in backbone conforma￾tion impact the outcome of the design predictions,
the crystallographic rotamers from the E73M struc￾ture were built onto the wild type SHV-1/BLIP
backbone. This yields an RMSD of 0.3 Å when
compared with the crystallographic conformation of
the salt bridge (Fig. 5b). A deviation of 0.2 Å in the
backbone conformation between the wild type and
E73M structures brings the amide nitrogen of K74
and od2 oxygen of D104 closer together by 0.6 Å. As
such, a van der Waals (vdW) clash is introduced, and
the salt bridge is not identified correctly during
rotamer optimization. In a separate test, the D104/
K74 side chain pair on the wild type template was
optimized to minimize the RMSD between the wild
type conformation and the E73M crystal structure
conformation (Fig. 5b). This minimization was
conducted using the ICM software package, and
allowed both the Cα
–Cβ bond distance and planar
C–Cα
–Cβ bond angle to be varied, as well as the
torsional χ angles.21 The variation in bond distance
and planar bond angle was included to compensate
for the slight differences in backbone conformation.
This optimization resulted in a side chain pair on the
wild type template with an RMSD of 0.1 Å to the
E73M crystal structure. Rotamer optimization of the
interface with this rotamer pair correctly identified
the salt-bridging interaction.
Neither the rotamer library conformations nor the
protein backbone used in the original design
predictions deviate by more than 0.6 Å from the
experimentally determined conformation. However,
these structural changes were sufficient to preclude
discovery of the correct designed interface confor￾mation. The difficulties in calculating accurate vdW
energies with a fixed backbone and rotamers are
well documented; our findings suggest that these
problems may become particularly acute for salt
bridges or hydrogen bonds.22 In these situations, a
delicate balance must be achieved—the residues
must come close enough to form a stabilizing
interaction, but not so close that they create a vdW
clash. The EGAD forcefield parameters dictate that
ideal hydrogen bonding distances are shorter than
the sum of the atomic vdW radii. Indeed, in the
E73M crystal structure, the amide nitrogen of K74
and carboxyl oxygen of D104 are positioned at a
distance of 2.8 Å, while the sum of their respective
vdW radii is 3.3 Å. During design calculations, this
side chain conformation generates a vdW clash that
must be compensated for by an energy term favor￾ing electrostatic or hydrogen bonding interactions. If
rotamers in the library do not capture the exact
geometry necessary to favor electrostatic interaction
Redesign of the SHV-1 BLIP Interface 1271without generating an overwhelmingly destabilizing
vdW clash, the salt bridge will be eliminated as a false
negative.
Increased side chain flexibility would improve the
prediction of salt bridge interactions by providing
conformations consistent with salt bridge formation
and reducing the number of salt bridges overlooked
as “false negatives”. One possible means of achieving
greater side chain flexibility is through the use of an
expanded rotamer library. This method greatly
increases computation time, and has been shown to
provide little advantage over using a softened vdW
potential.20 Another possibility is the use of contin￾uous optimization techniques, which allow for full
side chain flexibility rather than discrete rotamers.
These methods require an analytically differentiable
energy function, which typically precludes the inclu￾sion of a solvation term. Unlike fully flexible side
chains, discrete rotamers conveniently allow for the
precalculation of pairwise energy tables, which can
improve calculation speed. Further, some search
algorithms require a pairwise-decomposable energy
function, and thus also the use of discrete rotamers
(for example DEE). For these reasons, several groups
have suggested hybrid approaches that couple itera￾tions of continuous local minimization (allowing fully
flexible side chains) with global optimization algo￾rithms (that use discrete rotamers). The local mini￾mization process allows incorporation of continuous
side chain flexibility and “off-rotamer” side chain
conformations, but is limited to exploring conforma￾tional space near the closest local minimum. Global
optimization ensures that high-energy barriers separ￾ating low-energy conformations may be crossed, and
allows inclusion of non-analytically differentiable
energy terms. A two-tier Monte Carlo simulation
was recently used to redesign a protein/peptide
interface.23 This simulation introduced a random
change in sequence identity or rotamer conformation.
Next, local minimization considering continuous side
chain conformations was performed. The energy
obtained by local minimization was then used in the
Monte Carlo simulation to accept or reject the move in
sequence or conformation space. Similarly, the biased
probability Monte Carlo (BPMC) algorithm devel￾oped in the Abagyan lab performs a round of local
minimization for each Monte Carlo step.21 In this
algorithm, a random change in sequence identity or
rotamer conformation is introduced. Local minimiza￾tion is then performed using only the analytically
differentiable terms of the energy function. The
energy of the new conformation is then calculated
using the full energy function, and used to accept or
reject the Monte Carlo move. This was used success￾fully in the refinement of side chain conformations for
protein–protein docking calculations. In this study,
Monte Carlo optimization was used to select new
interface sequences and DEE was used to optimize
interface side chain conformation. Future design
calculations may include a brief round of local
minimization, such as conjugate-gradient, following
DEE. This would allow evaluation of “off-rotamer”
conformations, and possibly improve the EGAD
design results.

Concentrations of β-lactamase were 3–10 nM, with the
lower concentrations used for studies of the inhibitors
with higher affinity. Reactions were initiated with ncf at
the Km value for the enzyme (15 μM for SHV-1 and 350 μM
for TEM-1). Final reaction volumes were 1 ml, and all
measurements were performed in triplicate. In order to
minimize variation between protein preparations, all
measurements were performed with a single pooled
sample of either SHV-1 or TEM-1. Hydrolysis rates were
monitored at λ= 486 nm using the extinction coefficient
ε= 20,500 M- 1 cm- 1 for the hydrolyzed form of ncf (ε taken

SHV-1 was mixed 1:1 with BLIP E73M, or BLIP (E73M,
S130K, S146M) in 20 mM BisTris (pH 7.25), 50 mM NaCl
and concentrated. The concentrated protein was dialyzed
overnight against 20 mM BisTris (pH 7.25), 50 mM NaCl.
The final concentration of protein used for setting trays
was either 4.1 mg/ml SHV-1/BLIP E73M or 6.3 mg/ml
SHV-1/BLIP (E73M, S130K, S146M). Crystals were grown
at 19 °C in hanging drops by mixing 1 μl of protein with
1 μl of well solution or 2 μl of protein with 2 μl of well
solution over a 1 ml reservoir of well solution. Both the
SHV-1/BLIP E73M and SHV-1/BLIP (E73M, S130K,
S146M) complexes formed hexagonal crystals in well
solutions of 37.5% or 42.5% ammonium sulfate, 100 mM
Tris, pH 8.4. For reference, our previous crystals of the
wild type complex were obtained in 60% ammonium
sulfate, 50 mM cacodylate pH 6.5.12 For harvesting, a
cryoprotectant solution containing well solution plus 30%
xylitol was added directly to the drop, and the crystals
were immediately looped and flash-frozen in liquid
nitrogen.
All datasets were collected at beamline 8.3.1 at the
Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory.25 Data were indexed and scaled using
HKL2000.26 Subsequently, molecular replacement was
performed using PHASER with the wild type SHV-1/
BLIP structure (PDB entry 2G2U) as search model.27
Iterations of manual rebuilding in Coot, and refinement
with PHENIX generated the final structural models.20,28
Additional details of the data collection and refinement
are given in Table 4. All molecular figures were created
with PyMOL†.
Computational interface design
All design calculations were performed using the
EGAD library for computational protein design.17 The
protein backbone was held fixed to the crystallographic
conformation of the SHV-1/BLIP complex (PDB ID 2G2U).
Amino acid identity was sampled for sidechains compos￾ing a single interface cluster (further described in Results),
and a second shell of residues within 4 Å of the designed
positions was varied rotamerically. The Dunbrack back￾bone-independent rotamer library was used for all cal￾culations, with added 180° flips of χ2 for aspargine,
glutamine, and histidine.29 For sidechains with fewer than
three χ angles, χ1 was also spread by 1σ in each direction.
All amino acid identities with the exception of G, P and C,
were allowed at the designed positions. The energy
function used is that described in Refs 18 and 19, and
consists of a linearized vdW term, coulombic electro￾statics, and torsional potentials, all using atomic para￾meters from OPLS-AA.30,31 The Generalized Born model
and a solvent-accessible surface area-dependent hydro￾phobic burial term were included to incorporate solvation
effects.
Previously, EGAD library free energy calculations were
shown to reproduce experimental changes in free energy
upon interface mutation within an error of 1.6–2.2 kcal/
mol for the TEM-1/BLIP and SHV-1/BLIP interfaces.
These calculations explicitly considered the energy of the
bound complex relative to a reference state of unbound
monomers. As this improved the agreement with experi￾mental values, the unbound state energy was incorpo￾rated as a reference state in the designs presented here.
The design process minimized ΔGdiss, rather than the
energy of the bound complex alone:
DGdiss ¼ Gbound  Gfree
The free monomers were modeled by separating the
crystallographic structure of the complex by 50 Å. A two￾state minimization protocol was employed, consisting of
an outer search algorithm that conducted optimization in
sequence space, and an inner minimization loop that
optimizes in structure space. The Monte Carlo method
was used as the outer minimizer. Minimization was
initiated by random selection of an amino acid position
and introduction of a mutation. The inner minimization
loop (here Dead End Elimination) then performed
rotamer optimization of both the bound and unbound
states of the new mutant complex. The difference in
energy between the bound complex and unbound
monomers was returned to the outer Monte Carlo loop.
The Monte Carlo minimization subsequently accepted or
rejected the mutational move in accordance with the
Metropolis criterion, and randomly selected another
position for mutation. As the Monte Carlo method is a
heuristic search algorithm, ten independent minimization
runs were performed, and all ten designs underwent a
heuristic quench local minimization step. In this process,
a single amino acid position was randomly selected and
mutated to all possible residue identities to identify the
lowest-energy residue. This was done in random order
across the designed residues until all positions had been
† http://pymol.sourceforge.net/
Redesign of the SHV-1 BLIP Interface 1273            visited at least once with no change in residue identity.
Following this minimization, it was found that the ten
design runs converged on one to three individual
solutions. The modular structure of the EGAD library
greatly facilitated nesting and combination of the search
algorithms in the two-state minimizer implementation,
and will later allow for experimentation with other search
algorithm combinations, such as a genetic algorithm with
DEE.
There are two ways to introduce mutations with overall
stabilizing effects on the interface in two-state design
procedures. (1) Introduce a mutation that stabilizes the
bound state or (2) add one that destabilizes the unbound
monomers. Although both approaches do result in a
greater free energy difference between the bound and
unbound states, the latter approach often generates design
solutions that are calculated to improved binding affinity,
but fail to do so. For example, large vdW clashes are easily
introduced into the unbound state as a consequence of the
fixed backbone approximation. While this gives rise to the
desired effect on ΔGdiss, in reality these clashes would be
relaxed, or cause unfolding of the unbound monomers. To
mitigate this problem, the vdW term used to describe the
unbound monomers is softened slightly relative to the
term describing the bound complex. Specifically, the
linearization point of the repulsive potential is shifted to
a larger inter-atomic distance. The equation describing the
softened vdW potential is:

For the bound state of the complex, ζ = 1.5, while for the
free monomers ζ = 1.0. The value for the bound state was
taken from Ref.18, while the value for the free monomers
was selected by visually inspecting designed complexes at
different ζ thresholds.
Calculation of ΔΔGdiss, mut values
The equation used for comparison with experimental
values is:
DDGdiss; mut¼gðDGdiss; mutDGdiss; WTÞ
The scaling factor η is necessary because EGAD con￾sistently returns much larger values of ΔΔGdiss, mut than
those observed experimentally. For all ΔΔGdiss, mut
calculations, η= 0.20. This value was empirically deter￾mined by fitting to a large set of experimental interface
mutation data.18 The change in affinity upon mutation
was calculated with an energy function identical with that
used for the present designs. The crystallographic com￾plexes of TEM-1/BLIP and SHV-1/BLIP (PDB ID 1JTG
and 2G2U, respectively) were used as the starting
structures for bound state energy calculation, and the
unbound states were modeled by separating the complex
structures by 50 Å. As in the design process, for each
mutant complex a subset of amino acid sidechains was
rotamer optimized for the bound and unbound states by
DEE (thus guaranteeing a global minimum), and a free
energy calculated for the minimum energy state. As the
free energy of association calculations are less computa￾tionally demanding than a full design run, more side￾chains were included in the rotamer optimization. This set
includes all cluster residues (instead of the sidechains for
only a single cluster at a time), and all positions with one
atom within 4 Å of any of the cluster residues. All amino
acid positions with the identities G, P and C were held
fixed in conformation. This change in search space yields
some small differences between the energies for the
designs calculated here and those calculated in the design
runs. In all cases, however, the differences in calculated
energy are well within the error we observe between the
calculated and experimental values.
