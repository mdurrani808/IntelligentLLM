ABSTRACT Infection of mononuclear cells by human
immunodeflciency virus (HIV) begins with binding of the viral
envelope glycoprotein, gpl20, to its receptor, CD4. CD4 con￾tains four extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, the first
of which (V1) is sufficient for HIV binding. V1 contains three
sequences homologous to the antigen-complementarity￾determining regions (CDR1 to -3) of immunoglobulin variable
domains. While all three immunoglobulin CDRs are involved
in antigen binding, only amino acids within and flanking the
CDR2-like region of CD4 have been shown previously to be
involved in gpl20 binding. To investigate whether other regions
in V1 take part in gpl20 binding, we substituted alanine for
each of 64 amino acids, including all of the hydrophilic residues
in this domain. Mutations at four locations outside the CDR2-
like sequence (amino acids 29, 59-64, 77-81, and 85) markedly
affected gpi20 binding, but not the overall structure of V1 as
probed with eight conformationally sensitive monoclonal anti￾bodies. Thus, the gpl20-binding site of CD4 is not limited to the
CDR2-like sequence and consists of several discontinuous
segments. Several amino acids were identified that are critical
for the conformation of V1; the importance of these residues
suggests some differences in the folding of this domain com￾pared to immunoglobulin variable domains. Three amino acid
substitutions were found that increase the affinity for gpi20
significantly (1.7- to 2-fold individually and 4.2-fold when
combined), suggesting that it may be possible to improve the
HIV-blocking ability of CD4-based molecules by increasing
their gpl20 binding affinity.
CD4 is a cell surface glycoprotein found mainly on T lym￾phocytes that associates with class II major histocompatibil￾ity molecules on antigen-presenting cells, facilitating antigen
recognition by the T-cell receptor. CD4 is also the cellular
receptor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), binding
to the viral envelope glycoprotein, gpl20 (1, 2). The finding
that CD4 is required for HIV infection of human mononuclear
cells has led to the development of CD4-based candidates for
AIDS therapy. Some of these compounds block the binding
of HIV to cell surface CD4 (3-11), while others target toxins
to HIV-infected cells (12, 13). An understanding of the
interaction of HIV with CD4 may help improve the efficiency
of such CD4-based therapeutics.
CD4 is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily,
containing four immunoglobulin variable (V)-like domains
(V1-V4) in its extracellular region (14, 15). The V1 domain of
CD4, containing the first 92 amino acids, is sufficient for
binding to gpl20 (16, 17). Several approaches have been
taken to define the gpl20 binding site of CD4, including
random saturation mutagenesis coupled with selection of
escape mutants (18), insertional mutagenesis (19), and ho￾molog-scanning mutagenesis (17, 20-23). These studies have
identified a single amino acid stretch (residues 40-55) as
critical for gpl20 binding, leading to the notion that the
structure of the gpl20-binding site may be relatively simple.
However, peptides containing residues 81-92 block HIV￾induced syncytium formation (8), suggesting that the gp120-
binding site may involve more than one region in V1.
To investigate systematically which amino acids in CD4 are
critical for HIV binding, we studied the V1 domain by
alanine-scanning mutagenesis (24). We selected amino acids
with hydrophilic side chains, which are found generally on
the surface of the protein, and several hydrophobic amino
acids predicted to be either exposed or important for the
conformation of V1, and replaced each of them with alanine.
Substitution by alanine may identify contact sites for gpl20,
since protein-protein interfaces are dominated by amino acid
side-chain interactions and since alanine substitution elimi￾nates the side chains beyond the 13 carbon, without changing
the main-chain conformation or imposing extreme electro￾static or steric effects. Moreover, alanine is the most abun￾dant amino acid and can be found in both buried and exposed
positions and in various secondary structures (ref. 24 and
refs. therein). In addition, substitution of single amino acids
should yield results that are easier to interpret than the
multiple substitutions, insertions, or deletions used in previ￾ous studies.
Our results show that the gp120-binding site of CD4 is
complex, with residues likely to contact gp120 found in at
least four locations outside the 40-55 region. We also iden￾tified several residues that are important for the conformation
of the V1 domain and three mutations that increase the gp120
binding affinity significantly and thus may aid the design of
CD4-based molecules that block HIV more efficiently.
METHODS
Construction and Expression of CD4 Mutants. A molecular
fusion of human CD4 and IgG (CD4 immunoadhesin) was
used to construct the mutants and to test them as secreted
molecules (9, 11). Mutations were introduced using the
polymerase chain reaction (25). The mutants were transiently
expressed and secreted by transfection of human embryonic
kidney cells (9).
Analysis of gpl20 and Monoclonal Antibody (mAb) Binding.
Serum-free supernatants from transfected cells were tested for
binding of 125I-labeled recombinant gp120 (IIIb isolate of HIV)
(3). Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by Scatchard
analysis (26). The binding of murine mAbs to the CD4 immu￾noadhesins was tested in an ELISA format. MT 151 was from

750, and 752 against wild-type CD4 immunoadhesin.
Modeling the Structure of the V1 Domain of CD4. We
modeled the structure of the V1 domain by using the average
coordinates of structurally conserved regions (primarily .3-
sheet) from crystal structures of seven immunoglobulin light￾chain V (VL) domains, after superpositioning. The VL do￾mains were [Protein Data Bank code (27) in parentheses]
human A KOL (1FB4) (28) and NEWM (3FAB) (29); human
Bence-Jones proteins REI (1REI) (30) and RHE (2RHE) (31);
and mouse K HyHEL-5 (2HFL) (32), MCPC603 (2MCP) (33),
and J539 (1FBJ) (34). Conformations of the complementarity￾determining region 1 (CDR1)- and CDR2-like regions were
taken from VL structures, and that of CDR3, which is larger
in CD4 than in immunoglobulins, from loops of proteins
unrelated to VL domains. Side-chain conformations were
adapted from VL domains or predicted from allowed con￾formations (35). Several models were subjected to energy
minimization using the DISCOVER program (Biosym Technol￾ogies, San Diego).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We used a CD4 immunoadhesin construct to test the mutants
as secreted molecules. In this molecule, the V1 and V2
domains of CD4 are linked at their carboxyl terminus to the
hinge and Fc portion (CH2 and CH3 heavy-chain constant
domains) of human IgGi; the resulting polypeptide folds as a
homodimeric protein (9, 11). Wild-type and mutant CD4
immunoadhesins were transiently expressed in human em￾bryonic kidney cells and harvested in serum-free cell super￾natants. All 64 variants constructed were expressed and
secreted, as determined by both radioimmunoprecipitation
and immunosorbent assays that recognize the invariant Fc
domain (data not shown).
We tested the binding of each mutant to 125I-labeled gpl20
(Table 1). The wild-type immunoadhesin exhibited a Kd of 3.6
nM, similar to intact, cell-surface CD4 (22, 36). Mutations in
38 of the positions tested displayed Kd values comparable to
that of the wild type (Table 1; Fig. 1), suggesting that those
residues are not involved directly in gpl20 binding. Alanine
substitutions at the other 26 positions tested markedly af￾fected gpl20 binding; these residues may interact with gpl20
directly but could also affect the binding indirectly, by
changing the conformation of V1.
To distinguish between these possibilities, we probed the
overall structure of the V1 domain in each mutant with a
panel of eight conformationally dependent anti-V1 mAbs.
Each of these antibodies binds to native CD4 but not to CD4
that is reduced and alkylated (data not shown). Analysis of
mAb binding of each mutant revealed that 12 of the 26

FIG. 1. Effect of alanine substitution of individual amino acids in the V1 domain of CD4 on gpl20 binding. Histogram depicts the ratio of
the Kd of each mutant to the Kd of wild-type (wt) CD4 (see Table 1 for actual Kd values). Values greater or smaller than 1 indicate a decrease
or an increase, respectively, in the affinity for gpl20. Amino acid sequences of the V1 domain of human (CD4) and murine (L3T4) CD4 were
aligned according to Maddon et al. (15). Regions homologous to CDRs of immunoglobulin light chains are also indicated.
mutants that displayed altered in gpl20 binding (positions 29,
39, 40, 44, 49, 52, 59, 63, 64, 77, 81, and 85) bound most of
the mAbs as well as the wild type, indicating that the overall
structure of V1 was retained (Table 1). These residues,
therefore, appear to be involved directly in binding to gpl20.
Ten other mutants (positions 7, 13, 28, 54, 57, 62, 78, 79, 80,
and 82) exhibited dramatic reductions in binding to most or
all mAbs (Table 1), suggesting that mutations in these posi￾tions alter the conformation of V1 and therefore may affect
gpl20 binding indirectly. Four mutants (positions 36, 37, 46,
and 51) exhibited intermediate reductions in mAb binding
(Table 1); the reduction in gpi20 binding in these mutants also
may be due to changes in conformation.
We and others (18, 20, 21, 37) have constructed models for
the structure of the CD4 V1 domain, based on the known
structures of immunoglobulin VL domains. Within the limi￾tations of such models, one can draw certain inferences from
the basic similarity of CD4 to VL domains. Much of the
sequence of CD4 is predicted to fold in two P-pleated sheets,
which lie parallel to each other in an immunoglobulin-like
"sandwich" (Fig. 2A). The previously known mutations that
affect gpl20 binding are located in an exposed loop homolo￾gous to CDR2 of a VL domain (18-22, 38). This loop contains
two antiparallel P-strands (residues 36-45 and 48-53). To
reconcile our data with a VL-domain-like model of CD4, one
could postulate that the CDR2-like loop assumes a conforma￾tion different from that predicted by a simple translation of VL
structure. Because Glu-77 and Thr-81 appear to form direct
contacts with gpl20 (see above), it is possible that the segment
of amino acids 77-81, in which these residues are found, is
exposed more than the homologous segment in VL domains.
Indeed, the 77-81 region is accessible significantly more if the
small loop containing Ile-36 and Leu-37 is folded over toward
residues Ile-83, Phe-98, and Leu-100 (these five residues are
hydrophobic in CD4 from various species), rather than out￾ward, as is the case in immunoglobulins (Fig. 2B). This would
result in a different conformation of the CDR2-like loop, as
Ile-36 and Leu-37 are at the base of this loop. That Ile-36 and
Leu-37 affect the conformation of the CDR2-like loop is
consistent with the observation that substitution of these
residues abolishes gpl20 binding completely: because many
amino acids in the CDR2-like region appear to interact with
gpl20 directly, a change in the conformation of this loop may
obstruct the CD4-gpl2O interaction.
Within the CDR2-like region, mutations in Ser-39, Gln-40,
Leu-44, Lys-46, Ser-49, Leu-51, and Asn-52 resulted in
marked reductions in gpl20 binding (Table 1; Fig. 1). These
residues are predicted to be exposed (Fig. 2C) and therefore
are likely to interact directly with gpl20. However, since
mutants K46A and L51A also exhibited significant reductions
in mAb binding (Table 1), it is possible that Lys-46 and
Leu-51 are important for local conformation as well. The
residues outside the CDR2-like loop that appear to contact
gpl20 were found in four regions. The first includes Arg-59,
Asp-63, and Gln-64, which are predicted to be external and
adjacent to the CDR2-like loop (Fig. 2C), consistent with the
conclusion that they may interact with gpl20. The neighbor￾ing residues Ser-57 and Trp-62 are predicted to be buried (Fig.
2B) and their substitution probably affects gpl20 binding
through changes in conformation, as indicated by mAb
binding. In the second region, residues 77-81, Glu-77, and
Thr-81 appear to interact with gpl20 directly, while Asp-78,
Ser-79, and Asp-80 appear to be important for conformation.
These findings support two predictions of our model: Glu-77
and Thr-81 are the most accessible residues in the 77-81
segment, and Asp-78 forms an important salt bridge with
Arg-54, an interaction found for the homologous residues in
most VL domains (R54A, like D78A, displays a total loss of
gpl20 binding).
Mutations in Lys-29 and Glu-85 also appear to affect gpl20
binding directly (Table 1). Consistent with this conclusion,
Lys-29 is predicted to be external and in a P-strand imme￾diately adjacent to the CDR2-like loop, while Glu-85 is
located externally as well, in the p-strand adjacent to Lys-29.
These residues also might form a salt bridge together (Fig.
2C).
Mutations in Lys-7, Glu-13, Trp-28, and Tyr-82 reduced
the binding to all eight mAbs, indicating that these residues
are important for the conformation of V1 (Table 1). Consis￾tent with this notion, the model predicts that Lys-7 and
Glu-13 are capable of forming a salt bridge and that Trp-28
and Tyr-82 lie internally, Trp-28 abutted against the con￾served disulfide bond and Tyr-82 hydrogen-bonded to the V1
backbone (Fig. 2B). These residues are conserved between
CD4 and VL domains, further suggesting that they may be
important structurally.
Two of the alanine substitution mutants, Q40A and D63A,
exhibited significantly higher affinity for gpl20 than the
wild-type CD4 (2.0- and 1.7-fold, respectively; Table 2).
Similarly, a leucine substitution mutant, Q89L, constructed
as part of a more extended mutational analysis (A.A.,
S.A.M., and D.J.C., unpublished results), bound gpl20 with
1.7-fold higher affinity than the wild-type CD4. The double
mutant Q40A/D63A exhibited a 2.3-fold increase in affinity
and the triple mutant Q40A/D63A/Q89L exhibited a 4.2-fold
increase in affinity (Table 2). As Gln-40 and Asp-63 are
located externally in segments that appear to interact with
gpl20, their side chains may hinder the normal interaction of
gpl20 with CD4. In contrast, Gln-89 does not appear to be
involved directly in binding, as its replacement by alanine has
no effect (Table 1). However, a leucine at this position may
form a direct contact with gpl20 and thereby stabilize bind￾Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 (1990)Proc. Natd. Acad. Sci. USA 87 (1990) 7153

1. Multiple point mutants were generated by using single or double

through polymerase chain reaction primers.
In conclusion, our results show that the gp12O-binding site
of CD4 consists of several discontinuous segments, which
can be modeled to fold in space into a relatively compact
region of CD4. In addition, we have identified several resi￾dues that appear to be important structural determinants for
the conformation of the V1 domain. These data suggest that
the CDR2-like loop is folded differently in CD4 than in
immunoglobulins and that the 77-81 segment is more ex￾posed and plays an important structural role in CD4, unlike
the homologous region in VL domains. Finally, the obser￾vation that certain CD4 mutants have a markedly increased
gp120 binding affinity and that such mutations can be com￾bined to produce molecules that bind gp120 yet more strongly
may be useful in the development of CD4-based molecules
that are more efficient in blocking HIV infection or in
targeting the destruction of HIV-infected cells.
Note Added in Proof. During preparation of this manuscript, Brodsky
et al. (39) reported a mutational analysis of the gp120 binding site of
CD4. Their findings are consistent with our conclusion that the
binding site is discontinuous and not limited to amino acids in the
CDR2-like region.
