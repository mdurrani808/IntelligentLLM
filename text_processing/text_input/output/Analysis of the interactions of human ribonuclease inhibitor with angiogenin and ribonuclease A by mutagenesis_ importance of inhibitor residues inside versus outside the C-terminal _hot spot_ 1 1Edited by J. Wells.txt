Ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) binds diverse mammalian RNases with extra￾ordinary avidity. Here, we have investigated the structural basis for this
tight binding and broad speci®city by mutational analysis of the complexes
of RI with angiogenin (Ang) and RNase A (KD  0.5 fM and 43 fM, respect￾ively). Both crystal structures are known; the interfaces are large, and the
ligands dock similarly, although few of the speci®c interactions formed are
analogous. Our previous mutagenesis studies focused primarily on one
contact region, containing RI 434-438 and the enzymatic active site. Many
single-residue replacements produced extensive losses of binding energy
(2.3-5.9 kcal/mol), suggesting that this region constitutes a ``hot spot'' in
both cases. We have now explored the roles of most of the remaining RI
residues that interact with Ang and/or RNase A. One major cluster in each
complex lies in a Trp-rich area of RI, containing Trp261, Trp263, Trp318,
and Trp375. Although the energy losses from individual replacements in
this portion of the Ang complex were small-to-moderate (0-1.5 kcal/mol),
the changes from multiple substitutions were much greater than additive,
and the binding energy provided by this region is estimated to be 6 kcal/
mol (30 % of total). Effects of replacing combinations of hot spot com￾ponents had also been found to be superadditive, and this negative coop￾erativity is now shown to extend to the neighboring contact residue RI
Ser460. The overall contribution of the hot spot, taking superadditivity into
account, is then 14-15 kcal/mol. The hot spot and Trp-rich regions,
although spatially well separated, are themselves functionally linked. No
other parts of the RI-Ang interface appear to be energetically important.
Binding of RNase A is more sensitive to substitutions throughout the inter￾face, with free energy losses 5 1 kcal/mol produced by nearly all replace￾ments examined, so that the sum of losses greatly exceeds the binding
energy of the complex. This discrepancy can be explained, in part, by posi￾tive cooperativity, as evident from the subadditive effects observed when
combinations of residues in either the hot spot or Trp-rich region are
replaced. These ®ndings suggest that the binding energy may be more
widely distributed in the RNase A complex than in the Ang complex.

RNase inhibitor (RI), a 50 kDa leucine-rich
repeat (LRR) protein, binds diverse 14 kDa pro￾teins in the pancreatic RNase superfamily with dis￾sociation constants extending from 10ÿ13 M to
below 10ÿ15 M (Lee et al., 1989b; Vicentini et al.,
1990; Shapiro & Vallee, 1991; Boix et al., 1996;
Hofsteenge, 1997). The molecular basis for this
extraordinarily high af®nity and broad speci®city
has been explored in some detail in recent years by
X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagen￾esis. Crystal structures have been determined for
the complexes of porcine RI (pRI) with bovine pan￾creatic RNase A (KD  67 fM (Vicentini et al.,
1990)) (Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1995) and human RI
(hRI) with human angiogenin (Ang) (KD < 1 fM
(Lee et al., 1989b)) (Papageorgiou et al., 1997), a
ribonucleolytic enzyme that induces formation of
new blood vessels (Fett et al., 1985; Shapiro et al.,
1986). In both cases, RI utilizes its ``horseshoe''
shape, formed by symmetrical arrangement of the
16 homologous tandem LRR units that comprise
nearly the entire molecule (Figure 1), to partially
engulf its target. The contact points on RI lie within
the central cavity and on the upper surface of the
horseshoe, and are distributed among 12 (RNase A
complex) and 13 (Ang complex) of the LRRs.
Although nearly two-thirds of the inhibitor resi￾dues that interact with Ang and RNase A are the
same, few of the contacts that they make are analo￾gous.
Initial studies on the effects of single-residue
mutations on binding af®nity (Chen & Shapiro,
1997) suggested that the complexes of RI with Ang
and RNase A both conform to the ``hot spot''
model proposed by Clackson & Wells (1995): repla￾cements within one part of each interface
decreased binding af®nity substantially, whereas
substitutions of various residues in other interface
regions produced much smaller changes. The
locations of the putative hot spots on RI for bind￾ing Ang and RNase A are nearly identical. Both
contain primarily residues on the ba loop 433-439,
with additional involvement of the adjacent amino
acid residue Ser460. However, the speci®c inter￾actions formed in this region of the two complexes
are largely different.
A subsequent investigation of the RI-Ang and
RI-RNase A hot spots using multi-site mutagenesis
revealed additional details of their functioning,
including some dramatic cooperativities, which
were distinctive in the two complexes (Chen &
Shapiro, 1999). The losses in binding energy for the
RNase A complex associated with replacing pairs
of hRI residues in this site were markedly less than
additive (``subadditive''), suggesting that the
effects of the substitutions are partially interdepen￾dent and that the overall contribution of this region
may not be as large as it seemed from the single￾site variants. In contrast, the effects of these
multiple replacements on af®nity for Ang were
fully additive or much greater than additive
(``superadditive'', LiCata & Ackers, 1995). Super￾additivity was also found in several cases when
these hRI residues were substituted together with
hot spot residues on Ang. Thus this region of the
interface may provide even more binding energy
than was ®rst apparent.
Here, we have explored the roles of additional
components of the hRI-Ang and hRI-RNase A
interfaces, both inside and outside the hot spot, by
single-site and multi-site mutagenesis. Our ®nd￾ings, while con®rming the energetic predominance
of the key region in the Ang complex identi®ed
previously, demonstrate that a tryptophan-rich
area, containing Trp261, Trp263, Trp318 and
Trp375 of hRI and Trp89 of Ang, also makes an
important contribution. Some of the residues in
this part of the interface, like those in the hot spot,
are shown to work cooperatively, and these two
regions themselves, although well separated in the
3D structure, are functionally linked as well. The
RNase A complex is sensitive to losses of contacts
over a much larger portion of the interface than is
the Ang complex, suggesting that the binding
energy may be more widely distributed. Moreover,
we ®nd that replacements of residues just outside
the contact surface can also weaken af®nity for
RNase A signi®cantly.
Results
Role of the C-terminal region of hRI
Eight residues within the C-terminal LRR unit of
RI make contact with Ang; these same amino acid
residues, plus three others from this segment, inter￾act with RNase A (Table 1).{ Previous mutagenesis
studies examined the roles of four of these hRI resi￾dues (Tyr434, Asp435, Tyr437 and Ser460) in the
Ang and RNase A complexes and some of the Ang
residues that contact this region of hRI (Arg5,
His8, Gln12, Lys40 and His114) (Lee & Vallee,
1989a; Shapiro & Vallee, 1989, 1992; Chen &
Shapiro, 1997, 1999). Individual substitutions of
hRI Tyr434 and Asp435, and the Ang residues
Arg5 and Lys40 were shown to increase the KD for
the hRIAng complex substantially (50 to 1300-
fold), whereas deletion of the C-terminal residue
Ser460 of hRI and replacements of the other resi-
{ The RI-RNase A interactions cited throughout are
those observed in the crystal structure of the pRIRNase
A complex (Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1996). Except where
indicated otherwise, we assume that these contacts are
present also in the hRI complex; pRI and hRI bind
RNase A with almost identical af®nities (Lee et al.,
1989b; Vicentini et al., 1990), the sequences of the two
proteins are 85 % similar (77 % identical), and only four
of the contact residues on pRI are not present in the
human inhibitor (all but one are conservatively
replaced). The N terminus of hRI is extended by four
residues with respect to pRI; there are no other
insertions or deletions.
498 RNase Inhibitor Interactionsdues produced less extensive changes (1.6 to eight￾fold). All four hRI mutations greatly diminished
af®nity for RNase A, by factors ranging from 84 to
23,000-fold. The effects of numerous multi-site sub￾stitutions were also determined, focusing on hRI
Tyr434, Asp435 and Tyr437, and the two Ang resi￾dues (Arg5 and Lys40) that appear to interact most
strongly with the inhibitor loop containing these
amino acids.
We have now extended these studies to investi￾gate additional interrelationships within this por￾tion of the hRI-Ang interface and the importance
of those contact residues for Ang and RNase A on
the 430 to 460 segment of hRI that were not exam￾ined previously.
Interactions of des(460)-hRI with the Ang
variants R5A and K40G
In the hRIAng crystal structure, hRI Ser460
lies next to the inhibitor loop 433-439 but these
two C-terminal elements contact entirely different

structures have been enlarged by 15 % with respect to the inhibitors. hRI residue numbering is used. The Figure was
drawn with MOLSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997; Kraulis, 1991).
RNase Inhibitor Interactions 499sets of residues on Ang (Table 1). Their func￾tional connection was assessed by measuring KD
values for the complexes of des(460)-hRI with
the Ang variants R5A and K40G, in which the
two major residues that interact with the loop
have been replaced. Rate constants for associ￾ation (ka) and dissociation (kd) were determined
as described in Materials and Methods, and KD
values were calculated as kd/ka (Table 2). For￾mation of the wild-type (wt) hRIAng complex
is accompanied by a marked increase in Trp ¯u￾orescence; monitoring of this increase under
stopped-¯ow conditions has indicated that
association proceeds via a two-step mechanism
in which rapid formation of a loose complex EI
(dissociation constant K1) is followed by a slower
isomerization to the tight complex EI* (rate con￾stant k2) (Lee et al., 1989a).{ Values for K1 and
k2 can be obtained from the dependence of
1/kobs on 1/[Ang], where kobs is the rate con￾stant for the increase in Trp ¯uorescence and
[Ang] is the concentration of Ang; the 1/kobs
intercept is at 1/k2, the 1/[Ang] intercept is at
ÿ1/K1, and the slope is 1/ka, where ka ( k2/K1)
is the apparent second-order rate constant
of association. Binding of both R5A-Ang and
K40G-Ang to des(460)-hRI produced ¯uorescence
enhancements similar to that for the wt complex,
and again followed a two-step mechanism. The
values for ka were three- to fourfold lower,
re¯ecting both increases in K1 and decreases in
k2. Dissociation was affected more substantially:
the half-lives of the R5A and K40G complexes
were 73 and 16 minutes, respectively, versus
73 days for the wt complex. The reductions in
overall af®nity (5520-fold and 18,400-fold,
respectively) were 13-fold and ninefold larger
than expected if the pairs of residues replaced
were to function independently: i.e. the
mutational effects were superadditive. The values
for G, representing the difference between
the sum of the losses in binding free energy
(G values) for the individual replacements
and the measured G values for the double
variant complexes, were ÿ1.5 kcal/mol (R5A)
and ÿ1.3 kcal/mol (K40G).
Interactions of hRI variants Q430A/V432A,
W438A/S439A/E440A, R457A, and I459A with
Ang and RNase A
The roles of six residues on the hRI C-terminal
segment 430 to 460 that contact or approach Ang
and RNase A in the crystal structures of the com￾plexes (Gln430, Val432, Trp438, Ser439, Glu440 and
Ile459; Table 1) were not studied previously, and
that of a seventh (Arg457) was examined only with
respect to RNase A dissociation (Chen & Shapiro,
1997). The effects of substituting these residues by
Ala either singly or in groups were now deter￾mined (Table 2). Some of the replacements (those
of Glu440 and Ile459) eliminate interactions with
both ligands; others remove contacts with only one
of them (Trp438 (Ang); Gln430, Val432, and
Arg457 (RNase A)); and one (Ser439) deletes no
direct interactions with either enzyme (all contacts
involve main-chain atoms or CB). Q430A/V432A
and R457A bound Ang with avidities similar to
that of wt hRI, but their af®nities for RNase A
were reduced by four- to ®vefold. Replacement of
Ile459 produced threefold and 1.8-fold increases in
the KD values for Ang and RNase A, respectively.
The variant W438A/S439A/E440A bound 20 to
30-fold less strongly to both ligands.
Role of the tryptophan-rich region of hRI
Analysis of the hRI-Ang crystal structure reveals
one area of extended complementarity between the
surfaces of the two proteins outside the hot spot
already identi®ed (Papageorgiou et al., 1997). This
region includes a cluster of four tryptophan resi￾dues (Trp261, Trp263, Trp318, and Trp375), Ser289,
Glu344 and Glu401, which line the inside of the
hRI horseshoe from the ``9-o'clock'' to the ``12-
o'clock'' position (Figure 1), and residues 84 to 89
on the B4/B5 loop of Ang (Leonidas et al., 1999).
The intermolecular contacts formed are two direct
hydrogen bonds (linking hRI residues Ser289 and
Glu344 with Gly86 and Trp89 of Ang, respect￾ively), two water-mediated hydrogen bonds
(between hRI Trp263 and Glu344, and Ang Gly86
and Trp89, respectively), and 53 van der Waals
contacts (out of 113 for the entire complex) (Table 1
and Figure 2(a)).
The RNase A loop segment 86 to 92 differs con￾siderably from the corresponding residues (84 to
89) of Ang in both sequence and conformation,
and its surface is less complementary to that of RI
(Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1996; Papageorgiou et al.,
1997). Four direct hydrogen bonds connect this
RNase A loop with RI (Ser89, Gly88, Ser89 and
Glu86 interact with Glu206, Trp261, Trp263 and
Lys320, respectively); Lys91 of RNase forms a non￾hydrogen-bonding ionic interaction with RI
Glu287; and RNase residues Gly88, Ser90, and
Lys91 make a total of 20 van der Waals contacts
with Glu206, Asp232, Trp261, Trp263, Glu287 and
Trp318 of RI (Table 1, Figure 2(b)). Trp375 of hRI is
substituted by Cys in pRI, so the pRIRNase A
crystal structure does not indicate whether a Trp at
this position would interact with RNase A. How￾ever, modeling of the complex of RNase A with
C375W-pRI suggests that it might approach Arg39.
{ As noted by Lee et al. (1989a), the kinetic data are also consistent with an alternative mechanism in which Ang
and hRI can associate to form either EI or EI* in a single step and the two complexes are not interconvertible;
however, it seems more plausible that formation of the tight complex EI* would require multiple steps. The apparent
second-order rate constant of association and KD value are the same for both mechanisms.
500 RNase Inhibitor InteractionsHere, we have determined the effects of repla￾cing by Ala most of the RI residues that interact
with Ang and/or RNase A in this interface region,
and two of the contact residues on Ang. Prelimi￾nary data on the dissociation of the complexes of
RNase A with three of these hRI variants (E287A,
K320A, and E401A) were reported previously
(Chen & Shapiro, 1997).

Hydrogen bonds (HB) and van der Waals interactions (VDW) are listed. Interatomic contacts are shown only for hydrogen bonds;
the RI atom is listed ®rst and the Ang or R.Nase A atom second. The number of van der Waals contacts with each Ang or RNase A
residue is indicated in parentheses. Reference structures are 1A4Y-PDB (hRIAng (Papageorgiou et al., 1997)) and 1DFJ-PDB
(pRIRNase A (Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1996)). Contacts were assigned by criteria speci®ed in the respective publications, except that
the donor-hydrogen-acceptor cutoff angle for hydrogen bonds in the hRIAng complex has been relaxed from >120  to >90 .
Distance cutoffs were generally shorter for the hRI-Ang complex (2.0 AÊ resolution) than for the pRIRNase A complex (2.5 AÊ resolu￾tion). hRI residue numbering is used. The contacts listed for the Ang complex are those observed in molecule 1 of the non-crystallo￾graphic dimer; contacts in molecule 2 differ only for hRI Lys320, which forms one van der Waals contact with Asp41 of Ang in
molecule 1, and a hydrogen bond with this residue in molecule 2. pRI Asp232, which forms two contacts with Ser89 of RNase A, is
replaced by Ala in hRI and is therefore not listed. a Under the conditions used for kinetic characterization, RI Asp435 probably forms hydrogen bonds with Lys41 analogous to
those with Lys40 of Ang rather than the hydrogen bond with Val43 seen in the crystal structure (see Discussion). b Ser439 of hRI is substituted by Thr in pRI. The interactions with RNase A listed are only those that could be formed by a Ser
residue. c Contacts shown in brackets involve Ang or RNase A residues outside the segment 84-89/86-91.
d The contacts of hRI Trp375 with RNase A are not indicated by the pRI-RNase structure, since Trp375 is substituted by Cys in
pRI.
RNase Inhibitor Interactions 501and W89A-Ang were found to be nearly identical
with that of the wt enzyme (Table 3). (Previous
substitutions of Ang Trp89 by Met (Chen &
Shapiro, 1997) or oxindolylalanine (Lee & Vallee,
1989a) also had little effect on af®nity for RI.)
The Trp ¯uorescence emission spectrum of the
hRIW89A-Ang complex was blue-shifted by
several nanometers with respect to the sum of the
spectra of the two individual components, and its
maximum was only 8 % higher, compared to an
increase of 50 % for the wt complex. (Maxima for
the complexes of the Met89 (Chen & Shapiro, 1997)
and oxindolylalanine-89 (Lee et al., 1989a) deriva￾tives are 17 % and 33 % lower, respectively.) This

Materials and Methods).
The effects of Trp89 modi®cations on ¯uor￾escence indicate that this residue, the sole Trp in
Ang, is directly or indirectly responsible for the
large increase in ¯uorescence upon formation of
the wt complex. Therefore, it seemed likely that
replacements of some of the hRI residues that
interact with the Trp89 loop would alter the ¯uor￾escence of the complex. Such changes might have
repercussions for measurements of complex associ￾ation and might also provide insight into the inter￾actions within this region. Therefore, ¯uorescence
studies were performed with the hRI variants
W261A, W263A, S289A, W318A, E344A, W375A,
and E401A. The emission intensities of the free pro￾teins varied considerably (Figure 3(a)), ranging
from 9 % higher than that of wt hRI (E401A) to as
much as 31 % lower (W263A) (all comparisons are
based on emission at lmax). Binding of Ang to
E401A produced a somewhat larger ¯uorescence
increase (69 %) than for the wt inhibitor, whereas
the enhancements were smaller for S289A (38 %),
E344A (24 %), W263A (23 %), W261A (22 %), and
W375A (22 %). Binding of Ang to W318A-hRI
decreased emission by 12 % rather than causing an
increase (Figure 3(b)). In all cases, the ¯uorescence
of the complex was red-shifted with respect to that
of the free inhibitor.
The changes accompanying formation of the
complexes of all hRI variants except for W318A
were suf®cient to allow ¯uorimetric monitoring of
the association process. Binding clearly followed
the usual two-step mechanism (i.e. the dependence
of kobs on [Ang] was hyperbolic) except with
S289A, where kobs was linearly dependent on
[Ang] throughout the range used. We infer from
the data for S289A that K1 for this variant is at
least tenfold higher than for wt hRI or that associ￾ation proceeds by a single step. In either case, ka
represents the slope of the plot of kobs versus [Ang].
Despite the marked change in K1 or mechanism,
the ka value for S289A is only twofold lower than
for wt hRI. The ka for the W375A complex was
decreased similarly and the values for the other
complexes were altered even less (Table 3).
To measure association of W318A-hRI with Ang,
a new competition method was developed based
on the difference between the ¯uorescence emis￾sions of the W318A and wt hRI complexes. In this
method, a mixture of the two inhibitor forms is
combined with Ang, and the proportioning of Ang
between them is determined from the amplitude of
the observed ¯uorescence change together with the
amplitudes measured when each hRI form is com￾bined with Ang separately. The concentrations of
the free inhibitor species are then used to calculate
the ka value for the variant according to the
equation given in Materials and Methods. Fluor￾escence was monitored with the stopped-¯ow
instrument, which is more precise and less suscep￾tible to mixing artifacts than the standard ¯uori￾meter. The ¯uorescence changes measured should
closely approximate those for the entire association
process (i.e. no signi®cant binding should occur
during the mixing time) because the protein con￾centrations are expected to be well below K1 (see
Materials and Methods). The amplitude measured
with a 1:1.5 mixture of wt hRI and W318A was
found to be 40 % of that obtained with wt hRI
alone, and greater than tenfold larger than that
with W318A alone. The ka value for the W318A
complex calculated from these data is 2.0  108
Mÿ1 sÿ1
, identical with that for the wt inhibitor.
Measurements of the rate constants for complex
dissociation revealed signi®cant increases for
W263A (sixfold), W318A (12-fold), W375A (three￾fold), and E401A (threefold); values for W261A,
S289A, and E344A were similar to, or lower than,
that for wt hRI (Table 3). Hence the KD values for
the W263A, W318A, W375A, and E401A com￾plexes are four- to 13-fold higher than for wt
inhibitor (G  0.9-1.5 kcal/mol), and those for
the other three variants are nearly unchanged.
The effects of replacing two additional residues
from the Trp-rich region of hRI, Glu287 and
Lys320, were also determined (Table 3). Although
both contact the 86-92 loop of RNase A, neither
interacts with the Trp89 loop of Ang: Lys320 inter￾acts with a residue on another segment of Ang
(Asp41), whereas Glu287 does not contact Ang at
all. The af®nity of E287A was indistinguishable
from that of wt hRI. Binding of K320A was actu￾ally slightly tighter than for wt inhibitor, largely
due to more rapid association. (As shown below,
these replacements did have a signi®cant effect on
RNase A binding.)
Interactions of multi-residue hRI variants with Ang
We investigated the additivity of mutational
effects in the Trp-rich region of hRI by producing
the two variants: W261A/W263A/W318A (3W)
and W261A/W263A/W318A/W375A (4W).
Tryptophan residues at positions 261, 263, and 318
wrap around the 85 to 87 main-chain of Ang and
are in close proximity in the 3D structure (closest
distances of the pairs 261/263, 261/318, and 263/
318 are 3.9, 4.5, and 7.2 AÊ , respectively) (Table 1,
Figure 2(a)). Trp375 extends this network (distance
to Trp318 is 3.8 AÊ ) and, like Trp318, forms numer￾ous contacts with Pro88 and Trp89 of Ang.
The Trp ¯uorescence emission of free 3W was
50 % lower than for wt hRI (Figure 3(a)), and
addition of Ang produced only a small change
(Figure 3(b)). Therefore, complex association was
studied by using the same competition method as
for W318A; the ka value measured was 2.2-fold
lower than with wt hRI, although the three indi￾vidual replacements had produced decreases of
only 3-20 % (Table 3).
Attempts to determine the kd value for the
3WAng complex by the standard method used
RNase Inhibitor Interactions 505 for the single-site variants were unsuccessful
because the complex dissociated almost completely
during the chromatographic procedure for separ￾ation of bound and free Ang. Dissociation was fol￾lowed instead by ¯uorescence: wt hRI was added
to the 3WAng complex, and the increase in Trp
¯uorescence as Ang dissociated from 3W and
bound to wt inhibitor was measured. This change
occurred over a time-span of hours and was moni￾tored by recording emission spectra periodically.
The increases in ¯uorescence at multiple wave￾lengths during the ®rst apparent half-life were trea￾ted as ®rst-order processes; the resultant ®ts were
good (average r
2  0.998) and the kd value
obtained was 3.07(0.15)  10ÿ4 sÿ1 (t1/2  38(2)
minutes). Therefore, the KD for the 3WAng com￾plex is 3.4 pM. This value is 6250-fold higher
than for the wt complex, whereas an increase of

superadditive, with G  ÿ 2.4 kcal/mol.
The Trp ¯uorescence emission of the quadruple
variant 4W was 68 % less intense than that of wt
hRI (Figure 3(a)), and, as with 3W and W318A,
Ang binding produced no signi®cant increase. In
this case, however, we were unable to measure the
ka value for technical reasons, and only kd was
determined. The half-life of the complex, measured
by the same procedure used for 3W, was 12 min￾utes, i.e. 3.2-fold faster than for the 3WAng com￾plex. This change is similar to that produced by
replacing Trp375 in the context of wt hRI: thus,
introduction of the fourth substitution did not
reveal any superadditivity beyond that observed
with 3W, and we estimate that G for 4W is
6.2 kcal/mol (i.e. G for 3W plus G for
W375A).
Effects of hRI replacements on affinity for RNase A
We investigated the interactions of RNase A
with ten hRI variants containing single-residue
replacements in the Trp-rich region: the nine
whose binding to Ang was characterized, plus
E206A (Table 4). As with wt hRI (Lee et al., 1989a),
no signi®cant change in Trp ¯uorescence was
observed after addition of one molar equivalent of
RNase A to any of the variants. Values of ka and kd
were therefore measured by standard methods
based on the enzymatic activity of RNase A, and
KD values were again calculated as kd/ka. All var￾iants exhibited decreased af®nity for the enzyme,
by factors ranging from 3.8-fold for S289A to 42-
fold for W263A (G  0.8-2.2 kcal/mol).{ These
changes re¯ected faster dissociation and, in all but
three cases (E206A, W263A and W318A), slower
association as well. For two of the variants, S289A
and E344A, the residues replaced do not contact
RNase A in the crystal structure of the complex. It
is surprising that the Glu344 mutation resulted in
one of the largest KD increases.
The complex of RNase A with 3W was also stu￾died. Dissociation was found to be too rapid to
allow accurate quanti®cation of either kd or ka by
the standard procedures, and the KD value was
determined by measuring the effect of inhibitor on
RNase A-catalyzed cleavage of the ¯uorescent sub￾strate 50
-FAM-mAmArUmAmA-C7-QSYTM-7-30
. In
this ultrasensitive assay, it was possible to employ
an extremely low concentration of RNase A
(3 pM), expected to be in the same range as KD,
and a concentration of substrate well below Km;
therefore the inhibition constant could be obtained
directly by ®tting initial velocity data to the
equation for tight-binding inhibition given in
Materials and Methods. The KD value measured
was 8.7 pM, an increase of 202-fold compared to
wt hRI. This change is tenfold less than the
product of the KD increases for the three individ￾ual replacements; thus, the effects of the mut￾ations on RNase A binding are subadditive
(G  1.4 kcal/mol), in contrast with the
superadditivity found with Ang.
Inter-relationship between the Trp-rich and hot
spot regions in the hRIAng complex
The interactions of 3W-hRI with the Ang var￾iants R5A and K40G were investigated to assess
the extent to which the Trp-rich region and the hot
spot containing Arg5 and Lys40 of Ang and the C￾terminal segment of hRI function independently
(Table 5). The kd values were calculated from the
rates of increase in Trp ¯uorescence after addition
of wt hRI to the complexes. Values for ka were
determined by the competition method used above
for the complexes of W318A and 3W with wt Ang.
The KD values derived from these rate constants
were about one million-fold (R5A) and ®ve
million-fold (K40G) higher than for the wt com￾plex. G0
, the difference between the G
value for the complex of 3W with Ang variant and
the sum of G values for the complexes of 3W
with wt Ang and wt hRI with Ang variant, is
ÿ0.9 kcal/mol in both cases. Thus the effects of the
3W triple replacement and each single-residue Ang
substitution are superadditive, although less so
than for many of the multiresidue replacements
within the two interface regions.
Role of hRI Tyr150 in binding Ang
Seven hRI residues outside the C-terminal and
Trp-rich regions contact Ang in the crystal struc￾ture of the complex: Gln10, Cys11, Asp35, Asp36,
Asn93, Tyr150 and Asn406. The ®rst four of these
interact only with Arg31 or Arg32, whose roles in
hRI binding were assessed previously by mutagen￾esis (Shapiro & Vallee, 1992). R31A-Ang had nearly
the same af®nity for hRI as wt Ang, whereas R32A
bound 4.6-fold less tightly. Asn93 and Asn406 of
hRI each form a single van der Waals interaction
with Ang; the contributions of these residues were
considered likely to be small and were not investi￾gated. The OH group of hRI Tyr150 hydrogen
bonds to NH1 of Ang Arg95 and lies slightly
beyond hydrogen-bonding distance from OE1 of
Ang Gln93; it also forms a van der Waals contact
with CD of the latter residue. The importance of
this tyrosine residue was investigated by character￾izing the interaction of the variant Y150A with
Ang. The kd value for the complex was found to be
1.8(0.2)  10ÿ7 sÿ1 i.e. 1.7-fold higher than for the
{ Leland et al. (1998) have reported that wt hRI and the W263A variant inhibit RNase A similarly in an agarose

measured in our study would not have been evident in this assay.

by three- to fourfold (to 1.3 mM and 250 sÿ1
respectively). The calculated KD value is then
0.92 fM (G  0.3(0.1) kcal/mol).
Discussion
Basis for tight binding of hRI to angiogenin
The hRIAng interface buries 2908 AÊ of the sol￾vent-accessible surface areas (ASAs) of the two
proteins (Papageorgiou et al., 1997), considerably
more than the average for protein-protein com￾plexes studied thus far (Lo Conte et al., 1999). The
interface residues on hRI are dispersed throughout
the central cavity of the horseshoe, from Gln10
near the N terminus to Ser460 at the C terminus,
and are located on the upper face of the horseshoe
near the C terminus as well (Figure 1). The contact
residues on Ang are drawn from the enzymatic
active center and several distinct structural
elements outside this site. The degree of shape
complementarity between the hRI and Ang
surfaces at the interface is high, in general, but is
particularly impressive in two regions with concen￾trations of contact residues: that containing hRI
residues 434 to 438 and 460 and the active site of
Ang, and that formed by tryptophan residues at
positions 261, 263 and 318 of hRI and the Trp89
loop of Ang.
The results shown here, in conjunction with ear￾lier mutational data, offer a picture of the binding
energetics that is both simpler and more compli￾cated than that suggested by this analysis of the
crystal structure: simpler in that key contacts are
relatively few in number and are con®ned largely
to one small part of the interface, and more compli￾cated in that many contact residues function coop￾eratively rather than independently, even in some
cases where there is no apparent structural connec￾tion between them.
Energetics as revealed by single-site mutagenesis
The roles of 17 of the 26 contact residues on hRI
and 10 of the 24 on Ang have now been investi￾gated in detail by mutagenesis (Figures 4(a) and 5).
The various substitutions eliminate all of the 12
direct hydrogen bonds and all but four of the 113
van der Waals contacts. In only a few cases
do individual replacements have a substantial
impact on binding (G > 2 kcal/mol): hRI
Asp435 ! Ala (3.5 kcal/mol), hRI Tyr434 ! Ala
(3.3 kcal/mol), Ang Lys40 to Gly (3.2 kcal/mol)
(4.2 kcal/mol for Lys40 ! Gln (Lee & Vallee,
1989a)), and Ang Arg5 ! Ala (2.3 kcal/mol).
None of the other Ang mutations decrease binding

Shapiro & Vallee, 1992).

them (substitutions of His8, Arg32 and His114)
produce G values greater than 0.5 kcal/mol.
Four modi®cations of hRI (replacements of Trp263,
Trp318 and Trp375 by an Ala residue and deletion
of Ser460) diminish binding energy by 1-1.5 kcal/
mol, and three (substitutions of Glu401, Tyr437
and Ile459) reduce it by 0.7-0.9 kcal/mol. The
others (replacements of Tyr150, Trp261, Ser289,
Lys320 and Glu344) have no signi®cant effect on
af®nity. These ®ndings suggest that the hRI-Ang
interface contains a single energetic hot spot,
formed by the hRI segment 434 to 438 and portions
of the Ang active site (the catalytic residue Lys40
and Arg5), and that the contribution of this region
is enhanced by interactions of the neighboring resi￾dues hRI Ser460 and Ile459 with other Ang com￾ponents within (His8 and Gln12) or adjacent to
(Ser37 and Pro38) the active center. The Trp-rich
region of the interface (Trp263, Trp318 and Trp375
of hRI and the 84-89 loop of Ang) appears to
provide a small amount of additional binding
energy, and no other areas seem to play any
appreciable role.
This view of the interface energetics is incom￾plete, however, because the effects of the single￾residue replacements do not account for the enor￾mous free energy of complex formation, 21 kcal/
mol. The shortfall is most dramatically evident
when the Ang side of the complex is considered:
the sum of the G values for the ten Ala or Gly
substitutions performed (Figure 4(a)) is less than
9 kcal/mol, the sum of G values for non-redun￾dant hRI replacements that delete essentially all of
the interactions of another 12 residues (Ser37,
Pro38, Asp41, Glu67, Gly85, Gly86, Ser87, Pro88,
Gln93, Arg95, Ala106 and Gln117) is about 5 kcal/
mol, and the two remaining contact residues
(Arg24 and Arg121) form only one or two van der
Waals interactions and are unlikely to have signi®-
cant roles. The sum of G values obtained by an
analogous treatment focusing on the hRI side of
Figure 4. (a) G values for replacements of hRI (left) and Ang (right) residues in the hRIAng complex. Values
not determined in the present study were reported previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1997, 1999; Shapiro & Vallee, 1989,
1992). (b) G values for replacements of hRI residues in the hRIRNase A complex, as in (a). The value shown for

affected signi®cantly by the replacement.
RNase Inhibitor Interactions 509the complex is also 5G. Moreover, the true dis￾crepancies are even larger: the total binding energy
provided by the contact residues must be higher
than G because G also includes a generic
energy penalty for the decrease in translational
entropy due to association of the two protein mol￾ecules, estimated at 2.4 kcal/mol (Murphy et al.,
1994; Covell & Wallqvist, 1997).
It seems unlikely that contributions from water￾mediated hydrogen bonds can ®ll this gap. Seven
of the 15 water-mediated interactions observed in
the crystal structure were already eliminated by
the replacements cited, preliminary results with the
Ang variants Q93A and des(121-123) (R.S., unpub￾lished data) indicate that removal of another three
has little effect on af®nity, and all but one of the
remaining ®ve are long (53.2 AÊ ). In addition, the
water molecules seen in the hRIAng crystal struc￾ture do not improve the surface complementarity
at the interface (Papageorgiou et al., 1997). Burying
of non-contact residues is also unlikely to account
for the ``missing'' binding energy. Only ®ve resi￾dues (Arg63, Glu264, Asn349 and Glu443 of hRI
and Lys82 of Ang) not involved in intermolecular
interactions undergo losses of ASA greater than
10 AÊ 2 in the complex, and the combined decrease
in hydrophobic ASA for these amino acid residues,
98 AÊ 2
, is 6 % of that for the complex (this calcu￾lation takes into account that only 55 % of the total
ASA cited above is for non-polar components).
Additional burying of the hydrophilic portions of
these residues, only one of which forms a hydro￾gen bond (also present in free RI), is energetically
unfavorable.
Marked discrepancies between G and the sum
of G values for single-site replacements have
been found previously for most protein-protein
complexes examined, but have usually been in the
opposite direction (G4G) from that for the
hRIAng interaction (see, for example, Clackson &
Wells, 1995; Clackson et al., 1998; Dall'Acqua et al.,
1996; Goldman et al., 1997; and Muller et al., 1998).
In either case, the differences suggest that the
effects of many individual mutations are not inde￾pendent. Where G exceeds G, some of the
free energy losses for the replacements may re¯ect
indirect as well as direct effects. Where G is
less than G, as for the hRIAng complex, some of
the disruptive effects of the replacements may be
offset by favorable changes in the interface. In such
instances, the decreases in binding energy
measured for the single-site mutations would rep￾resent underestimates of the actual contributions of
the interactions eliminated.
In attempting to assess whether the energetic
effects of the individual replacements in the
Figure 5. Space-®lled models of hRI (left) and pRI (right) in their complexes with Ang and RNase A, respectively,
with contact residues color-coded according to the loss of binding free energy upon elimination of their interactions:
red, >2 kcal/mol; yellow, 1-2 kcal/mol; white, <1 kcal/mol. Cys375 of pRI has been replaced by Trp, as in hRI. The
general orientations are the same as in Figure 1, but the structures have been rotated somewhat in order to better
show the inner surface of the horseshoes, particularly in the C-terminal half of the molecules; residues can be ident￾i®ed by reference to Figures 1 and 4. Most of the G values shown are for individual Ala replacements or deletion
of RI residues; the values indicated for several hRI residues (H10, C11, D35, D36, S235, and W438 (main-chain)) are
based on the effects of substituting the contacts of these residues on Ang (R31, R32, R31, R32, H84, and R5, respect￾ively) by an Ala residue, and the values for the N-terminal pRI residues Q10, C11, D35, and N89 are based on the
effect of deleting the entire N-terminal segment 1 to 94. The effects of the simultaneous replacements of RI W438,
S439, and E440 in the two complexes (Table 2, Figure 4) cannot be ascribed to loss of any individual residue(s) and
are not indicated (see Discussion).
510 RNase Inhibitor InteractionshRIAng interface are ``reasonable'' in terms of the
crystal structure, one is faced with a general pro￾blem: despite recent progress in the calculation of
interaction energies by theoretical methods (e.g.
Novotny et al. (1997) and Covell & Wallqvist
(1997)), it has not yet proved possible to reliably
predict the energetic contributions of interactions
based purely on structural analysis. No doubt, this
is partially due to the type of indirect effects under
consideration here. However, it also re¯ects
additional complexities of the systems being scruti￾nized, which include solvent as well as the pro￾teins, and an incomplete understanding of the
thermodynamics of the various interactions within
the context of these systems. Despite these limi￾tations, the results of studies with small molecules
and the accumulated database of mutational effects
in proteins suggest some rough guidelines that can
be useful for gauging expectations. Good hydrogen
bonds involving at least one charged partner have
been proposed to contribute 4 kcal/mol of bind￾ing energy, with hydrogen bonds between
uncharged groups providing 0.5-1.7 kcal/mol
(Fersht et al., 1985). Lower energies would be
anticipated when the geometry is suboptimal or
the interaction is not well shielded from solvent.
Another consideration is the mobility of the atoms
involved: if one or both of these has a high B-factor
in the crystal structure, it is doubtful that a strong
interaction has actually been formed. van der
Waals contacts contribute primarily through the
hydrophobic effect, with estimates generally ran￾ging from 24 to 50 cal/mol for each AÊ 2 of non￾polar ASA buried (Chothia, 1974; Nicholls et al.,
1991; Vaughan et al., 1999).
Examination of the hRIAng interaction in light
of these considerations suggests that the effects of
most single-residue replacements are in accord
with qualitative expectations, but that some devi￾ate considerably. All of the G values greater
than 2 kcal/mol fall into the ®rst category. The
Lys40 and Asp435 replacements eliminate two
medium-length, well-buried hydrogen bonds
between these charged residues. Attribution of the
af®nity decreases to removal of these interactions
seems particularly warranted because the G
values for the hRIK40G-Ang, D435-hRIAng, and
D435A-hRIK40G-Ang complexes are all similar
(Figures 4(a) and 6). Substitution of Arg5 also elim￾inates two hydrogen bonds (Table 1), one well bur￾ied but long and the other partially buried but
short. The side-chain of Tyr434, which forms only
van der Waals contacts with Lys40, undergoes an
ASA decrease from 112 AÊ 2 to 8 AÊ 2 in the complex,
potentially explaining the large G for Y434A.
One apparent problem with this interpretation is
that the effects of replacing Tyr434 and Lys40 are
fully additive (Figure 6). However, modeling of the
hRIK40G-Ang complex suggests that in fact del￾etion of the Lys40 side-chain has minimal impact
on the extent to which Tyr434 is buried in the com￾plex (the ASA of Tyr434 in the model is 17 AÊ 2
).
The mutational results also conform to the
guidelines outlined in many cases where less
extensive decreases in af®nity, or none at all, were
measured. hRI Trp263, Trp318 and Trp375, whose
replacements produce G values of 1.0-1.5 kcal/
mol, undergo 34-60 AÊ 2 reductions in hydrophobic
ASA upon complex formation. Substitutions of
Trp261 and Lys320 of hRI, and His84 and Glu108
of Ang barely alter af®nity; these residues form
only van der Waals contacts and the changes in
non-polar ASA attributable to them are quite
small. In four instances (replacements of Arg31
and Arg32 on Ang, and Tyr150 and Ser289 on
hRI), disruption of contacts that technically qualify
as hydrogen bonds had little or no effect. For the
®rst three of these, the B-factors of one or both of
the interaction partners in the crystal are high, and
for the last, the angle is far from optimal.
In one instance, W438A/S439A/E440A-hRI, the
free energy loss (1.8 kcal/mol) seems greater than
expected as a direct consequence of the mutations.
The three side-chains replaced make only two van

RNase Inhibitor Interactions 511der Waals interactions with Ang, and the decrease
in hydrophobic ASA upon complex formation is
negligible. However, deletion of the intramolecular
contacts of Trp438 (hydrophobic packing against
Ile414, Ile436, Met442 and Leu446) might allow the
434 to 438 segment to have greater freedom of
motion, thereby diminishing the strength of its
interactions with Ang.
Finally, there are several examples where bind￾ing energy losses are smaller than might be antici￾pated. Tyr437 undergoes an even larger decrease
in hydrophobic ASA in the complex (from 173 AÊ 2
to 31 AÊ 2
) than does Tyr434, and yet the G value
for Y437A is only 0.8 kcal/mol, i.e. 2.5 kcal/mol
smaller than for Y434A. Replacement of Ang Trp89
by Ala has no effect on binding, although this resi￾due forms a well-ordered, buried hydrogen bond
and its hydrophobic ASA is reduced by 80 AÊ 2
. In
addition, the G values of 1.3 and 0.9 kcal/mol,
respectively, for des(460)-hRI and H8A-Ang are
perhaps out of line with the 2.8-AÊ buried hydrogen
bond between Ser460 and His8 (which is probably
charged at the pH used for kinetic measurements
(Lequin et al., 1997)).
Role of cooperativity in the interface
The free energy shortfalls, both general and
speci®c, described in the preceding section can
potentially be explained by the existence of nega￾tive cooperativity in the hRIAng interface. We
showed previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1997) that
many residues in the hot spot containing the 434 to
438 segment of hRI and Arg5 and Lys40 of Ang
indeed exhibit this type of interrelationship
(Figure 6). The KD increase for the hRI double
variant Y434A/Y437A exceeded the product of
the increases for Y434A and Y437A by 74-
fold (G  ÿ 2.5 kcal/mol). Superadditivities
(G  ÿ 0.9 to ÿ2.4 kcal/mol) were also
observed when Arg5 of Ang was replaced together
with Tyr434 or Asp435, and Lys40 of Ang was
mutated together with Tyr437. Importantly, the
magnitudes of G do not decrease appreciably
when a third residue is also substituted. As a con￾sequence, the losses of binding energy for some of
the triple substitutions were extremely large:
10.1 kcal/mol for Arg5/Tyr434/Asp435, 9.1 kcal/
mol for Lys40/Tyr434/Tyr437, and 8.5 kcal/mol
for Arg5/Tyr434/Tyr437. We have proposed that
superadditivity may arise when replacement of
one residue within a pair or group strengthens the
contacts of others or allows the formation of new
interactions (Chen & Shapiro, 1999). This would
then imply that the energetic contributions of some
of these residues are greater than is apparent from
the single-site variants, even in some instances
where the G value was judged reasonable in
terms of the 3D structure (R5A, K40G, D435A,
Y434A).
Here, we have demonstrated that the functional
coupling in this region of the interface extends
beyond the interactions of the hRI 434 to 438 seg￾ment to include those of a neighboring hRI residue,
Ser460 (Figure 6). The effects of deleting this amino
acid and replacing either Arg5 or Lys40 on Ang
were superadditive, with G  ÿ 1.3 to
ÿ1.5 kcal/mol. Ser460 is not in direct contact with
either Ang residue: the closest distances are 7.6 AÊ
(to Arg5) and 6.2 AÊ (Lys40). However, in each case
there are triangulated contacts between the residue
pairs (involving hRI Trp438 and Tyr434, respect￾ively) that may allow changes at one site to be pro￾pagated to the other.
The present study also reveals negative coopera￾tivity in the Trp-rich region of the hRI-Ang inter￾face (Figure 6). The increase in KD for W261A/
W263A/W318A-hRI is 60-fold greater than the
product of the increases for the three single-residue
variants (G  ÿ 2.4 kcal/mol). None of the
residues replaced contacts any of the others,
although the 261/263 and 261/318 pairs are separ￾ated by only 3.9 AÊ and 4.5 AÊ , respectively. The
observed cooperativity may re¯ect the inherent
malleability of the Ang loop 84-93 and the hRI
tryptophan residues, whose conformations change
considerably upon complex formation, improving
the complementarity of the two protein surfaces
(see Kobe & Deisenhofer (1996) and Papageorgiou
et al. (1997)). The ¯exibility of this region may
allow it to undergo rearrangements to form new or
stronger interactions when individual contact resi￾dues are mutated. An alternative explanation of
the superadditivity, that the triple substitution dis￾rupts interactions of other residues but the individ￾ual replacements did not, can be largely
discounted because: (i) the effects of these replace￾ments on af®nity for RNase A were subadditive
(Table 4); (ii) the effects of the triple substitution
and mutation of Trp375 appear to be fully addi￾tive; and (iii) the G values for replacements of
other residues in this region are small.
The hot spot and Trp-rich regions in the
hRIAng interface are also functionally linked,
although not as strongly as some of the residues
within each of them. The KD increases produced by
replacing Trp261, Trp263 and Trp318 of hRI
together with Arg5 or Lys40 of Ang are both
approximately fourfold larger than the products of
the increases for 3W-hRI and R5A-Ang or K40G￾Ang. These couplings occur over much greater dis￾tances (19-28 AÊ ) than for the intra-regional coop￾erativities, and may be mediated by adjustments in
the RI backbone. The N and C-terminal ends of the
horseshoe are >2 AÊ farther apart in the RNase A
complex than in free RI, suggesting that the struc￾ture is somewhat plastic and can adapt to maxi￾mize ligand interactions (Kobe & Deisenhofer,
1996).
Conclusions and unanswered questions
A major goal of our studies has been to explain
the remarkably high af®nity between hRI and Ang.
The approach taken, mutational mapping of the
crystallographically observed interface, is one that
512 RNase Inhibitor Interactionshas been applied to many protein-protein com￾plexes, but we have emphasized an aspect not
usually examined in detail: the interrelationships
between contact residues, both on the same mol￾ecule and on different molecules, including many
residue pairs or groups that appear to have little
functional connection in the 3D structure. The
cooperativities revealed, together with those
instances where mutational effects con¯ict with
expectations from the 3D structure, underscore the
dif®culty of rigorously assigning all the sources of
binding energy in quantitative terms.
Despite these complications, it is now possible to
propose an accounting of the energetics within the
hRI-Ang interface that yields the appropriate total
amount of free energy. The sum of the G values
for non-redundant single-residue mutations that
eliminate the interactions of hRI residues 434, 435,
437, 438 and 460 in the hot spot is 11 kcal/mol.
The observed superadditivities indicate that the
actual combined contributions of these interactions
is still greater, probably by at least 3 kcal/mol.
Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that this part
of the interface provides 14-15 kcal/mol. Another
6 kcal/mol appears to derive from the Trp-rich
region. This estimate is based on the G value
for the quadruple replacement of Trp261, Trp263,
Trp318 and Trp375, which includes 2.4 kcal/mol
due to superadditivity, and assumes that no other
hRI residues in this region contribute signi®cantly.
The superadditivities of the effects of the Trp261/
Trp263/Trp318 and Arg5 or Lys40 replacements
indicate that residues of one or both of these inter￾face regions may yet provide some additional
energy (1-2 kcal/mol). Elsewhere in the interface,
only the interactions of Ang Arg32 with hRI
appear to supply any further energy (0.9 kcal/
mol). The sum of these energies, taking into con￾sideration the cumulative errors and subtracting
the entropy penalty discussed above, is essentially
equivalent to the total binding energy for the wt
complex of 21 kcal/mol.
Numerous questions remain to be answered.
The physical bases for the cooperative effects are
unknown. These may involve changes in protein
conformation or solvent structure that could be
illuminated by crystallographic studies on com￾plexes of hRI and/or Ang variants. It is striking
that some of the strongest functional linkages (hRI
Tyr437 with hRI Tyr434 and Ang Lys40) are for
residues that are separated by at least 13 AÊ and
have no obvious structural connection other than
that they lie on or interact with the same tetrapep￾tide segment of the inhibitor. Both local and global
(up to 17 AÊ ) responses to replacements in other
protein-protein interfaces have been observed
in crystal structures (local: lysozyme-antibody
(Chacko et al., 1995; Ysern et al., 1994) and barnase￾barstar (Vaughan et al., 1999) complexes; global:
growth hormone-receptor complex (Atwell et al.,
1997)). Other factors that may underlie the super￾additivity, such as changes in electrostatic ®elds or
protein dynamics, would be more dif®cult to
evaluate experimentally. We also note that only a
small percentage of the potential functional con￾nectivities between contact residues in the
hRIAng complex have been investigated so far.
Although we believe that the most important of
these have already been explored, it is possible
that unsuspected cooperativities exist and that the
proposed energetic map would have to be modi-
®ed accordingly.
Basis for tight binding of hRI to RNase A
The overall docking of RNase A to RI resembles
that of Ang, and the ligand forms a similar number
of interactions with inhibitor residues lining the
central cavity and on the upper face of the horse￾shoe: 18 direct hydrogen bonds or salt-links and 99
van der Waals contacts, plus at least four water￾mediated hydrogen bonds. Again the contacts are
distributed widely over both proteins and the ASA
buried is large (2878 AÊ 2
). The main regions of
ligand and inhibitor involved are the same as in
the Ang complex: i.e. the enzymatic active site and
86-91 loop of RNase A and the C-terminal segment
and Trp-rich region of RI. Nonetheless, only two of
the hydrogen bonds formed and <30 % of the van
der Waals contacts in the two complexes are analo￾gous, even using extremely relaxed criteria for the
comparison. Moreover, the surface complementari￾ties in the two interfaces differ in striking ways
(Papageorgiou et al., 1997). The complementarity of
the C-terminal region of RI (401-460) to RNase A is
high over a broader region than for Ang, consistent
with the greater number of RI residues (16 versus
10) and interactions (79 versus 44) involved. In
addition, the surface of the Trp-rich region of RI is
much less complementary to RNase A than to
Ang. From this analysis, it appears that the role of
the RI C-terminal region may be even more predo￾minant in the RNase A complex than in the com￾plex with Ang. However, as for the interaction of
RI with Ang, the mutagenesis data collected here
and in previous studies may undermine the simple
structure-based view.
Energetics in the hRIRNase A interface as
revealed by mutagenesis
The energetic effects of replacing or deleting 24
of the 28 contact residues for RNase A on hRI have
been determined so far (Figure 5). Twenty of the
residues were mutated in hRI individually or in
groups (Figure 4(b)), and the others (His10, Cys11,
Asp35, Asn93) were eliminated in pRI by deletion
of the N-terminal segment through amino acid
residue 94 (Hofsteenge et al., 1991). The residues
not yet examined (Asp121, Val409, Gly410 and
Asp411) form a total of two hydrogen bonds and
nine van der Waals contacts. Therefore, the vast
majority of the RI side of the interface has been
explored. In contrast, the effects of truncating only
one contact residue on RNase A, Lys7, have been
measured (Neumann & Hofsteenge, 1994). Leland
RNase Inhibitor Interactions 513et al. (1998) and Suzuki et al. (1999) have enlarged
interface residues 88 of RNase A and 89 of human
pancreatic RNase, respectively. The extensive
decreases in af®nity measured probably re¯ect the
introduction of steric clashes, as intended, rather
than simple loss of the interactions of the residues
replaced.)
The single-residue RI mutations in general
reduce af®nity for RNase A much more severely
than that for Ang. In ®ve cases (versus two for the
Ang complex), the G values are above 2 kcal/
mol: Tyr434 ! Ala, Asp435 ! Ala, deletion of
Ser460, Tyr437 ! Ala, and Trp263 ! Ala. Another
seven replacements (versus four in the Ang com￾plex) produce free energy losses of 1-2 kcal/mol:
Glu206, Trp261, Glu287, Trp318, Lys320, Trp375
and Glu401 to Ala. Indeed, only three of the G
values measured (for substitutions of Cys408 and
Ile459 and deletion of residues 1 to 94) were
40.5 kcal/mol.
In constructing a map of the energetics in the
RIRNase A interface based on these results, the
problem faced is the opposite of that presented by
the Ang complex. Although the effects of
mutations in the C-terminal segment of RI are par￾ticularly large, replacements throughout most of
the rest of the interface also diminish af®nity con￾siderably. As a consequence, G for the indi￾vidual variants exceeds G for the wt complex by
far, 31.2 kcal/mol versus 18.2 kcal/mol. This indi￾cates that many interface components on RI do not
function independently in binding RNase A, and
that the direct contributions of some of the residues
replaced are lower than the energy losses
measured.
Such overestimates seem especially likely to
have occurred for Y434A, des(460), and W438A/
S439A/E440A (G  5.9 kcal/mol, 3.5 kcal/mol,
and 2.0 kcal/mol, respectively). The hydrogen
bond of Tyr434 has been shown to be unimportant
(Chen & Shapiro, 1999) and the decrease in hydro￾phobic ASA for this residue (from 73 to 6 AÊ 2
) and
its contact partners upon complex formation is not
substantial. Ser460 forms hydrogen bonds with
Lys7 and Gln11, but neither is also a charge-charge
interaction, the bond with Lys7 has high solvent
accessibility, and that with Gln11 is long (3.3 AÊ ).
The high G value for the 438/439/440 triple
variant probably re¯ects indirect effects, as pro￾posed above for the Ang complex.
The magnitudes of most other energy losses
accord better with the structural observations.
Replacements of Trp261 and Trp263 yield G
values of 1.3 and 2.2 kcal/mol, respectively; these
residues each form one non-optimal hydrogen
bond and undergo moderate (37-54 AÊ 2
) reductions
in ASA in the complex. G for mutation of
Glu206, which deletes a partially exposed hydro￾gen bond, is 1 kcal/mol. Tyr437, whose replace￾ment diminishes the binding energy by 2.6 kcal/
mol, forms two hydrogen bonds and its hydro￾phobic ASA decreases from 102 to 6 AÊ 2 in the com￾plex. Most of the contribution of this residue is
through the hydrogen bonds (Chen & Shapiro,
1999). Replacements of Lys320, Glu401, and
Arg457 of hRI produce only moderate G
values, although all of these residues appear to
form interactions that satisfy the distance and
angle requirements for hydrogen bonds and all are
also salt-links. However, in each case at least one
of the contact partners is extremely ¯exible (B-fac￾tor > 90 AÊ 2
). Deletion of the 1 to 94 segment of RI
and replacements of Cys408 and Ile459 have little
impact on af®nity. None of these structural altera￾tions is expected to affect ASA signi®cantly and
the putative hydrogen bonds eliminated
(Asn89(RI) to Asn24(RNase) and Cys408(RI) to
Lys66(RNase)) are solvent-exposed and, in the lat￾ter case, not well ordered.
In the crystal structure of the pRIRNase A com￾plex, Asp435 interacts with a sulfate ion and Val43
rather than with the catalytic lysine residue (Lys41)
as in the hRIAng complex. However, replacement
of Asp435 produces equivalent losses in af®nity for
RNase A and Ang (Chen & Shapiro, 1997),
suggesting that in the absence of sulfate or similar
anions (as in the kinetic experiments) Asp435
would form hydrogen bonds with Lys41 of RNase
A. This possibility was also raised by Kobe &
Deisenhofer (1996), who noted that the sulfate ion
might cause other rearrangements in this part of
the interface as well.
The hRIRNase A complex is also sensitive to
changes on the periphery of the interface. The
G values for replacements of Ser289 and
Glu344 were 0.8 kcal/mol and 1.6 kcal/mol,
respectively; these residues are 4.5-5.4 AÊ from their
nearest neighbors on RNase A, Gly86 and Lys91,
and neither of them contacts any interface com￾ponent on RI. Thus the structure provides no
explanation for the increases in KD. Af®nity losses
due to mutations of non-interface residues have
been described for other protein-protein systems
(e.g. see Schreiber et al., 1997; Clackson et al., 1998;
and Otzen & Fersht, 1999). However, in most of
these cases the replacements deleted important
intramolecular interactions with contact residues or
were thought to affect folding. In contrast to our
®ndings for the hRIRNase A complex, substi￾tutions of four residues on the periphery of the
hRIAng interface (Glu287, Gln430, Val432 and
Arg457 of hRI, which are 8.8, 3.7, 4.2 and 5.7 AÊ ,
respectively, from the nearest Ang residue) had no
discernible effect.
Cooperativity in the hRIRNase A interface
The discrepancy between G and G for the
complex of hRI with RNase A, like that for the
complex with Ang, can potentially derive from
cooperativity between contact residues. However,
the cooperativity here would need to be positive
rather than negative, so that mutation of one resi￾due impairs the interactions of others or, approach￾ing from the opposite direction, the interactions of
one residue support those of others. The presence
514 RNase Inhibitor Interactionsof such effects in the hRIRNase A complex has
not been explored as extensively as for the Ang
complex, but in all instances where the indepen￾dence of mutational effects was evaluated, non￾additivities of the type anticipated were measured.
We found previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1997) that
the losses in binding energy for replacements of
the hRI residue pairs Tyr434/Asp435 and Tyr434/
Tyr437 are subadditive, by 2.4 and 1.3 kcal/mol,
respectively (Figure 6). This suggested that the
unexpectedly large energy loss associated with the
Tyr434 substitution might re¯ect indirect effects on
Asp435 and Tyr437, and that part of the function
of Tyr434 is to enhance the interactions of these
other residues.
Here, we report that the energy losses for re￾placements of Trp261, Trp263, and Trp318 are also
subadditive, by 1.4 kcal/mol. This contrasts with
the superadditive effects of these mutations on
binding of Ang, but may have an analogous struc￾tural basis: the proximity of the three Trp residues
in the complex (261/263, 261/318, and 263/318
distances are 3.5, 4.4, and 7.4 AÊ , respectively) and
the ¯exibility of these residues and the RNase A
loop with which they interact.
The different types of non-additivities observed
for the complexes of RI with Ang and RNase A
might be a natural consequence of the evolution of
the inhibitor to bind extremely tightly to multiple
protein targets whose sequences are only 25-35 %
identical. A requirement for broad speci®city
places considerable constraints on the extent to
which the interactions with any particular ligand
can be optimized. Therefore, mutation of a speci®c
interface residue might produce opposite effects
on contacts of other residues in the RIAng and
RIRNase A complexes: enhancing them in the
®rst case (resulting in superadditivity) by destabi￾lizing an unfavorable conformation, while impair￾ing them in the second (resulting in subadditivity)
by destabilizing a favorable conformation.
Conclusions
The map of the distribution of binding energy in
the hRIRNase A interface suggested by the com￾bined structural and mutational data is less satis￾factory than for the Ang complex. In part, this is
due to the nature and magnitude of the cooperativ￾ity in this interface, both demonstrated and
implied, which undermines any efforts to correlate
G values with contributions of speci®c inter￾actions. The sum of G values for mutations of
the four residues in the C-terminal segment of hRI
that appear to play key roles, Tyr434, Asp435,
Tyr437 and Ser460, is 15.6 kcal/mol. The combined
energy loss for truncations of additional contact
residues in this segment, Gln430, Val432, Trp438,
Ser439, Glu440, Arg457 and Ile459, is another
4 kcal/mol, bringing the subtotal for this region
alone to 19.6 kcal/mol (versus 20.6 kcal/mol, i.e.
the sum of G for the complex plus the entropy
penalty). However, it is clear that several subtrac￾tions are warranted. In the two cases where single
and double variants were compared, subadditiv￾ities totaling 3.7 kcal/mol were measured, and it is
likely that much of the losses for substitutions of
438, 439 and 440 are due to indirect effects. If other
pairs and groups of these residues in this region
are also connected, the local ``concentration'' of
free energy might be reduced even further. None￾theless, the energy losses for mutations of hRI 434,
435 and 460 are well beyond those found for re￾placements outside this region, and our results
indicate, minimally, that the effects of some of
these other substitutions are also subadditive.
Therefore, it still seems reasonable to consider the
C-terminal region of hRI as a major hot spot in the
binding interface. A more complete understanding
of the basis for tight binding between RI and
RNase A must await studies on the interrelation￾ships between additional contact residues on the
two protein molecules and on the structural
changes induced by the various mutations.
Finally, we note that interpretive dif®culties of
the type encountered here for the complexes of hRI
with Ang and RNase A are not con®ned to them,
but seem to pertain to many protein-protein inter￾actions. Indeed, G values for extensive sets of
single-site mutations rarely ``add up'' correctly,
and examples of functional couplings between resi￾dues on the same protein partner have been found
in most protein-protein complexes where this ques￾tion has been examined (e.g. Kelley & O'Connell,
1993; and Jin & Wells, 1994). Moreover, non-inter￾acting residues on different partners have often
been demonstrated to be linked, even in numerous
instances where there are no direct or triangulated
contacts between them (LiCata & Ackers, 1995;
Schreiber & Fersht, 1995; Goldman et al., 1997).
Materials and Methods
Materials
Primers were synthesized by Genosys or Promega.
Human Ang (native Pyrl form), [14C-(U)]Ang (2700
cpm/mg), the Ang variants R5A and K40G, wt hRI, and
the hRI variants E287A, K320A, E401A, R457A, and
des(460) were produced in Escherichia coli as described
previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1997; Lee & Vallee, 1990;
Shapiro & Vallee, 1992). The RNase A substrate 50
-FAM￾mAmArUmAmA-C7-QSYTM-7- 30 was a generous gift
from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA)
(FAM is 50
,6-carboxy¯uorescein, rU is ribouridine, mA is
20
-O-methyl-riboadenosine, and QSYTM-7 (Molecular
Probes; Eugene, OR) is a rhodamine-based ¯uorescence
quencher). Sources of all other materials and procedures
for protein quanti®cation are given by Chen & Shapiro
(1999).
Site-directed mutagenesis and production of
variant proteins
Fragments of hRI cDNA containing the desired
mutations were generated by overlap extension PCR (Ho
et al., 1989). The template was pTRP-PRI (Lee & Vallee,
RNase Inhibitor Interactions 5151989b) for all mutants except 3W and 4W, where the
templates were the mutant plasmids encoding W318A
and 3W, respectively. The external ¯anking primers
were those listed previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1999),
except with Y150A and E206A, where 50
-AACTAG￾TACGCAAGTTCA-30 (from the 50
-non-coding region)
and the antisense strand internal primer for W318A
described below were used. The internal mutagenic pri￾mers were the following, listed for each of the mutants
indicated as sense oligonucleotide (numbered according
to the hRI cDNA sequence (Lee et al., 1988)), followed by
antisense oligonucleotide, and ®nally the replacement
codon(s): Y150A, 562-586, 560-584, GCT; E206A, 730-752,
728-750, GCT; W261A, 895-918, 893-916, GCT; W263A,
901-925, 900-923, GCT; S289A, 979-1004, 977-1001, GCT;
W318A, 1067-1091, 1065-1088, GCT; E344A, 1144-1169,
1143-1166, GCT; W375A and 4W, 1237-1261, 1236-1258,
GCT; 3W, 889-925, 889-923, GCT for both replacement
codons; Q430A/V432A, 1403-1436, 1397-1431, GCG
(430), GCC (432); W438A/S439A/E440A, 1426-1460,
1420-1455, GCG (438), GCT (439), GCG (440); and I459A,
1493-1517, 1486-1510, GCT. The ®nal PCR products were
digested with StuI and either P¯MI (Y150A and E206A)
or EcoRI (all others) and ligated into pTRP-PRI that had
been cleaved with the same enzymes. Plasmids for
expression of Ang variants were generated from pAng3
(Shapiro & Vallee, 1992) by using a Quick Change kit
(Stratagene). The mutagenic primers were 50
-GTTA￾CAACTTGCAAACTTGCTGGGGGGTCCCCGTGGCCG￾30 and 50
-CGGCCACGGGGACCCCCCAGCAAGTTTG￾CAAGTTGTAAC-30 (H84A) and 50

C-30 (W89A); these primers also introduce a silent
mutation that eliminates a BamHI site and thereby facili￾tates screening of transformants. Sequencing of ampli®ed
regions in all cases con®rmed the presence of the
intended mutations and the absence of any spurious
changes. hRI and Ang variants were expressed in E. coli,
puri®ed to homogeneity (as judged by SDS-PAGE), and
stored as described previously (Lee & Vallee, 1990); the
®nal chromatography of all hRI variants was performed
with RNase A-Sepharose.
Kinetics
Kinetic parameters were determined at 25 C in 0.1 M
Mes (pH 6.0) containing 0.1 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA,
supplemented with RNase-free bovine serum albumin
(BSA) and/or DTT as listed in the references cited
below. The enzymatic activity of RNase A was measured
spectrophotometrically with 75 mM CpA or CpG as the
substrate and 10 mg/ml of BSA (Witzel & Barnard, 1962);
Ang has no detectable activity in this assay.
Rate constants for dissociation of all inhibitor-ligand
complexes except for those of 3W-hRI and 4W-hRI were
determined by methods described in detail previously.
In all of these procedures, a scavenger for free inhibitor
was added to the complex, and the appearance of free
ligand was followed by physical techniques or by enzy￾matic activity. For RNase A complexes, the scavenger
was Ang and free RNase A was quanti®ed by activity
toward CpA (Lee et al., 1989b). For the complexes of
H84A-Ang and W89A-Ang with wt hRI and R5A-Ang
with des(460)-hRI, RNase A was the scavenger and free
Ang variant was quanti®ed by Mono S chromatography
(Lee et al., 1989b). For the complexes of wt Ang, 14
C￾labeled Ang was used for initial complex formation, the
scavenger was unlabeled Ang, and bound and free
radiolabeled Ang were separated chromatographically
and quanti®ed by scintillation counting (Chen &
Shapiro, 1997). Dissociation of the complex of K40G-Ang
with des(460)-hRI was monitored by ¯uorescence spec￾troscopy, with W89M-Ang as the scavenger (Chen &
Shapiro, 1999). Dissociation of the complexes of Ang and
Ang variants with 3W and 4W (0.1 mM) was measured
by modi®cations of this ¯uorescence technique in which
wt hRI is added as scavenger for free ligand and the
increase in Trp ¯uorescence is monitored. In this exper￾iment, there is an instantaneous rise in ¯uorescence due
to the presence of free wt hRI, followed by a slower
increase as Ang or Ang variant dissociates from the hRI
variant and binds to wt inhibitor; the binding step is suf-
®ciently rapid that the slow ¯uorescence increase
observed re¯ects only dissociation of the original com￾plex. The scavenger was used in only approximately
twofold excess because of its high ¯uorescence and cal￾culations were based on the ®rst half-life of dissociation.
For the wt Ang complexes, emission spectra were
recorded every 3-20 minutes and rate constants were
obtained by ®tting the readings at each of four wave￾lengths (345, 350, 355 and 360 nm) to a single-exponen￾tial process with SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS). The readings for
the 3W complex were corrected for a slow (1 % per hour)
¯uorescence increase measured with a control sample
prepared by mixing the same concentrations of wt hRI
and Ang, and then adding 3W; this increase may re¯ect
instrument instability or evaporation of sample. No cor￾rection was required for the 4W complex, which disso￾ciated more quickly. Dissociation of the complexes of 3W
with Ang variants was monitored continuously with a
stopped-¯ow ¯uorimeter (see below), and the rate con￾stants were again calculated by treating the data as a
single-exponential process.
Rate constants for association of all Ang or Ang var￾iant complexes except for those involving W89A-Ang,
W318A-hRI, or 3W-hRI were determined by using a
stopped-¯ow ¯uorimeter as detailed previously (Chen &
Shapiro, 1997; Lee et al., 1989a). The observed ¯uor￾escence change could be ®tted to a single-exponential
process in all cases. Rate constants for association of the
complexes of Ang with W318A-hRI and 3W-hRI and
Ang variants with 3W were obtained by measuring com￾petition between wt and variant hRI for ligand with the
stopped-¯ow instrument. One syringe contained 50 nM
Ang or Ang variant and the other a mixture of 50 nM wt
hRI and 50-75 nM hRI variant; equal volumes were
mixed and the resultant increases in Trp ¯uorescence
were measured. The concentrations of bound and free
wt hRI and hRI variant were then calculated from
the amplitude of this increase (Fmix) together with the
amplitudes observed when ligand was combined with
wt and variant hRI separately: [wtAng]/
[Ang]T  (Fmix ÿ Fvar)/(Fwt ÿ Fvar); [wt]F  [wt]T ÿ
[wtAng]  [varAng]; [var]F  [var]T ÿ [varAng],
where wt and var refer to wild-type and variant hRI,
respectively, and F and T denote total and free, respect￾ively. The ka value for the variant complex was then
obtained from the equation ka,var  ka,wtln([var]T/
[var]F)/ln([wt]T/[wt]F). This equation (Lee et al., 1989a) is
valid as long as the protein concentrations are well
below K1, a condition that is expected to be satis®ed,
since the K1 values for all AnghRI complexes examined
thus far are 5140 nM (in most instances >300 nM). A
single concentration of hRI variant (yielding a 33-60 %
reduction in ¯uorescence amplitude compared to that for
wt hRI) was used in each experiment, and at least six
replicate measurements were performed.
516 RNase Inhibitor InteractionsValues of ka for the complexes of RNase A with hRI
variants were determined from the rate constants for the
corresponding Ang complexes by measuring the compe￾tition between the two ligands for inhibitor in a spectro￾photometric assay of RNase A activity (Lee et al., 1989a).
The value for the complex of H84A-Ang with wt
hRI was determined from the rate constant for the
hRIRNase A complex by the same procedure.
KD values for all complexes except that of 3W-hRI
with RNase A were calculated from the rate constants
for dissociation and association (KD  kd/ka). The KD
value for the 3 WRNase complex was determined by
measuring the effect of 3W on cleavage of the substrate
FAM-mAmArUmAmA-C7-QSY-7. The enzymatic reac￾tion was followed by monitoring the ¯uorescence
increase that occurs upon separation of the 50 ¯uorescent
group FAM from the 30 quenching group QSY-7. This
assay of RNase A activity is a minor modi®cation of the
method reported by Keleman et al. (1999); a similar ¯uor￾escence-based assay was used previously to study the
interaction of RNase A with wt pRI (Zelenko et al., 1994).
The RNase A concentration employed was 3 pM, the
concentration range of 3W was 15-50 pM, and substrate
was 0.1 mM (well below Km). KD values were calculated
by ®tting the data to the equation for tight-binding inhi￾bition (Morrison, 1969):
vi  v0=2EtfKD  I ÿ Et
2  4KDEt
1=2 ÿ KD  I ÿ Etg
with SigmaPlot 4.0, where vi and v0 are initial velocities
(<5 % of the reaction) in the presence and absence of
inhibitor, respectively, and Et and I are the total enzyme
and inhibitor concentrations, respectively. RNase A and
3W were preincubated for 15 minutes prior to addition
of substrate.
The G values for complex formation were calculated
as ÿRT lnKD. The G values associated with amino
acid replacements were calculated as ÿRTln(KD,wt/
KD,var). The G values for multiple-residue variants
represent the sum of G values for the single-residue
variants minus the G value measured for the mul￾tiple-residue variant. Standard errors for KD values and
free energies were calculated as described previously
(Chen & Shapiro, 1999).
Fluorescence measurements
Fluorescence spectra of proteins and their complexes
were measured with a Jobin Yvon-Spex FluoroMax-2
¯uorimeter. Excitation was at 285 nm, and emission was
recorded from 300 to 400 nm. Time-based acquisition of
protein ¯uorescence data on this instrument and on the
stopped-¯ow ¯uorimeter (Applied Photophysics) were
conducted as detailed previously (Chen & Shapiro,
1999). Kinetic assays of RNase activity toward FAM￾mAmArUmAmA-C7-QSY-7 were performed with an
excitation wavelength of 495 nm (1 nm slit) and emission
wavelength of 525 nm (5 nm slit).
Structural analysis and modeling
ASAs were calculated with the program Quanta (Mol￾ecular Simulations) using a 1.4 AÊ radius spherical probe.
Areas reported for free RI were calculated from the free
pRI crystal structure (PDB code 2BNH (Kobe &
Deisenhofer, 1996)) except that the value for hRI residue
Trp375, which is substituted by Cys in pRI, is for the
``free'' hRI structure obtained by removing Ang from the
hRIAng complex (Papageorgiou et al., 1997). Values for
other RI residues in these two structures did not differ
appreciably. ASAs for free Ang were computed from the
Pyr1 Ang crystal structure (PDB code 1B1I (Leonidas
et al., 1999)). Replacements of Ang Lys40 by Gly in the
structure of the hRIAng complex and pRI Cys375 in the
pRIRNase A complex were performed with Quanta.
