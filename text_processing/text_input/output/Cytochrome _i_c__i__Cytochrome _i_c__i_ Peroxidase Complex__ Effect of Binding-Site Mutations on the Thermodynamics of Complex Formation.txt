ABSTRACT: The cytochrome c/cytochrome c peroxidase system has been extensively investigated as a
model for long-range electron transfer in biology. Two models for the structure of the one-to-one
cytochrome c/cytochrome c peroxidase complex in solution exist: one is based upon computer docking
of the two proteins and the second is based upon the structure of the complex in the crystalline state.
Titration calorimetry is used to investigate the interaction of horse ferricytochrome c with baker’s yeast
cytochrome c peroxidase and with six cytochrome c peroxidase mutants. Five of the six peroxidase mutants
eliminate a negative charge in the cytochrome c binding site by replacing a side-chain carboxylate with
an amide. The sixth mutation replaces a surface alanine residue with phenylalanine. The binding affinity
between cytochrome c and the cytochrome c peroxidase mutants varies from no significant change in
comparison to the wild-type enzyme to a 4-fold decrease in the equilibrium association constant. The
pattern of decreasing cytochrome c binding affinity for the cytochrome c peroxidase mutants is consistent
with the cytochrome c binding domain defined by X-ray crystallography [Pelletier, H., & Kraut, J. (1992)
Science 258, 1748-1755]. For those mutants which have lower affinity for cytochrome c, the lower
affinity is due to a decrease in the entropy change upon complex formation, consistent with the difference
in hydration of carboxylate and amide groups.
Electron transfer between redox proteins is an important
process in biological systems. Electron transfer occurs both
within static protein complexes such as the four multisubunit,
membrane-bound complexes which form the mitochondrial
electron transport chain and via dynamic protein complexes
such as those between cytochrome c and cytochrome c
peroxidase (CcP).1 In dynamic electron transfer complexes,
the reaction partners form an association complex, electron
transfer occurs within the complex, and the reaction partners
dissociate. These dynamic complexes allow reducing equiva￾lents to be transferred via diffusion of small redox-active
proteins such as cytochrome c. Specificity in electron
transfer is determined both by complex formation between
reactants (protein-protein recognition) and by the rate of
electron transfer within the protein complex.
The cytochrome c/cytochrome c peroxidase system has
been extensively investigated as a model for electron transfer
within dynamic protein complexes (McLendon, 1988). The
cytochrome c/CcP system has a number of properties which
make it a useful model for electron transfer. Both proteins
are water soluble and easy to isolate (Brautigan et al., 1978;
Vitello et al., 1990). Both proteins are small; horse cyto￾chrome c has a molecular weight of 12 400 (Bushnell et al.,
1990) and yeast CcP has a molecular weight of 34 200
(Poulos et al., 1980). Each protein consists of a single
polypeptide chain and a single heme; the crystallographic
structures of the two proteins are known (Bushnell et al.,
1990; Poulos et al., 1980). Horse cytochrome c is a basic
protein, pI ) 10.2 (Marini et al., 1967), with its net charge
dominated by 19 lysine residues. CcP is an acidic protein,
pI ) 5.25 (Yonetani, 1967), with 45 glutamate and aspartate
residues. The binding affinity between cytochrome c and
CcP decreases with increasing ionic strength consistent with
the interaction between oppositely charged proteins (Vitello
& Erman, 1987).
In the late 1970s, Margoliash and co-workers (Kang et
al., 1978) were able to define the CcP-binding domain on
the surface of horse cytochrome c by using derivatives of
horse cytochrome c modified at individual lysine residues.
Two types of derivatives were developed: trinitrophenyl
derivatives which neutralized the positive charge on the
lysine residue and carboxydinitrophenyl derivatives which
introduced a negatively charged carboxylate at the lysine
location. The CcP-catalyzed oxidation of the modified
cytochromes c was slower than or equal to unmodified horse
cytochrome c at pH 6.0, 0.05 M ionic strength. The
inhibition was in the order of modification at residues 72 >
86 > 87 > 13 ) 27 > 8, leading to the conclusion that the
CcP-interaction domain of horse cytochrome c included
lysine residues 72, 86, 87, 13, and 27 with lysine 8 being
near the periphery. These residues surround the solvent￾exposed edge of the heme group in cytochrome c.
With the elucidation of the crystal structure of CcP, Poulos
and Kraut (1980) made the first attempt at defining the

model of the complex was proposed on the basis of the visual
docking of the two proteins with the aid of a computer
graphics display system. The model was determined by
optimizing interactions between carboxylate groups on the
surface of CcP with the lysine residues surrounding the
solvent-exposed heme edge on cytochrome c identified by
Kang et al. (1978) as being within the CcP-binding domain
on cytochrome c. The model paired aspartates 37, 79, and
217 of CcP with lysines 13, 27, and 72 on cytochrome c,
respectively. Use of the refined crystal structures of CcP
and tuna cytochrome c altered the model slightly (Poulos &
Finzel, 1984). In the refined model, strong interactions were
predicted between aspartates 33, 37, and 217 on CcP and
lysines 8, 13, and 72 on cytochrome c, respectively.
Pelletier and Kraut (1992) reported crystal structures of a
horse cytochrome c/CcP complex and a yeast iso-1 cyto￾chrome c/CcP complex. The two complexes were crystal￾lized under different salt concentrations, and there are small
differences in the relative orientation of cytochrome c to CcP
in the two complexes. In the crystal structure of the horse
cytochrome c/CcP complex, Glu-35, Asn-38, and Glu-290
on CcP interact with lysines 87, 8, and 72 on cytochrome c,
respectively. The CcP-binding domain on the surface of
horse cytochrome c is nearly identical to that predicted by
Kang et al. (1978). However, the cytochrome c binding
domain on CcP is quite different from that predicted by
Poulos and Kraut (1980) and Poulos and Finzel (1984). A
comparison of the cytochrome c binding sites on CcP
determined by the computer graphics docking model (Poulos/
Finzel/Kraut site) and by X-ray crystallography (Pelletier/
Kraut site) is shown in Figure 1. The two binding sites
approach one another near the center of the figure, where
five of the six residues between positions 32 and 37 are
negatively charged. However, the two sites do not overlap,
and it is possible to simultaneously bind a cytochrome c at
each site without steric constraint.
The conditions used to determine the structure of the horse
cytochrome c/CcP complex were intricate (Pelletier & Kraut,
1992). The mole ratio of CcP to horse cytochrome c in the
crystals was consistently greater than one. Two CcP
molecules and a maximum of one and a half horse cyto￾chrome c molecules were observed in each asymmetric unit
of the crystal. One CcP and one horse cytochrome c within
the asymmetric unit form a well-ordered structure, and this
cytochrome c/CcP pair is the basis for the one-to-one horse
cytochrome c/CcP structure. The structure of the second CcP
molecule within the asymmetric unit could be solved
although the structure of the second cytochrome c could not.
The best approximation for the interaction of the second
cytochrome c and CcP is that cytochrome c is located near
Leu-294 of CcP. In addition, there are CcP/CcP interactions
within the crystal. Lysine residues on the back side of the
first CcP molecule interact with the putative high-affinity
cytochrome c binding site on the second CcP molecule,
specifically Asp-34, Glu-35, and Glu-290. These interactions
cause some concern about the impact of crystal forces in
determining the structure of the CcP/horse cytochrome c
complex and whether the horse cytochrome c/CcP complex
in the crystal is the same as the complex in solution. In this
paper we report on calorimetric studies of the interaction
between horse cytochrome c and CcP mutants in solution
designed to probe the high-affinity cytochrome c binding
site on CcP. Our conclusion is that the structure of the one￾to-one horse cytochrome c/CcP complex in solution is
consistent with that found in the crystal (Pelletier & Kraut,
1992).
Binding of cytochrome c to wild-type CcP is characterized
by a small unfavorable enthalpy change and dominated by
a large positive entropy change (Kresheck et al., 1995). These
thermodynamic parameters are consistent with the release
of solvent upon complex formation. In this study we have
also determined the effect of eliminating negatively charged
sites within the cytochrome c binding domain on the surface
of CcP in terms of the thermodynamic parameters for
complex formation. Conversion of binding-site carboxylates
to amides has no significant effect on the enthalpy change
for complex formation. The decrease in affinity is due to a
decrease in the entropy change, consistent with weaker
hydration of the amides in comparison to the carboxylate
residues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Wild-type yeast CcP was isolated as previously described
(Vitello et al., 1990). CcP solutions were prepared by
dissolving the crystalline enzyme into 0.050 M ionic strength
buffers, pH 6.0 (0.010 M potassium phosphate with added
KNO3 to adjust ionic strength). Samples were dialyzed
against four changes of buffer at a buffer/sample ratio of
>100. After dialysis, samples were centrifuged at 17 000g
to remove any insoluble material. CcP concentrations were
determined spectroscopically using an absorptivity of 98
mM-1 cm-1 at 408 nm (Vitello et al., 1990). PZ values for
the three preparations used in this study were 1.25, 1.29,
and 1.30. Absorbance ratios at 408/380 and 620/647 nm
were 1.50 ( 0.01 and 0.74 ( 0.01, respectively, indicating

represent the cytochrome c binding site originally determined by
visual docking of cytochrome c peroxidase and cytochrome c using
computer graphic techniques (Poulos & Kraut, 1980; Poulos &
Finzel, 1984). This binding site is referred to as the Poulos/Finzel/
Kraut binding site in the text. The residues in white define the
cytochrome c binding site, determined by X-ray analysis of two
cytochrome c/CcP complexes (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992). The binding
site in white is referred to as the Pelletier/Kraut binding site in the
text.
Cytochrome c/Cytochrome c Peroxidase Complex Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 13, 1997 4055that the CcP preparations were five-coordinate, high-spin
Fe(III) forms (Vitello et al., 1990).
Surface mutants of CcP were constructed, expressed in
E. coli, and isolated as previously described (Fishel et al.,
1987; Liu et al., 1995). Solutions of the mutant enzymes
were prepared from crystalline samples as described above
for the wild-type enzyme.
Horse heart cytochrome c (type VI) was obtained from
Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) and used without
further purification. Cytochrome c solutions were prepared
by dissolving the lyophilized protein in 0.050 M ionic
strength buffer, pH 6.0. At the high concentrations of
cytochrome c used in these studies (1.67-2.46 mM) the pH
of the resulting solution had to be readjusted to pH 6.0 with
dilute HNO3. Samples were then dialyzed in the same
manner as described for CcP. Cytochrome c concentrations
were determined spectrophotometrically using an absorptivity
of 106.1 mM-1 cm-1 at 410 nm (Margoliash & Frohwirt,
1959).
Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were carried
out with a MicroCal ITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.,
Northhampton, MA) using procedures previously described
(Kresheck et al., 1995). The reaction cell volume of the
instrument is 1.34 mL, and the titrant was added in 25 10-
µL increments. The time between injections was 480 s, and
the injection syringe was rotated at 400 rpm for the duration
of each experiment. Cytochrome c was treated as the ligand
and placed in the injection syringe with CcP in the cell.
Following the procedure recommended by MicroCal, each
titration was integrated manually using the data before and
after each peak to establish a base line. The heat changes
that accompanied the addition of buffer to solutions of CcP
in the cell were negligible. However, corrections were
necessary to account for the heat change that resulted when
cytochrome c was placed in the syringe and diluted into the
cell containing just buffer.
Data analysis to determine binding parameters was con￾ducted using a nonlinear iterative procedure utilizing the
Marquardt algorithm (Bevington, 1969). The data were fit
to a model describing one-to-one complex formation as
described in detail by Wiseman et al. (1989).
RESULTS
Significant absorption of heat occurs upon injecting 10
µL aliquots of horse ferricytochrome c (1.67-2.46 mM) into
the calorimeter cell (1.34 mL) containing either CcP or one
of the CcP mutants (42-109 µM). The absorption of heat
indicates that complex formation is endothermic. Figure 2
shows calorimetric titrations of the reaction between horse
ferricytochrome c and wild-type yeast CcP and between horse
ferricytochrome c and a mutant CcP in which the negatively
charged Glu-290 is replaced by a neutral asparagine residue,
CcP(E290N). Duplicate titrations are shown to give an
indication of the reproducibility of the data. Experimental
conditions are given in the figure legend.
The titration curves can be analyzed on the basis of a
model assuming simple binding between the two proteins
to give a one-to-one complex (Wiseman et al., 1989;
Kresheck et al., 1995). The analysis gives both the equi￾librium association constant and the enthalpy change for
complex formation. Equilibrium constants and enthalpy
changes for the titrations shown in Figure 2 are collected in
Table 1 along with those for the five other CcP mutants used
in this study. Entropy changes, calculated from the equi￾librium constants and enthalpy changes, are included in
Table 1.
The equilibrium association constant, KA, is reproducible
to about 35%, estimated from the standard deviation of
multiple titrations. The enthalpy and entropy changes are
reproducible to about (1.5 kJ mol-1 (∼17% of the mean
value) and (6 J mol-1 K-1 (∼5% of the mean), respectively.
DISCUSSION
Thermodynamic Parameters. The strong ionic strength
dependence of the interaction between CcP and cytochrome
c indicates that the binding is largely electrostatic in nature
(Vitello & Erman, 1987; Kresheck et al., 1995). Previous
studies show that, for native CcP and horse ferricytochrome
c, formation of the horse cytochrome c/CcP complex is
endothermic with a small, positive enthalpy change of 9 (
1 kJ mol-1, independent of ionic strength between 0.01 and
0.20 M (Kresheck et al., 1995). The thermodynamics of
complex formation, including the strong ionic strength
dependence of the reaction, is dominated by the positive
entropy change which increases from 92 to 155 J mol-1 K-1

1995). The large positive entropy change strongly suggests
that the thermodynamics of complex formation are dominated
by solvation effects. The mechanism for CcP/cytochrome
c binding is that electrostatic forces bring the two macroions
together, squeezing the solvent from the protein-protein
interface. The released water of hydration provides a
substantial increase in entropy for the reaction. The enthalpy
change for the reaction is small, indicating that the enthalpic
contributions of the protein-protein and water-water in￾teractions in the product essentially cancel the enthalpic
contribution of the protein-hydration layer interactions in
the uncomplexed proteins.
The CcP mutations used in this study are relatively benign,
and their effect on the binding of horse cytochrome c is small.
The CcP mutants segregate into two groups on the basis of
their affinity for cytochrome c. The binding of cytochrome
c to CcP(E291Q) is identical to that of wild-type enzyme
within experimental error. The cytochrome c binding affinity
for the other five CcP mutants is three to four times weaker
than that of wild-type CcP. The effect of the mutations can
be interpreted in the context of the thermodynamic param￾eters for binding of wild-type CcP and horse cytochrome c
(Kresheck et al., 1995). For all of the mutants, except CcP-
(A193F), the charge on specific glutamates or aspartates is
removed by substitution of amides, and for one mutation,
E290N, a methylene bridge is eliminated from the side chain.
Substitution of amides in the mutants for carboxylate groups
in wild-type CcP still permits the mutants to form hydrogen
bonds with appropriate lysine residues on cytochrome c. The
major difference in the thermodynamic parameters of the
mutants relative to the wild-type enzyme will be due to
differences in releasing water of hydration from a neutral
asparagine or glutamine residue rather than from a charged
aspartate or glutamate as the two proteins interact. As can
be seen from Table 1, the enthalpy change upon complex
formation for all of the mutants, except CcP(E35Q), is
identical to that to the wild-type enzyme (within experimental
error), suggesting that the hydrogen bonding between the
CcP mutants and cytochrome c is similar to that of wild￾type CcP and cytochrome c. The major decrease in binding
affinity is an entropic effect with smaller increases in the
entropy of interaction in the mutants. This is consistent with
weaker hydration of the amide groups in the mutants relative
to the charged carboxylate groups in wild-type CcP and a
smaller increase in entropy as the water of hydration is
released from the mutants upon complex formation.
Similarity of the Cytochrome c/CcP Complex in Solution
and Crystal. One purpose of this study is to determine if
the crystal and solution structures of the cytochrome c/CcP
complex are the same. Figure 1 shows the surface of CcP
and indicates the cytochrome c binding site determined by
crystallography (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992). Figure 1 also
indicates the cytochrome c binding site identified by
computer docking (Poulos & Kraut, 1980; Poulos & Finzel,
1984).
Three regions of the CcP molecule make contact with
horse cytochrome c in the crystalline CcP/horse cytochrome
c complex. Two of the three regions are composed of acidic
amino acid residues: the first contact point includes residues
32-35 and the second includes residues 290 and 291.
Mutations at residues 32, 34, 35, 290, and 291 were created
to assess the contribution of individual carboxylate residues
to formation of the CcP/horse cytochrome c complex in
solution. Since each of these mutations converts a solvent￾exposed carboxylate residue to an amide, the effect of each
mutation on the surrounding solvent should be approximately
the same. The results in Table 1 show that all three mutants
in the 32-35 cluster (E32Q, D34N, and E35Q) have similar
effects on KA, decreasing the affinity of CcP for horse
cytochrome c by 3-4-fold. On the other hand, although
CcP(E290N) also causes a 4-fold decrease in KA, the E291Q
mutation has no effect on the binding of cytochrome c.
The results are consistent with the crystal structure of the
CcP/horse cytochrome c structure complex (Figures 1 and
3). Figure 3 gives a perpendicular view of the interface
between horse cytochrome c and CcP as determined from
the crystal structure. In Figure 3, the CcP molecule is on
the right with Glu-32 toward the top and in the foreground
of the figure. Glu-291 in CcP is toward the bottom
foreground of the figure. Ala-193 of CcP is not shown but
would be in the background, toward the center of the
interface. The interactions between horse cytochrome c and
CcP shown in Figure 3 can be used to rationalize the binding
affinities of the CcP mutants given in Table 1. The crystal
structure of the complex shows that the carboxylate side
chain of CcP Asp-34 is within hydrogen-bonding distance
of the side-chain nitrogen of Lys-13 of horse cytochrome c
and that the carboxylate oxygen atoms of CcP Glu-35 are
4.5 Å from the respective side-chain nitrogen atoms of Lys-5
and Lys-87 in horse cytochrome c. The carboxylate of Glu￾32 bends away from the binding interface in the crystal
structure (Figure 3) but is still close enough to influence the
binding of cytochrome c.
Particularly interesting are the relative binding affinities
of mutations at Glu-290 and Glu-291 in CcP. Conversion
of Glu-290 to an asparagine causes a 4-fold decrease in
binding affinity while conversion of Glu-291 to a glutamine
has no effect even though this two residues are adjacent.
This is easily reconciled by Figure 3 where it is seen that
Glu-290 makes a strong hydrogen bond to Lys-72 of horse
cytochrome c while Glu-291 projects away from the cyto￾chrome c binding interface.
FIGURE 3: Interface between cytochrome c peroxidase and horse
cytochrome c at the Pelletier/Kraut binding site (Pelletier & Kraut,

is shown in yellow on the left. Five of the six residues which were
mutated in CcP and used in this study are shown in white (Ala￾193 is not shown but would be in the background toward the center
of the interface).
Cytochrome c/Cytochrome c Peroxidase Complex Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 13, 1997 4057The third region of interaction between CcP and horse
cytochrome c is near Ala-193 and Ala-194 of CcP and Gln￾12 of cytochrome c. The A193F mutation was created to
decrease the affinity of CcP for horse cytochrome c by
introducing steric conflict to formation of the CcP/horse
cytochrome c complex seen in the crystal. In the crystalline
CcP/horse cytochrome c complex, Ala-193 is only 4.8 Å
from the side chain of Gln 16 of horse cytochrome c.
Computer simulations showed that the Phe side chain at
position 193 will have very restricted movement about the
bond between the R and â carbons and will exist predomi￾nantly in the trans conformation (i.e., with a dihedral angle
of approximately 180°). This orientation will make the
distance between the phenyl ring and the side chain of Gln￾16 less than the sum of the standard van der Waals radii in
the CcP/horse cytochrome c complex and was expected to
decrease the affinity for horse cytochrome c by increasing
the enthalpy of complex formation. Our results provide no
evidence for this type of effect, however. Instead, the
decreased affinity for complex formation for the A193F
mutant is caused by entropic effects, much like the other
mutants examined here. The results suggest that the effect
of the A193F mutation on complex formation is caused by
a change in the solvation of the side chain at residue 193
instead of a steric effect.
In summary, these binding studies are consistent with the
horse cytochrome c/CcP interface as determined from X-ray
crystallography (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992) and shown in
Figures 1 and 3.
PreVious Studies. The Poulos/Finzel/Kraut model of the
cytochrome c/CcP complex (Poulos & Kraut, 1980; Poulos
& Finzel, 1984) has been important in promoting the
cytochrome c/CcP system as a model for detailed studies of
electron transfer within dynamic protein complexes. It was
the first model for an electron transfer complex between
physiologically related proteins and prompted a number of
investigations into the binding and electron transfer properties
of this system. Previous studies designed to test the Poulos/
Finzel/Kraut model did show discrepancies from predictions,
and these can now be understood in light of the crystallo￾graphically defined binding site.
Bechtold and Bosshard (1985) found that acidic residues
33, 34, 35, 37, 221, and 224 and at least one of the three
carboxylates between residues 290 and 294 in CcP became
less reactive when bound to cytochrome c. The negative
cluster between residues 33-37 is consistent with either
binding site, but the protection of a residue (or residues)
between 290 and 294 is only consistent with the binding
site determined by crystallography. The altered reactivity
at residues 221 and 224 cannot be explained by binding of
cytochrome c at either the Pelletier/Kraut or the Poulos/
Finzel/Kraut sites. Residues 221 and 224 are too far from
either binding site to be blocked by a single cytochrome c
molecule bound to either site. There must be some other
explanation for the altered reactivity at residues 221 and 224.
Waldmeyer and Bosshard (1985) cross-linked CcP and
horse cytochrome c with a carbodiimide under conditions
where one-to-one complex formation is favored. Two major
cross-links were localized: one between Lys-13 of cyto￾chrome c to an acidic residue within the cluster of acidic
residues between positions 32 and 37 on CcP and the second
between Lys-86 of cytochrome c and a carboxyl group in
the same cluster of acidic residues in CcP. These two cross￾links are consistent with the crystallographic data (Figure
3). No cross-links involving the region of CcP including
residues 221 or 224 were detected.
Das et al. (1988) replaced Lys-32 of yeast iso-1 cyto￾chrome c with several different amino acid residues and
found these mutations had little influence on the interaction
between yeast iso-1 cytochrome c and CcP. Lys-32 in yeast
iso-1 cytochrome c is analogous to Lys-27 in horse cyto￾chrome c and was proposed to interact with Asp-79 in CcP
in the original Poulos/Kraut model of the complex (Poulos
& Kraut, 1980). This interaction does not occur in the crystal
structures of either the yeast iso-1 cytochrome c/CcP or the
horse cytochrome c/CcP complexes.
Corin et al. (1991) made point mutations in CcP at residues
37, 79, and 217, converting the aspartate residues in wild￾type CcP to lysine residues. The mutations at positions 79
and 217 had no significant effect on the binding of yeast
iso-1 cytochrome c or the steady-state kinetics of horse
ferrocytochrome c. The results reported for residues 79 and
217 are consistent with the crystal structure in that these
residues are far from the CcP/horse cytochrome c interaction
site. Although Asp-37 is not at the interface, it would not
be surprising to find that mutation of this residue to lysine
has a significant effect on the local structure of CcP near
the interaction site. Asp-37 forms a charge-mediated hy￾drogen bond with the imidazolium side chain of His-181 and
is known to stabilize the native conformation of the enzyme
(Miller et al., 1988). Replacing Asp-37 with lysine would
introduce charge-charge repulsion between the imidazolium
of His-181 and the -amino group of lysine. This in turn
would decrease the pKa of His-181 and destabilize the native
conformation of the enzyme. The decreased affinity of the
Lys-37 mutant enzyme may therefore represent a perturbation
of the binding region by a more global effect on enzyme
structure.
The observation that modification of Asp-217 does not
influence the binding and kinetic properties of CcP with
cytochrome c and that modification of Glu-290 causes
significant changes provides strong evidence that the Pelle￾tier/Kraut binding site is the correct site and that the Poulos/
Finzel/Kraut site is not (Figure 1).
Electron Transfer within the Horse Cytochrome c/CcP
Complex. Miller et al. (1994) and Liu et al. (1995) have
studied the kinetics of electron transfer between cytochrome
c and CcP using many of the same CcP mutants used in this
calorimetric study. Liu et al. (1995) have used a ruthenium￾modified horse cytochrome c to explore electron transfer
between cytochrome c and CcP. A ruthenium(II) complex
is covalently attached to Lys-27 of horse ferricytochrome c
(Ru27-hCc). At low ionic strength, stoichiometric mixtures
of Ru27-hCc and CcP form a one-to-one complex. Photo￾excitation of the Ru(II) ion produces Ru(II*), a strong
reductant. Ru(II*) rapidly reduces the heme iron of the
covalently attached ferricytochrome c (k ) 2.3 × 107 s-1)
to generate ferrocytochrome c and Ru(III). Ru(III) is a strong
oxidizing agent and, in the one-to-one complex with CcP,
rapidly (k ) 7 × 106 s-1
) oxidizes Trp-191 in CcP to a radical
state regenerating ground-state Ru(II). The photoinitiated
redox cycle is completed by electron transfer from the heme
iron of cytochrome c to the Trp-191 radical in CcP with a
rate constant of 6.1 × 104 s-1
. As the ionic strength is
increased, dissociation of the Ru27-hCc/CcP complex occurs
and the amplitude of the intramolecular reactions between
4058 Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 13, 1997 Erman et al.sites on Ru27-hCc and CcP decreases. From the decrease
in amplitude the fraction of complexed and uncomplexed
proteins can be estimated and an estimated equilibrium
constant for complex formation determined. These kineti￾cally determined equilibrium association constants deter￾mined by Liu et al. at pH 6.0, 0.050 M ionic strength are
shown in Table 2 and compared with the calorimetric results.
The values of the kinetically determined equilibrium
constants may be subject to systematic errors. These values
depend upon interpretation of kinetic data, the assumed
kinetic mechanism for the reaction, and how well rapid￾equilibrium conditions are met. In spite of the possible
systematic errors, the trend in the kinetically determined
equilibrium constants for the Ru27-hCc derivative and the
CcP mutants is almost identical to those for native horse
cytochrome c and the CcP mutants. These data strongly
support the conclusion that Ru27-hCc binds to the same
surface domain on CcP as horse cytochrome c.
Miller et al. (1994) investigated the reaction between CcP
compound I and both horse and yeast ferrocytochrome c.
The redox reactions were studied under somewhat different
conditions than our calorimetry experiments: 0.11 M ionic
strength sodium phosphate/NaCl buffer at pH 7.0, 25 °C.
Under these high ionic strength conditions, the reaction
between CcP compound I and ferrocytochrome c is second
order. Assuming that the redox mechanism involves rapid
binding of CcP compound I and ferrocytochrome c, followed
by intramolecular electron transfer within the complex, ket,
the observed second-order rate constant is given by KAket.
The observed second-order rate constant for the reaction was
1.3 × 108 M-1 s-1 for the parental form of CcP expressed
in E. coli, CcP(MI). Miller et al. (1994) found very similar
effects due to mutations in the cytochrome c binding domain
on CcP as we have found in direct binding studies. The
observed bimolecular rate constants for CcP(MI) and its
mutants decrease in the following order: CcP(E32Q) ≈ CcP-
(MI) ≈ CcP(E291Q) > CcP(E35Q) > CcP(D34N) > CcP-
(A193F) ) CcP(E290N). The only exception to the ordering
listed in Table 1 is that of the CcP(E32Q) mutant. In the
study of Miller et al. (1994) CcP(E32Q) had the same
electron transfer rate as the native recombinant protein, CcP-
(MI), and CcP(E291Q). The observation that the apparent
bimolecular rate constants for the reaction between horse
ferrocytochrome c and CcP compound I for the CcP mutants
correlate with the binding constants in this study suggests
that the rate of intracomplex electron transfer is not disrupted
by the surface mutations and that ket is similar for CcP(MI)
and the surface mutants shown in Tables 1 and 2.
Many physiological processes require the formation of
specific protein/protein complexes. The structural basis for
the specificity of protein/protein recognition can only be
examined through the study of complexes where structure
of the complex is known. In the present study we have
begun the characterization of one such system, that of the
complex formed between cytochrome c peroxidase and
cytochrome c. The studies reported in this paper demonstrate
that the structure of the CcP/horse cytochrome c complex
in solution is consistent with the structure of the complex in
the crystalline state. Moreover, the crystal structure shows
few strong interactions between CcP and cytochrome c, a
result consistent with the unfavorable enthalpy of complex
formation. The binding of CcP and cytochrome c is
dominated by a favorable entropy change as the protein/
protein interface is desolvated upon complex formation. This
type of interaction is beneficial for formation of dynamic
protein complexes where the reacting partners must associate
and dissociate rapidly. The rate of formation of the
cytochrome c/CcP complex is extremely fast, probably
diffusion controlled (Matthis et al., 1995), and the half-time
of dissociation is on the millisecond time scale (Yi et al.,
1994). It appears that the binding-site specificity in these
types of dynamic, electrostatically stabilized protein/protein
complexes is determined by the electrostatic potentials of
the interacting partners rather than by multiple, strong
complementary side-chain interactions at the binding surface.
These studies provide a basis for further exploration into
more fundamental questions of specificity, dynamics, and
electron transfer pathways in the CcP/cytochrome c complex.
