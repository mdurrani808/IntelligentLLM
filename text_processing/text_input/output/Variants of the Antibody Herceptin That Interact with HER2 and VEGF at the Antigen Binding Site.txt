Variants of the Antibody Herceptin
That Interact with HER2 and VEGF
at the Antigen Binding Site

The interface between antibody and antigen is often depicted as a lock and key, suggesting that
an antibody surface can accommodate only one antigen. Here, we describe an antibody with an
antigen binding site that binds two distinct proteins with high affinity. We isolated a variant of
Herceptin, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody that binds the human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2), on the basis of its ability to simultaneously interact with vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF). Crystallographic and mutagenesis studies revealed that distinct amino
acids of this antibody, called bH1, engage HER2 and VEGF energetically, but there is extensive
overlap between the antibody surface areas contacting the two antigens. An affinity-improved
version of bH1 inhibits both HER2- and VEGF-mediated cell proliferation in vitro and tumor
progression in mouse models. Such “two-in-one” antibodies challenge the monoclonal antibody
paradigm of one binding site, one antigen. They could also provide new opportunities for
antibody-based therapy.
The binding of antibodies to specific single
antigens has prompted their use for nu￾merous targeted therapies (1). However,
the notion of an antibody that recognizes more
than one antigen is intriguing. It has been sug￾gested that multi-specificity may evolve and play
a role in the highly efficient antibody repertoire
for immune protection with one antibody per￾forming more than one task (2, 3). However, the
few examples of such multi-specificity are lim￾ited to antibodies that bind small haptens (4), and
a strategy to generate a single antigen binding
fragment (Fab) capable of recognizing two un￾related proteins has not yet been reported.
We set out to explore whether dual specific
antibodies can be derived from a monospecific
antibody with the following approach: A repertoire
of Herceptin (Genentech, South San Francisco,
CA) antibody variants with mutations in the light
chain (LC) complementarity determining regions
(CDRs) were generated, and Fabs that can bind
a new protein antigen while maintaining human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) bind￾ing were identified. The approach is based on the
understanding that modifications of the LC se￾quence can modulate the binding specificity of
antibodies (5, 6). In addition, many antibodies,
with Herceptin as a prime example (7, 8), bind
the antigens by using mainly the heavy chain (HC)
CDRs, suggesting that mutations in the LC CDRs
might allow preservation of the original antigen
binding specificity.
The framework regions of Herceptin varia￾ble domains (VH and VL, the variable domain of
HC and LC, respectively) belong to subtypes
that are prevalent in the human antibody reper￾toire (VH3, VLkappa1). Thus, mutations within
the antigen binding site of Herceptin that confer
a second specificity may indicate a potential for
a dual specific antibody to evolve from the natu￾ral repertoire. As Herceptin is a validated thera￾peutic for breast cancers that overexpress HER2
(9), recruitment of a second binding specificity to
Herceptin may add to it a distinct pharmaco￾logical activity.

REPORTSWe constructed the repertoire of Herceptin
LC variants by randomizing a subset of solvent
exposed LC CDR positions to mimic the natural
diversity in amino acid composition and length
(tables S1 and S2) (10). Selection of the Herceptin
variant library against vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), death receptor 5 (DR5), and the
complement binding fragment of immunoglob￾ulin G (IgG) (Fc) generated over one hundred
specific clones containing 3 to 17 amino acid
substitutions and/or insertions compared with
Herceptin (tables S3 and S4). Some of the clones
lost binding affinity for HER2 and switched bind￾ing entirely to the new antigen, whereas others
maintained the ability to bind HER2 and thus
were dual specific.
Representative VEGF and DR5-binding clones
were expressed as Fab and IgG proteins to
assess their specificity and affinity (Table 1 and
fig. S1). VEGF and DR5 are therapeutic tar￾gets of known structure. Equilibrium binding
affinities (Kd) of the LC library-derived mono￾specific antibodies ranged from 15 to 150 nM
(Table 1). The dual specific antibodies bound
the new antigens (i.e., VEGF or DR5) with high
nanomolar to micromolar affinity while preserv￾ing HER2 binding in the low nanomolar affinity
range. The antibody bH1 exhibited the highest
dual affinity for the two completely different pro￾tein antigens VEGF (Kd = 300 nM) and HER2
(Kd = 26 nM).
To understand the molecular basis of the
dual specificity, we determined the crystal struc￾Fig. 1. The crystal structures of bH1 Fab

REPORTStures of the bH1 Fab bound to the extracellular
domain of HER2 (residues 1 to 624) and to the
VEGF receptor-binding domain (residue 8 to 109)
at 2.9 and 2.6 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 1A
and table S5). The structure of the bH1/HER2
binding domains (bH1 Fv and domain IV of
HER2) superimposes onto the Herceptin/HER2
complex with a root mean square deviation of
0.8 Å, showing that the Herceptin binding epi￾tope on HER2 is retained (Fig. 1A) (7). The HER2
binding sites on bH1 and Herceptin differ only
in the CDR-L1 and -L2 regions where the bH1
sequence differs from Herceptin (Fig. 1B).
In the structure of the bH1/VEGF complex,
the Fab recognizes an epitope that overlaps with
the binding sites of the VEGF receptors and other
VEGF binding antibodies (11–13). Consistent with
this observation, bH1 blocks the interaction be￾tween VEGF and its receptors (fig. S2).
Comparison of the bH1/VEGF and the
bH1/HER2 complexes shows an extensive overlap
of the VEGF and HER2 binding sites on bH1
(Fig. 1B and table S6); 11 out of the 13 bH1 res￾idues that are in close contact with HER2 also
make contact with VEGF. In the HER2 com￾plex, the LC and HC CDRs contribute approx￾imately equal antigen contact area (53% and 47%,
respectively), whereas in the VEGF complex, the
LC CDRs constitute nearly 70% of the buried
surface (fig. S3).
With the exception of CDR-L1, the CDR
conformations of the bH1 Fab bound to VEGF
are markedly similar to those observed in bH1 or
Herceptin bound to HER2 (Fig. 1C). The capa￾bility of CDR-L1 to rearrange appears to be nec￾essary for the dual specificity of bH1 (Fig. 1D).
In the HER2 complex, CDR-L1 is minimally in￾volved in antigen interaction, and part of the
loop appears to be flexible, as evidenced by poor￾ly defined electron density (Fig. 1D). In contrast,
in the VEGF complex, this loop is well struc￾tured and forms extensive contacts with VEGF.
Similar conformational flexibility of CDR-L1
has been reported to play a role in antigen rec￾ognition of natural antibodies (14, 15).
Next, we performed shotgun scanning muta￾genesis studies to assess the energetic contribu￾tions of individual CDR residues to VEGF and
HER2 binding (S11 and S12 in the supporting
online material) (10). We determined the change
in free energy (∆∆G) as a result of mutation to
alanine (alanine scan) or a homologous residue
(homolog scan) (table S7), revealing the CDR
residues that make up the functional paratopes
of the Fab in the two complexes (Fig. 2A).
In contrast to the extensive overlap between
buried surfaces in the interfaces of bH1 bound
to either VEGF or HER2, the two functional
paratopes show only limited overlap (Fig. 2B
and fig. S4). Energetically, the VEGF binding in￾teraction is mediated primarily by the LC CDRs,
whereas HER2 binding is dominated by HC
CDRs. Compared to Herceptin, bH1 maintains
the same core hotspot residues for HER2 bind￾ing (Arg50, Trp95, and Tyr100a of HC) (fig. S4).
The structural and functional studies show
that the interactions between bH1 and the two
entirely unrelated large proteins are distinct (Fig.
2 and fig. S5) and are characterized by confor￾mational adaptation of the antigen binding site
(table S8) and differential engagement of VL
and VH (Fig. 2). The molecular versatility ob￾served in the dual specific bH1 is reminiscent of
other antibodies binding multiple small haptens
or peptides (4, 16) or of an antibody binding its

REPORTScognate antigen and an anti-idiotype antibody
(17, 18). Further, the differential engagement of
residues within a common binding site also echoes
the plasticity observed in other protein-protein in￾teractions, such as the recognition of distinct anti￾gens (major histocompatability complex–bound
peptides) by T cell receptors (19) or growth factor
binding to different receptors (20).
We further examined whether the dual bind￾ing specificity can translate into dual activity in
vivo. To facilitate the investigation of the in vivo
activity of bH1, we generated versions of bH1
with high affinity and specificity for HER2 and
VEGF (figs. S1, S2, S6, S7, and S8 and table S9).
bH1, the affinity-improved bH1-81 (Kd = 58/6 nM
VEGF/HER2), and bH1-44 (Kd = 3/0.2nM
VEGF/HER2) inhibit VEGF-induced prolifera￾tion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) and the growth of the HER2 overex￾pressing breast cancer cell line, BT474 (Fig. 3A).
The potencies of the bH1 variants correlate with
their relative affinities. The bH1-44 variant inhib￾its the growth of HUVEC and BT474 cells with
potencies similar to bevacizumab or Herceptin,
respectively.
To examine the two unique activities of bH1-
44 in vivo, we studied mouse xenograft tumor
models known to be responsive to treatment by
anti-VEGF antibodies (Colo205, a human colo￾rectal cancer cell line) or Herceptin (BT474M1,
human breast cancer cell line). We compared the
bH1-44 treated groups with those treated with
anti-VEGF (B20-4.1) (21), Herceptin, or the com￾bination (Herceptin + anti-VEGF) (table S10)
(10). The results of the Colo205 model demon￾strate that the VEGF binding component of
bH1-44 is inhibiting tumor growth (P < 0.0001,
n = 10 mice, compared with the control IgG treated
group), as Herceptin alone has no effect (P = 0.12,
n = 10). The BT474M1 model indicates that the
HER2 binding component of bH1-44 is active
(P < 0.0001, n = 7), because the effect observed
with the anti-VEGF control antibody is not sig￾nificant (P = 0.6, n = 7) (Fig. 3B).
Hence, bH1-44 appears to have the pharma￾cological activity of a VEGF blocking antibody
and a Herceptin-like antibody, although we do
not yet know whether bH1-44 is as effective as
Herceptin or anti-VEGF administered separately
or in combination. Whether there is a therapeutic
benefit to co-targeting the tumor cell prolifera￾tion mediated by HER2 and tumor angiogenesis
mediated by VEGF is a question currently being
evaluated in clinical trials combining Herceptin
and bevacizumab in breast cancer patients (22–24).
If the drug combination is found to be beneficial,
then dual specific antibodies like bH1-44 may merit
further exploration as potential therapeutics.

REPORTSmolecule have previously been described (25, 26).
In contrast to these bispecific formats, the dual
specific “two-in-one” antibody we describe has
the molecular structure of a regular IgG (or Fab).
It has all the favorable attributes of an IgG for
therapeutic development, such as predictable phar￾macokinetic properties, well established manufac￾turing protocols, choice of Fc-mediated effector
functions, and bi- or mono-valencies (25).
In summary, we have demonstrated that an
antigen binding site is capable of interacting with
two unrelated protein antigens with high af￾finity. The dual specific antibodies reported here
are derived from a monospecific antibody through
mutations in the periphery of the antigen binding
site in the LC CDRs. This strategy is a general
one and can be applied to create dual specific
antibodies against two distinct antigens. The
mutational analysis of bH1 and bH1-44 (Fig. 2
and fig. S8) suggested that the dual specificity
could be switched to monospecific binding to
either antigen (10). Indeed, bH1-44 lost binding
to VEGF but retained HER2 binding when mu￾tating two LC residues. Similarly, two alanine
mutations in the HC drastically reduced the af￾finity for HER2 while preserving tight binding
for VEGF (fig. S9). This finding highlights how
a limited number of mutations in the antigen
binding site can alter specificity or add a distinct
specificity. During development of the natural
antibody repertoire, the antigen binding sites often
undergo diversification by exchanging the VL
that pairs with a VH (6). Somatic mutations also
occur frequently, in particular among the res￾idues in the periphery of the antigen binding site
(27–30). Our studies reveal a mechanism by
which one antibody can diverge into many anti￾bodies with distinct specificity profiles. This mech￾anism may contribute to the large capacity of
the natural antibody repertoire for diverse anti￾gen recognition.

Ankyrin-G Promotes Cyclic
Nucleotide–Gated Channel Transport
to Rod Photoreceptor Sensory Cilia
Krishnakumar Kizhatil,1 Sheila A. Baker,2 Vadim Y. Arshavsky,2 Vann Bennett1
*
Cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channels localize exclusively to the plasma membrane of
photosensitive outer segments of rod photoreceptors where they generate the electrical response
to light. Here, we report the finding that targeting of CNG channels to the rod outer segment
required their interaction with ankyrin-G. Ankyrin-G localized exclusively to rod outer segments,
coimmunoprecipitated with the CNG channel, and bound to the C-terminal domain of the
channel b1 subunit. Ankyrin-G depletion in neonatal mouse retinas markedly reduced CNG channel
expression. Transgenic expression of CNG channel b-subunit mutants in Xenopus rods showed
that ankyrin-G binding was necessary and sufficient for targeting of the b1 subunit to outer
segments. Thus, ankyrin-G is required for transport of CNG channels to the plasma membrane
of rod outer segments.
Cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channels

in photoreceptors and to chemical stimuli
in olfactory neurons (1). CNG channels are seg￾regated to sensory cilia, where visual and olfac￾tory signal transduction takes place. This precise
intracellular localization is dependent on the
channel’s b subunit (CNG-b1, CNGB1) in both
classes of neurons (2–4). However, the molec￾ular mechanism(s) of CNG channel targeting to
the plasma membrane of sensory cilia, where
this channel normally functions, are unclear.
Ankyrin-G is a versatile membrane adaptor
involved in the formation and maintenance of
diverse specialized membrane domains (5–9).
Ankyrin-G is localized exclusively to rod outer
segments (ROSs), where it was found along with
CNG channels that have been localized to the
ROS plasma membrane (10, 11) (Fig. 1, A and
B). In contrast, the plasma membrane of the inner
segment was lined with ankyrin-B, which is re￾quired for the coordinated expression of the Na+
-
and K+
-dependent adenosine triphosphatase
(ATPase), Na+ and Ca+ exchanger, and b2-spectrin
(12) (Fig. 1A). Localization of ankyrin-G to the
plasma membrane was evident in isolated mouse
ROSs, but was better demonstrated in frog ROSs,
which are three to four times as large in diam￾eter (Fig. 1B). Ankyrin-G also localized in the
olfactory sensory cilia and the principal piece of
sperm flagella, together with CNG-b1 (4, 13)
(fig. S1). We treated isolated bovine ROSs with
a cleavable cross-linker, solubilized them in 0.1%
SDS, and used ankyrin- or CNG-b1–specific anti￾bodies for immunoprecipitation. We observed the
reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of CNG-b1 and
ankyrin-G (Fig. 1C). The interaction with ankyrin-G
was specific, because CNG-b1 was not precipitated
by nonimmune or ankyrin-B–specific antibodies,
