SUMMARY
The GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 receptors constitute the
bc family, playing important roles in inflammation,
autoimmunity, and cancer. Typical of heterodimeric
type I cytokine receptors, signaling requires recruit￾ment of the shared subunit to the initial cytokine:
a subunit binary complex through an affinity conver￾sion mechanism. This critical process is poorly un￾derstood due to the paucity of crystal structures of
both binary and ternary receptor complexes for the
same cytokine. We have now solved the structure
of the binary GM-CSF:GMRa complex at 2.8-A˚ reso￾lution and compared it with the structure of the
ternary complex, revealing distinct conformational
changes. Guided by these differences we performed
mutational and functional studies that, importantly,
show GMRa interactions playing a major role in re￾ceptor signaling while bc interactions control high￾affinity binding. These results support the notion
that conformational changes underlie the mecha￾nism of GM-CSF receptor activation and also sug￾gest how related type I cytokine receptors signal.
INTRODUCTION
The bc cytokines, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and IL-5 play important
roles in health and disease. Although these cytokines are not
essential for steady-state hemopoiesis, they are produced
by activated T cells in response to invading pathogens. In this
context their expression leads to increased production and
release of multiple myeloid cell types from the bone marrow
and to their enhanced immune function at sites of infection (Her￾cus et al., 2009). On the other hand, excessive production of bc
cytokines results in pathologies associated with elevated or
abnormal cell signaling thus making the cytokines and their re￾ceptors desirable targets for developing novel therapeutics for
use in treating certain leukemias and inflammatory diseases
(Asquith et al., 2008; Hamilton, 2008). Monoclonal antibodies
to GM-CSF are currently under development, some of which
are in phase II clinical trials to treat arthritis (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier NCT01023256), while antibodies specific to the IL-3 re￾ceptor are in clinical trials for the treatment of acute myeloid leu￾kemia (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01632852). A structural
and functional understanding of how these cytokines interact
with, and activate, their receptors is essential for the develop￾ment of a new generation of cytokine-specific therapeutic
agents that block excessive signaling from the bc cytokines.
GM-CSF binds and signals through a heterodimeric cell-sur￾face receptor comprising a specific a subunit (GMRa) and the
dimeric bc subunit that is shared with other members of the
bc family. GMRa binds cytokine with low affinity (KD 10 nM),
but the presence of bc converts this to high affinity (KD 100
pM) through heterodimerization of both subunits and subse￾quent receptor activation (Stomski et al., 1996). The crystal
structure of GM-CSF was solved in the mid 1990s (PDB:
2GMF, 1CSG) (Hill et al., 1993; Rozwarski et al., 1996), followed
by the structure of the GM-CSF:GMRa:bc ternary complex in
2008 (PDB: 3CXE) (Hansen et al., 2008). The GM-CSF ternary
complex revealed a hexameric arrangement containing two
GM-CSF:GMRa binary complexes, one bound to each end of
a central arch formed by the bc homodimer (Hansen et al.,
2008). Although this structure revealed the assembly required
for receptor signaling via the JAK-STAT pathway, it provided
only limited insights into the role of GMRa in cytokine recogni￾tion and receptor activation, as the ternary complex structure
had no electron density for the GMRa N-terminal domain
(NTD) and only ambiguous density for much of the adjoining
GMRa domain 2 (D2).
Here we report the crystal structure of the GM-CSF:GMRa bi￾nary complex that elucidates all three GMRa fibronectin type III
(FnIII) domains (NTD, D2, and D3) and details key interactions
made by these three domains with GM-CSF. Importantly, the
solving of the GM-CSF:GMRa binary complex structure has al￾lowed us to significantly improve the crystal structure of the orig￾inal ternary complex (Hansen et al., 2008), enabling us for the first

complexes for a member of the bc family. This comparison has
revealed evidence of conformational changes that occur in the
cytokine and receptor subunits following the binary to ternary
complex transition. Mutational and functional studies show
that these distinct structural adjustments are likely to contribute
to the nanomolar to picomolar binding affinity conversion and to
the initiation of signaling, with GM-CSF interactions involving
GMRa (site 1) and bc (site 2) exhibiting differential roles in these
events. Given the similarities in structure and function of the
GM-CSF receptor and those of IL-3 and IL-5, it is likely that the
mechanisms of affinity conversion and activation revealed for
the GM-CSF receptor will be applicable in varying degrees to
all members of the bc cytokine family and also more broadly to
other type I cytokine receptors.
RESULTS
A Comparison of the Structures of the Binary and
Ternary Complexes Reveals Discrete Conformational
Changes
A binary complex of soluble GMRa (sGMRa DN123) and GM￾CSF was purified and crystallized, and the structure of the com￾plex determined (see Experimental Procedures and Figure S1).
The final model of the complex has been refined to 2.8-A˚ resolu￾tion with an R factor of 22.8% (Rfree = 28.7%). The final data
collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1.
The binary complex shows the extracellular region of GMRa
comprising three FnIII domains separated by linker regions: an
immunoglobulin-like N-terminal FnIII domain (NTD residues
S16 to P93) followed by a pair of FnIII domains, D2 (residues
E98 to D192) and D3 (residues F199 to F296) that constitute
the cytokine recognition module (CRM) (Figure 1A). The three
GMRa FnIII domains adopt a ‘‘wrench-like’’ conformation that
wraps around the four-helical bundle of GM-CSF. The hinge
region between the D2 and D3 domains has an elbow angle of
100, which is within the range observed in related type I
cytokine receptor structures (Broughton et al., 2014; Kusano
et al., 2012; LaPorte et al., 2008; Lupardus et al., 2010; Patino
et al., 2011) and the elbow angle between D2 and NTD is
65. GMRa contains five disulfide bonds as well as a free
cysteine within the NTD (C68). Two disulfides are located in the
NTD (C32-C60, C41-C62) and D2 domains (C107-C117,
C146-C159) with one in the D3 domain (C209-C214) (Figures 1
and S1E).
The manner in which GMRa interacts with GM-CSF is similar
to the interaction observed in the IL-5 binary complex (Fig￾ure S2A) (Kusano et al., 2012; Patino et al., 2011) and the closed
IL-3:IL3Ra model (Broughton et al., 2014) (Figure S3A). The inter￾face between GMRa and GM-CSF is expansive with a total
buried surface area of 1,175 A˚ 2 and a shape complementarity
(Sc) value of 0.66, which is typical of oligomeric protein-protein
complexes (Lawrence and Colman, 1993). The interface be￾tween the a subunit and cytokine is similar for each complex,
with a total buried surface area of 1,115 A˚ 2 for IL-5:IL5Ra
(Sc = 0.64) and 1,243 A˚ 2 for the closed IL-3:IL3Ra model
(Sc = 0.62). Indeed, IL5Ra and the closed form of IL3Ra both
superimpose reasonably well with GMRa despite low shared
sequence identity (18%–32%), with the CRMs particularly similar
(root-mean-square deviation [rmsd] of 1.4 A˚ for IL5Ra, and 2.4
and 2.2 A˚ for the open and closed forms of IL3Ra, respectively)
and the D2-D3 elbow angles being the same. The greatest differ￾ence between the GM-CSF, IL-5, and IL-3 a subunits is the posi￾tioning of the NTD relative to the CRM (for additional details see
Supplemental Analysis).
The crystal structures of the related IL13Ra1 and IL13Ra2
(IL13Ra1/2) receptors also have a three FnIII domain architecture
that wraps around IL-13 (PDB: 3BPO and 3LB6) (LaPorte et al.,
2008; Lupardus et al., 2010) or IL-4 in the type II ternary complex
(PDB: 3BPN) (LaPorte et al., 2008) in a ‘‘wrench-like’’ conforma￾tion (Figure S3B). The overall secondary structure in the CRMs of
the GMRa and IL13Ra1/2 receptor subunits is conserved (D2-D3
rmsd = 2.0, 3.2, and 1.5 A˚ , respectively), but the placement of the
NTD relative to the CRM varies between the cytokine complexes
(the comparison with IL-13 is shown in Figure S3B; see also Sup￾plemental Analysis).
GMRa contacts GM-CSF primarily through the D strand and
EF loop in the NTD, the CD and EF loops in D2, and the D2-D3
linker and the BC and FG loops in D3, while GM-CSF interacts
with GMRa via helix D and the b2 strand (Figure 1). There are
two distinct GMRa interaction surfaces with the cytokine. Site
1a comprises the interactions formed by GMRa D2 and D3 and
conforms to the classical site 1 of type I cytokine receptors (de
Vos et al., 1992). Site 1b is an interaction between GM-CSF
and the a subunit NTD and is a feature of the bc cytokine family,
as well as the IL-13 and IL-4 (type II complex) receptors (Figure 1)

2008; Lupardus et al., 2010; Patino et al., 2011). A complete list
of GM-CSF:GMRa site 1 interactions in the binary complex are
detailed in Table S1 and additional analysis is included in the
Supplemental Analysis.
The more complete GMRa structure reported here enabled
us to improve the published 3.3-A˚ resolution structure of the
GM-CSF ternary complex (as described in Experimental Proce￾dures), and has led to a greatly improved electron density map
for the ternary complex and the placement of an additional
75 residues from GMRa (Figure S4A, see also Supplemental
Analysis). Data collection and refinement statistics are given in
Table 1 and a complete list of GM-CSF:GMRa site 1 interactions
in the ternary complex are detailed in Table S1.
Overall, the structures of the GM-CSF:GMRa component
of the binary and ternary complexes appear quite similar (Fig￾ure 2A). Thus the GMRa CRM component (i.e., D2-D3) superim￾poses closely (Ca rmsd = 1.0 A˚ ), the elbow angle between the D2
and D3 domains is the same, and the GM-CSF molecules are
almost identical in the two complexes with a Ca rmsd of 0.8 A˚ .
However, when the two complexes are superimposed via their
CRMs, it is clear that the cytokine has tilted 9 toward the bc
subunit in the ternary complex structure relative to a pivot point
centered on R283 in the FG loop of GMRa D3 domain (Figures 2A
and 2B). The region around the FG loop of GMRa is almost iden￾Figure 1. Structure of the GM-CSF Binary

tical between the two complexes, with the
backbone and side-chain atoms overlap￾ping very closely (Figure 2B). In contrast,
the GMRa D3 D strand changes to a
two-turn coiled loop in the ternary com￾plex (Figure 2C) and the side chains of
GMRa T247 and E248 within this coiled
loop interact with Q346 and R432 of bc
D4 in an adjacent hexameric complex,
which may help to stabilize the dodeca￾mer assembly (site 4, Figure S4B).
Importantly, the binary and ternary complexes show a number
of differences in the structure and orientation of the cytokine
when aligned via the GMRa CRM. Significant local differences
in the GM-CSF BC loop, as well as a portion of both B and C he￾lices, reveal a distinct shift toward bc in the ternary complex, with
a maximal shift of 2.8 A˚ in the Ca atoms. Helix D of GM-CSF inter￾acts with GMRa NTD and D3 in the binary complex (Figure 1C)
whereas in the ternary complex, the Ca of the C-terminal end of
helix D has rotated 3 A˚ toward bc while still maintaining key
anchoring interactions with GMRa D3 (Figure 2A). Weak electron
density was observed for the ternary complex GMRa NTD, so it
was modeled using the binary complex (as described in Experi￾mental Procedures). Analysis of this model suggests that the
movement of GM-CSF upon binding to the bc subunit pulls the
GM-CSF b2 strand away from the D strand of GMRa NTD and
abolishes multiple hydrogen bonds present in the binary complex
(Figures 1B and 2D). Loss of this extensive hydrogen bond
network reduces but does not abolish GM-CSF interactions
with GMRa and is consistent with the observation that weak re￾ceptor signaling occurs when the NTD is removed (Mirza et al.,
2010). Subtle differences in the A and C helices of GM-CSF are
also apparent when comparing the binary and ternary com￾plexes. In the binary complex conformation, the orientation of
GM-CSF K72 would preclude interaction with a docked bc homo￾dimer (site 2, Figure 2E) whereas in the ternary complex, GM-CSF

contacts with S102 in bc D1 (Figure 2F). In the ternary complex
GM-CSF E21 forms critical interactions with bc (site 2, Figure 2F)
through polar contacts with bc D1 residues Y39 and V105 and bc
D4 Y421. Thus the N-terminal end of GM-CSF helix A is rotated
toward bc in the ternary complex compared with the binary com￾plex (Figures 2E and 2F), a conformational change that likely un￾derlies the strong affinity conversion provided by bc (see below).
Changes in the bc conformation have also been noted when
comparing the free homodimer (apo) to the bound form in the
GM-CSF ternary complex. In the apo-bc crystal structure
(PDB: 2GYS) (Carr et al., 2006) the BC loop in D4 adopts a
conformation whereby Y365 and H367 are pointing away from
Y421 and Y39 (Figure 2E). This orientation of the BC loop is
incompatible with the GM-CSF orientation in the ternary com￾plex, and steric clashes would occur between GM-CSF residues

GM-CSF ternary complex, and a conformational change
points Y365 and H367 toward bc D1 to form an aromatic
pocket along with Y39 and Y421 (Figure 2F). A rotation of bc
D4 5.4 inward and away from GMRa D3 in the ternary com￾plex, when overlaid with the apo-bc dimer (Carr et al., 2006; Han￾sen et al., 2008), results in the bc D4 FG loop tilting down toward
the membrane, which allows Y421 to interact with GM-CSF E21
(Figures 2E and 2F).
Conformational Changes Observed in Binary to Ternary
Conversion by Crystallography Are Supported by
Mutagenesis Studies
The question arises as to whether the conformational changes
we observe between the binary and ternary complex crystal
structures are due to crystal lattice forces or are a consequence
of bc engagement by the binary complex. While crystal lattice
forces may account for some of the conformational changes
observed, the crystal structures of the binary and ternary com￾plexes convincingly recapitulate conclusions from extensive
mutagenesis data presented here and published elsewhere.
The most crucial evidence for this is that in the ternary complex
GM-CSF E21 (A helix), a critical residue for bc binding (Hercus
et al., 1994a, 1994b; Woodcock et al., 1994), forms hydrogen
bonds with Y39, V105, and Y421 (Figures 2F and S4B; Table
S3). If GM-CSF did not move (i.e., tilt and translate) during the
transition from binary to ternary complexes into the position
observed in the ternary complex, the side chain of E21 would
be too distant to make these interactions (Figure 2E) and a longer
side chain should be accommodated at this position in GM-CSF.
We assessed the interaction of bc site 2 with GM-CSF using the
GM-CSF E21R mutant, a GM-CSF-specific antagonist with unal￾tered binding to GMRa but no interaction with bc (Hercus et al.,
1994a; McClure et al., 2003). In silico analysis of the GM-CSF
E21R mutation within the ternary receptor complex model
suggests that steric conflicts are likely to explain the functional
properties of GM-CSF E21R (Figure 2H). Consistent with this
conclusion, mutation of GM-CSF E21 to glutamine or smaller
residues (A, F, or H) is functionally tolerated (Hercus et al.,
1994a), and enlarging the bc site 2 pocket by mutation allows
GM-CSF E21R to bind with intermediate affinity (Woodcock
et al., 1994). Considering these observations, it seems likely
that the E21R mutation prohibits the tilting and translational
movement of the cytokine seen in the binary to ternary complex
conversion, thereby preventing effective engagement with bc.
Given the conformational changes observed between the
binary and ternary complexes, we sought to understand their
significance in receptor activation by performing mutagenesis
and functional analyses of the protein-protein interactions at
sites 1 and 2, guided by the new structural data.
Site 1 Is Critical for Binding and Signaling
Mutagenesis of residues that contribute to site 1, coupled with
binding and functional analyses, revealed multiple interactions
that allow formation of the binary complex. Initial poly-alanine
mutagenesis of GMRa revealed a critical role for site 1a residues
in the D2 EF loop/F strand, the D2-D3 linker region, and the D3
BC and FG loops, but not the NTD EF loop or the D2 CD loop
(Table 2). Co-expression of the non-binding GMRa mutants
with bc allowed GM-CSF to bind with near wild-type affinity, indi￾cating that the defect in binding to GMRa is due to a reduction in
affinity for GM-CSF rather than gross protein misfolding (Table 2).
The restoration of cytokine binding to binding-defective GMRa
mutants by bc co-expression is consistent with previous studies
of GMRa (Hercus et al., 2009; Mirza et al., 2010) and IL3Ra
(Broughton et al., 2014) and emphasizes the dominant contribu￾tion that bc makes to cytokine binding. Expression of all mutants
was confirmed by flow cytometry studies using multiple anti￾bodies to overcome potential epitope disruption (Table S2).
The complex interaction between GM-CSF and GMRa around
the GMRa R283 pivot represents a critical and dynamic element
of site 1a (Figure 1D). Mutation of residues within the GMRa FG
loop of D3 confirmed that D281 and R283 are required for GM￾CSF binding (Table 2) (Rajotte et al., 1997). Residues V282 and
R283 interact with helix D in GM-CSF with the R283 side chain
protruding into a hydrophobic bulge of helix D, framed by resi￾dues L114, L115, I117, P118, and F119 in GM-CSF (Figure 1D).
The position of R283 within this bulge is dependent upon multiple
interactions involving residues from both GMRa and GM-CSF.
A network of charged residues in GMRa, including K194 in the
D2-D3 linker region, D231 in the BC loop of D3, and D281 in
the FG loop of D3, help to position the R283 side chain (Fig￾ure 1D). Interactions with GM-CSF helix D residues, including
charge-p interactions of the guanidine moiety with F119 and
hydrogen bonds with the carbonyls of L114 and I117, also stabi￾lize the R283 side chain (Figure 1D). Mutation of residues in the
D2-D3 linker demonstrated that K194 is required for GM-CSF
binding while charge-reversal mutation of D231 in the BC loop
of D3 revealed that this residue is critical for GM-CSF binding
even in the presence of bc (Table 2). GM-CSF-mediated cell pro￾liferation was substantially reduced by charge-reversal mutation
of GMRa residues K194 and D231, with further reductions in
GM-CSF function observed for the K194D,D231K combination
(Figures 3A and S5A). Mutations of GM-CSF L115 and F119
reduce binding affinity for GMRa and in combination substan￾tially reduce biological activity (Table 3).
A second prominent feature of site 1a centers around GM-CSF
D112 in helix D, which is located within a network of salt bridges
and hydrogen bonds involving E66, R170, D192, and K195 in
GMRa (Figure 1C). Mutation of residues within the EF loop
of D2 demonstrated that R170 is required for GM-CSF binding
(Table 2) and although mutation of S169 has no effect on GM￾CSF binding (Table 2), S169 hydrogen bonds with D48 in GM￾CSF and mutation of D48 reduces the biological activity of
GM-CSF and its binding affinity for GMRa (Table 3). Mutation
of residues in the GMRa D2-D3 linker demonstrated that both
D192 and K195 are required for GM-CSF binding (Table 2), sup￾porting the critical role played by this network of interacting
residues. GM-CSF-mediated cell proliferation was substantially
reduced by charge-reversal mutation of GMRa residues R170,
D192, and K195 with further reductions in GM-CSF binding
and function observed for the R170D,K195D combination
(Figures 3A and S5A). Mutations of GM-CSF D112 reduce both
biological activity and binding affinity for GMRa (Hercus et al.,
1994b; Rajotte et al., 1997) and synergize with mutations of
GM-CSF E45 and D48 (Table 3). Consistent with the arrange￾ment of this charged residue network, using GM-CSF D112K

cells expressing the GMRa R170D,K195D combination mutant
but greatly reduced binding and function for cells expressing
GMRa D192R (Figures S5B–S5E).
The site 1b interaction between GMRa and GM-CSF involves
a b-sheet hydrogen bonding network between the D strand of
GMRa NTD and the b2 strand of GM-CSF as well as a salt bridge
between R54 in the D strand of GMRa NTD and E41 in the b1
strand of GM-CSF (Figure 1B). Mutation of V51 in the D strand
of GMRa NTD has been reported to abolish GM-CSF binding
(Mirza et al., 2010), and mutation of GM-CSF V40-D48 has
been reported to abolish GM-CSF activity (Kaushansky et al.,
1989). GMRa R65 is adjacent to the NTD D strand and has the
potential to form a salt bridge with E45 in GM-CSF (Figure 1C),
and we observed that mutation of GM-CSF E45 reduces the
binding affinity for GMRa and synergizes with mutations of
GM-CSF D48 and D112 (Table 3). Additional analysis of site 1b
is included in Supplemental Analysis.

cellular responses (Figures 3A and S5A). In contrast, the more
conservative alanine mutations have little impact on cellular re￾sponses (Figures S5B and S5F). Of all mutations examined, the
GMRa K194D and D231K mutations have the greatest reduction
in cellular responses (Figures 3A and S5A) and are the only sin￾gle-residue mutations to display reduced GM-CSF binding in
the presence of bc (Table 2). Combinations of disruptive muta￾tions such as GMRa K194D and D231K reduced cellular re￾sponses even further (Figure 3A) and abolished GM-CSF binding
in the presence of bc (data not shown). Mutations of critical
GM-CSF site 1 residues have similar functional consequences,
with reductions in GMRa binding affinity and cellular response
(Table 3). These results emphasize the affinity-converting role
played by bc in cytokine binding, but unexpectedly demonstrate
uncoupling of receptor binding from functional responses
(Table 2; Figures 3A and 3C) and the critical role of site 1 interac￾tions in GM-CSF receptor signaling (Table 3).
Site 2 Is Critical for High-Affinity Binding but Not
Signaling
In the GM-CSF ternary complex, GM-CSF E21 makes critical in￾teractions with bc D1 through hydrogen bonds with Y39, V105,
and bc D4 through a hydrogen bond with Y421 (Figures 2F and
S4B; Table S3). Alanine substitution of bc residues Y39 or
F103 in D1 or Y365, H367, I368, or Y421 in D4 abolishes GM￾CSF high-affinity binding (Lock et al., 1994; Murphy et al.,
2003; Woodcock et al., 1994, 1996), identifying multiple bc res￾idues that contribute to the site 2 interaction between GM-CSF
and bc. Phenylalanine substitution of Y421 also abolishes high￾affinity binding of GM-CSF and reveals the critical role of the
phenolic hydroxyl in GM-CSF binding (Hansen et al., 2008).
Despite this, mutation of bc site 2 residues has little impact
on GM-CSF-mediated cell proliferation, and it is only in the
context of simultaneous mutation of residues in the BC loop
(Y365A,E366A,H367A,I368A) and FG loop (Y421A) of bc D4
that we observed a marked reduction in GM-CSF-mediated
cell proliferation (Figure 3B). Functional analysis of the bc site 2
mutants provides further evidence of the uncoupling of receptor
binding from functional responses.
We examined the ability of GM-CSF E21R to function through
bc site 2 mutants and observed no proliferation of cells express￾ing wild-type bc but significant proliferation of cells expressing
the Y421F, F103A, Y39A, E366A, or H367A bc mutants (Fig￾ure 3D). The individual bc site 2 mutations have differential
effects on maximal cell proliferation in response to GM-CSF
E21R (Y421F > F103A > Y39A = E366A > H367A) and weak
but nearly identical dose responses (ED50 = 10–30 ng/ml), sug￾gesting that GM-CSF E21R is functioning through a low-affinity
interaction. The partial restoration of agonist function to GM￾CSF E21R through selected bc site 2 mutations is consistent
with multiple steric clashes contributing to the antagonist pheno￾type and is consistent with an array of bc residues that partici￾pate in the formation of site 2 interactions (Figures 2H and 3D).
Molecular Basis for Receptor Activation
To investigate the potential consequences of the conformational
changes we observed (Figure 2) upon GM-CSF receptor activa￾tion, we examined how the spatial relationship of the membrane
proximal domains of the GMRa and bc might be altered during
the binary to ternary complex transition. We aligned the binary
and ternary complex structures via the cytokine and, relative to

domain 6 inward along the x-y plane toward the bc D4 domain
(Figure 4A) that we postulate would optimize the GMRa D3:bc D4
interactions in the ternary complex (site 3). In addition there is a
5 rotation of the bc D4 domain inwards toward the center of
the dimer arch when comparing the apo form of bc (Carr et al.,
2006) with that in the GM-CSF ternary complex (Figure 4B).
Although we cannot exclude the influence of crystal packing, it
is likely that these bc D4 domain movements optimize contact
with the GMRa D3 domain and GM-CSF. The movement of the
membrane proximal domains that is associated with formation
of the ternary complex therefore has the potential to transmit
conformational changes to the adjacent transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domains.
DISCUSSION
A detailed molecular understanding of the basis for affinity
conversion and signaling of heteromeric cytokine receptors
has been hampered by the paucity of crystal structures for
both the binary and ternary forms of representative receptor
complexes. Here we report the crystal structure of the GM￾CSF:GMRa binary complex (Figure 1), which has enabled
the determination of an improved structure for the GM￾CSF:GMRa:bc ternary complex (Figures 2 and S4) and a detailed
comparison of the two structures. Our analysis suggests that
GM-CSF actively transitions toward the bc subunit upon forma￾tion of the ternary complex so as to lock the cytokine in the
ternary complex through numerous contacts with bc (site 2), at
the expense of others with GMRa (site 1). Thus, ternary complex
formation involves a net gain of surface contact between GM￾CSF and the GMRa (site 1) and bc (site 2) subunits as well as
through the formation of new contacts between the two receptor
subunits (site 3). Affinity conversion through interaction with bc
results in decreased cytokine dissociation (Hayashida et al.,
1990), so it seems likely that in the ternary complex the additional
contacts with bc site 2 effectively hold GM-CSF to the receptor
yielding a high-affinity interaction. Functional studies of site 1
and site 2 mutants reveal a critical role for GM-CSF:GMRa site
1 interactions in receptor signaling and for GM-CSF:bc site 2 in￾teractions in affinity conversion but not receptor signaling (Fig￾ures 3 and S5; Tables 2 and 3). Detailed comparison of the
GMRa and bc receptor subunits in the binary and ternary com￾plexes revealed that ternary complex formation is associated
with rotations of the membrane proximal domains that are likely
to optimize site 3 and site 4 contacts (Figure 4 and Table S3).
These changes are also likely to affect the position of the
transmembrane helices that are required for activation of JAK2
kinases associated with the cytoplasmic domains, and influ￾ence subsequent transmembrane signaling via the JAK-STAT
pathway (Brooks et al., 2014).
The crystal structure of the binary GM-CSF complex pre￾sented here completes the set of receptor a subunit structures
for the bc family of cytokines (Broughton et al., 2014; Kusano
et al., 2012; Patino et al., 2011). Although the extracellular do￾mains of the GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 a subunits adopt a similar
three FnIII domain architecture which engages the cytokine in
a wrench-like fashion, each a subunit has unique structural fea￾tures that allow it to selectively recognize the appropriate cyto￾kine (Figures S2 and S3). The determination of the GM-CSF
binary complex structure also provided us the opportunity to
significantly improve our published GM-CSF ternary complex
structure (PDB: 3CXE) (Hansen et al., 2008) that revealed new
as well as more detailed descriptions of the key protein-protein
interaction surfaces (Figures 2 and S4; Tables S1 and S3).
The GM-CSF binary complex structure guided binding and ac￾tivity studies to assess the functional contribution of site 1 resi￾dues in GMRa and GM-CSF. These studies revealed a number
of residues essential for GM-CSF function and identified two ma￾jor binding determinants in the binary complex: one centered
around GM-CSF D112 and the other around GMRa R283 (Fig￾ures 1, 2, S4, and S5; Tables 2, 3, and S1). Residues comprising
the GM-CSF D112 motif are only conserved among primates
(Figure S6), providing one explanation for the species-restricted
function observed for GM-CSF. In contrast, the residues of the
GMRa R283 motif appear to be highly conserved across many
species (Figure S6), although they are not sufficient for full recep￾tor recognition by themselves.
We observed that many mutations of GMRa abolish direct
measurable binding of GM-CSF but still allowed wild-type GM￾CSF binding in the presence of bc (Table 2). This observation is
consistent with previous studies of both GMRa and IL3Ra
(Broughton et al., 2014; Mirza et al., 2010; Rajotte et al., 1997)
and emphasizes the dominant contribution bc makes to cytokine
binding through affinity conversion. The recruitment of bc to form
the high-affinity complex increases the overall cytokine interac￾tion surface from 1,175 A˚ 2 (site 1) in the binary complex to
1,516 A˚ 2 (sites 1 and 2) in the ternary complex; however, there

Conversion and Receptor Signaling, Structure (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2016.05.017  are also important qualitative changes as seen by a reduction of
the site 1 interaction surface in the ternary complex (902 A˚ 2
). Sur￾prisingly, the wild-type level of GM-CSF binding observed for
GMRa site 1 mutants co-expressed with bc is not coupled to
wild-type levels of GM-CSF function (Figure 3A), suggesting
that the mutations are able to disrupt receptor activation without
affecting the binding affinity of ligand in the ternary complex
(Table 2). Supporting this notion, mutation of site 1 interacting
residues in GM-CSF also affected binding to GMRa and GM￾CSF function (Table 3).
Mutation of bc site 2 residues has previously been shown to
abrogate affinity conversion or high-affinity binding for GM￾CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 (Hansen et al., 2008; Lock et al., 1994; Mur￾phy et al., 2003; Woodcock et al., 1994, 1996). While bc is
considered the major signaling subunit (Hercus et al., 2009),
we now show that mutation of bc site 2 has limited impact on
GM-CSF-mediated cell proliferation unless multiple elements
of site 2 are disrupted (Figure 3B). The importance of the GM￾CSF tilt (Figure 2B) for bc engagement and affinity conversion
through site 2 is supported by our earlier studies of GM-CSF
E21 mutants (Hercus et al., 1994a, 1994b). Loss of GM-CSF ac￾tivity associated with mutation of the E21 residue to larger resi￾dues such as arginine can now be understood in terms of steric
inhibition of the tilt (Figure 2H). Our modeling suggests that IL-3
may undergo a similar tilt when transitioning from the binary to
the ternary complex (Broughton et al., 2015). Our mutational
data support the critical role of bc site 2 interactions in GM￾CSF binding but demonstrate that this interaction does not
directly correlate with receptor function (Figure 3C). Collectively
our data support a model of receptor activation whereby GM￾CSF binding to GMRa through site 1 determines initial binding,
cytokine specificity, and receptor activation while GM-CSF inter￾action with bc through site 2 determines high-affinity GM-CSF
binding and signaling.
A detailed mechanism of activation was recently presented
for the archetypal homomeric human growth hormone receptor
(hGHR), in which the transmembrane helices were shown to
cross over to an ‘‘active’’ state upon hormone binding, leading
to activation of the JAKs associated with the cytoplasmic tails
(Brooks et al., 2014). Given the comparable distance between
the juxtamembrane domains of hGHR and the site 4 bc subunits
in the GM-CSF dodecameric complex (10 A˚ ), it seems plau￾sible that a similar mechanism of activation might operate in
the more complex GM-CSF heterodimeric receptor system.
Structural comparison of the apo-bc dimer and GM-CSF binary
complex with the GM-CSF ternary complex (Figure 4) indicates
that the membrane proximal domains of the receptor a and bc
subunits could rotate upon assembly of the ternary complex
and that these movements could be transmitted to the trans￾membrane helices. Of particular relevance were the observa￾tions of local conformational changes in the membrane proximal
domain of GMRa upon ternary complex formation. Thus the
GMRa D strand of domain 3 (D3) of the binary complex converts
to a two-turn coil that forms interactions at the site 4 interface in
the ternary complex (Figure 2C). These changes may contribute
to the domain movements and, thus, signaling events that
are initiated following receptor complex assembly. The distinct
conformational changes in GM-CSF and its receptor upon com￾plex assembly raise the possibility that this novel tilt-and-lock
mechanism is a conserved and necessary feature of cytokine
receptor activation.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Full details can be found in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Expression and Purification of the GM-CSF:sGMRa Binary Complex
Partially glycosylated soluble GMRa (sGMRa DN123; residues L1 to G301 of
the mature peptide with N27Q, N35Q, and N80Q mutations) was expressed
from Sf21 insect cells and purified by affinity chromatography (McClure
et al., 2003). Human GM-CSF (residues A1 to E127) was purified from
Escherichia coli (Hercus et al., 1994a). Functional studies demonstrate that
the N27Q, N35Q, and N80Q combination mutation has minimal impact on
the function of GMRa (Figures S1A and S1B). The binary complex containing
GM-CSF and sGMRa was isolated by preparative size-exclusion chromatog￾raphy (Figures S1C and S1D).
Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination of
GM-CSF:GMRa
Crystallization was performed using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method
at 21C. The best crystals were obtained in 22% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1%
2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 5 mM DTT, and 100 mM imidazole (pH 6.2–6.5). The
crystals diffracted to resolution of 2.8 A˚ in the orthorhombic space group
P22121. Data were collected at the MX2 beamline at the Australian Synchro￾tron. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the a subunit
of IL-5 (PDB: 3QT2). One GM-CSF:GMRa complex was found in the asym￾metric unit. The stereochemical quality of the final model correlates well with
structures at similar resolutions, with 99.7% residues in the allowed regions
of the Ramachandran plot. Data and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1.

Conversion and Receptor Signaling, Structure (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2016.05.017 Refinement the GM-CSF Ternary Complex
The complete GMRa structure from the binary model was used in molecular
replacement together with the previously published bc dimer (Carr et al.,
2006) and the structure of GM-CSF from the ternary complex (Hansen et al.,
2008). The solution led to an improvement of the electron density for large re￾gions of the GMRa D2 domain, and a few main-chain strands of the GMRa
NTD domain became apparent. The stereochemical quality of the final model
correlates well with structures at similar resolutions, with 99.3% residues in the
allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Data and refinement statistics are
listed in Table 1.
Computational Modeling
The dodecameric GM-CSF ternary complex model (Figure S4) was con￾structed by replacing the four partial GMRa subunits in the refined GM￾CSF ternary crystal structure dodecameric complex with complete
‘‘chimeric’’ GMRa models. The ‘‘chimeric’’ GMRa model was obtained by
splicing residues S16 to F199 from the binary complex GMRa subunit into
the incomplete GMRa subunit from the ternary complex crystal structure.
Structural optimization (MMFF94s force field and partial atomic charges,
conjugate gradient method, termination upon successive steps being
<0.05 kcal/mol d A˚ ) was performed using SYBYL-X 2.1 (Certara; http://
tripos.com/) to remove any steric conflicts. The final minimized GM-CSF
dodecameric receptor complex model and the refined GM-CSF ternary crys￾tal complex have an rsmd = 0.6 A˚ over 2,420 Ca atoms. Interactions within
sites 1–5 of the dodecameric ternary receptor complex model are tabulated
in Tables S1 and S3.
Mutagenesis of GMRa and bc and Expression of GMRa Mutants
Human GMRa and bc cDNA were cloned in the pSG5 expression vector
(Stratagene) and mutations generated by PCR mutagenesis. HEK293T cells
were transfected with pSG5 plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant GMRa
using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and cell-surface expression of GMRa
assessed by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for
GMRa, 4H1 (Stomski et al., 1998), 8G6 (Woodcock et al., 1994), and 1037
(Millipore).
Cell Binding Studies with GMRa Mutants
COS cells were electroporated with pSG5 plasmids encoding wild-type or
mutant GMRa, alone or in the presence of the pSG5H:bc plasmid encoding
human bc. Cell-surface expression of receptor subunits was confirmed by
flow cytometry using mAbs specific for GMRa (see above) or bc, 1C1 (Stomski
et al., 1996). Saturation binding assays with radioiodinated GM-CSF were car￾ried out as previously described (Woodcock et al., 1996; Sun et al., 1999) and
dissociation constants calculated using the EBDA and LIGAND programs
(Munson and Rodbard, 1980) (KELL Radlig; Biosoft).
Functional Studies with GMRa and bc Mutants
Wild-type or mutant GMRa cDNA was cloned in the retroviral expression
vector, pRufHygro, and used to transduce CTL-EN cells expressing hu￾man IL3Ra and bc (CTL-EN/IL3Ra/bc). Wild-type or mutant bc cDNA was
cloned in the retroviral expression vector, pRufPuro, and used to transduce
CTL-EN cells expressing human IL3Ra and GMRa (CTL-EN/IL3Ra/GMRa).
Following selection with hygromycin or puromycin, respectively, cells were
sorted for GMRa or bc expression, respectively, by flow cytometry as
previously described (Woodcock et al., 1996). Cell proliferation assays
using [6-3
H]thymidine incorporation were performed as previously described
(Hansen et al., 2008) and analyzed using GraphPad Prism to determine ED50
values.
Mutagenesis, Purification, and Testing of GM-CSF Mutants
GM-CSF mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis and purified from
E. coli (Hercus et al., 1994a). Receptor binding was assessed in competitive
binding assays using CHO cells stably expressing wild-type GMRa and radio￾iodinated GM-CSF (Hercus et al., 1994a). The functional activity of mutant GM￾CSF was assayed by measuring the proliferation of the human erythroleukemia
cell line TF-1 (Kitamura et al., 1989) using [6-3
H]thymidine incorporation (Han￾sen et al., 2008), and the data analyzed using GraphPad Prism to determine
ED50 values.
ACCESSION NUMBERS
