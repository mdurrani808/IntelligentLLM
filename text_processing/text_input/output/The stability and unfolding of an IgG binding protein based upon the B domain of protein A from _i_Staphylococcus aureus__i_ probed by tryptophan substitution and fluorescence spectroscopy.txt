The stability and unfolding of an immunoglobulin (Ig) G
binding protein based upon the B domain of protein
A (SpAB) from Staphylococcus aureus were studied by
substituting tryptophan residues at strategic locations
within each of the three a-helical regions (al-a3) of
the domain. The role of the C-terminal helix, a3, was
investigated by generating two protein constructs, one
corresponding to the complete SpAB, the other lacking a
part of ct3; the Trp substitutions were made in both one￾and two-domain versions of each of these constructs. The
fluorescence properties of each of the single-tryptophan
mutants were studied in the native state and as a function of
guanidine-HCl-mediated unfolding, and their IgG binding
activities were determined by a competitive enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. The free energies of folding and of
binding to IgG for each mutant were compared with those
for the native domains. The effect of each substitution
upon the overall structure and upon the IgG binding
interface was modelled by molecular graphics and energy
minimization. These studies indicate that (i) <x3 contributes
to the overall stability of the domain and to the formation
of the IgG binding site in al and a2, and (ii) al unfolds
first, followed by a2 and a3 together.

Introduction
Immunoglobulin (Ig) binding proteins are expressed on the
cell surface of many Gram-positive bacteria. Protein A (SpA)
is a cell wall component of Staphylococcus aureus that binds
principally to the Fc region of Igs from a diversity of sources
with differing affinities (Langone, 1982). For example, SpA
strongly binds IgG from pig, rabbit and humans (subclasses
1, 2 and 4), whereas rat and chicken IgG, IgA or IgM from
all species bind either weakly or not at all (Lindmark et al.,
1983). This specific interaction with the Fc region of IgG has
been exploited in many fields, with roles in Ig purification
(Hjelm et al., 1972), biotechnology (Nilsson and Abrahmsen,
1990) and clinical therapy (Palmer et al., 1989; Huston
etal, 1992).
The gene for SpA has been cloned and encodes a soluble
57 kDa protein composed of five highly homologous IgG
binding domains (E, D, A, B and C), a C-terminal cell wall
anchor region and an N-terminal 36 amino acid signal sequence
© Oxford University Press
(Uhl6n et al., 1984; Shuttleworth et al, 1987). NMR studies
have shown recently that the solution structure of the B domain
of SpA (SpAB) consists of three a-helices which are retained
upon interaction with the Fc fragment of IgG (Torigoe et al,
1990; Gouda et al, 1992). X-ray crystallographic analysis of
a co-crystal of the human Fc fragment from polyclonal IgG
and SpAB (Deisenhofer, 1981) shows the presence of two anti￾parallel a-helices (al and a2, which correspond to helices I
and II in the NMR structure) and a disordered C-terminal
region. The NMR data imply that this disordered C-terminal
region found in the crystal structure may be due to intermolecu￾lar contacts. The importance of the third C-terminal helix (a3)
has been illustrated in two ways. Firstly, proteins lacking a3
have a reduced affinity for IgG (Ferris, 1992; Huston et al,
1992); secondly, non-truncated forms of an IgG binding protein
based upon SpAB were found to be more highly expressed
than theirC-terminally truncated partners (Jansson etal, 1990).
The fluorescence emission properties of tryptophan (Trp)
residues are sensitive to their immediate environment and may
be able to act as probes for the local conformation of proteins.
The combination of site-directed mutagenesis and fluorescence
spectroscopy has been used to investigate the unfolding path￾way of many proteins and the various forces which stabilize
protein conformation. Smith et al. (1985) produced a series of
mutants of lactate dehydrogenase each of which contained a
unique Trp residue. These proteins showed that Trp residues
are able to report local changes in protein structure upon
denaturation and can be used to dissect the unfolding pathway
of the enzyme. By employing a similar approach, Trp residues
have been inserted into and used to follow the unfolding of a
synthetic IgG binding protein (SpAB*) based upon the B
domain of protein A from S.aureus (SpAB), as described in
Popplewell etal (1991).
The genes, SpAB* and SpAB*-2, encoding single or two
consecutive binding domains (respectively) based upon SpAB,
have been expressed as fusion proteins with the N-terminal
81 amino acids of an inactive form of bovine DNase I
(Popplewell et al, 1991). The fusion protein, which contains
53 amino acid residues in the binding domain, shows similar
binding characteristics to that of SpA with respect to the
source and affinity of the species bound (Popplewell et al,
1991). Site-directed mutagenesis of SpAB* has been used to
examine the binding interactions of this protein to IgG by
the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Popplewell
et al, 1991). In our paper, the substitution of specific amino
acids in SpAB* by Trp residues has been used to investigate
the presence and effect of the putative third helical region of
the protein. However, the functional binding domain of SpAB*
is insufficient in size (53 residues per binding domain) to form
the three a-helices proposed by Torigoe et al. (1990). Insertion
of an oligonucleotide cassette encoding a further 12 amino
acid residues into the SpAB* gene produced C-SpAB* which
contains all the amino acid residues necessary to make the
three a-helix protein described in Torigoe et al (1990) and
Gouda et al (1992). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to

generate a series of mutant versions of the truncated SpAB*
(53 residues) and full-length C-SpAB* (61 residues) proteins.
In each mutant a selected amino acid residue situated in one
of the a-helices of SpAB* and C-SpAB* was replaced by a
unique Trp. The various proteins were assayed for IgG binding
(i) by competitive ELISA to assess the effect of the mutation
upon the binding interaction, and (ii) in fluorescence spectro￾scopic studies to provide information about the immediate
environment and conformational stability of the proteins. The
effect of each of the Trp substitutions upon the overall structure
of the domain, and upon the IgG binding interface in a l and
al, was also investigated by molecular graphics modelling of
each mutation and energy minimization of the resulting struc￾ture, either alone or as a complex with IgG Fc, for correlation
with the experimental results.
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids, mutagenesis and cell growth con￾ditions
The Escherichia coli JM103 strain (Messing et al., 1981) was
used as a bacterial host in all experiments. The construction
of the gene fusion plasmids pSpAB*-2, pSpAB*-l, pSpAB*-2
Y18J6W and pSpAB*-l Y18W has been described previously
(Popplewell etal., 1991).
Plasmids pSpAB*-2 and pSpAB*-l were digested with
HindUl. A 127 bp DNA fragment was removed and replaced
by a 56 bp oligonucleotide cassette encoding a3 as shown.

The resulting plasmids pC-SpAB*-2 and pC-SpAB*-l were
then used as templates for further mutagenesis. The EcoRl￾Pstl fragment encoding the genes SpAB*-2, SpAB*-l, C￾SpAB*-2 and C-SpAB*-J was subcloned into the bacteriophage
M13mpl8 (Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985). Site-directed muta￾genesis was performed using the mismatch primer method of
Kunkel (1985). The oligonucleotides used were synthesized on
an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA synthesizer. The mismatch
primer oligonucleotide sequences are shown below.

The mutated codon is in bold. The nucleotide sequences of
the mutant genes were verified by DNA sequencing of the
single-stranded M13mpI8 using 'Sequenase', modified phage
T7 DNA polymerase (Tabor and Richardson, 1987; Sequenase
kit was purchased from US Biochemical Corporation). The
mutant gene was excised from the bacteriophage with EcoRl￾Pstl digestion and subcloned into the expression vector
pKK223-3 (Brosius and Holy, 1984). The expression and
purification of the mutant proteins from E.coli JM103 cells
transformed with the appropriate expression vector was as
described by Popplewell et al. (1991).
EUSA
To quantify the IgG binding activity of the various mutants, a
competitive micro-ELISA technique was used essentially as
described by Popplewell et al. (1991). The wells of a 96-weIl
microtitre plate were coated with a constant amount of SpA
(15 ng/well) at 37°C for 3 h. Following coating, serial dilutions
of the mutant proteins were made in PBS-Tween (0.1 % v/v),
and to this a 100 uJ mixture of swine anti-sheep IgG-HRP
(horse radish peroxidase) (0.5 (ig/ml) and swine IgG (0.5 u.g/
ml) in PBS-Tween were added and incubated for 30 min. The
plate was then washed five times and the substrate solution
(0.4 mg/ml o-phenylene diamine, 0.1% v/v H2O2 in 0.1 M
citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 5.0) added to each well. The
reaction was then stopped after 15 min by the addition of
12.5% H2SO4 and the absorbance measured at 495 nm on a
(Dynatech MR5000) automated plate reader.
Fluorescence experiments
Fluorescence spectra and measurements were performed on a
Hitachi F2000 spectrofluorimeter at a constant temperature of
25°C. Excitation and emission slits were set at 2 nm for spectra
and 5 nm for the denaturation titrations.
Stability measurements
Molecular biology grade guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn HC1)
was purchased from Sigma and the concentrations of the Gdn
HC1 solutions, in 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.5, were
calculated from their refractive indices as described by Pace
(1986). Gdn HC1 denaturation curves were determined by
measuring the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of a protein
solution as a function of Gdn HC1 concentration. Preliminary
experiments showed that the unfolding process for this protein
is rapid and is completed within a few minutes at 25°C.
Therefore, protein samples in the presence or absence of Gdn
HC1 were incubated for 1 h at 25°C prior to measurement to
ensure that equilibrium had been reached.
Molecular modelling and energy minimization
The structures of the native SpAB domain and of the Trp
mutants were generated from the crystal structure of the
complex with IgG Fc (Brookhaven Protein Databank entry
1FC2; Deisenhofer, 1981) using INSIGHT II (Biosym Techno￾logies Inc.) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation.
The C-terminal helix, a3, was built by extending the polypep￾tide chain in a helical conformation from Ser45 to Ser58 (the
extent of the helical segment in the NMR solution structure;
Gouda et al., 1992), in place of the disordered, random coil
segment of SpAB in the Fc complex structure. The orientation
of rx3 relative to al generated in this way was very similar to
that described by Gouda et al. (1992). The additional residues
(59-61) present in C-SpAB* are expected to adopt a random
coil conformation and were not included in the model.
The modelled native and mutant structures were subjected to
energy minimization using DISCOVER (Biosym Technologies
Inc.). Typically, 100 steps of steepest descent followed by
1500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization were performed,
after which the incremental decrease in energy was always
<0.01 kJ/mol and the r.m.s. derivative -0.05 kJ/mol/A. The
structures of each of the mutants were compared with the
native SpAB model minimized under similar conditions. For
certain of the mutants (as described in Results), the SpAB
domain was also minimized as a complex with Fc to discover
whether small changes in structure at the interface could be
accommodated in the complex. In these cases, only the contact

segments of the Fc structure were relaxed, together with SpAB,
in the minimization.
Results
The aim of this work was to determine the effect of the C￾terminal helix, a3, on the structural stability of the IgG binding
domain of protein A and to compare the interaction of SpAB*
and C-SpAB* with IgG. The two constructs used in this
study were based on the X-ray crystallographic structure
(Deisenhofer, 1981) and the NMR solution structure of SpAB
(Gouda el al., 1992). Both structures contain the amino acids
necessary to form al and a2, the region responsible for IgG
binding, but C-SpAB* contains the additional residues needed
to form a3. Figure 1 illustrates the three helices formed in the
full-length construct C-SpAB*. and indicates the segment
missing from the truncated domain, SpAB* (in which a3 is
not expected to form). All native and mutant constructs
were efficiently expressed as inclusion bodies and purified as
described by Popplewell et al. (1991).
Fluorescence properties of Trp mutants
The absence of Trp residues in the SpAB* construct means
that substitution of an amino acid by Trp affords the protein
new fluorescence properties. The locations of the six residues
individually substituted by Trp are shown in Figure 1. The
emission spectra of the mutants possessing single Trp residues
(one per binding domain) were analysed (Figure 2a and
b). While each mutant displayed a characteristic emission
spectrum, the position of the emission maximum of each

the location of the six residues, two in each of the three helices ccl-a3, that
were individually substituted by Trp in the full-length construct C-SpAB*.
The truncated version of the domain, SpAB*, lacks residues beyond the
point indicated by the arrow (unshaded section of ribbon); note that without
these residues, the helix a3 is not expected to form (image generated by
MOLSCRIPT; Kraulis, 1991)
mutant was the same whether a full-length, truncated, single￾or two-domain form of the protein was measured.
Tyrl8 is situated in al and is involved in the binding
interaction with Fc through the formation of a weak hydrogen
bond with the backbone carbonyl group of residue 432 and
extensive non-bonded interactions. Replacement of Tyrl8 by
a Trp residue leads to an emission maximum at 340 nm
which is indicative of a solvent-exposed residue (Figure
2b). Molecular graphics modelling clearly indicates that this
substitution causes no changes to occur in the core of the
domain or in the conformations of any of the other contact
residues of SpAB*. In contrast, the side chain of Ile20, also in
a l, contributes to the hydrophobic core of the protein (Figure
1). This environment is confirmed by the emission maximum
for Trp20 of 334 nm (Figure 2a). Modelling of this substitution
reveals that Trp20 can be accommodated in the core of the
domain, but only with significant changes in the polypeptide
backbone conformations. Energy minimization of the Trp20
mutant structure suggests that movement of the al-a 2 loop
region, and of the side chains of Leu residues 23 and 26 in
particular, expands the core and accommodates the Trp residue

 at McMaster University Library on January 14, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Fig. 3. The structure of the modelled SpAB domain after single site substitution by Tip (black), superimposed upon the native structure of the domain (grey),
after equivalent energy minimization of both structures (refer to text) for (A) I20W mutation and (B) the F34W mutation. The two pairs of structures are
viewed from slightly different angles, but in each the helix a l and the principal contact residues for Fc binding are on the left.
(Figure 3A). Interestingly, this new conformation for the ocl￾cc2 loop and Leu residues is more similar to that found in the
NMR solution structure (Gouda et al, 1992).
Ile35 situated in a2 also contributes to the core of the
protein (see Figure 1), but is only partially buried. Deisenhofer
(1981) suggests that this is a contact residue for Fc. However,
it may have a more indirect effect upon Fc binding by affecting
the interactions between a l and a2 (Gouda et al, 1992).
When replaced by a Trp residue the emission maximum is
334 nm, suggesting a hydrophobic environment comparable
with that of Trp20 (Figure 2b). Modelling indicates that this
mutation is readily accommodated, only affecting the side￾chain conformation of the adjacent Phe34. This latter residue
is situated in the non-binding face of al, orientated away from
Fc in the complex, towards the amino acid residues in the C￾terminal portion of the protein (Figure 1). The solution structure
(Gouda et al., 1992) of SpAB revealed that Phe34 is sandwiched
between the side chains of Leu48 and Leu55 of a3 (see Figure
1); molecular modelling of the mutant indicates that Trp34
can adopt a similar location without substantially disturbing
other residues of the core, although there is an overall shift of
<x3 relative to a2 (see Figure 3B). The emission maximum
obtained when Phe34 is replaced by Trp is 336 nm (Figure
2a), which shows that the environment is also relatively
hydrophobic.
The two Leu residues 48 and 55 in a3 involved in this
stabilizing interaction with Phe34 were also substituted by
Trp. The emission maximum of Trp48 is at 335 nm and
indicates a relatively hydrophobic environment (Figure 2b).
The modelling of this mutation reveals that the partially buried
Trp can be accommodated, and with only relatively minor
changes in the positions of the a l and a2 relative to a3.
Trp55, however, yields an emission maximum of 340 nm
indicative of a considerably more exposed residue (Figure 2a).
The modelling clearly shows that the substitution of this
surface-exposed residue can be tolerated without affecting any
other residues.
Conformational stability of SpAB
The intrinsic fluorescence characteristics of the Trp residue
permits solvent denaturation studies to determine the conforma￾tional stability (AGH2o) of the mutant proteins. Upon treatment
with Gdn HC1, there is a decrease in fluorescence intensity
and a red shift in the emission maximum for all proteins. It is
worth noting that the rates of both denaturation and renaturation
were too fast to be analysed by conventional fluorescence
spectroscopy. Denaturation curves (Figure 4a and b) measuring
this decrease in intensity were determined for all proteins as
described by Pace (1986). To analyse the curves, a two-state
folding mechanism was assumed which allows the calculation
of the apparent fraction of unfolded protein, F^p, using:
where F is the observed fluorescence intensity, and Ff
 and Fu
are the fluorescence intensities associated with the folded and
unfolded conformations. Extrapolation of the pre- and post￾transition regions allows the determination of Ff and Fu. The
difference in free energy between the folded and unfolded
conformations, AG, is calculated using:
AC = -/?r-ln[(Fapp)/(l - F^)]
= -/?rin[(Ff
.F)/(F-Fu )].
For all the results reported here, AG was found to vary linearly
with Gdn HC1 concentration. Therefore the data were fitted
by the equation:
AG = AGHJO - "»[Gdn HC1],

Figure 4a and b shows the apparent fraction F^ of unfolded
protein (for all of the Trp mutants) as a function of the
concentration of Gdn HCI at 25°C. The data were analysed
using the equations above and the results are shown in Table
I. It can be seen that the shapes of the denaturation curves are
significantly different depending on the position of the reporter
group. When the Trp is in a 1 of C-SpAB* the mutant appears
to unfold in very low concentrations of Gdn HCI (<<1 M),
whereas when the Trp reporter is within a2 or a3, >1 M Gdn
HCI is required to perturb its environment. These results
suggest that a l is more sensitive to the effects of Gdn HCI
than a2 or a3. This is also evident from the data presented in
Table I, which show that the presence of a Trp residue in
a l results in a lower conformational stability, denaturation
midpoint and m value than in a2 or a3 mutants.
The effect of the presence of a3 on the stability of al and
a2 was investigated by measuring the unfolding of the truncated
(SpAB*) versions of these mutants. Figure 5 (and Table I)

compares the results obtained for the unfolding of the full￾length and truncated constructs as probed by Trp reporters in
a l (Y18W) and a2 (F34W). The curves in Figure 5 show that
the unfolding transition of mutant F34W is influenced by
the presence (AGH2O = 3.0 kcal/mol) or absence (AGH2o
 =
2.4 kcal/mol) of a3. In contrast, the unfolding of mutant
Y18W is little affected (AGH?o = 1-6 kcal/mol in the presence
of a3 and AGH2o = 1 -5 kcal/mol in the absence of a3). These
differences in response to the presence of a3 result from the
location of F34W in a2 which contacts and interacts with a3,
whereas Y18W is located in a l and makes no contact with a3.
All of these results are consistent with the observation that
while a2 and a3 contribute several residues to the hydrophobic
core of the domain and interact intimately, residues of al,
particularly those towards the N-terminus, interact less tightly
with a2 and a3 (Gouda et al., 1992).

the ability of the protein in solution to inhibit the binding of
SpA to IgG. Representative results for the six mutants of C￾SpAB* are shown in Figure 6. Table II shows that the two￾domain constructs of C-SpAB* bind to swine IgG with 2- to
5-fold higher affinity than the corresponding single-domain
constructs. This difference in binding affinity between the one￾and two-domain constructs is equivalent to -1 kcal/mol.
Mutation of Phe34, Leu48 and Leu55 which are in the non￾binding face of SpAB* does not alter the high binding affinity
(refer to values for the two-domain C-SpAB* mutants in Table
II; see also Figure 6). The modelling of the Trp34 and
Trp55 substitutions (as described above) did not affect the
conformations of the contact residues for Fc, consistent with
the observed binding affinities. It can be seen in Figure 3B
that for the F34W mutant the positions of the backbone atoms
of a l and oc2, and Fc contact residue side chains such as
Gin 14, Tyrl8, Leu21, are virtually unchanged. However, the
mutation L48W and the accommodation of this bulkier residue
did affect the positions of al and a2 relative to a3, and thus
also the disposition of the side chains that constitute the
binding site for Fc. However, these differences are slight, and
the relative positions of the side chains are virtually unaffected

(e.g. Gin 14, Tyrl8, Leu21). Furthermore, when the energy of
the structure of the mutant in complex with Fc was minimized,
relaxing only the contact regions of the Fc (residues 247-258,
307-318 and 430-437), all of the interactions between SpAB
and Fc were maintained.
The mutation Y18W reduces the binding affinity 2-fold
(Table II; Popplewell et al., 1991). The substitution of this
exposed contact residue is not predicted to affect any of
the surrounding residues (as described above); furthermore,
modelling of the complex with Fc indicates that Trp 18 can be
accommodated at the interface with only very slight changes
in the surface loop of Fc residues 431-436. In contrast, the
Trp20 mutation results in a dramatic loss of binding activity
(-100- to 200-fold; Table II and Figure 6). It can be seen in
Figure 3A that the modelling of this substitution indicated
substantial changes to the polypeptide backbone of the al-a 2
loop and, in the conformation of the contact residues for Fc,
particularly Glnl4, Phel7, Tyrl8, Leu21 and Ile35. The
substitution of residue Ile35 by Trp also reduces the binding
affinity considerably (~ 15-fold; Table II). Although modelling
of this mutation in the free SpAB domain suggested that only
the adjacent Phe34 might be affected, in the Fc complex it is
clear that the bulkier Trp cannot be accommodated because it
clashes with Gln311 in the Fc. Only when substantial segments
of the Fc structure (residues 307-318 and 249-256) are
relaxed during energy minimization can the Trp35 be accom￾modated.
Finally, the data in Table II reveal that the full-length
constructs, which include a3, exhibit binding affinities for all
the mutants, one- or two-domain, ~3-fold higher than the
corresponding truncated versions. The effect of the presence
of the C-terminal amino acid residues upon binding of the
wild-type and mutant domains to various IgG species was also
studied. It was found that although the additional C-terminal
residues improved binding affinity, they did not alter binding

(data not shown).
Discussion
Crystallographic evidence (Deisenhofer, 1981) suggests that
when bound to Fc, SpAB is composed of two anti-parallel a￾helices, al (Gln9-Hisl8) and a2 (Glu24-Asp36), with a
disordered C-terminal region. The structures of both the free
and bound SpAB have also been investigated using NMR
(Gouda et al., 1992), and these demonstrate that unbound
SpAB consists of three a-helices. Helices al and oc2 contain
the amino acids involved in the binding interaction and are
essentially the same as in the crystal structure of the complex;
Ct3 (the C-terminal region) is composed of residues Ser41-
Ala55 and does not participate in the binding interaction.
This tri-helical bundle, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions,
remains intact when bound to Fc (Gouda et al., 1992).
The importance of a3 has been illustrated in two ways.
Firstly, proteins lacking a3 have a reduced affinity for IgG
(Ferris, 1992; Huston et al., 1992), and secondly, non-truncated
forms of an IgG binding protein based upon SpAB were found
to be more highly expressed than their C-terminally truncated
counterparts (Jansson et al., 1990). Comparison between the
affinities of SpAB domains which either have or do not have
the amino acids corresponding to a3 in the tri-helical motif
have been made using competitive ELISA (Table II). The
~3-fold lower binding affinity of the truncated proteins
indicates that the contribution to IgG binding made by the
additional amino acids is -1.0 kcal/mol (average of the values
for the single-domain proteins determined by competitive
ELISA in this study). This decrease in binding affinity may
result from a loss in hydrophobic interactions between the
helices which affects the overall protein fold. It has been
proposed that a re-orientation of al relative to a2 occurs upon
binding of SpAB to Fc (Gouda et al., 1992), and the lack of a
stabilizing contribution from a3 may affect this conformational
change and hence decrease the affinity for Fc.
The affinity for Fc is greater when more than one domain
is present. The data presented in Table II show that the relative
affinities of the two-domain constructs are in general 2- to 5-
fold higher using the competitive ELISA technique than those
of the single-domain proteins. The linking together of binding
domains has been shown to have little effect upon the associ￾ation rate, but noticeably decreases the dissociation rate thus
increasing the affinity for IgG (Malmqvist, 1993).
Tyrl8 is a contact residue in the complex with Fc; the
hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl
group of the peptide bond between residues 432 and 433 of
the Fc (Deisenhofer, 1981). Popplewell et al. (1991) showed
through ELISA experiments that mutation of this residue to
Phe, thereby removing the possibility of hydrogen bond
formation, causes a 3-fold decrease in binding affinity.
Popplewell et al. (1991) also found that replacement of Tyrl8
by Trp, a bulkier side chain than either Phe or Tyr, decreases
trie binding affinity by a factor of two. A similar result,
equivalent to a 0.4 kcal/mol change in free energy of binding,
was found in the present study using a competitive ELISA
approach. The competitive ELISA technique described here is
preferable to the ELISA procedure used by Popplewell et al.
(1991), as the protein of interest is free in solution.
The mutation F34W does not affect the binding affinity
compared with wild-type. It can be seen in Figure I that die
Trp side chain is orientated away from the binding face of the
protein towards a3, and modelling of this substitution indicates
that this mutation can be tolerated without significantly
affecting the surrounding residues (Figure 3b). A mutation of
the same residue to Ala (Cedergren et al., 1993) also resulted
in no change in binding affinity.
In contrast, Ile35 is a key residue in the interaction of SpAB
with IgG. Mutation of this residue to Ala (Cedergren et al.,
1993) decreases binding ~70-fold, and we have shown that
alteration to a Trp residue, i.e. an increase in the size of the
side chain, reduces binding 15- and 60-fold (for the single￾and two-domain constructs, respectively; see Table II), corres￾ponding to -1.60 and 2.37 kcal/mol (per two domains) in
binding free energy. It is clear from the modelling that Trp at
this location cannot be accommodated by the Fc without
substantial conformational change. Cedergren et al. (1993)
propose that stabilization of the interaction between a I and
a2 can affect binding, since the NMR data of Gouda et al.
(1992) suggests that a change in the relative orientation of
these helices occurs upon binding to Fc. However, SpAB*-2
containing the I35W mutation has a conformational stability
determined by Gdn HC1 denaturation similar to that of SpAB*-
2 F34W (Table II) which has a wild-type binding affinity. This
suggests that there is nodestabilizationof theal-a2 interaction
by this mutation, and that the decrease in binding affinity
arises because a conformational change in the Fc has to occur
to accommodate the bulkier Trp side chain.
The presence of the additional amino acid residues which
form the full-length construct increases both the conformational
stability and m values of the proteins (Table I). This increase
in the former is presumably due to the contribution of the
additional interactions from a3 to the hydrophobic core.
However, the m value, which is a measure of the dependency
of AC upon Gdn HC1 concentration, reflects the size and
composition of the polypeptide (Pace, 1975); thus, the increase
in the value of m (Table I) for the proteins containing those
residues required to form a3 is to be expected.
In the solution structure of SpAB determined by NMR
(Gouda et al., 1992) al lies -30° with respect to a2 and a3,
which are in intimate contact and anti-parallel to each other.
As a consequence, the N-terminal part of al is less closely
associated with a2 and a3 than its C-terminal region. The
denaturation curves (Figure 4 and data in Table I) for Trpl8
and Trp20 show that only a small amount of denaturant is
required to cause a change in the environment around these
Trp residues in al. In a2, however, Trp34 and Trp35 only
report unfolding when approximately four times as much
denaturant is present. The same is true when reporter groups
are placed in a3 (Trp48 or Trp55). These results imply the
existence of stabilizing interactions between a2 and a3 which
cause these helices to be more resistant to denaturant than al.
Comparison between the NMR and X-ray crystallographic
structures of SpAB (Gouda et al., 1992) revealed that the
positions of certain side chains of residues in al involved in
the SpA-Fc interaction (e.g. Tyr 18 and Leu21) and the al -
a2 interaction (e.g. Ile20) alter as a consequence of a change
in the relative orientation of al and a2. The apparently lower
conformational stability of al, and its looser association with
a2 and a3, may facilitate such conformational changes.
The presence of additional binding domains does not greatly
increase the conformational stability of the proteins as meas￾ured by the perturbation of Trp fluorescence. These observa￾1469
 at McMaster University Library on January 14, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from S.P.Bottomley et al
tions suggest that each domain is behaving independently and
not in a cooperative manner. Since the position of the Trp
residues in each domain of the two-domain constructs is
identical, it might be expected that its fluorescence properties
would be affected by denaturant in a similar manner. The use
of this fluorescence reporter group may also limit the detected
unfolding to the immediate locality of the Trp residue. CD
studies now under way will clarify if this is indeed the case.
This also implies that the structure of successive domains is
not altered by linking them together, although NMR and/or
X-ray crystallographic studies are needed to confirm this.
The earlier studies of Popplewell et al. (1991) showed that
the fusion partner of the protein had no effect on the binding
interactions of the single- or two-domain constructs, demon￾strating the conformational independence of the IgG binding
domains. The similarity in the values of conformational stability
for the single- and two-domain constructs determined by
fluorescence studies reported here also shows that the short
leader sequence has little, if any, influence on the unfolding
process.
The values of AGH2Q recorded for the proteins in this study
(Table I) reflect the stability of specific regions of the protein,
as reported by the Trp residues at their particular locations.
The highest values are reported for the two mutants of a3
(L48W, L55W) and F34W in al. The lowest values are for
the two mutations in a I (Y18W, I20W). All of these values
are relatively low, however; Privalov (1979) showed that the
difference between the folded and unfolded states of most
naturally occurring globular proteins is between 5 and 15 kcal/
mol. For the wild-type SpAB the value is 6.6 kcal/mol, as
determined by CD studies (Cedergren et al, 1993) which
detect changes in the peptide backbone throughout the protein,
rather than individual regions of the protein as determined in
the present study. The same authors found that the replacement
of Phe34 by Ala did not affect binding, but did reduce the
conformational stability by 3.5 kcal/mol. This difference in
stability is comparable with that of the F34W mutant, and also
with the L48W and L55W mutants, and indicates that the
interactions between Phe34 in a2 and the two Leu residues
(48 and 55) in ot3 provide a substantial fraction of the
stabilization of the domain.
The studies described above show that the presence of a3
leads to a higher affinity for Fc and also to an increased
conformational stability. The interaction of <x2 and a3 results
in higher stabilities for these helices relative to al. We
therefore propose that the unfolding pathways of these IgG
binding domains originate with the unfolding of al.
