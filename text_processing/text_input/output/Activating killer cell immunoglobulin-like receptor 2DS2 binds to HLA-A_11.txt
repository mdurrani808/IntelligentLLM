Inhibitory killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) are known to recognize
HLA ligands mainly of the HLA-C and Bw4 groups, but the ligands
for KIRs are poorly understood. We report here the identification
of the cognate ligand for the activating KIR 2DS2 as HLA-A*11:01.
The crystal structure of the KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 complex was
solved at 2.5-Å resolution and revealed residue-binding charac￾teristics distinct from those of inhibitory KIRs with HLA-C and
the critical role of residues Tyr45 and Asp72 in shaping binding
specificity to HLA-A*11:01. Using KIR2DS2 tetramers, binding to
surface HLA-A*11:01 on live cells was demonstrated and, fur￾thermore, that binding can be altered by residue changes at p8
of the peptide, indicating the influence of peptide sequence on
KIR–HLA association. In addition, heteronuclear single quantum
coherence NMR was used to map the involvement of critical resi￾dues in HLA binding at the interface of KIR and HLA, and validates
the data observed in the crystal structure. Our data provide struc￾tural evidence of the recognition of A*11:01 by the activating
KIR2DS2 and extend our understanding of the KIR–HLA binding
spectrum.
Human killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane
glycoproteins expressed on natural killer (NK) cells that
detect the expression levels of major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I on normal and diseased cells (1–3). In humans,
KIR genes are divided into inhibitory type (2DL and 3DL) and
activating type (2DS, 3DS, and 2DL4), which are receptors
with two or three C2-type Ig-like extracellular domains (4–6).
Whereas the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-ligand specificities
for inhibitory KIRs are relatively well studied, with available
structural information for three KIR-DL–HLA complexes, the
ligands for activating KIRs are not well-defined and no KIR-DS–
HLA complexes have been described (7, 8). We report here the
structure of the activating KIR2DS2 in complex with HLA￾A*11:01 and a vaccinia viral peptide. The solved structure at
2.5-Å resolution reveals that Tyr45, which is a residue specific to
KIR2DS2, forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of the
HLA α1-helix at Thr80 and contributes to the binding specificity
of KIR2DS2–A*11:01. This is a distinct departure from the in￾hibitory KIRs that use position 44, which engages the dimorphic
HLA-C1 (Asn80) or HLA-C2 (Lys80) epitope of HLA-C. These
data provide a detailed description of the unique features that
characterize the binding of an activating KIR and its cognate
HLA ligand.
Results
Crystal Structure of the KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 Complex. Human
KIRs have been reported to bind HLAs that carry a selective
range of epitopes including C1, C2, Bw4, and A3/A11 (1, 9). Crystal
structures of KIR2DL1–C*04:01 (10), KIR2DL2–C*03:04 (11),
and KIR3DL1–B*57:01 (12) in complex with their respective
HLA ligands are available, but there is as yet none for activating
KIRs. The activating KIR 2DS2 is an interesting KIR that has
been associated with NK responses and susceptibility to cyto￾megalovirus (13), hepatitis C virus (14), and ulcerative colitis (15).
It has very close sequence similarity to KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3,
differing only in four and two amino acid residues, respectively,
and, despite having only these few substitutions, binding to HLA-C
was abrogated (16, 17). KIR, HLA, and β2-microglobulin recom￾binant proteins were refolded (18), and cocrystals of KIR2DS2–
*001 and –A*11:01 bound to the vaccinia virion membrane protein
A14-derived peptide MLIYSMWGK (Immune Epitope Data￾base and Analysis Resource, Epitope ID 41975; www.iedb.org/
assay_details.php?assayId=1359384) were successfully generated
and its structure was determined to 2.5-Å resolution (Fig. 1 A
and B and Table 1). The molecular packing resulted in two
KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 complexes in one asymmetric unit in
a “head-to-tail” arrangement, and contact with the complex can
be observed between the D2 domain of KIR2DS2 and N ter￾minus of the peptide-binding grove of the heavy chain (Fig. S1 A
and B and Table S1). KIR2DS2 bound to HLA-A*11:01 consists
of two C2-type Ig-like domains termed D1 and D2, and displays
a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd for 192 paired Cα) of 2.16 Å
with free 2DS2 (19), 1.17 Å with KIR2DL1–C*04:01, and 0.97 Å
with KIR2DL2–C*03:04. The total buried surface area between
the D1 and D2 domains is 1,020 Å2
, which is similar to the re￾ported values for inhibitory KIRs of 2DL1 (1,076 Å2
), 2DL3
(1,050 Å2
), and 2DL2 (919 Å2
). The interface between HLA￾A*11:01 and KIR2DS2 is 1,180 Å2
, which is the smallest among
KIR–HLA complexes of KIR2DL1–C*04:01 (1,485 Å2
), KIR2DL2–
C*03:04 (1,562 Å2
), and KIR3DL1–B*57:01 (1,740 Å2
). Com￾paring the hinge angle of the free KIR2DS2 (19) with that of the
Significance
Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) function as key
recognition elements in innate immunity. Structural informa￾tion for inhibitory KIRs 2DL2, 2DL1, and 3DL1 in complex with
their respective HLA ligands is available, but such data for ac￾tivating KIRs are lacking. We report here the successful crys￾tallization and solved structure of the activating KIR2DS2 in
complex with HLA-A*11:01. The structure clearly explains the
role of Tyr45, which has long puzzled KIR researchers because
it differentiates KIR2DS2 from all inhibitory KIRs, and is now
shown to bind Thr80 of HLA-A*11:01. Using KIR2DS2 tetramers
to bind HLA on live cells, we also provide evidence that peptide
sequence can affect KIR–HLA binding. Our data thus resolve a
long-standing problem in KIR biology.

2662–2667 | PNAS | February 18, 2014 | vol. 111 | no. 7 www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1322052111complexed KIR2DS2, there is only a small expansion of the
hinge angle induced by the binding from 71.2° to 72.4° (Fig. 1C).
However, after superimposing HLA molecules of different HLA–
KIR complexes, the relative orientations of the D1 and D2 domains
displayed significant differences. The D1 and D2 domain axes of
KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 differ from those of KIR2DL1–HLA￾C*04:01 by 10.6° and 8.5°, respectively (Fig. 1D). A more sig￾nificant D1 axis difference of 25.8° was observed between
KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 and KIR2DL2–HLA-C*03:04, whereas
the D2 axis remained similar. The consequence of this D1 ori￾entation in KIR2DS2 results in the shift of the CC′ loop toward
the C-terminal region of the HLA α1-helix. The CC′ loop of the
D1 domain, hinge region, and BC and FG loops in the D2 do￾main of KIR2DS2 are the main contact points with the HLA α1-
and α2-helical regions (Fig. 2 A and B and Fig. S2). The CC′ loop
of KIR2DS2 was observed to be positioned more toward the C
terminus of the α1-helix of HLA-A*11:01, and this displacement
was 2.6 Å compared with KIR2DL1 (Fig. 2A) and an even more
significant difference of 6.2 Å compared with KIR2DL2 (Fig.
2B). In KIR2DL2, residue Phe45 located at the tip of the CC′
loop is inserted into the groove of the α1-helix of HLA residues
75–80 and is surrounded by atoms through hydrophobic inter￾actions (Fig. 2C). However, Tyr45 of KIR2DS2 shifts toward the
C terminus of the α1-helix, allowing it to contact the NH group
of HLA Thr80 to form a hydrogen bond (Fig. 2C).
The conserved interdomain salt bridge Asp98-Arg149 present
in all inhibitory KIR molecules is not observed in KIR2DS2. For
inhibitory KIRs, this salt bridge is disrupted by conformational
change when the KIR binds to HLA and contributes to the increase
in the interdomain hinge angle of the complexed KIR2DL2.
With KIR2DS2, the Nη1 and Nη2 groups of Arg149 are >8 Å away
from the carboxyl groups of Asp98 in its free form and narrow
slightly to 5.5 and 5.9 Å, respectively, after binding to HLA￾A*11:01. Pro16 in the KIR2DS2 D1 domain, which in KIR2DL1/
2DL2 is Arg16, lies at the interdomain interface, and this dif￾ference in side-chain volume may also contribute to the shaping
of the hinge angle.
Shape complementarity for the interface of KIR2DS2 and HLA￾A*11:01 showed a calculated mean value of shape correlation sta￾tistic of 0.64 and suggests that molecular bond formation contributes
significantly to the binding interaction. Of these, the most important
appears to be formation of salt bridges (KIR–HLA: Asp72-Arg75,
Asp135-Arg145, Glu187-Lys146) and hydrogen bonds (KIR–HLA:
Tyr45-Thr80, Glu106-Ala149, Ser133-Arg145, Ser184-Lys146). A
comparison with the inhibitory KIR2DL1–HLA-C*04:01 and
KIR2DL2–HLA-C*03:04 structures shows the use of Tyr45, Asp72,
Tyr134, and Glu87 in KIR2DS2 to create new interactions that
contribute to its binding specificity with A*11:01 (Table S2).
The footprint of the interaction on the A*11:01 surface shows

IMMUNOLOGYGly79, Thr80, Arg82, and Gly83 to make contact with D1 of
KIR2DS2 (Fig. 2 E–G). Specifically, hydrogen bonds between the
D1 domain and HLA α1-helix at Asp72-Arg75 and Tyr45-Thr80
were observed (Table S3). The D2 domain engages the HLA α2-
helix across a larger number of residues including Ile142, Arg145,
Lys146, Ala149, Ala150, and His151.
NMR Titration of the KIR–HLA Interaction. With the availability of
the solved crystal structure, we sought to confirm these observations
using an alternative approach, and examined the KIR2DS2–HLA￾A*11:01 binding interactions using transverse relaxation-optimized
spectroscopy-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (TROSY￾HSQC), which is a highly sensitive method of assigning positions
of specific atoms and determining chemical shifts indicative of
binding interactions (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3). Tyr45 is unique to
KIR2DS2, and it has been proposed that KIR2DS2 evolved away
from binding the HLA-C1 epitope by substitution of Phe45 with
Tyr45 (16, 17). The importance of position 45, illustrated by a
swap from Tyr45 to Phe45, is sufficient to restore some binding
(although not to the same degree as KIR2DL2) with the Lys80
C1 epitope (17). In the KIR2DS2–A*11:01 structure, the Tyr45
side chain orients toward the α1-helix and hydrogen-bonds with
the Thr80 backbone NH group. NMR analysis showed a chem￾ical shift change at Tyr45 when HLA-A*11:01 was titrated into
the KIR2DS2 sample (Fig. 3C′), thus confirming its role in
KIR2DS2 binding. An interesting feature to be tested is position 44
of KIR2DS2, which in inhibitory KIRs determines the dimorphic
binding characteristic between the C1 and C2 epitopes of HLA-C
(16, 20). From the NMR and structural data, Lys44 can be seen
to have only a weak hydrophobic interaction with Ala83 (Fig. 3B′),
and thus appears to have a diminished role in KIR2DS2 compared
with the inhibitory KIRs.
KIR3DL2 and KIR2DS4 have been reported to bind A*11
and that Lys44, Pro71, and Val72 are important for this interaction
(15, 16). Position 71 in KIR2DS2 is Gln71 and shows polar in￾teraction with the Val76 backbone of A*11:01 (Fig. 3D). Similar
to the structure of KIR2DL2–C*03:01, the tip of KIR2DS2 Gln71
interacts with p8 of peptide bound to HLA-A*11:01, indicating
the potential role of peptide in recognition of HLA-A*11:01 by
KIR2DS2. Only a slight chemical shift change was observed in the
NMR titration experiment, which is consistent with an overall
moderate binding interaction (Fig. 3D′). Asp72 of KIR2DS2
hydrogen-bonds with Arg75 of HLA-A*11:01 (Fig. 3E), and this
KIR-HLA interaction has not been described previously in in￾hibitory KIR binding. The TROSY-HSQC spectrum detects a
strong chemical shift signature for Asp72 and supports the nature
of this binding interaction (Fig. 3E′).
The salt bridge Ser133/Asp135-Arg145 and hydrogen bond
Glu106-Ala149/His151 (Fig. 3 F, G, F′, and G′) conserved in
inhibitory KIRs can also be seen in KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01,
and this represents the retained homology between KIR2DS2
and the inhibitory KIRs. Interestingly, a hydrogen bond that is
usually formed between Asp183 of inhibitory KIRs and Lys146
of HLA is now made by Ser184 of KIR2DS2 (Fig. 3 H and H′).
This slight change to accommodate a subtle shift in the FG loop
preserves the hydrogen bond, which is important for maintaining
the overall integrity of the KIR–HLA complex.
Tetramer Staining Assay of KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 Binding in Live
Cells. To demonstrate whether KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 binding
occurs in live cells, KIR2DS2 tetramers were generated (SI Materials
and Methods). The lymphoblastoid cell line BM03, homozygous
for HLA-A11, was first tested to confirm expression of surface HLA￾A11 using an A11-specific antibody (4i93; Abcam), whereas MF2,
an HLA-A11–null cell line, and the MHC class I mutant 721.221
were both negative for HLA-A11 expression (Fig. S4 A–C). Using
KIR2DS2 tetramers, BM03 showed strong staining when pulsed
with 250 μg of the MLIYSMWGK peptide (WGK; Fig. S4D),
whereas MF2 and 721.221 remained negative in the presence of
the peptide as well as three other peptide variants, MLIYSM￾WAK (WAK), MLIYSMWSK (WSK), and MLIYSMWVK (WVK)
(Fig. S4 E and F). Because tetramer staining is highly sensitive, it
can be used to assess the impact of peptide on KIR–HLA binding.
To do so, peptides with different side-chain volume residues at

residues, Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg, were synthesized. Interestingly,
the replacement of Gly with Ser, Ala, Thr, Val, or Trp at the
p8 position still permits the association between KIR2DS2 and
HLA-A*11:01 (Fig. S4G). However, the presence of charged
residues at p8 of the peptide uniformly resulted in loss of binding
(Fig. S4H). In addition to the peptide sequence, binding is also
influenced in a peptide dose-dependent manner (Fig. S4 I–N).
Taken together, the cell-based tetramer binding assays demon￾strate that KIR–HLA binding is not entirely peptide-agnostic.
Mutational Analysis of KIR2DS2-Binding Contact Residues. Using
a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay, the binding interaction
between KIR2DS2 and A*11:01 was first determined in triplicate,
showing a KD of ∼22 μM (Fig. 4 A and C–F). HLA-C controls
C*08:01, and C*12:02 confirmed the lack of interaction between
KIR2DS2 and HLA-C molecules (Fig. S5 A and B). Mutational
analysis was carried out on all important contact residues of
KIR2DS2 to verify their roles in providing stability to the KIR–
HLA complex (Fig. 4 A, B, and G–P). Alanine mutants at
positions 45, 71, 72, 104, 106, 135, 184, and 187 abrogated KIR–
HLA binding, which confirmed the observations with inhibitory
KIRs that a single amino acid change at a critical position can
completely disrupt binding. An A11-binding motif (21, 22) com￾prising Pro71/Val72 was previously reported, and this was tested
with a double mutation that changed Gln71/Asp72 of KIR2DS2
to Pro71/Val72. However, this did not result in any binding,
which suggests that the Pro71/Val72 combination could function
in the context of KIR2DS4 or KIR3DL2 but not necessarily in
other KIRs such as KIR2DS2.
The mutants Lys44Ala, Tyr134Ala, and Tyr45Phe resulted in
some loss of measurable binding, but this was insufficient to
disrupt the overall stability of the KIR–HLA complex, which
suggests that such disruption is compensated by the network of
salt bridges and other hydrogen bonds that keep the binding
intact. However, a Tyr45Ala mutation abrogated binding, sug￾gesting that Ala is a more drastic change at this position than
Phe, which is of the same aromatic amino acid grouping as Tyr
(Fig. 4 A, M, and N). Hence, position 45 appears to be important
to maintain the stability of KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 binding
given that alanine mutation abrogated binding whereas a similar
mutation at the adjacent position 44 did not. The binding
experiments were performed with both A*11:01 and A*11:02,
which differ only at one amino acid (Glu19Lys), and both HLA
alleles showed similar binding behavior to KIR2DS2. A*11:02
therefore provided a functional and validating replicate for the
SPR binding studies.
Discussion
The main HLA ligand specificities for inhibitory KIRs are HLA-C
(23, 24); however, the activating KIR2DS2 does not bind well to
HLA-C. Although these observations have not been formally

IMMUNOLOGYproven using crystal structure data, amino acid substitution ex￾periments have shown that replacement of tyrosine at position 45
alone of KIR2DS2 can restore some degree of binding activity
with HLA-C. Although tantalizing, these results do not explain the
mechanism behind the loss of binding with HLA-C and which
specific residues of HLA are likely to engage with position 45 of
KIR2DS2. In this study, we provide structural evidence that the
activating KIR2DS2 binds to a previously unrecognized HLA
ligand, A*11:01. In addition, the use of NMR and HSQC titration
provides further confirmation of binding interactions by tracing
chemical shift changes of specific residues.
In contrast with inhibitory KIRs, the role of position 44 in the
activating KIR2DS2 is greatly diminished. The lack of significant
binding interaction of position 44 is a major departure from its
known function in inhibitory KIRs, and SPR data show that
substitution of Lys44 with Ala does not result in a significant
decline in binding. Of interest is position 45, which is a residue
unique to KIR2DS2, and because no prior evidence has been
shown that Tyr45 has a specific function, it has been speculated
to constitute a “fatal” mutation (17) and that it has been actively
selected to lose binding with HLA class I (8, 16). We found that
Tyr45 has an important role in forming hydrogen bonds with the
backbone of Thr80 of HLA. It does so by being positioned closer
to the C terminus of the α1-helix, whereas in inhibitory KIRs,
Phe45 is accommodated by the helix groove comprising the
HLA-A*11:01 75–80 fragment through hydrophobic contacts.
Mutating Tyr45 to Phe45 resulted in some loss of binding but was
not abrogated completely, whereas an Ala45 mutant showed no
binding. This suggests that position 45 plays an important role in
maintaining the stability of the KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 interaction.
The KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 structure has revealed binding
interactions that differ from those seen in inhibitory KIRs; these
are the salt bridges Asp72-Arg75 and Glu187-Lys146, hydro￾gen bond Tyr45-Thr80, and hydrophobic interactions Tyr134-
A149. Interestingly, KIR2DS4 has previously been shown to exhibit
A*11:01 and A*11:02 binding specificity by means of a Pro71/
Val72 motif at the D1 domain (22). Human KIR2DS4 shares this
Pro71/Val72 motif with KIR3DL2, and is believed to have arisen

2666 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1322052111 Liu et al.through a gene conversion event between the ancestral lineages
of these two genes. KIR2DS4-Fc fusion proteins have shown
binding to A*11:02 and to a lesser extent A*11:01, but the in￾teracting residues between KIR and HLA have also not been
formally proven. In KIR2DS2, Asp72 does not follow the binding
interactions proposed for Val72 binding to KIR2DS4, because
substitution of Asp72 with Val results in a loss of binding. Never￾theless, KIR2DS2 and KIR2DS4 have many residue differences
such that Val72 may be relevant only to KIR2DS4. Our data show,
however, that position 72 is an important residue (more so
than position 44), and may be a binding paradigm for acti￾vating KIRs. Gln71 in KIR2DS2 does not participate in strong
bond formation as with Asp72, but it is sufficiently close to
being able to interact with p8 of the peptide. It appears that in
inhibitory KIRs (26–28), bulky or strongly charged residues are
likely to affect the overall KIR–HLA interaction.
In this study, the availability of structural information, live-cell
tetramer staining, NMR, and SPR binding data together pro￾vides insight into the binding of activating KIR2DS2 to HLA￾A*11:01 as its cognate ligand. Furthermore, the role of peptide
sequence is demonstrated by altered KIR2DS2–tetramer binding
when the peptide p8 residues are charged residues, and therefore
lends understanding to how minimal amino acid changes can
dramatically alter binding characteristics of highly homologous
inhibitory KIRs. The identification of the unique network of
critical residues in determining the binding specificity of activating
KIRs and the mediation of peptide in KIR–HLA association will
be the basis for future work on how KIRs are activated and their
mechanism of action.
Materials and Methods
Full details of the methods are described in SI Materials and Methods. Briefly,
single-wavelength native data of the KIR2DS2–HLA-A*11:01 crystal were col￾lected with space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 69.5, b = 94.7,
c = 228.4, α = β = γ = 90° and further processed using CCP4 (29). Rigid-body and
restrained refinement were performed using REFMAC5 (30). Model geom￾etry of the complex was verified with PROCHECK (31), and PDBePISA (32)
was used to generate interface data. The structure coordinates have been
deposited in the Protein Data Bank under PDB ID code 4N8V.
