Abstract
The cytokine interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a major effector molecule for T-helper type 2 inflammation and is
pathogenic in allergic diseases such as asthma. The effects of IL-13 are mediated via a pathway that is
initiated by binding to a heterodimeric receptor consisting of IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα. Antibodies raised against
IL-13 can block its inflammatory effects by interfering with binding to either of the two receptor polypeptides.
Lebrikizumab is a monoclonal anti-IL-13 antibody that has shown clinical benefit in a phase II study for the
treatment of moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma. Here we report the molecular structure of IL-13 in
complex with the Fab from lebrikizumab by X-ray crystallography at 1.9 Å resolution. We show that
lebrikizumab inhibits IL-13 signaling by binding to IL-13 with very high affinity and blocking IL-13 binding to IL￾4Rα. In addition, we use site-directed mutations to identify the most important antibody contributors to binding.
Our studies define key features of lebrikizumab binding and its mechanism of action that may contribute to its
clinical effects.

Introduction
Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a member of the four-helix
bundle short-chain cytokine family that, along with
the closely related cytokine IL-4, is associated with
allergic type 2 inflammation.1–3 IL-13 binds to two
receptors: (1) the heterodimeric combination of IL￾13Rα1 and IL-4Rα or (2) IL-13Rα2. Of these, the
heterodimeric receptor of IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα is
also bound by IL-4.
The affinities of IL-13 and IL-4 for these three
receptor polypeptides and the structures of their
molecular complexes have been determined
previously.4–7 IL-13 binds to IL-13Rα2 with a very
high affinity using the combination of two well￾separated binding sites, more or less at opposite
ends of IL-13 helix D, to interact with all three
domains of the IL-13Rα2 extracellular region.6 In
contrast, IL-13 binds to IL-13Rα1 with a modest
affinity and to IL-4Rα with a weak affinity, leading to
the sequential formation of IL-13/IL-13Rα1 and then
IL-13/IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα complexes. The IL-13Rα1
binding site on IL-13 strongly overlaps with the IL￾13Rα2 binding site, 6 with differences in detail
accounting for the large difference in affinity. In
contrast, the IL-4Rα binding site on IL-13 is distinct
from those of IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2, on the
opposite side of IL-13 and composed of elements
from helices A and C.5
IL-13 is produced by many cell types, including T￾helper type 2 cells, mast cells, basophils, eosino￾phils, innate type 2 cells, natural killer T cells, and
macrophages; it promotes several biological pro￾cesses associated with the pathogenesis of asthma
and other allergic diseases.1–3 For instance, IL-13-
induced intracellular signal transduction mediated by
the IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα receptor, primarily via the
phosphorylation of STAT6 (signal transducer and
activator of transcription 6), is associated with goblet
cell hyperplasia and mucus production, B cell class
0022-2836/$ - see front matter © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. J. Mol. Biol. (2013) 425, 1330–1339switching to IgE, induction of chemoattractants for
eosinophils and other inflammatory cells, promotion
of subepithelial fibrosis, and generation of airway
hyperreactivity. In contrast, IL-13Rα2 is considered
to be primarily a decoy receptor (i.e., without a direct
signaling function), although under some circum￾stances, IL-13 binding to IL-13Rα2 can promote
fibrosis by the induction of TGFβ via an intracellular
signaling pathway that is poorly understood.8
Numerous prior studies have implicated IL-13 and
its receptors in the pathogenesis of asthma and
allergy.1,2,9,10 Polymorphisms of the IL-13 and IL-4Rα
genes are associated with asthma and allergy,
including effects on IgE levels, prevalence of atopy,
and the severity of asthmatic disease.11–16 In addition,
expression of IL-13 and its receptors is increased in
asthma and other allergic diseases, and neutralization
or deficiency of IL-13 and its receptors ameliorates
disease in preclinical disease models.17–24
Recently, several monoclonal antibodies against
IL-13 have been assessed in clinical studies for the
treatment of asthma.25–28 Of these, the anti-IL-13
antibody lebrikizumab improved lung function in
asthmatics who were symptomatic despite treatment
with, for the majority, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)
and a long-acting β2-andrenergic receptor agonist.25
The other anti-IL-13 antibodies have shown varying
degrees of activity in clinical studies.29 The clinical
efficacy of anti-IL-13 antibodies may be influenced
by the binding affinities of the antibodies to IL-13, as
well as the molecular mechanisms by which they
block IL-13 signaling. For instance, IL-13 signaling
through the IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα receptor can be
inhibited by blocking IL-13 binding to either IL￾13Rα1 or IL-4Rα, but these different molecular
mechanisms of blocking IL-13 signaling will have
different consequences on the ability of IL-13 to bind
to IL-13Rα2.
Although lebrikizumab has been previously shown
to block IL-13 signaling through the IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα
receptor,25 the binding affinity of lebrikizumab for IL￾13 and the mechanism by which lebrikizumab blocks
IL-13 signaling have not been described in the
scientific literature. Here we report the binding
affinity of lebrikizumab to IL-13 and the crystal
structure of the complex between IL-13 and the
antigen-binding fragment of lebrikizumab (LebFab).
We find that lebrikizumab binds with a very high
affinity to IL-13 at an epitope that overlaps strongly
with the binding site of IL-4Rα, and using site￾directed mutations of the antibody, we identify
several key residues in the complementarity-deter￾mining regions (CDRs) of lebrikizumab that drive this
high-affinity binding to IL-13.
Results
Effects of LebFab on IL-13 binding to IL-13-Rα1
and IL-13Rα2
Previous studies have demonstrated that lebriki￾zumab blocked IL-13-induced STAT6 phosphoryla￾tion and cell proliferation in vitro and produced
clinical benefits on lung function in asthmatics, both
of which are consistent with blockade of the IL￾13Rα1/IL-4Rα heterodimeric receptor.25 In order to
determine which receptors are affected by lebrikizu￾mab binding to IL-13, we performed ELISA assays
showing that IL-13 binding to neither IL-13Rα1 nor
IL-13Rα2 is reduced by the presence of LebFab
(Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). These results suggest that

binding of cytokine to receptor. (a) LebFab does not inhibit binding of biotinylated human IL-13 (60 nM) to human IL￾13Rα1. Control anti-IL-13 human IgG (■) reduces binding of biotinylated human IL-13 from a maximum level of cytokine
binding (▼) to a level of no cytokine (▲). (b) LebFab does not inhibit binding of biotinylated human IL-13 (0.4 nM) to human
IL-13Rα2. Error bars represent ± standard deviation of three independent measurements.
Structural Basis of IL-13 Blockade 1331lebrikizumab may block the IL-4Rα binding site of IL￾13, thereby preventing the formation of an active
cytokine/receptor complex consisting of IL-13, IL￾13Rα1, and IL-4Rα. The intrinsic affinity between IL￾13 and IL-4Rα alone is too low for direct testing in a
similar ELISA assay.
Molecular structure of the LebFab/IL-13 complex
by X-ray crystallography
In order to understand the binding site for
lebrikizumab on IL-13, we determined the structure
of a complex of LebFab with IL-13 by X-ray
crystallography at 1.9 Å resolution (Table 1).
The molecular complex shows IL-13 bound by the
canonical antigen-recognition site of LebFab. The IL￾13 structure is very similar overall to IL-13 from
Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3L5X, another IL-13/
Fab complex but wherein IL-13 has a different
epitope in contact with the Fab. 30 The most
significant difference in IL-13 Cα positions after
superpositioning (~ 3.8 Å) is centered at Pro72 (in
the CD loop), which has a water-mediated H-bond with the CDR-L1 Asn30 side chain but that also
experiences a close intermolecular contact in our
structure. Absent this and three other short seg￾ments with differences up to ~ 1.9 Å, the root-mean￾square deviation (rmsd) for superpositioning of IL-13
Cα atoms is 0.74 Å, a value that rises to 0.99 Å if all
Cα atoms are included.
Lebrikizumab is a humanized version of a mouse￾derived anti-human IL-13 monoclonal antibody. In
our crystals, LebFab displays an elbow angle of
138°. The conformations of the six CDR loops (L1,
L2, L3, H1, H2, and H3) can be classified31 as L1-
15-1, L2-8-1, L3-9-cis7-1, H1-13-1, H2-9-1, and H3-
anchor-1, respectively, which in each case is the
most common configuration for the given CDR
length. The fidelity with which these classifications
are made is high, with rmsd values for the super￾positioning of main-chain atoms to the prototype
coordinates being less than 0.3 Å, except for CDR￾H1 where it rises to 0.94 Å. The conformational
classification of CDR-H3 is restricted to the amino
acids in the initial and final polypeptide segments
(seven amino acids altogether) and discounts the
highly variable intermediate segment for which
conformational classes are not a useful concept.
There are 12 amino acids in the lebrikizumab CDR￾H3 between Cys92 and Trp103.
The LebFab/IL-13 interface buries 890 Å2 of
protein surface from bulk solvent on each side
(1780 Å2 total). Of the LebFab buried surface, 63%
is from the VH domain and 37% is from the Vκ
domain. At least one residue from each of the six
CDR loops is within 4 Å of IL-13, and 16 amino acids
lose at least 10 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface in
the IL-13 interaction (Fig. 2).
There are 20 IL-13 residues within 4 Å of LebFab,
all of them, except Ser32 from the AB loop, being

The interface is a mixture of polar and hydrophobic
interactions and includes seven bridging waters that
H-bond with both IL-13 and LebFab (Fig. 3). The
topographic complementarity of the IL-13 and
LebFab surfaces is typical of antigen/antibody in￾teractions, with a calculated shape complementarity
statistic, Sc, of 0.71.32 If the seven bridging water
oxygen atoms are considered part of the interface,
Sc rises to 0.77. Of the seven aromatic side chains
within the interface, all come from LebFab (Vκ
residues Tyr28, Phe32, and Tyr49 and VH residues
Trp52, Tyr97, Tyr98, and Tyr100) (Fig. 3) and, of
these, only VH residues Tyr98 and Tyr100 provide a
polar interaction via their hydroxyl moieties (Fig. 3).
IL-13 side chains provide almost exclusively polar
interactions (e.g., Ser58, Glu61, and Arg65), while
IL-13 residues bearing hydrophobic side chains
(e.g., Val54, Ala59, and Ile60) are classified within
the epitope by virtue of polar interactions of their
main-chain atoms, for instance, between IL-13
Gly69 and LebFab LC-Tyr28 main-chain atoms.
Thus, despite a preponderance of aromatic side
chains within the LebFab paratope, the main-chain
atoms of these residues sometimes partake in polar
interactions with IL-13 residues. In addition, non￾traditional H-bonds between aromatic ring H-atoms
and a traditional H-bond acceptor are possible, as
between HC-Tyr100 and IL-13 Gln61. The single
hydrophobic IL-13 side chain contacting LebFab is
Met66, within van der Waals distance of LC-Tyr28
from CDR-L1 (Fig. 3).

Structural Basis of IL-13 Blockade 1333The intermolecular crystal contacts were inspected
for evidence that they may have skewed important
features described above. The intermolecular envi￾ronment produces H-bonds and hydrophobic con￾tacts between symmetry-related complexes at
several patches (Fig. S2). The CL and CH1 domains
of LebFab, plus some nearby elements of the Vκ
and VH domains, are surrounded by symmetry￾related CL and CH1 domains. IL-13 and some
nearby elements of the Vκ domain are surrounded
by symmetry-related copies of IL-13. Notably, both
CDR-L1 and CDR-L3 have close contacts with a
neighboring copy of IL-13, centered on IL-13 residue
Ser36 from the AB loop. The section of CDR-L1
involved in this intermolecular contact does not
contribute to the canonical antigen-binding surface
of LebFab (see above), but part of CDR-L3
contributes to the canonical paratope while also
contacting the symmetry-related IL-13. Since both
CDR-L1 and CDR-L3 conform closely to prototype
loops, we conclude that they do not include artifacts
from crystal packing.
Determination of key residues in lebrikizumab
CDRs that drive high-affinity binding to IL-13
Previous studies demonstrated that lebrikizumab
neutralizes the activity of IL-13 with high potency,
suggesting that lebrikizumab binds to IL-13 with very
high affinity.25 To confirm this, we determined the
dissociation constant (Kd) for IL-13 binding to
lebrikizumab by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
(Biacore). We found that the Biacore-derived Kd for
IL-13 binding to wild-type lebrikizumab is lower than
the detection limit, 10 pM. The lebrikizumab in these
experiments was bound to the SPR chip via an anti￾Fc reagent. Additional SPR measurements of IL-13
binding to a low-density surface of directly amine
coupled lebrikizumab also revealed kinetic con￾stants at the limit of detection (Fig. S3). In order to
understand which lebrikizumab residues are most
vital to this very high affinity interaction, we mutated
several residues within the structural paratope one at
a time and determined Kd values for the mutant
proteins. Conservative mutations of lebrikizumab
residues did not have a measurable effect on Kd, for
instance, HC-Tyr100 mutated to Phe when mea￾sured at 25 °C (Table 2). However, mutations to
alanine of six residues had effects on Kd of 5-fold or
greater, calculated using 10 pM as the Kd for wild￾type lebrikizumab. These results are illustrated in
Fig. 4, where some discrepancies between the
structural paratope, based on surface area buried
in the complex, and the Biacore binding data are
apparent. For instance, HC-Tyr97 protrudes from the
LebFab surface and loses more than 75 Å2 of
solvent-accessible surface by virtue of its proximity
to IL-13 (Fig. 2) and yet mutation of this residue to
alanine has an immeasurably small effect on Kd
(Table 2 and Fig. 4).
Based on affinity measurements of alanine mu￾tants, the functional paratope resides in a strip of VH
residues lying near the face of IL-13 formed by
mostly α-helices B and C (Fig. 4). The most
important LebFab residues according to the effect
of their mutation to alanine on binding include heavy
chain residues Trp52, Asp54, Tyr98, and Tyr100.
Asp54 has significant contact with IL-13 (loss of
solvent-accessible surface; Fig. 3) as it also H-bonds
with IL-13's Ser58 (side chain to side chain). Trp52
lacks a polar interaction with IL-13 but has significant
contact with IL-13 also centered on Ser58. A
measurable but less severe effect arises from
mutation of Trp52 to Phe, consistent with a structural
role internal to the LebFab that would be much less
well filled by Ala. Tyr98 contacts IL-13 residues
Arg65 and Ser68 as it also contributes to an H￾bonding network with CDR-L1, a water and the main
chain of IL-13 Arg65 via its hydroxyl moiety. The
contribution of the H-bonding aspect of Tyr98 is not
large, as mutation to Phe leaves the dissociation
constant beyond the detection limit. Tyr100 contacts
IL-13 residues Glu61 and Gln64 and also contributes
to an extensive water-mediated H-bonding network
that extends to IL-13 residues Val54 and Cys57 in
the BC loop and to Gln64. As seen for Tyr98, the H￾bonding provided by the Tyr100 hydroxyl makes a
marginal contribution to binding, as mutation to Phe
causes a measurable but small effect when mea￾sured at 37 °C (Table 2).
Discussion
Lebrikizumab is a humanized antibody that binds
and neutralizes the activity of IL-13 with high affinity.
Clinical studies indicate that lebrikizumab provides
clinical benefit in the treatment of moderate-to￾severe uncontrolled asthma. 25 Here we have
determined the structure of a complex between

1334 Structural Basis of IL-13 BlockadeLebFab and IL-13, thereby elucidating the structural
epitope on IL-13. In addition, we have defined
several key residues in the CDRs that are respon￾sible for the high affinity of lebrikizumab. The clinical
utility of lebrikizumab derives from its blockade of
IL-13 signaling, which we have determined is due to
LebFab's interference with IL-13 binding to one of
its cell-membrane-bound receptors, IL-4Rα, thereby
preventing formation of IL-13/IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα sig￾naling complexes. With the X-ray structure reported
here, and by reference to previously reported
structures of IL-13 with its receptors,5,6 we can
see precisely how the blockade arises. Figure 5
shows the ternary IL-13/IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα complex,5
determined using X-ray crystallography. An addi￾tional X-ray structure is known, of the complex
between IL-13 and the high-affinity “decoy” recep￾tor, IL-13Rα2.6 There are important differences in
detail, but for the purpose of the present discussion,
we may consider the rough equivalence of IL￾13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 interactions with IL-13 as a
useful simplification. Also shown in Fig. 5 is LebFab
from the present work.
There is a quite significant steric overlap between
LebFab and IL-4Rα when they are both shown as
they bind to IL-13. Of the 20 IL-13 residues within 4 Å
of LebFab, three are also among the seven residues
within 4 Å of IL-4Rα in the ternary complex (Arg65,
Met66, and Gly69) (Fig. 6). We conclude that both
these molecules cannot bind IL-13 at the same time.
On the other hand, LebFab also seems to be
sufficiently distant from IL-13Rα1 that it would not
be expected to interfere with IL-13Rα1 (or IL-13Rα2)
binding by a direct-contact mechanism (Fig. 5).
Thus, lebrikizumab's apparent mechanism of action
contrasts with that of another anti-IL-13 antibody
called CENTO607, for which a crystal structure has
been reported33 and that presents a steric conflict for
IL-13 interaction with IL-13Rα1 (and IL-13Rα2) but
not for IL-4Rα.
The IL-13 and IL-4 affinities for isolated IL-4Rα are
very different: immeasurably low5 and with a
Fig. 6. LebFab epitope and IL￾4Rα binding site on IL-13 overlap.
The 4-Å contact zones from LebFab
(left, in red) and IL-4Rα (right, in
magenta) clearly share IL-13 resi￾dues in common. The view of each
IL-13 is from the same direction
after superpositioning. The inexact
congruence between the overall IL￾13 shapes arises from differences in
residues missing due to disorder in
the refined structures.

of IL-13 to receptor IL-4Rα. The
ternary complex between IL-13, IL￾13Rα1, and IL-4Rα is shown with

IL-4Rα seems to be “inside” Leb￾Fab, an impossibility. The wire

34 respectively. Nonetheless, con￾sidering that both IL-13 and IL-4 bind IL-4Rα using
homologous binding sites and that a part of this site on
IL-13 is also recognized by lebrikizumab, there is a
potential for an interaction between lebrikizumab and
IL-4. We have never observed a measurable effect of
lebrikizumab on IL-4 activity (data not shown).
Several antibodies that bind and neutralize the
activity of IL-13 have entered clinical development
for the treatment of asthma. These include traloki￾numab (CAT-354), IMA-026, IMA-638, and
CNTO5825. 25–28 While the binding epitope of
tralokinumab on IL-13 has not been reported, IMA￾026 and CNTO5825 have been reported to bind to
the IL-13Rα1/IL-13Rα2 binding site on IL-13,26,28
whereas IMA-638 has been reported to bind to the
IL-4Rα binding site on IL-13.26 Interestingly, IMA￾638 had a greater effect on antigen-induced airway
response (allergen challenge) in asthmatics than
IMA-026,26 and it has been suggested that this may
be due to better clearance of IL-13 in patients treated
with IMA-638 arising from IL-13/IMA-638 complexes,
but not IL-13/IMA-026 complexes, being scavenged
by the decoy receptor IL-13Rα2.35 Alternatively,
differences in binding affinities of IMA-638 and IMA￾026 may account for differences in the activity of
these antibodies in allergen challenge studies.
However, IMA-638 showed no effect on symptoms,
lung function, or time to exacerbation compared to
placebo in patients with uncontrolled asthma who
were also receiving ICS or ICS plus long-acting β2-
agonists.26 The Kd of lebrikizumab binding to IL-13 is
b10 pM as determined by Biacore in our studies,
tighter than has been reported previously for other
anti-IL-13 antibodies (165–14 pM36,37). The clinical
effects of lebrikizumab among treated asthmatics,
such as they may differ from those from other anti-IL￾13 antibodies, may be distinguished by its very high
affinity, the exact details of its epitope on IL-13, the
interference of IL-4Rα binding, and the potential for
IL-13 to be scavenged via IL-13Rα2 even when
bound by lebrikizumab, or by combinations of these
characteristics.
Materials and Methods
Protein complex formation and crystal structure
determination
For Fab′2 generation, 125 mg lebrikizumab was adjust￾ed to pH 4.2 with 0.5 M sodium acetate buffer. Pepsin
was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/w) of the IgG.
The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The protein
was diluted 3-fold with water and loaded onto a SPHP
(GE Healthcare) 5-mL column equilibrated in 25 mM
sodium acetate (pH 5.0). The column was washed with
starting buffer (25 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0) and eluted
with 20–25 column volumes with salt gradient to 0.3 M
NaCl. Peaks were assessed by mass spectrometry to
identify the Fab′2 peak pool. Preparation of Fab′ was
accomplished by adjusting the pH of the Fab′2 pool to 7.4,
then adding 1 mM DTT and incubating for 2 h at 20 °C.
Reduction was assessed by mass spectrometry. Addition
of 3 mM dehydroascorbic acid solution (100 mM in
dimethylacetamide) was mixed and incubated 2 h at
20 °C. Mass spectrometry was used to assay for
complete oxidation of the heavy chain/light chain intra￾chain disulfide bridge. The Fab′ was further purified by
size exclusion using S200 (GE Healthcare) in phosphate￾buffered saline (PBS). Recombinant human IL-13 was
purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The
complex was prepared and purified as previously
reported,33 except that glycerol concentration was re￾duced from 10% to 2%.
Crystallization of the complex was carried out by vapor
diffusion in sitting drops at 18 °C. The experiments
consisted of 30 nL protein complex plus 30 nL reservoir
using an Echo Acoustic Liquid Handler (Labcyte). Initial
screens were performed using PEG and PEG II screens
(Qiagen) and PEGRx (Hampton). Monoclinic crystals of
the complex appeared after 2 days from a PEGRx
experiment using 30% (w/v) PEG 1000, 0.1 M sodium
malonate (pH 8.0), and 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0). After 1 week,
crystals were harvested directly from the screening tray
and preserved by immersion in liquid nitrogen after a brief
treatment in pure reservoir.
Diffraction data extending to 1.90 Å were collected at
synchrotron beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source
and reduced38,39 in space group C2. The structure was
solved by molecular replacement40 based on an expecta￾tion of a single complex in the crystallographic asymmetric
unit according to a VM of 2.5 Å3
/Da and using IL-13 from
PDB entry 3L5X and a Fab variable region (with CDR
loops removed) and constant region from PDB entries
1FVC and 1FVD, respectively. Model building and
manipulation41 and refinement42–44 led to the final model
with agreement factors R= 0.179 and Rfree= 0.219. See
Table 1.
ELISA assays for effect of LebFab on IL-13 binding to
receptors
In a 96-well plate, a 200 μg/mL (4.44 μM) solution of
LebFab was serially diluted 2-fold in assay buffer [PBS
(pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.5% bovine
serum albumin] to provide a concentration range from 0.10
to 200 μg/mL (2.2 nM to 4.44 μM). The volume of each
dilution was 35 μL. Biotinylation of IL-13 was accom￾plished using the Thermo EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin Kit
(Pierce Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's
protocol using a 20-fold molar excess. To each well, we
added 35 μL of a 120 nM solution of biotin-IL-13. The
mixture was incubated for 40 min at room temperature.
Following incubation, we transferred the contents of the
well to a 96-well Nunc Maxisorp plate (Roskilde, Denmark)
that was coated overnight with 50 μL of a 2.0 μg/mL
solution of soluble IL-13Rα1-Fc protein in PBS and then
blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin.
After a 40 min incubation, the plate was washed four times
in wash buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). Each
well then received 50 μL of a streptavidin–horseradish
peroxidase solution (Caltag Laboratories, Invitrogen;
1336 Structural Basis of IL-13 BlockadeCarlsbad, CA) and was incubated for 40 min. Following
four washes with wash buffer, we added 50 μL of
tetramethylbenzidine substrate (KPL; Gaithersburg, MD)
to each well. After several minutes, 50 μL of a 1N solution
of HCl was added to stop the reaction. The plate was read
at 450 nM using a Spectra Max 340 plate reader
(Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA). For each sample,
the optical density reading at 450 nM was plotted against
concentration. Curves were plotted in KaleidaGraph
(Synergy Software; Reading, PA) and fitted using a four￾parameter fit or plotted point to point. The same pro￾cedures were followed in an assay using IL-13Rα2, except
that LebFab was used at concentrations approximately 10-
fold lower [0.01–20 μg/mL (0.1 nM to 0.44 μM)], and the
concentration of biotin-IL-13 was reduced to 0.8 nM. A
different anti-IL-13 antibody (11H4v6) was shown able to
completely eliminate IL-13 binding to both IL-13Rα1 and
IL-13Rα2, and on this basis, it was employed as an
experimental control.
Site-directed mutation of lebrikizumab
Mutations were introduced into the heavy and light
chains of lebrikizumab by site-directed Kunkel
mutagenesis.45 The plasmid DNA containing the heavy
or light chain mutation clones were transfected into 293s
cells and harvested 7 days later. IgG was isolated from the
harvest media by protein A affinity chromatography.
Binding assay for lebrikizumab variants using SPR
The binding kinetics of the lebrikizumab variants were
measured using SPR on a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE
Healthcare). Anti-human Fc (GE Healthcare) was immo￾bilized on a CM5 sensor chip via amine-based coupling
using the manufacturer-provided protocol. A high-density
anti-human Fc surface (N5000 resonance units) was
employed in order to minimize the contribution to the
observed antigen-binding kinetics from dissociation of the
antibody from the capture surface. The lebrikizumab
variants were captured at a level of 600 resonance units.
Sensorgrams from passage of human IL-13 at concentra￾tions of 0, 3.13, 6.25, 12.50, 25.0, and 50.0 nM were
recorded using an injection time of 2 min with a flow rate of
30 μL/min, at temperatures 25 °C and 37 °C, and with a
running buffer of 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl,
and 0.005% Tween 20. After injection, disassociation of
the cytokine was monitored for 900 s in running buffer. The
surface was regenerated between binding cycles with a
50-μL injection of 3 M magnesium chloride. The primary
sensorgrams were corrected using a blank cell run in
parallel and by zero-point adjustment using the 0-nM IL-13
buffer. After corrections, sensorgrams were analyzed
using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model with software supplied
by the manufacturer to calculate the kinetic and binding
constants.
