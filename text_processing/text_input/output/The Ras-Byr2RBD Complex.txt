[6, 40]. As discussed above, Asp33 and Asp38 are both
potential salt-bridging partners for Lys101Byr, located on
the C-terminal end of helix 1 in the RBD. Irrespective
of the possible number of interactions (arrows in Figure
2b), the side chain of Ser39 seems to provide no contri￾bution for Byr2 binding, since the alanine mutation in￾creases the Kd value only 3-fold. The contribution of the

residue totally conserved in all GTP binding proteins
and is involved in the switch mechanism by virtue of

The second category is residues flanking the effector

not to be involved in the binding to Byr2RBD. Mutation
of Ras residues Asp30 and Glu31 to the corresponding
residues in Rap proteins, Glu and Lys, results in only a
2-fold increase of the Kd value. This is consistent with
the observation that these residues are not contributing
