Abstract: The b-lactamase inhibitory proteins (BLIPs) are a model system for examining molecular rec￾ognition in protein-protein interactions. BLIP and BLIP-II are structurally unrelated proteins that bind
and inhibit TEM-1 b-lactamase. Both BLIPs share a common binding interface on TEM-1 and make
contacts with many of the same TEM-1 surface residues. BLIP-II, however, binds TEM-1 over 150-fold
tighter than BLIP despite the fact that it has fewer contact residues and a smaller binding interface.
The role of eleven TEM-1 amino acid residues that contact both BLIP and BLIP-II was examined by
alanine mutagenesis and determination of the association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants
for binding each partner. The substitutions had little impact on association rates and resulted in a
wide range of dissociation rates as previously observed for substitutions on the BLIP side of the inter￾face. The substitutions also had less effect on binding affinity for BLIP than BLIP-II. This is consistent
with the high affinity and small binding interface of the TEM-1-BLIP-II complex, which predicts per res￾idue contributions should be higher for TEM-1 binding to BLIP-II versus BLIP. Two TEM-1 residues
(E104 and M129) were found to be hotspots for binding BLIP while five (L102, Y105, P107, K111, and
M129) are hotspots for binding BLIP-II with only M129 as a common hotspot for both. Thus, although
the same TEM-1 surface binds to both BLIP and BLIP-II, the distribution of binding energy on the sur￾face is different for the two target proteins, that is, different binding strategies are employed.

Introduction
Nearly all biological processes are regulated by
protein-protein interactions and understanding the
principles guiding molecular recognition is funda￾mental to our ability to manipulate them.1,2 Many
proteins participating in biological pathways have
multiple binding partners, and understanding how a
single binding site can accommodate a variety of
binding partners with different structural elements
is of significant interest.3 In this study, alanine￾scanning mutagenesis was combined with kinetic
analysis to examine how shared interface residues
in TEM-1 b-lactamase contribute to affinity and
specificity for different binding partner proteins.
The interactions of b-lactamase Inhibitory Pro￾teins (BLIPs) with b-lactamases are an established

Published by Wiley-Blackwell. VC 2014 The Protein Society PROTEIN SCIENCE 2014 VOL 23:1235—1246 1235model for studying protein–protein binding and
molecular recognition.4–10 Many previous studies
have described the presence of binding hotspots,
which are clusters of residues responsible for a large
portion of the binding energy for an interac￾tion.4,5,8,11–13 Substitution of hotspot residues to ala￾nine results in a greater than 10-fold increase of the
dissociation constant (Kd) due to a reduction in bind￾ing free energy. In addition, the presence of
specificity-determining residues in an interface plays
a major role in the choice of binding partners for an
interaction. By definition, substitution of a
specificity-determining residue with alanine has dif￾ferent or even opposite effects on the affinity
between different interaction partners.5,14 The exis￾tence of these residues allows rational engineering
of protein interfaces with altered binding properties.
This study utilizes TEM-1 b-lactamase as a com￾mon binding partner for naturally occurring
BLIPs.9,10 TEM-1 is an extensively studied represen￾tative of class A b-lactamases, which mediate bacte￾rial resistance towards penicillin and cephalosporin
antibiotics.15 Class A b-lactamases are serine hydro￾lases and the family includes a large number of
enzymes from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria. Crystal structures of the TEM-1-BLIP and
TEM-1-BLIP-II complexes reveal extensive interac￾tions of each BLIP with the same interface at the
center of the protruding loop-helix composed of resi￾dues 99–114 of TEM-1 b-lactamase.16,17
BLIP is a naturally occurring inhibitor of b￾lactamases that is produced by the soil bacterium
Streptomyces clavuligerus.
18,19 BLIP inhibits class A
enzymes with a wide range of affinities and its inter￾action with TEM-1 has been extensively studied
using structural and biophysical methods. Crystal
structures of BLIP, as well as the BLIP-TEM-1 b￾lactamase complex, reveal a 17 kD protein that
forms a concave surface which encapsulates the con￾served loop-helix region of class A b-lactamases16,19
(Fig. 1). The BLIP-TEM-1 interface is relatively
large with a buried surface area of 2636 A˚ 2 that con￾tains several aromatic residues.16 Aromatic amino
acids are the most commonly found residues in bind￾ing hot spots and seem to be a common feature in
protein–protein interfaces.20 The BLIP-TEM-1 inter￾action relies on a complex network of residues bridg￾ing the interface. This involves multiple hotspots or
modules that act largely independent of one another
but together contribute most of the binding free
energy for the interaction.6 BLIP inhibits b￾lactamases by inserting two loops into the enzyme
active site that make contacts with catalytic resi￾dues and block antibiotic binding.16
BLIP-II has a seven-bladed b-propeller struc￾ture and shares no structural or amino acid identity
with BLIP (Fig. 1). The crystal structure of the
BLIP-II-TEM-1 complex reveals that BLIP-II inter￾acts with b-lactamase via a buried interaction sur￾face area of 2,187 A˚ 2
, which is smaller than that
observed with BLIP.17 Although BLIP and BLIP-II
are unrelated proteins, they both interact with the
same loop-helix region on TEM-1 b-lactamase16,17
(Fig. 1). Unlike BLIP, BLIP-II uses numerous turns
to bind b-lactamase and sterically block access to
the active site without direct interaction with any
TEM-1 catalytic residues. BLIP-II is a tighter bind￾ing inhibitor of b-lactamases (low picomolar to fem￾tomolar Ki values) than BLIP (micromolar to high
picomolar Ki values) and has a much narrower
range of binding affinities for b-lactamases (two
orders of magnitude from weakest to tightest) when
compared to those observed with BLIP (six orders of
magnitude) despite binding to the same interface on
the enzymes.5,19,21 Kinetic analysis of the binding
reaction indicate the association rate constant for
BLIP-II with TEM-1 (106 M21
s21
) is 10-fold faster
than the on-rate for BLIP-TEM-1 and the off-rate of
Figure 1. Structural comparison of BLIP-TEM-1 (PDB 1JTG) (A) and BLIP-II-TEM-1 (PDB 1JTD) (B). The protruding loop-helix
region (red) and the catalytic serine 70 (blue space fill) of TEM-1 (gray) is shown as the primary binding region for both BLIP
and BLIP-II (orange).
1236 PROTEINSCIENCE.ORG Role of b-Lactamase Residues in a Common InterfaceBLIP-II from TEM-1 (1026 s21
) is 10-fold slower
than that observed for BLIP-TEM-1.10,22 According to
the cocrystal structures, 12 TEM-1 residues are
involved in interactions with both BLIP and BLIP-II
out of a total of 14 TEM-1 residues that interact with
BLIP-II and 24 TEM-1 residues that interact with
BLIP (Materials and Methods) (Table I).10,16,17 There￾fore, BLIP-II uses significantly fewer contact residues
than BLIP but binds TEM-1 with much higher affinity
(150-fold). Understanding how BLIP-II uses fewer
contact residues, has a smaller interface, and yet
binds more tightly than BLIP would be a significant
step towards understanding molecular recognition
determinants of affinity and specificity. Alanine￾scanning mutagenesis of residues on the TEM-1 b￾lactamase side of the interface that are common
between BLIP and BLIP-II was performed and the
association and dissociation rate constants for each
mutant were determined to assess the contributions of
the individual TEM-1 positions for binding each BLIP.
Results
Kinetic parameters of TEM-1 b-lactamase ala￾nine mutants
This study entails alanine scanning mutagenesis of
the TEM-1 b-lactamase residues that contact both
BLIP and BLIP-II according to the X-ray structures
of the complexes.10,16,17 As stated above, 12 residues
in TEM-1 contact both BLIP and BLIP-II, however,
one of these (A237) is an alanine naturally and was
not pursued further (Table I). As a first step, it was
necessary to examine the impact of the alanine sub￾stitutions on the catalytic activity of the enzyme to
ensure they retain structure and function. The b￾lactamase mutants Q99A, N100A, L102A, E104A,
E105A, P107A, E110A, K111A, M129A, V216A, and
M272A were constructed by site-directed mutagene￾sis as described in Materials and Methods. Each
mutant, as well as the wild type TEM-1 enzyme,
was expressed and purified to homogeneity for
enzyme kinetic analysis of nitrocefin hydrolysis. In
general, the enzymes containing alanine substitu￾tions exhibited kinetic parameters for nitrocefin
hydrolysis similar to those of wild type (Table II).
The L102A and P107A variants exhibited an 2-fold
reduction in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) and the
M272A variant displayed a 4-fold reduction in effi￾ciency because of a decrease in kcat but nevertheless
these mutants were still highly active with catalytic
efficiency values in the 4 to 9 3 106 M21 s21 range
(Table II).
Determination of association rate constants
Having evaluated the enzyme activity of the alanine
mutants, the next task was to determine the impact
of the substitutions on TEM-1 binding to BLIP and
BLIP-II. In order to gain information on what aspect
of binding was affected by the substitutions, the
association rate constant (kon) and the dissociation
rate constant (koff) were determined for wild type
TEM-1 and each mutant.
The association rate constants were determined
for all 11 TEM-1 alanine mutants with both BLIPs
by measuring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence
using a stopped flow apparatus (Materials and
Methods, Fig. 2). Overall, the association rate con￾stant was not affected greatly by substitution of any

rates for TEM-1 alanine mutants were within 5-fold
of each other for binding both BLIP and BLIP-II
(Table III and Fig. 3). The association rates for
TEM-1 binding BLIP were generally one order of
magnitude slower than those observed for TEM-1
with BLIP-II. Wild type TEM-1 associated with
BLIP at a rate of 1.1 3 105 M21 s21 while wild type
TEM-1 and BLIP-II associated at a rate of 1.9 3 106
M21 s21
. The M272A substitution enhanced the
association rate constant 2-fold for TEM-1 binding
BLIP while the L102A and E104A substitutions
increased speed of association for binding BLIP-II by
2- and 3-fold, respectively (Table III). Nevertheless,
taken together, the results indicate alanine substitu￾tions of the TEM-1 b-lactamase contact residues do
not greatly impact association rates.
Determination of dissociation rate constants
To measure the effects of the alanine substitutions
on the rate of dissociation of TEM-1 and BLIP-II as
well as the overall Kd of the interaction, an enzy￾matic recovery assay was used to measure the rate
of BLIP-II-b-lactamase complex dissociation.10,22
The dissociation rate experiments were performed
by forming a BLIP-II-b-lactamase complex and then
adding 400-fold excess of the inactive TEM-1 b-lacta￾mase mutant, E166A. This TEM variant exhibits
very low levels of b-lactam hydrolysis activity but
still binds to BLIP-II with similar affinity as wild
type TEM-1.10 These characteristics allow for the
hydrolysis activity of the wild type TEM-1 enzyme
to be monitored as an indication of the off-rate
because as BLIP-II dissociates from the active b￾lactamase it binds and is sequestered by the large
excess of inactive TEM E166A enzyme. This data
was fitted to the first order rate equation and the
dissociation rate constant was determined (Fig. 2).
However, this assay was not an effective way to
measure the BLIP-TEM-1 dissociation rate, which is
too fast to determine koff accurately. Instead, an
enzymatic inhibition assay was utilized to determine
the Ki of the interaction between BLIP and the
TEM-1 variants.21,23 The dissociation rate constant
was then calculated using the following equation:
koff 5 ðkonÞ Ki
The alanine substituted TEM-1 b-lactamases
showed dramatic changes in the dissociation rate
constants for both binding partners. The weaker
binding BLIP dissociates from wild type TEM-1 b￾lactamase 9-fold faster (2.5 3 1025 s21
) than does
BLIP-II (2.9 3 1026 s21
) (Table III). However, sev￾eral TEM-1 alanine variants displayed large
increases in dissociation rate for both BLIPs (Fig. 3).
Therefore, the individual TEM-1 amino acid residues
in the binding interface contribute largely to the
rate of dissociation of the complexes with both BLIP
and BLIP-II as was previously observed for BLIP-II
alanine scanning experiments.22 Alanine substitu￾tions in TEM-1 are surprisingly well tolerated in the
BLIP interface (Table III). The TEM-1 E104A and
M129A substitutions significantly increase the disso￾ciation rate while the Q99A, L102A, Y105A, P107A,
K111A, V216A, and M272A substitutions have only
a modest effect and the N100A and E110A substitu￾tions decrease the dissociation rate. In contrast, the
interface with BLIP-II is more sensitive to

1238 PROTEINSCIENCE.ORG Role of b-Lactamase Residues in a Common Interfacesubstitutions (Table III). The TEM-1 Q99A, N100A,
E110A, V216A, and M272A substitutions modestly
affect dissociation rates while the L102A, E104A,
Y105A, P107A, K111A, and M129A substitutions
result in large increases in dissociation rate and no
substitutions significantly decrease the dissociation
rate (Table III). These results suggest BLIP-II is
more highly optimized to bind to the TEM-1 surface
in that the majority of TEM-1 residues contribute to
the slow dissociation of BLIP-II. In contrast, BLIP is
less optimized to bind the TEM-1 surface in that
most TEM-1 positions can be converted to alanine
without increasing the dissociation rate and, in fact,
substitutions at several positions slow down dissoci￾ation. The increased optimization of BLIP-II versus
BLIP for binding the TEM-1 surface is consistent
with the fact that BLIP-II binds TEM-1 much
tighter and with fewer contact residues than does
BLIP.
Functional epitopes for BLIP and BLIP-II
Residues that result in >10-fold decrease in binding
affinity are considered in this study as hotspot resi￾dues belonging to the functional epitope.4,5 There￾fore, the functional epitope for TEM-1 binding to
BLIP consists of only two residues including E104
and M129 (Fig. 4). Because the TEM-1-BLIP-II bind￾ing interface is smaller than that of TEM-1-BLIP
and the interaction is 150-fold tighter, one might
expect the proportion of residues contributing
strongly to the TEM-1-BLIP-II interface to be corre￾spondingly larger. This was found to be the case in
that only 2/11 TEM-1 residues are hotspots for BLIP
binding while 5/11 are hotspots for binding BLIP-II
(Table IV and Fig. 4). This finding reflects the
increased dissociation rates of the TEM-1 mutants
for binding BLIP-II versus BLIP as discussed above.
A comparison of the impact of the alanine substitu￾tions for the two targets reveals M129A results in a
large decrease in binding affinity for both BLIP and
BLIP-II due to increased dissociation rates. In con￾trast, residue E104 contributes to binding affinity
for BLIP but not BLIP-II and residues L102, Y105,
P107 and K111 contribute to binding BLIP-II but
not BLIP. Finally, TEM-1 residues Q99, N100, E110,
V216, and M272A do not strongly contribute to bind￾ing either BLIP or BLIP-II. The general picture that
emerges from these results is that, although BLIP
and BLIP-II bind to the same region of TEM-1 b-lac￾tamase, they do so by utilizing remarkably different
binding energy contributions from the individual
TEM-1 residues.
Discussion
While the individual contributions of BLIP and
BLIP-II interface residues for binding to Class A
enzymes have been described, the functional signifi￾cance of the TEM-1 contact residues shared by these
two proteins remains largely unknown.5,8,22,24 The
alanine scanning approach taken here identified key
hotspot residues for the interaction of TEM-1 b-lac￾tamase with BLIP and BLIP-II. Extremely tight
binding interactions between BLIP-II and TEM-1
have been characterized by determining both the
individual association and dissociation rate con￾stants to derive the Kd. In general, the association
rate constants (kon) showed little variation for TEM￾1 alanine mutants, while the dissociation rate

results are consistent with previous BLIP and BLIP￾II mutagenesis studies indicating that dissociation
constants, which are highly dependent on short
range contacts, are most easily disrupted by alanine
substitutions.22,25 On the other hand, association
rates, which are strongly influenced by long-range
electrostatic attraction forces that depend on electro￾static complementarity, are less sensitive to disrup￾tion by single alanine substitutions.26,27
The BLIP-TEM-1 binding interface is large with
2636 A˚ 2 of surface buried upon complex formation.16
Despite the large binding interface, the majority of
the binding energy is contained in two patches of
BLIP hotspot residues (F36, H41, D49, Y53, K74,
W112, F142, H148, W150, R160, W162) which show
a bias towards large aromatic amino acids.5,8 The
hotspot residues in TEM-1 for binding BLIP are in
contact with BLIP hotspot residues. For example,
TEM-1 E104 forms a salt bridge with BLIP K74 that
is buried upon complex formation.16 In a previous
study it was found that the BLIP K74A substitution
results in a 92-fold decrease in binding affinity for
TEM-1 and therefore the TEM-1 E104 and BLIP
K74 hotspots match across the interface (Table IV).
Also, TEM-1 residue M129 contacts BLIP residue
F36 and the F36A substitution was previously
shown to result in a 68-fold loss in affinity for TEM￾1. In addition, several TEM-1 residues that are not
hotspots, including E110, K111, and V216, contact
BLIP residues that are not hotspots (Table IV). Sev￾eral exceptions exist, however, in that TEM-1 resi￾dues Q99, N100, L102, Y105, and P107 make
contacts with BLIP residues that are hotspots (Table
IV). In addition, the M129 TEM-1 hotspot residue
for BLIP also contacts BLIP residue Y50 and the
Y50A substitution increases binding affinity for
TEM-1.4 A possible explanation for these findings is
that the BLIP substitutions may result in changes
in the interface that alter positioning of other key
residues, such as those in contact with TEM-1 hot￾spots, thereby altering binding energy. Support for
the idea that amino acid substitutions of interface
residues could impact the positioning of other amino
acids beyond the site of mutation comes from the X￾Figure 3. Comparison of the DDG values of the TEM-1 ala￾nine variants for binding BLIP (black) and BLIP-II (red) for

changes are defined as the difference in energy between
wild-type TEM-1 and the alanine mutant (DDG 5 2RTln(Kd,wt/
Kd,mut)). The top control line is set at 1.35 kcal/mol and the

b-lactamase structure is shown in gray (PDB ID 1XPB). The
catalytic serine 70 residues is colored dark blue. A residue is
defined as a hotspot if the alanine substitution reduces bind￾ing by >10-fold (Table IV). TEM-1 positions Q99, N100, E110,
V216, and M272 are not hotpots for binding either BLIP or
BLIP-II and are colored white. TEM-1 residue E104 is a hot￾spot for binding BLIP but not BLIP-II and is colored light
blue. Positions L102, Y105, P107, and K111 are hotspots for
binding BLIP-II but not BLIP and are colored orange. TEM-1
residue M129 is a hotspot for binding both BLIP and BLIP-II
and is colored red.
1240 PROTEINSCIENCE.ORG Role of b-Lactamase Residues in a Common Interfaceray structures of complexes of BLIP and TEM-1
mutants. For example, Reichmann et al. showed that
a E104Y:Y105N double mutant of TEM-1 results in a
major structural rearrangement of the residue 46–51
loop of BLIP in the complex.20 In addition, the struc￾ture of the BLIP W150A mutant in complex with
TEM-1 revealed a 4 A˚ change in the position of BLIP
D49, which is 25 A˚ away from W150.25
A similar analysis of hotspots in the BLIP-II￾TEM-1 interface reveals good matching between the
TEM-1 hotspot residues and those residues in BLIP￾II previously determined to be hotpots for binding
TEM-122 (Table IV). For example, TEM-1 hotspot
residues L102, P107, K111, and M129 all make
direct contact with residues previously determined
to be hotspots in BLIP-II (Table IV). Among the
TEM-1 hotspot residues for binding BLIP-II, only
Y105 does not contact a hotspot residue in BLIP-II
and one of its contact residues in BLIP-II is G49,
which was not examined (Table IV). Similarly, the
majority of the contacts from BLIP-II hotspot resi￾dues are to TEM-1 hotspot residues, with exceptions
being contacts between BLIP-II hotspots and the
nonhotspot TEM-1 residues N100, E110, and V216
(Table IV).22
In general, alanine substitutions in TEM-1 b￾lactamase have less of an impact on binding affinity
for BLIP than BLIP-II (Table IV and Fig. 3). The
average increase in Ki(d) for TEM-1 alanine mutants
versus wild type is 12.1-fold for BLIP as compared
to 18.6-fold for BLIP-II. This reflects the fact that
only two of the eleven TEM-1 residues tested are
hotspots for BLIP binding. In addition, the low aver￾age increase in Ki for TEM-1 binding to BLIP is
influenced by residues N100 and E110, K111 and
V216 where the alanine substitution results in
tighter binding to BLIP (Table IV). The lower aver￾age increase in Kd for TEM-1 mutants binding BLIP
versus BLIP-II can be rationalized if one considers
that the TEM-1-BLIP interaction is over 150-fold
weaker than that for TEM-1-BLIP-II while also uti￾lizing more area in the binding interface compared
to TEM-1-BLIP-II, which predicts the per residue
contributions to binding affinity should be less for
TEM-1 binding BLIP versus BLIP-II.
The TEM-1 N100A, E110A, K111A, and V216A
substitutions are interesting in that they signifi￾cantly increase binding affinity for BLIP suggesting
the wild type TEM-1 residue at these positions is
detrimental for binding (Table III). The majority of

Fryszczyn et al. PROTEIN SCIENCE VOL 23:1235—1246 1241the improvement in binding affinity for each of these
substitutions is due to a decrease in the dissociation
rate (Table III). These findings suggest that removal
of these TEM-1 side chains by alanine substitutions
optimize short range contacts in the interface either
directly by removal of an unfavorable interaction or
by a cooperative effect on multiple interactions in
the interface. TEM-1 residue N100 is at the edge of
the interface of the complex and makes a main chain
hydrogen bond to the side chain of BLIP R160 and a
more distant side chain contact with BLIP W150
(Table IV). It is unclear why this alanine substitu￾tion reduces the dissociation rate. The mutant would
retain the main chain bond to BLIP R160 but lose
the interaction with W150. TEM-1 E110 is buried in
the interface and forms hydrogen bonds with the
hydroxyl groups of BLIP S71 and S113. The BLIP
S71A and S113A substitutions do not alter binding
affinity and so this region does not contribute to
affinity of the complex and removal of the E110 side
chain may facilitate new interactions in the inter￾face.4 Similarly, TEM-1 K111 forms a hydrogen bond
with BLIP S39 and the S39A substitution does not
affect binding affinity.4 Interestingly, TEM-1 V216
has its closest interaction with BLIP Y50 and previ￾ous results have shown that the BLIP Y50A substi￾tution increases binding affinity for TEM-1 by 50-
fold.4 Therefore, the creation of extra space in this
region allows for a tighter interaction between BLIP
and TEM-1.
Computational programs that can predict changes
in binding affinity upon mutation are a valuable asset
for advancement of protein engineering and drug
design. It was therefore of interest to compare the
results of computational alanine scanning of the
TEM-1 interface with BLIP and BLIP-II to the experi￾mental results presented here. Alanine mutations of
the TEM-1 residues tested in this study were per￾formed computationally using Robetta and BeAtMu￾SiC online servers.28,29 The DDG values generated by
the online servers and the experimental values are
listed in Table V and plotted in Figure 5. The average
of the standard deviations of the prediction values for
each position versus the experimental results for each
position for TEM-1 binding BLIP was 1.2 kcal mol21
for both programs. For the interface residues exam￾ined between TEM-1 and BLIP-II, the average of the
standard deviations was 0.7 kcal mol21 for Robetta

1242 PROTEINSCIENCE.ORG Role of b-Lactamase Residues in a Common Interfaceand 0.6 kcal mol21 for BeAtMuSiC. Overall, both pro￾grams were more successful at predicting free energy
changes upon mutation in the TEM-1/BLIP-II inter￾face than the TEM-1/BLIP interface. This could be
due to the fact that BLIP-II is a rigid protein while
mutations at the interface between BLIP and TEM-1
have been shown to cause significant movement in
the BLIP structure to accommodate these changes at
the interface as described above.10,20,25
The b-lactamase-BLIP system is an example of
a common surface on a protein (TEM-1) that inter￾acts with proteins of disparate structure (BLIP or
BLIP-II). There are many examples in biology of a
protein using a single surface to bind different tar￾get proteins including protein kinase A regulatory
domain, Ran GTPase, calmodulin, Fc receptor, and
BirA, among others.30–35 In the TEM-1 b-lactamase￾BLIP system studied here it was found that largely
different residues on TEM-1 serve as hotspots for
binding BLIP versus BLIP-II, that is, different bind￾ing strategies are used to bind disparate partners.
This is similar to the situation with BirA, which uses
a single surface to either homodimerize or to form a
heterodimer with the biotin carboxyl carrier protein
of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase.35 Amino acid sub￾stitutions in the BirA binding surface revealed some
overlap in residues required for both interactions but
hotspots specific for one but not the other were also
found.35,36 In addition, it has been shown by compari￾son of a database of homologous proteins binding to
heterogeneous partner proteins that promiscuous
binding, that is, the binding of a single protein sur￾face to multiple, unrelated partner proteins, is largely
achieved by alternate binding strategies for the dif￾ferent partners rather than convergent evolution to
use the same binding interactions for different part￾ners.37 The experiments reported here extend these
observations to the TEM-1 b-lactamase-BLIP system.
Class A b-lactamase enzymes are the most prev￾alent b-lactamases worldwide and are diverse in
sequence.15 Since the introduction of newer b-lactam
derivatives, class A enzymes capable of hydrolyzing
extended-spectrum cephalosporins, monobactams,
and carbapenems have evolved or emerged.38,39
There is a pressing need for new inhibitors and
improved detection methods for b-lactamases. Better
understanding of the forces driving the interaction
of b-lactamases and BLIPs can aid in design of bet￾ter diagnostic tools for detection of those enzymes.
Materials and Methods
Construction of alanine substitutions
The TEM-1 residues chosen for mutation were based
on the previously performed cluster analysis of the
BLIP–TEM-1 and BLIP-II-TEM-1 interfaces8,10
(Table I). The TEM-1 residues of the TEM-1 BLIP
interfaces were mutated to alanine by site-directed
mutagenesis using the Quikchange method (Strata￾gene) using the Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene)
and the pET-TEM-1 plasmid as template DNA.40
DpnI restriction enzyme was then added to the solu￾tion to remove the parental strands. The Quik￾change product was introduced into E. coli XL-1
Blue cells (Stratagene). DNA sequencing confirmed
the mutations and that no extraneous mutations
occurred in the TEM-1 gene (Lonestar Labs).
Protein purification
The TEM-1 wild type and alanine-substituted
enzymes were purified as previously described.40,41
BLIP and BLIP-II were purified using the TALON
Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech) using an N-terminal
His-tag on BLIP and a C-terminal his-tag on BLIP￾II as previously described.10,23 The protein concen￾trations were determined by a Bradford assay, and
compared with a b-lactamase standard curve cali￾brated by quantitative amino acid analysis.
b-Lactamase inhibition assay
The inhibition assay for evaluating the binding con￾stant of tight-binding inhibitors has been described
previously.21,23 Various concentrations of BLIP were
incubated with 0.2 nM of TEM-1 b-lactamase var￾iants for 1 h at room temperature in 50 mM phos￾phate buffer pH 7.0. The percentage of b-lactamase
bound by BLIP was determined by monitoring the
initial velocity of TEM-1-b-lactamase-mediated
nitrocefin (chromogenic cephalosporin analog) hydro￾lysis at room temperature (23C) in a spectropho￾tometer at OD485nm. Nitrocefin was used at a
concentration of 40 mM for the binding assays and
the experiments were repeated a minimum of two
times. The Ki
app values for BLIP inhibition of each
TEM-1 mutant were determined by fitting the initial
velocities to the Morrison tight-binding equation

spectrometric measurements of association rate
The association rate constants for binding of BLIP-II
and BLIP to TEM-1 b-lactamase were determined as
previously described using a Kintek stopped-flow
spectrofluorometer with binary injection mode to
monitor the tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence over a
time course.10 The proteins were dialyzed into
10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.0. Two injection
syringes containing equal protein concentrations of
10 mM for BLIP and TEM-1, and 5 mM for BLIP-II
and TEM-1, were engaged on the instrument and
used for mixing. The excitation and emission wave￾lengths were 286 and 340 nm with bandwidths of 2
and 8 nm, respectively. The data was collected at 10-
ms intervals with a 10-ms mixing dead time. Multi￾ple traces (>10) were collected at room temperature
(23C) and averaged together. The averaged trace of
the change in intrinsic fluorescence was fitted with
a second order kinetic time course [Eq. (3)] to deter￾mine the association constant using the program

Enzymatic determination of the dissociation
rate constants
The dissociation rate constants for BLIP-II and
TEM-1 were determined as previously described.10,22
The slow dissociation rate constants (koff) were
determined by measuring the recovery of the wild￾type b-lactamase activity by competitive displace￾ment with an inactive TEM-1 variant (E166A).10,22
The E166A mutation prevents the deacylation step
of the catalytic mechanism rendering the enzyme
inactive after one round of acylation and allows for
the mutant enzyme to remain in large excess but
still allows the measurement of the wild-type b-lac￾tamase activity. The TEM-1 E166 residue is not at
the binding interface with BLIP-II and the E166A
substitution does not affect binding to BLIP-II.10
TEM-1 was incubated in a 2-fold excess of BLIP-II
for one hour. The BLIP-II-b-lactamase complexes
were then diluted into a 400 molar excess TEM-1
E166A competitor solution. The final TEM-1 enzyme
concentrations were 5 nM for Q99A, N100A, E104A,
E105A, E110A, K111A, M129A, V216A, M272A, and
10 nM for mutants L102A and P107A (Table II). The
buffer used in these experiments was 50 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 7.0, supplemented with 1 mg/mL
BSA and reactions were performed at room tempera￾ture (23C). A 400 mM concentration of nitrocefin
was used for all dissociation kinetics experiments.
The experiments were repeated at least twice. The
amount of active b-lactamase over the time course
was fitted with first order kinetics to determine the
kinetic parameters [Eq. (5)],

t. is the amount of free b￾lactamase estimated by enzymatic activity at time
(t) and t is the time after mixing the BLIP-II-b￾lactamase complex with the inactive TEM-1 E166A
enzyme. C is the curve fitting constant representing
the background rate of nitrocefin hydrolysis (includ￾ing the activity of the TEM-1 E166A enzyme) and
koff is the dissociation rate constant extrapolated
from fitting the data. Because of the long time
course of the experiment, positive and negative con￾trols of the b-lactamase and inactive TEM-1 E166A
alone, respectively, were used to assess the stability
of the b-lactamases during the experiment. Due to
fast dissociation rates (koff) of BLIP from TEM-1,
this method was not suitable for their accurate
determination and they were calculated from the
inhibition constant (Ki) and the association rate con￾stant at ambient temperature (23C).
Computational prediction of the effect of TEM-1
mutations on binding affinity
Two programs were used to predict changes in bind￾ing affinity of the TEM-1 mutants on complex for￾mation with BLIP or BLIP-II. Computational
alanine scanning of TEM-1 interface residues was
performed using Robetta, an online structure predic￾tion and analysis server that makes use of protein–
protein docking methodologies.28 Robetta uses a sim￾ple free energy function to perform the alanine scan￾ning of the interface residues that the program
defines. Pro107 was not included in the alanine
scanning performed by Robetta because the
program-defined interface did not include this resi￾due. BeAtMuSiC was also used and this server relies
on a set of statistical potentials derived from known
protein structures and predicts the changes in

interface.29 PDB IDs 1JTG (BLIP and TEM-1) and
1JTD (BLIP-II and TEM-1) chains A and B were
submitted to the online servers for analysis.16,17
