Type I interferons bind to two cell surface receptors, ifnar1 and ifnar2, as the first
step in the activation of several signal transduction pathways that elicit an anti-viral
state and an anti-proliferative response. Here, we quantitatively mapped the
complete binding region of ifnar2 on IFNa2 by 35 individual mutations into Alanine
and isosteric residues. Out of the six "hot spot" residues identified (L30, R33, R144,
A145, M148 and R149), four are located on the E-helix, with is located at the center
of the binding site, flanked by residues on the A-helix and the AB-loop. The
contribution of residues of the D-helix, which have been previously implicated in
binding, proved to be marginal for the interaction with ifnar2-EC. Interestingly, the
ifnar2 binding site overlaps the largest continuous hydrophobic patch on IFNa2.
Thus, hydrophobic interactions seem to play a significant role stabilizing this
interaction, with the charged residues contributing towards the rapid association of the
complex. Relating the anti-viral and anti-proliferative activity of the various interferon
mutants with their affinity towards ifnar2 results in linear function over the whole
range of affinities investigated, suggesting that ifnar2 binding is the rate determining
step in cellular activation. Dose-time analysis of the anti-viral response revealed that
shortening the incubation time of low-level activation cannot be compensated by
higher IFN doses. Considering the strict dependence of the cellular response on
affinity, these results suggest that for maintaining transcription of IFN-responsive
genes over a longer time period, low, but continuous signaling through the IFN
receptor is essential.

INTRODUCTION
Type I interferons (IFNs) are a family of homologous cytokines which potently elicit
an anti-viral and anti-proliferative state in cells. All human type I IFNs (IFNa, b, w
and t) bind to a cell surface receptor consisting of two trans-membrane proteins,
ifnar1 (1) and ifnar2 (2), which associate upon binding. Binding of IFN to its receptor
mediates activation of numerous genes (3) through different signal transduction
pathways (reviewed by (4)). Intriguingly, different expression profiles are induced by
different IFNs, apparently through the same receptor, with particular differences
between IFNa and IFNb (3, 5). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
functional differences between IFNs is still unknown. Type I IFNs belong to the
class of helical cytokines (6) and are built by five helices. The structure of several
type I IFNs have been resolved, such as murine IFNb (7), human IFNa2 (8,9), human
IFNb (10) and ovine IFNt (11). Mutational studies have revealed functionally
important residues on IFNs (reviewed by (12), which can be ascribed to distinct
functional epitopes that interact with ifnar1 and ifnar2 (13, 14). The binding site for
ifnar2 was mainly mapped on the AB loop and D-helix, and the binding site for ifnar1
on the C-Helix. However, comparison with homologous cytokines suggests the
involvement of the E-helix in the binding of ifnar2 (8, 13, 15).
Understanding the basis of IFN signaling at the molecular level requires to
establish, in quantitative terms, the correlation between IFN cellular activity and its
structural, kinetic and thermodynamic binding parameters to its receptors. Having
established methods for expression, refolding and purification of the extra-cellular
domain of ifnar2 (ifnar2-EC) we have recently analyzed kinetics and thermodynamics
of the interaction between ifnar2-EC and IFNa2 by solid phase detection (16). We
mapped the binding interface of the IFNa2-ifnar2-EC by single Alanine mutations and
determined the precise energetic contribution of individual residues in the complex (16,
17). Only very minor contributions of residues on the D-helix were observed, and
only three residues on the AB-loop contributed more than 1.0 kcal/mol, suggesting
additional elements of IFNa2 are involved in binding ifnar2. In this study, we present
a complete, high-resolution map of the binding site of IFNa2 for ifnar2 in energetic
and kinetic terms. Based on a large set of single-residue IFNa2-mutants covering
several orders of magnitude in binding affinity, we have correlated the cellular activity
exerted by these IFNs with the structural, thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of
their interaction with ifnar2-EC.

EXPERIMENTAL
Materials. EDC and NHS were purchased from Fluka. Monoclonal anti￾ifnar2-EC 46.10 and 117.7, which bind non-competitively and do not inhibit IFN
binding, were a gift by Daniela Novick, The Weizmann Institute of Science. WISH
and Daudi cells were a gift by Daniela Novick, The Weizmann Institute of Science.
Protein expression and purification. IFNa2 and ifnar2-EC were expressed in E.
coli and purified by ion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography as described
earlier (16, 17). Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at
280 nm (16) with e280 = 18070 M-1 for IFNa2 and e280 = 26500 M-1 for ifnar2-EC.
Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and
concentrations were verified by quantitative evaluation of the protein bands compared
to wild-type standard. The concentration of active IFNa2 protein was determined for
all mutants by analytical gel filtration with ifnar2-EC as described earlier (16).
Site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR
amplification of the complete plasmids for expression (pT72Ca2) with 18-21
nucleotide primers containing the mutated codon using high fidelity polymerases pwo
(Boehringer Mannheim) and pfu (Stratagene) as described in detail before (18). After
phosphorylation and ligation, the mutated plasmids were transformed into TG1 cells.
The sequence of the whole expressed gene containing the mutation was verified by
DNA sequencing.
Measurements of kinetics and affinity. The interaction between recombinant
ifnar2-EC and IFNa2 was monitored by an optical probe called reflectometric
interference spectroscopy (RIfS) under flow-through conditions (19). This method
detects biomolecular interaction at interfaces as a change in the apparent optical
thickness of a thin silica layer. The coplete experimental set-up for this methodology
has been described in detail before (20, 21). Binding to the surface is monitored as a
shift in the interference spectrum. A shift of 1 pm corresponds to approximately
1 pg/mm2
 protein on the surface. All measurements were carried out using HBS
(20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.01% Triton X100) as a running buffer.
The non-neutralizing anti-ifnar2-EC mAb 46.10 was covalently coupled to the
carboxyl-functionalized dextran layer on the transducer surface by standard BIAcore
protocols. Ifnar2-EC (20 mg/ml, 800 nM) was captured by the immobilized antibody,
followed by cross-linking with a second mAb (117.7) at a concentration of 10 µg/ml
(65 nM). The binding curves were evaluated with the BIAevaluation software
(Biacore AB, Sweden) using simple one-to-one kinetics models. For the determination
of dissociation constants KD, the equilibrium response was plotted versus the
concentration and fitted by the law of mass action.

Anti-viral protection activity assay. Anti-viral activity of wild-type and mutant
IFNa2 was assayed as the inhibition of the cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis
virus (VSV) on human WISH cells (22). The relative activity of IFNa2-mutants was
determined as the concentration needed for 50% protection of the cells relative to the
concentration of wild-type IFNa2 needed for 50% protection. Dose-time experiments
were carried out by occluding free interferon after different incubation times. At time
zero, IFNa2 was added at concentrations between 1 and 250 pM to a culture of
human WISH cells. At different time points, a quantity of ifnar2-EC was added (1-5
µM), which was calculated to reduce the free IFN concentration in the sample to less
than 0.5 pM, which was bellow the threshold for cell protection in our assay. In all
cases, the culture was challenged with VSV 4 hr after the addition of IFNa2. After 18
hr of growth, the cells were stained with crystal violet to determine the proportion of
intact cells. 
Anti-proliferative assay. The anti-proliferative activity of IFNa2 on Daudi
cells was assayed as follows. Two-fold serial dilutions of IFNa2 (10-12 samples
altogether) were prepared in flat-bottomed 96 well plates, with final concentrations of
wild-type IFNa2 ranging from 0.04 to 82 pM. The concentration range for IFNa2-
mutants was adjusted according to the anticipated anti-proliferative activity for the
specific mutant as estimated from its affinity. 100 µL of human Daudi Burkitt's
lymphoma cells growing in RPMI 1620 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and
4 mM L-glutamine were added into each well and were grown for an additional 60 h
with IFN. The number of living cells was then determined using a cell staining kit
(Biological Industries Co, Israel) based on the colorimetric detection of the cleavage of
the tetrazolium salt XTT into formazan. The XTT reaction solution was added
according to manufacture’s recommendation for a period of 5 h, after which the
absorbance at 475 nm was recorded in an ELISA-reader. The relative anti-proliferative
activities of IFNa2-mutants were determined as the concentration needed for 50 %
inhibition of cell growth relative to the concentration of wild-type IFN needed for
50 % inhibition. 
RESULTS
Binding assays by label-free detection. The interaction of IFNa2 with ifnar2-
EC was characterized by a biosensor system based on reflectometric interference
spectroscopy (RIfS) using purified proteins for all measurements. In previously
published experiments, ifnar2-EC was covalently immobilized via its exposed amino
groups by amine coupling chemistry (17). From these studies, a dissociation constant
of about 10 nM was determined for the wild-type IFNa2-ifnar2-EC complex, with an
association rate constant of 2x106 M-1s
-1 and a dissociation rate constant of 0.02 s-1
.

Since we observed heterogeneous affinity of covalently coupled ifnar2-EC, we
investigated alternative methods for immobilization including biotinylated ifnar2-EC
and capturing with monoclonal antibodies (mAb). An efficient protocol was
developed based on affinity capturing and crosslinking with two different monoclonal
anti-ifnar2-EC antibodies (46.10 and 117.7) that bind ifnar2-EC non-competitively,
and do not interfere with interferon binding: ifnar2-EC was captured from the
solution by the surface bound mAb 46.10, followed by cross-linking with mAb 117.1,
which virtually abolished leak-out due to dissociation. This method of immobilization
provided a stable surface, which was readily regenerated by a short pulse of 50 mM
HCl. Thus, the immobilized mAb 46.10 could be repeatedly reloaded with fresh
ifnar2-EC. In addition to the simple regeneration of this surface, we observed a
significant improvement in the homogeneity of the ifnar2-EC binding sites compared
to measurements done using the standard amine coupling method. This proved to be
particularly advantageous for retrieving direct binding data for some of the weaker
binding IFNa2 mutants (e.g. R33A), which could not be measured using the standard
amine coupling method. A comparison of IFNa2 binding to ifnar2-EC immobilized to
the surface via both methods clearly shows that absolute rates of association and
dissociation differ (Fig. 1a), with the affinity of IFNa2 towards mAb-immobilized
ifnar2-EC being 2.5 fold higher than towards the amine-coupled receptor. The
difference in affinity is a result of a faster ka and a slower kd (Fig. 1a). However, the
relative changes of rate constants and affinities upon mutation of IFNa2 were in good
agreement, as demonstrated in Fig 1b. Thus, the changes in free energy of interaction
upon mutation (DDG0) determined from measurements on both surfaces were
consistent.
The time resolution in solid phase detection is typically limited within the
sub-second range due to the inertia of flow-through sample handling. With the
biosensor systems used in this study, dissociation rate constants of up to ~0.3 s-1
were properly resolved, which is about 30 fold faster than the rate measured for the
interaction of the wild-type proteins. The dissociation of several low-affinity IFNa2-
mutants was too fast to be directly determined. In these cases, the affinity was
determined from the concentration dependence of the equilibrium binding response on
the sensor surface. The binding affinities as calculated from the rate constants
corresponded well to those obtained from analysis of the equilibrium response (Fig.
1c). 
Mapping the binding site of IFN 2 for ifnar2. The AB-loop, and to a lesser
extent the D-helix, have been previously identified as being important for IFN activity
and ifnar2 binding (12). However, mapping these residues on the structure of IFNa2
(17), as well as homology considerations, raised the possibility that the binding

interface extends towards the E-helix. Here, most surface exposed residues of the E￾helix were individually mutated to Ala, and their contribution to binding was
determined. The mutations R144A, A145G, M148A and R149A each resulted in a
decrease in binding affinity of over 20 fold, corresponding to a loss of more than 2
kcal/mol of binding free energy (Table 1 - see also Fig. 4a) (the D146A mutant did not
refold and thus could not be measured). The mutations S152A and L153A reduced
binding by 6 and 13 fold, respectively, while mutation N156A had no significant
effect on binding (Table 1). Extending the search to the A-helix revealed that also L15
is involved in the interaction with ifnar2, while mutating M16 had no effect on
binding. On the D-helix, only K133 contributes more than 0.5 kcal/mol of binding free
energy. Although most of the residues on the AB-loop have been analyzed
previously (17), these results were confirmed here with ifnar2-EC immobilized via
mAbs. Furthermore, the KD of mutants with extremely low affinity were quantified
appropriately. On the AB-loop, residues L30 and R33 contribute 3.8 and 5.5
kcal/mol binding free energy (relative to Ala). L26, F27, K31, D32, and H34
contribute between 0.5-2 kcal/mol of binding free energy (Table 1), while residues
R22, R23, I24, S25, S28, D35 and Q40 do not contribute significantly to binding. For
most of the mutations, the change in binding affinity was dictated by a change in kd,
whereas ka was constant. The exceptions were R144A, where ka decreased 10 fold
while kd increased by 4 fold, and K133A where ka decreased by 5 fold while kd
increased by less then 2 fold. Thus, in these cases the mutations affect mostly ka
(Table 1). 
Mapping the change in binding free energy upon mutation on the structure of
IFNa2 gives a consistent picture of the binding site (Fig. 2a). six 'hot spot' residues
are located in the center of the binding site, each of them decreasing DDG0mut-wt by
more than 2 kcal/mol (L30, R33, R144, A145, M148 and R149, depicted in red). Nine
additional residues contribute between 0.5-2 kcal/mol (L15, L26, F27, K31, D32, H34,
K133, S152 and L153). Residues which contribute less then 0.5 kcal/mol of free
binding energy, and thus are probably not within the binding interface, surround the
residues mapped within the binding site. The binding site is composed by residues in
the A and E helices and the AB loop, with the 'hot spot' residues being located at the
center of the binding site (Fig. 2b). 
In the published NMR structure of IFNa2, the C-terminal is not involved in
any specific interaction with the rest of the protein, and seems to be flexible. To
assess the importance of the C-ter to interferon activity, a truncated IFNa2 protein
(missing the 5 last residues) was produced. Analytical gel-filtration in the absence and
presence of ifnar2-EC demonstrated that this protein folds correctly and retains ifnar2
binding activity (data not shown). Similar affinity and rate constants were found for
 at University of Michigan on March 7, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from 8
the truncated protein compared with the wild-type protein (Table 1). Thus, the C￾terminus of IFNa2 does not seem to participate in ifnar2 binding. Previous studies of
C-terminal truncated interferons have given mixed result, from retaining most of the
antiviral activity (23) to loosing most of it (for fragment 1-158 (24)).
Isosteric mutations of L30 and R33. A significant advantage of immobilizing
ifnar2-EC by affinity capturing is the low level of non-specific background, even at
very high IFNa2 concentrations. Consequently, we could directly determine the
binding affinities of the IFNa2 mutations L30A, L30V, R33A, R33K and R33Q, a
task not feasible with ifnar2-EC immobilized by amine-coupling. An Ala at position
30 reduced the binding affinity towards ifnar2-EC to 1.7 µM, while the R33A mutant
had an affinity of 28 µM. The cause for the large decrease in affinity of these two
mutations was further investigated by isosteric mutations. The binding affinity of
L30V is 260 nM (compared with 4 nM of the wild-type), thus most of the binding is
lost by shortening the branched side chain by a single methylene unit. For R33, the
regain of binding affinity upon introducing isosteric mutations was even smaller: an
affinity of 8 µM was determined for R33K, while R33Q caused a decrease in affinity
to 86 µM. The small difference in binding affinity between R33A and R33K is
surprising, as Lys was often found to replace Arg without much change in binding or
activity. Possibly, mutating R33 affects the structural integrity of the binding sites
Anti-viral activity vs. affinity of IFNa2 mutants. Binding of IFN to ifnar2 is the
very first step initiating a complex signal transduction cascade that activates the anti￾viral state in cells. The interferon concentration which gives 50 % protection of human
WISH cells challenged with VSV is a good measure for its biological activity. Here, the
concentrations giving rise to 50 % protection ( mut I
50 ) for the various IFNa2 mutants
were determined. The relative anti-viral activity pAV was obtained by normalizing to
the concentration measured for wild-type IFNa2 ( wt I
50 ), with pA V = I

Previously, a good correlation between the binding affinity and the anti-viral activity
was observed for a set of mutants located in the AB-loop and the D-helix (17). Here,
this correlation is extended to virtually a complete set of residues involved in the
interaction of IFNa2 with ifnar2-EC, covering 4 orders of magnitude of binding
affinities. To weigh binding affinities over this whole range equally, we correlated this
data on a logarithmic scale. An excellent linear correlation between the affinity of
IFNa2 towards ifnar2-EC and anti-viral activity was observed for all mutants (Fig.
3a). The slope of this curve is 0.72, which is probably due to the constant
contribution of ifnar1 towards formation of the active ternary complex. Notably, the
relation between affinity and activity is maintained also for R144A and K133A. In
these two cases, the affinity is mainly affected by a large reduction in ka (10 and 5
fold, respectively). Thus, anti-viral activity is related to the binding affinity,
 at University of Michigan on March 7, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from 9
independent on the relative contributions of ka and kd. Truncating IFNa2 at residue
S161 had no significant effect on the antiviral activity compared to the wild-type
protein, thus confirming that the four C-terminal residues are not essential for IFN
function.
Anti-proliferative activity vs. affinity of IFN 2 mutants. The level of the anti￾proliferative response of IFN on Daudi cells is a well-established marker that
determines the potency of IFNs. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the
antiproliferative response is mediated by different elements of the signal transduction
pathways than those mediating anti-viral activity (4). Anti-proliferative activity of
the various IFNa2 mutants was determined by measuring the relative number of living
cells 60 h after the addition of IFNa2, using a colorimetric assay (detecting the
cleavage of the tetrazolium salt XTT in to formazan). For exponentially growing
Daudi cells, ~0.3 pM wild-type IFNa2 incubated over 60 hr was required to inhibit
cell growth by 50% (Fig. 3b). Plotting the relative anti-proliferative potency of the
various IFNa2 mutants versus their relative binding affinity towards ifnar2-EC
yielded a linear correlation (Fig. 3c). The slope of the (logarithmic) affinity-activity
plot is 0.84.
A detailed graphic comparison of the relative contributions towards binding
and activity of the individual residues is presented in Fig. 4. On the AB-loop, only
two residues (L30 and R33) caused a significant decrease in all three parameters.
Except for K133, none of the residues located on the D-Helix are involved in binding
nor in biological activity. Many of the residues on the E-helix are important for
binding and activation of the biological response. Within the error of the assays, the
relative contribution to binding are in agreement with the changes in biological activity. 
Time-dose relationship for activating the anti-viral response. IFN-induced
association of ifnar1 and ifnar2 causes phosphorylation and activation of STAT's. It
has previously been observed that the initiation of the anti-viral state depends on the
continuous presence of interferon for at least 4 hr prior to viral infection (25). Here
we wanted to determine whether higher concentrations of interferon (which increases
the number of activated receptors) would shorten the time needed to activate the anti￾viral state. The availability of large amounts of purified ifnar2-EC enabled us to
elegantly block receptor stimulation by IFN after specific time periods. Complete
protection was achieved at an IFNa2 concentration of 16 pM after at least 4 hr
incubation in the presence of IFNa2, prior to its occlusion by ifnar2-EC (Fig. 5).
Occluding free IFNa2 from the medium after less than 4 hr did not result in the
activation of the anti-viral state. Adding interferon at much higher concentrations (up
to 250 pM) did not shorten the time of continuous interferon presence needed to
 at University of Michigan on March 7, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from 10
activate the anti-viral state (Fig. 5). This is despite the larger number of activated
receptor complexes per cell expected at higher IFNa2 concentrations. 
DISCUSSION
Structural and functional aspects of IFN signaling through its receptors ifnar1 and
ifnar2 are currently understood only on a basic level. IFN-induced association of the
receptors stimulates a variety of signaling transduction pathways by activating the
associated kinases Jak1 and Tyk2. However, the fact that different IFNs elicit
different response profiles through the same receptor requires detailed correlation of
structural and functional properties of IFNs. Here we present a virtually complete,
high-resolution picture of the ifnar2-binding epitope of IFNa2, obtained by extensive
mutational analysis using direct binding assays to evaluate affinity and kinetics of the
interaction between IFNa2 and ifnar2-EC. Based on a large set of IFNa2 mutants, we
investigated in detail the role of kinetics and affinity of the IFNa2-ifnar2-interaction
for IFN signaling and activity. By individually mutating many of the surface exposed
residues located on helices A, D and E, as well as on the AB loop into Ala, we
quantitatively mapped their energetic contributions. We located the ifnar2 binding site
on the first half of the AB loop (residues 26-34), residue 133 on the D-helix, the E￾helix (residues 144-153) and on a small part of the A-helix (L15). Two additional
residues which may affect binding, are R12A and E146A, but these mutants failed
either to express or fold. Mutating Glu 146 to Lys was previously shown to cause a
large reduction in biological activity, albeit this was explained as resulting from the role
of Glu 146 in stabilizing the AB loop (26). In the center of the ifnar2 binding site is
the E-helix, flanked by helix A and the AB-loop from both sides. The D-helix faces a
different surface of the protein than the suggested binding site, in agreement with its
marginal contribution to binding of ifnar2 (Fig 2b). Coloring all mutated residues
according to their contribution to binding (Fig. 2a) shows that the ifnar2 binding site
on IFNa2 is surrounded by inert residues (blue colored). Assuming that the interface
consists of a continuous surface patch, we conclude that most of the ifnar2 binding
site has been identified. The classical interface structure consists of 'hot-spot'-
residues (DDG0
 > 2 kcal/mol) located at the center of the binding site, surrounded by
residues which have a smaller impact on binding (27, 28). On IFNa2, A145 is located
at the center of a pocked, enclosed by R22, L26, F27, R33, R144, M148 and M149
(Fig. 2a). All of these residues, except for R22, were found to contribute significantly
to binding, including 5 of the 6 'hot spot' residues identified (except for L30).
Residues L15, A19, I24, S28, L30, K31, H34, D35, K133, S152 and L153 form the
next shell surrounding this core of the binding site. From this group of residues, only
L30 contributes more than 2 kcal/mol to binding, while L15, K31, H34, S152 and
 at University of Michigan on March 7, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from 11
L153 contribute between 0.5 - 2 kcal/mol of free energy of binding. Removing the five
terminal residues of IFNa2 (162-166) did not affect binding to ifnar2-EC, nor did it
have any effect on the magnitude of biological anti-viral or anti-proliferative activity.
As these residues are conserved in most human interferons (but are truncated in
IFNa7), their biological role in a whole organism needs further evaluation. 
About half of the 18 residues surrounding A145 are hydrophobic. The
hydrophobicity of the ifnar2 binding site relative to the IFNa2 protein surface was
calculated using the computer program QUILT, which calculates hydrophobic patches
on protein surfaces (29). The largest continuous hydrophobic patch on IFNa2
overlays with the ifnar2 binding site, as determined by mutagenesis (Fig. 6).
Strikingly, performing this calculation on a model of ifnar2 identified the IFNa2
binding site on ifnar2 also as the largest continuous hydrophobic patch on ifnar2 (Fig.
6). Although the IFNa2-ifnar2 binding interface is hydrophobic, electrostatic forces
have been shown to play a significant role in steering these two proteins to achieve
fast binding (16). The electrostatic potential on IFNa2 at the ifnar2 binding site is
clearly positive (Fig. 6). This positive potential stems from the many Arg and Lys
residues located both within and around the binding site (9 versus only 5 Asp+Glu).
Interestingly, performing a similar analysis on the IFNa2 binding site on ifnar2 shows
that, although this binding site exerts a strong negative electrostatic potential, most of
the negatively charged residues seem to be located either at the periphery or outside
the physically interacting surfaces (Fig. 6 and (17)). From the large complementary
hydrophobic binding surfaces between IFNa2 and ifnar2 it is speculated that
hydrophobic interactions are of major importance in stabilizing this complex, while
charged residues, many of which are located at the periphery of the binding site, are
important in steering this two proteins together (30, 31).
The sequence homology between different IFNa's is ~70, and 30% between
IFNa and IFNb. Comparison of functionally important residues on a sequence
alignment of different type I IFNs shows that some of the residues interacting with
ifnar2, are not fully conserved, including some of the 'hot spot' residues on the A and
E-helixes (Fig. 7): L15 is a Met in IFNa5 and a Cys in IFNb. A145 is a Met in
IFNw and a Val in IFNb. The dissociation constant KD of the A145M mutation (in
IFNa2) is 5 fold lower than A145G, yet 8 fold higher than Ala at this position (cf.
table 1). M148 is a Leu in IFNb, S152 is a Tyr and L153 is a Val. Interestingly, L153
is not fully conserved between different IFNa's either. Comparing the binding
epitopes for IFNa2 and IFNb on ifnar2 indicated that both proteins interact with a
similar set of residues, but with a very different relative contribution of binding
energies within the binding site (17, 32). This observation can be rationalized from
the partial conservation of active site residues on IFNa2 and IFNb. Two of the six

'hot spot' residues and six of the nine remaining residues which contribute to binding
are not conserved between these two interferons. In contrast to IFNb, all six 'hot
spot' residues on IFNa2, and eight out of the nine remaining active-site residues were
found to be conserved on 10 out of the 11 IFNa's aligned.
A structure-function analysis of the ifnar2 binding site on IFNb has identified
the A and E helixes as well as the AB loop as constituting the ifnar2 binding site (33).
A quantitative comparison between the results presented here and those of Runkel et
al. (33) is difficult: first, there are differences in the methods of measurements, second,
while we analyzed single mutations, Runkel et. al. (33) analyzed multiple mutations
only. However, some qualitative differences between IFNa2 and IFNb seem to
emerge. Whereas in IFNb residues K135 and E136 (homologous to K133 and K134 in
IFNa2) increase receptor binding affinity, they decrease anti-proliferative activity by
10 - fold. In IFNa2, the mutation K134A had no effect on binding, while K133A
reduced both ifnar2 binding affinity and biological activity to a similar degree. The
anti-viral and anti-proliferative activity of the multiple IFNb mutant: V147A, R151A,
Y154A, N157A (all located on the E-helix) is less than 10 fold smaller compared to
wild-type activity. Conversely, summing up the contributions of individual
mutations on homologous positions on IFNa2 (A145, R149 and S152) implies a
reduction of about 300-fold in activity, suggesting that the E-helix might be more
important for IFNa2 activity than for IFNb. Thus it appears that, although IFNa2
and IFNb bind ifnar2 on the same structural motives, the distribution of binding
energies within the binding site is different. Analogously, it has been shown that the
relative importance of residues on ifnar2 towards IFNa2 and IFNb differs
significantly (17, 32).
IFNa2 and IFNg share no obvious sequence or overall structural homology.
However, helix A, the AB-loop and the F-helix of IFNg (which constitute the receptor
I binding site) overlay onto helix A, the AB loop and the E-Helix of IFNa2 with an
RMS deviation of 2.3 Å for 59 residues (see Fig 8 and (8)). Interestingly, residues
that participate in the IFNg and IFNa2 receptor interactions are located at the same
positions on the two helices and on the AB loop (Fig. 8). This may suggest that ifngR
binds IFNg in a similar orientation as ifnar2 binds IFNa2. Despite the good structural
homology between the binding sites of these two IFNs, there is only little sequence
homology between the active site residues of these two proteins. Helix-D of IFNa2
does not overlay any IFNg helix using this structural alignment. 
The biological activity of interferon is exerted through binding ifnar1 and
ifnar2, the association of which causes the activation of multiple signal transduction
pathways. Having available a large set of IFNa2 mutants with distinct affinities and
rate constants of binding ifnar2, we were able to elucidate the role of IFN binding to

ifnar2 for anti-viral and anti-proliferative activity in quantitative terms. Thus, the first
event activating the signal transduction cascade was correlated with markers for the
final steps of two important, different signal transduction pathways induced by IFNs.
The linear correlation of both anti-viral and anti-proliferative activities with the
relative binding affinity observed for all mutants analyzed suggests that IFNa2
binding is a rate-limiting event in activating the biological response. This result clearly
establishes that the binding affinity of IFNa2 to its receptor does not surpass the
requirements for cellular activity, as found for human GH (34) and proposed for IFNb
(33). Further quantitative mechanistic interpretation of the affinity-activity
relationship requires a closer look at parameters determining anti-proliferative and
anti-viral activities: the assay for anti-proliferative activity is based on a continuous
inhibition of cell growth and therefore may be considerably distorted by experimental
variables such as cell growth rates, incubation times or sample volumes. Interpretation
of this data in absolute quantitative terms is therefore not appropriate. In contrast,
anti-viral activity is an unbiased parameter, because cells are either protected or lysed
by the virus attack. Therefore, further interpretations are based on this data. On a
double logarithmic scale, the linear correlation of IFN affinity with its anti-viral
activity yielded a slope 0.72 ±0.02. Since the logarithm of the affinity is a measure for
the free energy DG
0
 of binding, the relative anti-viral potency pAV can be described by
the function
where DGifnar2
0
 is the free energy of the ifnar2-EC-IFNa2 complex for the different
mutants. The correlation coefficient k in this equation is 1.34 mol/kcal, with pAV, 0
being ~3x10-7. What is the meaning of this constant offset? Since IFN binds to both
ifnar1 and ifnar2 on the cell surface, the binding affinity towards ifnar2 is enhanced by
cooperative binding of ifnar1. Thus, typically a 10 to 100-fold higher affinity constant
is observed for IFN binding to the cell surface receptor than for ifnar2 alone (35). The
constant offset in equation 1 most likely accounts for this constant energetic
contribution of ifnar1 to form the ternary complex, and the value pAV is in good
agreement with the relative contribution of ifnar1. This result impressively
corroborates that anti-viral activity is directly related to the number of occupied cell
surface receptors. We therefore looked into the dose-time relationships of the
activation of the cellular response. Picomolar concentrations of IFN are sufficient to
achieve sufficient activation for anti-viral protection. At a concentration of 4 pM
wild-type IFNa2 (~50% inhibition in the anti-viral assay), ~8 receptors per cell will
be occupied by IFN, assuming a KD of 400 pM for the ternary complex and a total of
500 receptors per cell typical for WISH-cells. Thus, the concentration required for
inducing anti-viral activity corresponds to only very few occupied receptors per cell

and higher doses should linearly increase the number of activated receptors. However,
occlusion of IFNa2 after different incubation periods indicated that activation is
necessary over at least 4 hr and cannot be compensated by higher doses over longer
time periods. This result is in good agreement with the observation that the half-life
of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 is short, and therefore continuous tyrosine
kinase activity of Jak1 and Tyk2 is required for prolonged transcription (25).
The quantitative, high-resolution description of the functional epitope of
IFNa2 for binding, and the strict correlation of binding affinity with both anti-viral
and anti-proliferative activity, are important steps forwards in understanding IFN
recognition by its receptor on a molecular level. We showed that the E-helix
constitutes the center of the ifnar2 binding site, in excellent analogy to several other
homologous cytokines. Binding affinity seems to be driven by hydrophobic forces,
while association is driven by electrostatic complementarity. Structural differences
between complexes of ifnar2 with different IFNs are probably minor, only the
distribution of binding energy on essentially the same set of residues is different.
How this translates into differences in activity has to be studied by structural tools.
Based on the linear relation between affinity and activity we were able to explain dose
and time dependencies within the signal transduction pathway.

Ifnar2-EC (1 - 5 µM final, depending of the concentration of IFNa2) was added at
different time points to occlude any free IFNa2 from the solution. The lane
marked ON is a control where no ifnar2-EC was added. Four hours after adding
IFNa2 the culture was challenged with VSV. The next day the culture was stained
with crystal violet to determine the proportion of living cells, from which the %
protection was calculated.

identified using the computer program QUILT, (29) is colored green. Dark green
is where the hydrophobic patch overlaps the binding site, light green is where the
hydrophobic patch does not overlaps the binding site, and yellow is where the
binding site does not overlap the hydrophobic patch. The binding site was
