The colicin DNase-specific immunity proteins interact
with the endonuclease domain of the bacterial toxin
colicin E9 with dissociation constants that span the mil￾limolar to femtomolar affinity range. Among the non￾cognate interactions Im2 shows the strongest binding
toward the E9 DNase domain with a Kd of 1028 M, 6
orders of magnitude weaker than that of the cognate
immunity protein Im9. Based on a NMR structure of Im9
that shows it to be a 4-helix protein, we have conducted
a mutagenic scan in which elements of Im9 secondary
structure were substituted into Im2 to precisely delin￾eate regions that define specificity. Eleven chimeras
were constructed, and their biological cross-reactivity
toward colicins E2 and E9 was evaluated. From this set
of mutants seven proteins were purified, and the Kd for
their interaction with the E9 DNase domain was meas￾ured by a combination of stopped-flow fluorescence and
subunit exchange kinetics. Our results show that immu￾nity specificity is dominated by residues on helix II,
accounting for 5 orders of magnitude binding specificity
relative to Im2, and that packing interactions of helix II
with its neighbor helix I and the loop connecting helix
III with helix IV play minor roles. The conformational
stability of these chimeric proteins was also determined.
Proteins displaying an Im9 phenotype were all more
stable than the parent Im2 protein, and surprisingly
some chimeras were significantly more stable than ei￾ther Im2 or Im9.
Understanding specificity in protein-protein recognition is
fundamental to our knowledge of complex biological processes
such as transcription, signal transduction, and immune recog￾nition, yet little is known about how specificity is determined in
protein-protein interactions. In this paper we describe the use
of homologue-scanning mutagenesis to determine the main
structural elements that define the specificity of the immunity
protein Im9 in its interaction with the DNase derived from the
bacterial toxin colicin E9 (ColE9).1
Colicins are plasmid-borne toxins produced by the Enter￾obacteriacae that have lethal action against other related
strains and are classified into groups on the basis of the cell
surface receptor to which they bind (reviewed by James et al.
(1)). The focus of our work has been the E group colicins, which
bind to the product of the chromosomal btuB gene, an essential
component of the high-affinity transport system for vitamin
B12 in Escherichia coli (2). Following receptor binding, the
toxin translocates into the cell and initiates cell death. Each E
colicin plasmid codes for the production of a ;61-kDa colicin
toxin, a 9.5-kDa inhibitor (immunity) protein that protects the
producing cell against the cytotoxic activity of the toxin, and a
small lipoprotein (the lysis protein) that releases the resulting
71-kDa heterodimeric colicin complex from the bacterium.
Colicin-producing cells are naturally resistant to the action
of their own toxin but sensitive to the action of other bacterio￾cins from the same family. This forms the basis for the so-called
immunity test by which cells producing different colicins can be
identified. Using this biological test the E group has been
subdivided into 9 types (ColE1–ColE9), and these fall into three
cytotoxic classes (3, 4); the periplasmic membrane-depolarizing
(or pore-forming) toxin ColE1 (5, 6), the RNases ColE3, ColE4,
ColE5, and ColE6 (7–9), and the DNases ColE2, ColE7, ColE8,
and ColE9 (9–13).
We have been studying the DNase colicins and their inter￾action with immunity proteins as a model system for investi￾gating specificity in protein-protein recognition. The four co￾licins are almost identical in sequence in the N-terminal
regions of the protein that are involved in translocation and
receptor binding, but share only ;80% sequence identity in the
C-terminal DNase domains. Hence, the specific immunity pro￾teins Im2, Im7, Im8, and Im9 have evolved to counteract the
toxicity of each DNase colicin, and these share ;50% sequence
identity (9). Im9 binds to either ColE9 or the isolated 15-kDa
E9 DNase domain with a dissociation constant of 10216 M in the
absence of salt (pH 7.0 and 25 °C) rising to 10214 M in 200 mM
salt (14). Association between the two proteins is diffusion
controlled, wherein the proteins are electrostatically steered
toward one another to produce an encounter complex, which
then undergoes a conformational change to produce the final
stable complex (14). The other immunity proteins of this family
can also bind the E9 DNase, but with much weaker affinities;
the equilibrium Kd values for these complexes are 1024 M for
Im7, 1026 M for Im8, and 1028 M for Im2. In each case, binding
results in inhibition of enzymatic activity, and the binding
affinity is governed by the rate of complex dissociation (15).

This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org 22253
 at University of Saskatchewan on March 17, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Our knowledge of the regions of an immunity protein that
determine its specificity is limited to the results of homologous
recombination experiments between Im9 and Im8 (16). This
early work focused on the biological activity of chimeric immu￾nity proteins and showed that the primary determinants for
specificity were located in the N-terminal half of the protein.
Moreover, substituting Val-34 in Im9 with aspartic acid, the
amino acid at this position in Im8 provided the resulting mu￾tant Im9 with some ColE8 cross-reactivity in in vivo assays.
Subsequent structural work has shown that Im9 is a 4-helix
protein in which position 34 is part of helix II (17, 18) (Figs. 1
and 2). Chak et al. (19) have recently proposed, based on the
crystal structure of the Im7 protein, that helices I and II are
both involved in determining specificity as well as loop 2 and
possibly loop 1 (Fig. 1). In large part their model is based on the
observation that these are the most variable sequences in the
immunity protein family (Fig. 2). However, this is at variance
with recent isotope-edited NMR experiments in which the am￾ide resonances of 15N-labeled Im9 bound to unlabeled E9
DNase (forming a 25-kDa complex) were assigned. These data
show that the major regions of perturbation on binding the
DNase are helices II and III, the latter being conserved in the
immunity protein family (20).
The present work set out to use homologue-scanning mu￾tagenesis to identify unambiguously the elements of immunity
protein secondary structure that determine colicin specificity.
With Im2 as our template, we have substituted structural
elements from Im9 into Im2 and characterized the resulting
chimeras using both in vivo biological toxicity tests and in vitro
binding assays. We find that specificity in this system is mul￾tifactorial but dominated by residues from a single helix.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strain and Plasmids—E. coli strain JM83 Hsd R, a colicin￾sensitive restriction-deficient derivative of E. coli JM83 (Ara1, Lac1,
Pro, thi, rpsL, f80DLac ZM15), was used as the host strain. The ex￾pression vector pTrc99a was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.;
pRJ345 and pCD01 were the resulting derivatives of this vector con￾taining the imm9 and imm2 genes encoding Im9 and Im2, respectively.
Both constructs were used as templates for the mutagenic scan reported
in this study.
Homologue-scanning Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was carried out by
modifying the megaprimer method of Sarkar and Sommers (21). Prim￾ers were synthesized at each junction site between imm2 and imm9.
They were designed so that the 39 half of the primer can anneal to one
imm gene template (e.g. imm2), while the 59 half is the upstream
sequence of the other immunity gene. Thus, in the first polymerase
chain reaction using imm2 as template, the resulting product will have
an imm9 sequence overhang. This product is then used as a “mega”
primer for a second polymerase chain reaction, although the sequence
that actually primes this reaction is only around 20–30 nucleotides in
length. The second polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into
pTrc99a and transformed into E. coli JM83. Transformants were
screened by streaking out on Luria-Bertani (LB) plates with 100 mg/ml
ColE2 or ColE9. The surviving clones were checked by SDS-polyacryl￾amide gel electrophoresis after IPTG induction and double-stranded
DNA sequencing using an ALF sequencer (Pharmacia).
Biological Plate Assay—The biological activity of each chimeric im￾munity protein toward ColE2 and ColE9 was tested using a modified
procedure of a plate assay described previously (15). 22 3 22-cm LB
agar plates containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin were divided into lanes and
each lane overlaid with a lawn of exponentially growing E. coli JM83
cells producing a different immunity protein. Two parallel plates were
used, one induced with IPTG (1 mM) and the other without. Aliquots (2
ml) of 5-fold serially diluted ColE2 and ColE9 from 3 mg/ml to 1.5 ng/ml
were spotted on top of the cells. The plates were incubated overnight at
37 °C and scored the following day for biological protection against the
toxin.
Protein Purification and Protein Determinations—JM83 cells that
had been transformed with wild type and mutant immunity genes
cloned into pTrc99A were grown in LB broth containing ampicillin (100
mg/ml) and were induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogal￾actoside at an optical density at 550 nm between 0.6–0.8. The immu￾nity protein was purified as described previously for Im9 (22). The E9
DNase was purified according to the protocol described by Garinot￾Schneider et al. (23). Protein concentrations were determined using the
molar absorption coefficients of 17,550 M21 cm21 for the E9 DNase and
11,400 M21 cm21 for Im9, Im2, and the chimeric immunity proteins (14).
Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—The masses of all of the purified
proteins were verified by mass spectrometry using a VG platform elec￾trospray mass spectrometer. The lyophilized proteins were dissolved in
high pressure liquid chromatography grade water, and the concentra￾tions were adjusted to about 0.1 mg/ml. Formic acid was added to a final
concentration of 1% just before the injection into a mobile phase of
water:acetonitrile:formic acid (1:1:0.001) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The
scan range was from 700 to 1700 m/z, and 10 transients were collected
and averaged for each sample with the raw data processed using the
accompanying MassLynx software. Horse heart myoglobin (Sigma) was
used as a calibrant. Each protein was analyzed at least twice.
E9 DNase Immunity Protein Dissociation Constants—Dissociation
constants were obtained from the ratio of the individual dissociation
(koff) and association (k1) rate constants at 25 °C in 50 mM Mops buffer,
pH 7.0, containing 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol, as described
previously by Wallis et al. (14, 15) and Osborne et al. (20). Association
of the proteins was monitored by stopped-flow fluorescence under pseu￾do-first-order conditions using a 4–20-fold excess of immunity protein
over E9 DNase (0.35 mM). The resulting biphasic fluorescence traces
were fitted to a double exponential equation, and the bimolecular rate
constant was obtained from linear replots of the rate of initial fluores￾cence enhancement versus the immunity protein concentration. Disso￾ciation kinetics for E9 DNase-Im2 complexes were obtained either from
radioactive subunit exchange (in which complexes were chased with
3
H-Im9) for slow dissociation rate constants (,1023 s21
) or from fluo￾rescence chase stopped-flow (in which complexes were chased with a
6-fold excess of Im9) for fast dissociation rate constants (.1023 s21
).
Differences in binding energy between Im2 mutants and wild type
Im2 binding to the E9 DNase were determined according to Equation 1,
DDGbinding 5 RT ln~Kd mutant/Kd wild type! (Eq. 1)
where R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.
Immunity Protein Stability—Immunity protein stabilities were de￾termined by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denaturation where
protein denaturation was monitored by the change in tryptophan fluo￾rescence. All of the experiments were carried out on a Shimadzu
RF5000 spectrofluorimeter at 25 °C using an excitation wavelength of
295 nm. The excitation and emission bandwidths were both 5 nm. Each
immunity protein (2 mM) was equilibrated at 25 °C in 50 mM potassium
phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing GdnHCl (0–3 M) for a minimum of
2 h, and the fluorescence emission was measured at 354 nm. The
relative stabilities of the immunity proteins were compared by the
concentrations of GdnHCl required to cause 50% protein denaturation
([GdnHCl]50%).

22254 Protein-Protein Interaction Specificity of Im9
 at University of Saskatchewan on March 17, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from RESULTS
Biological Specificity—Eleven chimeric immunity proteins
were constructed and cloned into the expression vector
pTrc99a, transformed into E. coli JM83, and their biological
specificity toward colicins scored using an agar plate assay (see
“Materials and Methods”). We have previously shown (15) that
in the absence of IPTG, JM83 cells containing this expression
vector and a non-cognate immunity gene cloned into it are
completely sensitive toward the action of ColE9, whereas the
same construct containing the imm9 gene is resistant toward
the action of the toxin. Although SDS-polyacrylamide gel elec￾trophoresis indicates the absence of any significant amounts of
expressed protein under these conditions, the complete protec￾tion of cells containing the pTrc99A1imm9 construct is most
likely due to “leaky” expression (15). On addition of IPTG,
.25% cell protein is immunity protein, and now both the Im8
and Im2 containing cells begin to show non-cognate biological
cross-reactivity with the latter being the strongest.
The sensitivity of JM83 cells (with and without IPTG induc￾tion) containing each of the eleven chimeric immunity proteins
generated in this study were tested against serial dilutions of
both ColE9 and ColE2. The results for five of these constructs
are shown in Fig. 3 along with the data for cells expressing wild
type Im2 and Im9. As in our previously published work, both
Im2 and Im9 are completely resistant to the action of their
cognate colicin with or without induction by IPTG (i.e. no zones
of clearance). However, whereas IPTG-induced Im2 provides E.
coli cells with partial protection toward ColE9, IPTG-induced
Im9 shows no such cross-reactivity toward ColE2 (Fig. 3).
When helix II of Im9 is inserted into Im2 (Im2-(30–44)Im9) the
resulting chimera behaves very much like Im9 in that it pro￾vides complete protection toward ColE9 6 IPTG and is sensi￾tive toward ColE2 in the absence of induction. It differs from
Im9, however, since on induction with IPTG it still retains
some residual ColE2 cross-reactivity. By contrast, when the N
terminus of Im9 was inserted into Im2 (Im2-(1–29)Im9) the
resulting chimera behaved exactly like Im2 toward both co￾licins with or without induction suggesting that helix I is not
directly involved in specificity. A further chimeric protein in
which the N-terminal half of Im9 was fused to the C-terminal
half of Im2 (Im2-(1–44)Im9) showed exactly the same biological
phenotype as Im2-(30–44)Im9. This latter result is in agree￾ment with our previous homologous recombination experi￾ments between Im9 and Im8, which showed that residues in
the N terminus of the protein were the most likely determi￾nants of biological specificity (16). The present data show for
the first time that of the two helices in the N-terminal half of
the protein, helix II is responsible for these differences in
specificity.
An intriguing property of both the Im2-(30–44)Im9 and Im2-
(1–44)Im9 chimeras is that they retain some residual cross￾reactivity toward ColE2 even though Im9 itself does not show
this behavior (Fig. 3). The region of the protein responsible for
this cross-reactivity was identified by introducing further
structural elements of Im9 into Im2-(1–44)Im9. It was not until
the loop connecting helix III and helix IV was introduced (Im2-
(1–64)Im9) that this residual cross-reactivity was finally lost,
and the protein behaved like Im9 6 IPTG (Fig. 3). Interest￾ingly, the same phenotype could be obtained by combining the
helix II and loop 2 substitutions (Im2-(30–44, 56–64)Im9) but
not helix I and loop 2 (Im2-(1–29, 56–64)Im9) or loop 2 on its
own (Im2-(56–64)Im9) both of which behave essentially like
Im2. A summary of the biological phenotypes of the bacterial
cells expressing the chimeric constructs is given in Table I.
E9 DNase Binding—Although a total of eleven chimeric im￾munity proteins were constructed (Table I) and induced by
IPTG to approximately similar levels as deduced from SDS￾polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown), only those
which showed representative changes in biological specificity
were characterized further. Seven chimeras were purified and
their masses confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. In
each case the observed mass of the protein corresponded to the
predicted mass 6 1 Da (data not shown).
The Kd for each purified chimeric immunity protein binding
the E9 DNase was obtained from the ratio of the individual
dissociation and association rate constants, koff and k1,
respectively, as summarized under “Materials and Methods”
(14, 15). Association kinetics were monitored by stopped-flow
fluorescence, and dissociation kinetics were monitored by sub￾unit exchange methods. The association of Im2 and Im9 with
the E9 DNase is biphasic in stopped-flow fluorescence experi￾ments in which a fluorescence enhancement representing the
bimolecular collision is followed by a fluorescence quench that
is thought to emanate from a conformational change in the
complex (14). The rate constants for both of these processes (in
Mops buffer at pH 7.0, 25 °C and containing 200 mM NaCl) are
very similar for both Im2 and Im9 where k1 ; 6–9 3 107 M21
s21
, and the conformational change is ;4–5 s21 (15). Very
similar values were obtained for each of the seven Im2/Im9
chimeric immunity proteins (data not shown) indicating that
the association kinetics of these proteins do not play a signifi￾cant role in determining the stability of the resulting complexes
with the E9 DNase. However, the complexes differed quite
significantly in the rate of complex dissociation; some behaved
like Im2 (for example, Im2-(1–29)Im9), which has a koff of ;1
s21
, whereas others displayed off rates similar to that of wild
type Im9 (for example, Im2-(19–44)Im9), which has a koff of
;1026 s21
. The equilibrium dissociation constants for each of
the seven purified chimeric immunity proteins are shown in
Table I along with data for wild type Im2 and Im9. Also shown
in Table I are values for DDG, which have been calculated
relative to Im2 binding the E9 DNase. Hence the DDG for Im9
is 28 kcal/mol, reflecting the difference in specificity between
these two proteins for the E9 DNase.
The thermodynamic data in Table I show clearly that helix I
makes no contribution toward E9 DNase binding specificity
(DDG 5 0), and this matches the biological phenotype of the
cells expressing the Im2-(1–29)Im9 mutant. In contrast, helix II
contributes ;6 kcal/mol toward E9 DNase binding specificity,
and this corresponds to a complete switch in the biological
FIG. 2. Sequence alignment of Im9, Im2, Im7, and Im8 overlaid with the secondary structure arrangement of Im9. The consensus
sequences among the four immunity proteins are shown at the bottom with bold letters. *, indicates a conservative substitution. The identical
residues between Im9 and Im2 are boxed.

terminus of Im9 are included in Im2 (Im2-(30–64)Im9) binding
is reduced a little, and at the same time the residual cross￾reactivity toward ColE2 is lost. Conversely, as helix II is com￾bined with sequences toward the N terminus, including loop 1
and part of helix I, binding affinity increases and even seems to
surpass that of the cognate immunity protein Im9. Neverthe￾less, the residual biological cross-reactivity toward ColE2 is
retained in these chimeras.

A serial dilution, going from left to right, of 3 mg/ml to 1.6 ng/ml of either ColE2 (top of each lane) or ColE9 (bottom of each lane) was dropped onto
each lawn of cells. The uppermost lane is the vector control and shows the cells to be sensitive to the action of both toxins. The absence of zones
of killing indicates biological cross-reactivity toward the toxin by the expressed immunity protein.

22256 Protein-Protein Interaction Specificity of Im9
 at University of Saskatchewan on March 17, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from thermodynamic stabilities of immunity proteins, and since the
homologue scan involved moving whole elements of secondary
structure between immunity proteins, it was of interest to
compare the thermodynamic stabilities of Im2 and Im9 with
the chimeras. Guanidine hydrochloride was used as a denatur￾ing agent, and denaturation was monitored by tryptophan flu￾orescence spectroscopy. The endonuclease-specific immunity
proteins possess a single conserved tryptophan at position 74,
and the wavelength of maximum emission for Im2 and Im9 is
the same (334 nm), increasing to 354 nm on denaturation. In
the folded immunity proteins the emission from Trp-74 is
quenched, and when unfolded the fluorescence increases 5-fold.
This was used to construct denaturation curves (as described
under “Materials and Methods”) and plotted as the fraction of
unfolded protein versus GdnHCl concentration. The denatur￾ation curves for Im2 and Im9 along with some of the chimeras
are shown in Fig. 4. Both immunity proteins and all of the
chimeras exhibited single cooperative unfolding transitions in￾dicating the absence of any unfolding intermediates. The mid￾points of denaturation for all of the purified chimeric and wild
type immunity proteins are listed in Table I. The data in Fig. 4
and Table I show that Im9 ([GdnHCl]50% 5 1.71 M) is margin￾ally more stable than Im2 ([GdnHCl]50% 5 1.52 M) but also
show quite dramatic differences between some of the chimeras
and these two immunity proteins. The only chimeric protein
that did not show an increase in E9 DNase binding affinity was
Im2-(1–29)Im9, and this was also less stable than Im2. The
other chimeric Im2 proteins that displayed Im9 phenotypes
were all more stable than Im2. In many cases, the chimeric
immunity proteins were significantly more stable than Im9 as
well; for example, Im2-(19–44)Im9 ([GdnHCl]50% 5 1.81 M). The
increasing stability of the mutant proteins suggests that the
Im9 sequences, which have been grafted into the Im2 frame￾work, have been accommodated better than the corresponding
Im2 sequences. It is also worth noting that residues 45–64 from
Im9 have a stabilizing effect, which becomes apparent from
comparing the midpoints of denaturation for Im2-(30–64)Im9 to
Im2-(30–44)Im9 and Im2-(1–64)Im9 to Im2-(1–44)Im9 (Table I).
DISCUSSION
The specificity of E group colicin immunity proteins for their
target endonuclease toxins has yet to be explained, and so we
chose to use homologue-scanning mutagenesis combined with
biological and in vitro binding assays to determine the regions
of the protein that govern its specificity. Homologue scanning
was first used by Wells and co-workers (24) to identify the
regions of human growth hormone that are required for specific
binding to its receptor. Since then it has been used in a number
of systems to localize functionally important regions in families
of homologous proteins (25, 26). The basic premise of the tech￾nique is the substitution of sections of sequence from one pro￾tein with analogous sections from a related protein and then
testing the resulting chimeras by a functional assay that dis￾criminates between the two wild type starting proteins. Clearly
for the strategy to succeed the two proteins must be sufficiently
similar in three-dimensional structure to allow accommodation
of the novel sequences and so yield chimeras that are stable
and can be purified and characterized.
In the present work, we have used this technique to localize
the elements of secondary structures of the immunity proteins
Im2 and Im9, which define their colicin specificity. The solution
structure for Im9 has been determined by NMR (18) and this
structure was used as the basis for the scan (Fig. 1). Im2 and
Im9 are identical in length (86 amino acids) and share 68.6%
sequence identity (Fig. 2) and so it is likely that the structure
of Im2 will be similar to that of Im9. Indeed, the structures for
the other endonuclease specific immunity proteins Im7 and
Im8, which show even less sequence identity to Im9 than Im2,
have very similar 4-helix structures (19).2 A further point,
which suggests that the Im2 and Im9 structures will be com￾parable, stems from the results of this work since a total of
eleven chimeras were generated, and in each case a stable
protein was made suggesting that there was no gross distortion
of the protein fold.
Helix II, Loop 2, and Packing Interactions—Our data show
that of the four helices in an immunity protein, helix II is the
major determinant of colicin specificity that in the context of
the binding of Im2 relative to Im9 contributes over 6 kcal/mol
E9 DNase binding energy from a total of 8 kcal/mol. However,
other sequences have to be added for full E9 DNase binding
(Table I). The most important of these appears to be the C￾terminal end of helix I (compare the binding energy data for
Im2-(25–44)Im9 with Im2-(19–44)Im9). Interestingly, these se￾quences in isolation (in the form of the Im2-(1–29)Im9 construct)
do not affect E9 DNase binding. In other words, the effect of
helix I is not additive to that of helix II but is felt only in the
presence of helix II. We conclude from these observations that
it is the buried residues of helix I that elicit this effect, probably
by changing the orientation of helix II. Since helix I and II pack
against each other in the Im9 structure, and since both helices
are largely variable in sequence between immunity proteins, it
seems reasonable that packing interactions between them may
play a role in specificity. Tight binding protein complexes are
characterized by highly complementary and well packed bind￾ing interfaces (27), and so it is quite conceivable that such
intramolecular packing interactions could affect intermolecu￾lar specificity. It is also noteworthy that packing interactions
between these two helices affect the stability of the protein;
adding residues 19–30 from Im9 to the Im2-(30–44)Im9 mutant
increases [GdnHCl]50% by .0.2 M (Table I).
Although neither of the variable loops play important roles
in specificity, the results for chimeras containing loop 2 do
show some relatively minor effects that require comment. Co￾incident with the loss of residual ColE2 cross-reactivity of
Im9-like chimeras, the inclusion of loop 2 from Im9 also seems
to reduce E9 DNase binding in these proteins (Table I). This

Protein-Protein Interaction Specificity of Im9 22257
 at University of Saskatchewan on March 17, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from affect can be seen in two cases. First, it is seen in chimeras that
seem to bind slightly more tightly to the E9 DNase than Im9
itself (Im2-(19–44)Im9 and Im2-(1–44)Im9). This affinity is re￾duced to wild type Im9 levels when loop 2 from Im9 is added
(Im2-(1–64)Im9). Second, this region also reduces the binding of
the mutant protein that contains helix II alone (compare Im2-
(30–44)Im9 with Im2-(30–64)Im9). Taken together these results
suggest a rather paradoxical situation in which loop 2 in Im2
imparts some specificity for its cognate E2 DNase (hence the
residual biological cross-reactivity) as well as providing some
binding energy for the non-cognate E9 DNase. Substituting
this loop in Im2 with that from Im9 removes both effects. Loop
2 also seems to affect the thermodynamic stability of the im￾munity proteins since the [GdnHCl]50% of chimeras containing
this loop is increased by 0.2–0.3 M (see “Results” and Table I).
The observations on specificity concerning loop 2 could be the
result of direct effects where loop 2 is involved in DNase bind￾ing or indirect effects where loop 2 alters the conformation of
binding residues. Two pieces of evidence suggest that the latter
is the most likely. First, few amide resonances from this loop in
Im9 are perturbed on binding the E9 DNase in 15N edited NMR
experiments (20). Second, the solution structure of Im8 shows
that the conformation of Tyr-55, a conserved residue in helix
III, is markedly different from that of Im9, and the reason for
this seems to be the nature of the adjoining residues in loop 2.2
The importance of this observation stems from the fact that
recent mutagenesis data have shown this residue to be critical
for DNase binding.3
In conclusion, the specificity of an immunity protein for an E
colicin DNase domain is complex. Although dominated by res￾idues from a single helix, interactions with other parts of the
immunity protein scaffold also play an indirect role. Protein￾protein interactions are characterized by relatively large sur￾face areas of each binding partner (typically .600 Å2
) becom￾ing buried in the complex (27, 28), and given the very tight
binding for the E9 DNase-Im9 complex this is likely to be true
for a colicin complex. Since it is clear that other parts of Im9 are
also involved in binding the DNase (20), it is interesting that
specificity can be controlled almost exclusively by residues
from a single helix, a situation reminiscent of some DNA￾protein interactions (29).
