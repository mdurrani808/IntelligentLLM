Human Tsg101 plays key roles in HIV budding and in
cellular vacuolar protein sorting (VPS). In performing
these functions, Tsg101 binds both ubiquitin (Ub) and
the PTAP tetrapeptide `late domain' motif located
within the viral Gag protein. These interactions
are mediated by the N-terminal domain of Tsg101,
which belongs to the catalytically inactive ubiquitin
E2 variant (UEV) family. We now report the struc￾ture of Tsg101 UEV and chemical shift mapping
of the Ub and PTAP binding sites. Tsg101 UEV
resembles canonical E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes,
but has an additional N-terminal helix, an extended
b-hairpin that links strands 1 and 2, and lacks the two
C-terminal helices normally found in E2 enzymes.
PTAP-containing peptides bind in a hydrophobic cleft
exposed by the absence of the C-terminal helices,
whereas ubiquitin binds in a novel site surrounding
the b-hairpin. These studies provide a structural
framework for understanding how Tsg101 mediates
the protein±protein interactions required for HIV
budding and VPS.

Introduction
Human Tsg101 has recently been identi®ed as the
functional receptor required for budding of the enveloped
human immunode®ciency (HIV) and Ebola viruses
(Garrus et al., 2001; Martin-Serrano et al., 2001;
VerPlank et al., 2001; Demirov et al., 2002). Tsg101 is
recruited to the sites of virus budding by binding to a
P(S/T)AP tetrapeptide motif (the `late domain') located
within the p6 region of HIV Gag and the Ebola Vp40
matrix structural proteins. Once there, Tsg101 appears to
recruit other cellular factors that help to complete the
budding process (Garrus et al., 2001; Martin-Serrano et al.,
2001). In the absence of Tsg101, the ®nal membrane
®ssion step(s) fails and HIV release is arrested at a very
late stage, in which the assembled viral particles remain
attached to the plasma membrane (and to one another) via
thin membrane stalks (Garrus et al., 2001).
The direct interaction between Tsg101 and the PTAP
late domain motifs on the viral structural proteins is
mediated by the N-terminal ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV)
domain of Tsg101 (Garrus et al., 2001; Martin-Serrano
et al., 2001; VerPlank et al., 2001), whereas the remaining
C-terminal two-thirds of Tsg101 interacts with other
proteins (Figure 1A). Like other UEV domains, Tsg101
UEV shows signi®cant sequence similarity to E2 ubiquitin
ligases but is unable to catalyze ubiquitin transfer as it
lacks the active site cysteine that forms the transient
thioester bond with the C-terminus of ubiquitin (Ub)
(Koonin and Abagyan, 1997; Ponting et al., 1997)
(Figure 1B). Nevertheless, at least some UEVs have
retained the ability to bind Ub, and appear to act either as
cofactors in ubiquitylation reactions, or as ubiquitin sensors
(Hofmann and Pickart, 1999; Garrus et al., 2001; Katzmann
et al., 2001; VanDemark et al., 2001; VerPlank et al.,
2001). As discussed below, UEV domains also frequently
contain other protein recognition motifs, and may generally
serve to couple protein and Ub binding functions to
facilitate the formation of multiprotein complexes.
Tsg101 normally functions in the cellular vacuolar
protein sorting (VPS) pathway, which coordinates the
sorting of membrane-associated proteins through a series
of endosomal compartments for eventual delivery to the
lysosome (vacuole in yeast) (Dupre et al., 2001; Hicke,
2001; Piper and Luzio, 2001). A key decision-making step
in this pathway occurs when membrane patches containing
proteins destined for destruction bud as small vesicles into
the lumen of the late endosome, creating an organelle
called the `multivesicular body' (MVB). Subsequent
fusion of the MVB with the lysosome delivers these
vesicles and all associated cargo to the lumen of the
lysosome, where they are degraded by proteolysis. In
contrast, proteins that remain in the limiting membrane of
MVB are delivered to the limiting membrane of lysosomes
and therefore escape degradation.
Recent work, particularly in the yeast system, has
revealed that Tgs101 (yeast Vps23p) performs an import￾ant role in selecting which proteins enter the MVB lumen
and which remain on the limiting membrane. In yeast,
proteins destined for the lumen of the vacuole are
covalently modi®ed with monoubiquitin and bound by a
350-kDa protein complex called ESCRT-I, which contains
the proteins Vps23p, Vps28p and Vps37p (Katzmann et al.,
2001). ESCRT-I appears to function as the receptor and/or
sorting complex that selects ubiquitylated proteins for
incorporation into MVB vesicles. Consistent with this
model, ESCRT-I can bind ubiquitin in vitro, and proteins
that would otherwise remain on the limiting membrane of
the late endosome are targeted into the lumen by addition
of a ubiquitylation signal (Katzmann et al., 2001).
Although the human system is less well characterized,
Tsg101 also binds Ub in vitro (Garrus et al., 2001), forms a
Structure and functional interactions of the
Tsg101 UEV domain
The EMBO Journal Vol. 21 No. 10 pp. 2397±2406, 2002
ã European Molecular Biology Organization 2397soluble 350-kDa complex that includes Vps28 (Babst et al.,
2000; Bishop and Woodman, 2001), and is required for the
delivery of cathepsin D and endocytosed receptors to
the lysosome (Babst et al., 2000). Thus, it appears that
ESCRT-I complex function is conserved from yeast to
humans, and that recognition of ubiquitylated proteins is
an important element in this function. Unlike Tsg101,
however, Vps23p is not known to bind PTAP, and this may
be an important difference between the yeast and mam￾malian systems.
Intriguingly, Ub also plays an important role in the
budding of retroviruses and other enveloped viruses (Harty
et al., 2000; Patnaik et al., 2000; Schubert et al., 2000;
Strack et al., 2000; Vogt, 2000; Harty et al., 2001;
Kikonyogo et al., 2001). Although the precise role of Ub in
virus budding is not yet established, retroviruses contain
high Ub levels and 2±5% of Gag proteins in the virion are
monoubiquitylated (Putterman et al., 1990; Ott et al.,
1998, 2000). Moreover, treatment of infected cells with
proteasome inhibitors, which decreases the intracellular
concentration of free Ub, also inhibits virus release at a
late stage (Schubert et al., 2000; Harty et al., 2001). In
some cases, virus release can be partially rescued either by
overexpressing free Ub or by fusing Ub to the C-terminal
end of the viral Gag protein (Patnaik et al., 2000).
Taken together, these observations have led us to
hypothesize that Tsg101 may perform similar roles in
facilitating virus particle budding from the plasma mem￾brane and vesicle budding from the surface of MVB
(Patnaik et al., 2000; Garrus et al., 2001). In this model,
the essential difference between viral budding and MVB
formation is that the PTAP signals on the viral proteins
cause Tsg101 to relocalize to the sites of virus budding on
the plasma membrane (Martin-Serrano et al., 2001). Once
there, Tsg101 could recognize the viral proteins as `cargo'
to be incorporated into a budding vesicle and recruit the
additional MVB machinery necessary to complete the
budding process. This model further suggests that HIV
Gag, like cellular proteins destined for the lumen of
the MVB, may undergo a cycle of ubiquitylation and

model remains speculative, it emphasizes the importance
of understanding how Tsg101 interacts with the PTAP
motif and with Ub. We have therefore used nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the
structure of the N-terminal UEV domain of Tsg101 and to
map the sites of Ub and PTAP binding.
Results
Structure of the Tsg101 N-terminal UEV domain
The Tsg101 UEV domain was de®ned as residues 1±145
on the basis of preliminary sequence and NMR analyses
(see Materials and methods). This construct (Tsg101
UEV) was expressed and puri®ed, and its NMR solution
structure calculated from a total of 1861 NOE interproton
restraints, 76 hydrogen bonding restraints derived from
amide proton exchange protection experiments, and 146 f
and y dihedral angle restraints. A stereo view of the
superposition of the 20 lowest-penalty structures is shown
in Figure 1C. The structures superimpose over the mean
coordinate positions of all ordered residues of the domain
(4±142) with root mean square deviations (r.m.s.ds) of
0.69 and 0.99 AÊ for backbone and non-hydrogen atoms,
respectively (see Table I for structural statistics).
The Tsg101 UEV fold is generally similar to E2 ligases
and to Mms2, the only other structurally characterized
UEV (Cook et al., 1992, 1993, 1997; Tong et al., 1997;
Worthylake et al., 1998; Huang et al., 1999; Jiang and
Basavappa, 1999; Zheng et al., 2000; Hamilton et al.,
2001; Moraes et al., 2001; VanDemark et al., 2001). This
`E2 fold' consists of four helices packed against one side
of a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (Figure 2). The
structural similarity is greatest around the central active
site regions of the proteins (residues 53±138), where
Tsg101 UEV superimposes with hMms2 (Figure 2B) and
yUbc13 (a canonical E2; Figure 2C) with r.m.s.ds over
equivalent Ca positions of 2.22 and 1.97 AÊ , respectively
(Figure 2D). However, there are important differences
between Tsg101 UEV and other E2 and UEV proteins
outside of this region.
Most signi®cantly, Tsg101 UEV lacks the two
C-terminal helices found in all structurally characterized
E2 proteins (Figure 2C and D, gray helices and green
arrow, respectively). Mms2 also lacks these helices, and
sequence analyses suggest that they are missing from other
UEV domains (Koonin and Abagyan, 1997), indicating
that this is a general difference between UEV and
canonical E2 proteins (Figure 1B). Although both Mms2
and Tsg101 UEV lack C-terminal helices, their structures
differ in this region because the C-terminal residues of
human and yeast Mms2 adopt extended, but ordered
conformations that occupy the same site as the ®nal E2
helix, whereas the equivalent residues in Tsg101 UEV
project off into solution and are disordered. We considered
the possibility that these residues might be ordered in
longer Tsg101 constructs, and therefore analyzed proteins
that contained an additional 5 or 12 residues (Tsg1011±150
and Tsg1011±157, respectively), but could ®nd no evidence
for additional order in these longer constructs (see
Materials and methods). Thus, the C-terminal end of
Tsg101 UEV differs from other known proteins with E2
folds and, as discussed below, this difference allows
Tsg101 UEV to bind PTAP-containing peptides.
Tsg101 UEV differs from Mms2 and canonical E2
proteins in two additional ways: (i) Tsg101 contains two
N-terminal helices (colored red and orange in Figure 2A),

Tsg101 UEV domain structure
2399whereas Ubc13 and Mms2 contain only one (Figure 2D,
red arrow). The general disposition of Tsg101 UEV helix 2
(orange) is similar to the N-terminal helices of Ubc13 and
Mms2, but is shifted slightly towards the center of the
sheet (Figure 2D). (ii) The disposition of the ®rst two
b-strands in Tsg101 UEV is quite different from that of
Mms2 and Ubc13. In Tsg101, strand 1 is twisted and
displaced toward the N-terminal end of strand 2, and these
two strands form an extended b-hairpin `tongue' that
projects 11 residues beyond the main body of the domain
and terminates in a type I turn (Figure 2D, blue arrow).
This b-tongue is well de®ned by strong interstrand Ha-to￾Ha and Ha-to-HN NOEs, as well as interstrand backbone
hydrogen bonds that protect the backbone amide protons
from rapid deuterium exchange (not shown). As discussed
below, the extended b-tongue appears to be a functionally
important feature because it forms part of the Ub binding
site. The disposition of the ®rst two b-strands also allows
extensive packing interactions between the Tsg101 UEV
N-terminal helices and the b-sheet, which are not possible
in Ubc13 or Mms2. For example, the loop connecting
Tsg101 helices 1 and 2 inserts a tyrosine side-chain
hydroxyl (Tyr15) between strands 2 and 3, bridging the
hydrogen bonding interaction between the amide proton of
Met53 (strand 2) and the carboxyl oxygen of Lys76 (strand
3), thereby terminating the hydrogen bonding network of
the b-sheet.
In summary, Tsg101 UEV is similar to canonical E2
enzymes in the hydrophobic core and `active site' regions,
but differs signi®cantly at both its N- and C-termini.
Although some of these structural differences are shared
by the Tsg101 and Mms2 UEV domains (e.g. the lack of
C-terminal helices), it is apparent that Tsg101 has
diverged even further from the canonical E2 fold than
has Mms2.

how the binding groove of Tsg101 UEV is ®lled in cis by C-terminal

2400Tsg101 UEV domain (Figure 3). Our previous binding
studies showed that the Tsg101 UEV domain binds p6
with moderate af®nity under physiological conditions
(Kd = 27 6 5 mM) (Garrus et al., 2001), and the interaction
is even tighter under the low salt and slightly acidic
conditions used in our NMR titration experiments (Kd =
4.3 6 1.6 mM at 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate
pH 6; Table II), suggesting an ionic component to the
interaction. Heteronuclear single quantum coherence
(HSQC) spectra of 15N-labeled Tsg101 UEV were col￾lected during stepwise addition of unlabeled p6, and sites
of 1H±15N chemical shift changes were monitored. The
majority of Tsg101 UEV amide protons (71/130) changed
chemical shift signi®cantly, suggesting the possibility that
local conformational changes may accompany binding
(normalized chemical shift, d > 0.5; Cheever et al., 2001).
A nine-residue peptide spanning the p6 PTAP motif
(5PEPTAPPEE13) produced very similar chemical shift
changes as full-length p6 (Figure 3A), and bound with the
same af®nity as full-length p6 (Figure 3B). Thus, we
conclude that this PTAP peptide contains all of the
relevant residues for Tsg101 binding. Upon addition of
0.5 molar equivalents of either p6 or PTAP peptide, two
distinct peaks were observed for each shifted amide,
indicating that both complexes were in slow exchange on
the NMR time scale (Figure 3A, lower panels). As
expected, complex formation proceeded to completion
upon addition of a second 0.5 molar equivalent of peptide,
and additional shifts were not observed when super￾saturating levels of p6 (>4-fold) were added (not shown).
Tsg101 UEV residues exhibiting the greatest chemical
shift changes upon PTAP binding (d > 1.8) were clustered
about a groove de®ned by residues from three different
structural elements: (i) the loop connecting strands 2 and
3; (ii) the N-terminal third of the vestigial active site loop;
and (iii) the C-terminal residues of the domain (Figure 3C
and D). Several intermolecular NOEs between the peptide
and the protein have been assigned in preliminary studies,
and are consistent with PTAP peptide binding in this
groove (data not shown). The groove is opened up by a
®ve-residue insertion in the active site loop (Figure 1B),
displacement of the loop connecting strands 2 and 3
(Figure 2D), and irregularities in C-terminal helix geo￾metry created by two glycine residues (Gly126 and
Gly136). Hydrophobic residues from strands 3 and 4
(Ile70, Val89, Pro91) line the bottom of the groove, while
one end is ¯anked by charged residues (Arg64, Arg144).
This asymmetric charge distribution may help orient the
bound peptide, possibly by interacting with complemen￾tary acidic residues that ¯ank the PTAP motif. We have
shown previously that single alanine point mutations of
both p6 Glu6 and Glu13 (but not Glu12) residues reduce
the overall binding energy (Garrus et al., 2001).
Mutational analyses were used to con®rm that residues
in the binding groove make energetically signi®cant
interactions in the Tsg101 UEV/p6 complex (Figures 3D
and 4). Four Tsg101 UEV residues located around the
putative PTAP binding site were mutated to alanine and
tested for their effect on Tsg101 binding af®nity in
BIAcore biosensor experiments (Garrus et al., 2001). As
expected, alanine substitutions in three residues that
surround the rim of the groove (Tyr63, Met95 and
Val141) all reduced p6 binding signi®cantly (Figure 4
and Table II). Surprisingly, mutation of Val89, which is

2401located at the bottom of the pocket, had no effect on p6
binding. Therefore, although the Val89 amide showed the
greatest chemical shift change upon addition of p6 (Figure
3A), the Val89 methyl groups do not contribute appre￾ciable binding energy, perhaps because the PTAP peptide
does not reach down to the very bottom of the pocket.
Importantly, the Tyr63®Ala and Met95®Ala mutations,
which decreased p6 binding af®nity by 14- and 52-fold,
respectively, also signi®cantly impaired the ability of
Tsg101 to support HIV-1 budding, whereas the Val89®
Ala mutation had no effect on budding (J.Garrus, personal
communication). The excellent correspondence between
the viral budding phenotypes and in vitro binding activities
of both PTAP and Tsg101 UEV mutants strongly supports
the idea that PTAP-mediated recruitment of Tsg101 to
HIV-1 budding sites at the plasma membrane is a
prerequisite for the ef®cient release of virus particles
from infected cells.
Ubiquitin binding
The Tsg101 UEV domain also binds ubiquitin, although
the 1:1 interaction is quite weak (Kd » 500 mM) (Garrus
et al., 2001). The Ub and PTAP binding sites appear to be
distinct, and indeed can be simultaneously occupied as
evidenced by the fact that direct fusion of Ub to p6
enhances the binding af®nity over that of either ligand
alone (i.e. the ligands bind cooperatively; Figure 4). As
compared with p6, titration with Ub produced chemical
shift changes in a distinct, but slightly overlapping subset
of Tsg101 UEV amides, consistent with the idea that
PTAP and Ub bind to different sites (compare Figures 3A
and 5A). Signi®cant amide chemical shift changes (d >
1.8) were observed for only 13 residues, suggesting that
Ub does not contact a large surface area or cause large
conformational changes upon binding (Figure 5A).
Consistent with the weak af®nity of Tsg101 UEV for
(unconjugated) ubiquitin, the complex was in fast
exchange. As shown in Figure 5A, single resonances
were always observed for the perturbed amides and their
chemical shift changes increased as the Ub protein ratio
increased. Residues undergoing the greatest chemical shift
changes were located throughout the b-tongue and at the
vestigial active site loop, which ¯ank a large hydrophobic
patch on the protein surface formed by side-chains from
strands 3 and 4 (Figure 5B and C).
The importance of this region for Ub binding was tested
by introducing a series of alanine point mutations and
quantitating their effects on Ub, p6±Ub and p6 binding
(Figure 4 and Table II). Alanine substitutions of b-tongue
residues (Val43, Asn45, Asp46) and a hydrophobic sheet
residue (Phe88) signi®cantly reduced Tsg101 UEV bind￾ing to both p6±Ub and Ub alone (>3-fold) without
affecting p6 binding. Substitution of Trp75, which is
exposed on the hydrophobic surface, did not signi®cantly
affect the ubiquitin-binding activity of Tsg101 UEV. This
was unexpected, as the indole N-H of Trp75 is signi®-
cantly shifted during Ub titration. This difference not￾withstanding, our mutagenesis and NMR chemical shift
mapping experiments are generally in good agreement and
de®ne the location of the Tsg101 UEV Ub-binding site.
The complementary Tsg101 UEV-interacting surface
on ubiquitin was also mapped by chemical shift perturb￾ation experiments. As expected, titration of unlabeled
Tsg101 UEV into 15N-labeled Ub shifted a small subset of
Ub amides, and the complex was again in fast exchange
(Figure 5D). The greatest chemical shift changes (d > 1.0)
mapped to the two shortest strands (3 and 4) of the
Fig. 5. Mapping the Tsg101 UEV and Ub interaction sites. (A) Overlay

b-tongue residues. The shifted Ub residues include
Lys48, which is used for the formation of polyubiquitin
chains that target proteins for proteasomal degradation
(Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998).
Discussion
PTAP binding
The structure presented here demonstrates that the
N-terminal UEV domain of human Tsg101 conforms to
the general E2 fold, but with several distinctive features
that allow it to bind PTAP and ubiquitin. Tsg101 UEV is
the ®rst example of an E2/UEV domain with a peptide
binding motif, and our work shows that residues from ®ve
different secondary structural elements come together to
create a PTAP binding `groove'. Analogous sites in other
E2/UEV proteins are buried, either by a C-terminal helix
(in canonical E2 enzymes) or by the ordered C-terminal
residues of Mms2 UEV (Figure 3B), explaining why these
domains do not have peptide binding activities.
The importance of the Tsg101/PTAP interaction in the
release of HIV particles seems clear because mutations in
either the p6 PTAP motif (GoÈttlinger et al., 1991; Huang
et al., 1995) or in Tsg101 UEV (J.Garrus, personal
communication) that inhibit the interaction also block
virus release. In principle, the Tsg101 UEV domain
represents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention
against HIV and Ebola as these viruses require Tsg101 for
budding (Garrus et al., 2001; Martin-Serrano et al., 2001)
and because the cellular Tsg101 protein presumably would
not develop drug resistance as rapidly as a viral target. Our
structure therefore provides the ®rst glimpse of potential
binding sites for small molecule inhibitors designed to
block viral egress by inhibiting Tsg101 binding.
The role(s) of PTAP binding in normal cellular Tsg101
functions remains an open question. A number of candi￾date cellular Tsg101-binding proteins also carry P(S/T)AP
motifs (Strack et al., 2000; Garrus et al., 2001), including
plasma membrane proteins known to be downregulated via
the vacuolar protein sorting pathway (Berthoud et al.,
2000; Strack et al., 2000). A PSAP motif is also found
in hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase
substrate (Hrs/Hgs, the ortholog of yeast Vps27)
(Garrus et al., 2001), a protein required for tyrosine
kinase receptor downregulation and MVB formation in
Drosophila (Komada and Kitamura, 2001; Lloyd et al.,
2002). This suggests the intriguing possibility that viral
late domains may act by mimicking the normal protein
recruiting functions of Hrs during vacuolar protein sorting
and multivesicular body formation. Consistent with this
idea, human Hrs has very recently been shown to be
ubiquitylated (Polo et al., 2002). Hrs also contains a PPEY
sequence, which is another motif that can function as a late
domain in other enveloped viruses (Vogt, 2000).
We have also noticed that Tsg101 contains its own
PTAP motif, which is located in a predicted loop region
connecting the apparent binding sites for the Vps37 and
Vps28 proteins (Figure 1A). We hypothesize that the
Tsg101 UEV domain could fold back and bind to this
PTAP sequence, perhaps creating an `auto-inhibited'
conformation. Thus, we speculate that regulated PTAP
binding may be important for normal Tsg101 function, and
viruses like HIV and Ebola are simply mimicking this
natural binding interaction.
Ubiquitin binding
Previous biochemical and modeling studies have sug￾gested that ubiquitin can bind to E2/UEV domains in
two distinct modes. Remarkably, our data indicate that
ubiquitin binds in yet another, third way to the Tsg101
UEV domain, although the biological relevance of this
interaction remains to be tested. As illustrated in Figure 6,
both previously known modes of ubiquitin binding are
utilized by the heterodimeric Ubc13/Mms2 complex. This
complex can assemble polymeric chains of Ub molecules
by binding and catalyzing the linkage of `acceptor' and
`donor' ubiquitin molecules. The most general mode of Ub
binding is illustrated by the interaction between the donor
ubiquitin and the catalytically active Ubc13 E2 domain.
As in other E2 enzymes, the active site cysteine of Ubc13
forms a transient thioester bond with the C-terminus of Ub
in the process of transferring Ub from an E1 enzyme onto
the lysine side chain of a protein substrate (Lys63 of
another Ub molecule in this case). This covalent chemistry
implies that the C-terminal `tail' of Ub must bind near the
active site cysteine residue, and there is direct evidence
that tail residues form the major contacts when Ub binds to
the Ubc1 and Ubc2b E2 enzymes (Miura et al., 1999;
Hamilton et al., 2001).
Ubiquitin binds in quite a different mode to the
catalytically inactive Mms2 UEV subunit of the Ubc13/
Fig. 6. Comparison of the ubiquitin binding site (blue residues) on
Tsg101 UEV (yellow) with models for the two distinct ubiquitin bind￾ing sites (purple) on the Ubc13/Mms2 heterodimer (gray) (VanDemark
et al., 2001). To create the ®gure, Tsg101 UEV was superimposed on
either the Ubc13 E2 (A) or the Mms2 UEV (B) subunits of the Ubc13/
Mms2 heterodimer. The ®gure illustrates the fact that the Ub binding
surface on Tsg101 is distinct from previously characterized Ub binding
sites on either E2 or UEV domains, but does roughly correspond to the
Mms2 binding site on Ubc13.
Tsg101 UEV domain structure
2403Mms2 complex. The role of Mms2 is to position the
acceptor Ub Lys63 side-chain to attack the C-terminus of
the donor ubiquitin. Although two different models for the
Mms2/Ub have been proposed (Moraes et al., 2001;
VanDemark et al., 2001), mutagenesis studies are most
consistent with Ub binding in a channel that straddles the
Mms2/Ubc13 interface (Chan and Hill, 2001; VanDemark
et al., 2001), with the Mms2 binding surface de®ned by the
C-terminal half of helix 1, the outer edge of strand 1, and
the loop that connects strands 1 and 2.
In contrast, our chemical shift mapping and mutagenesis
experiments indicate that ubiquitin binds to the concave
`lower' half of the four-stranded sheet of Tsg101 UEV.
The most prominent feature of this binding site is the
b-tongue projection, and mutations of residues at the tip of
the tongue reduce Ub binding. Although this site is distinct
from both previously characterized Ub binding surfaces in
E2/UEV proteins, it does roughly match the Mms2 binding
site on the Ubc13 protein (Figure 6A). Ub binds Tsg101
UEV using a convex surface that encompasses strands 3
and 4, and we therefore propose that shape complement￾arity may play an important role in recognition. The Lys48
residue at the N-terminal end of Ub strand 4 is likely to be
sequestered at the Tsg101 UEV/Ub interface, which
probably precludes polyubiquitylation via Lys48 linkages
(the targeting signal for proteasomal degradation).
In summary, the Ub-binding surface of Tsg101 differs
from that used by other E2/UEV proteins, leading to the
surprising conclusion that although E2/UEV domains
utilize a conserved three-dimensional fold to bind
ubiquitin, they have evolved at least three distinct surfaces
to mediate these interactions.
Materials and methods
Tsg101 UEV domain
Tsg101 UEV domain constructs were designed based on an alignment of
Tsg101 homologs obtained from the NCBI protein database (Arabidopsis
thaliana, BAB03147; Caenorhabditis elegans, AAC25822; Chelonia
mydas, AAF87776; Drosophila melanogaster, AAG29564; Homo
sapiens, AAC52083; Mus musculus, AAH05424; Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, AAB62820). Since canonical E2 enzymes are ~150 residues
in length, gaps in the alignment near Tsg101 residue 150 were interpreted
as potential domain boundaries. Based on the alignments, constructs
spanning residues 1±145, 1±150, 1±157 and 1±161 of Tsg101 were cloned
and expressed from a pET11d vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The three
shortest constructs expressed soluble proteins at high levels in
BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells, but 1±161 (and longer constructs)
expressed poorly and were insoluble. Although we were unable to make
these longer protein constructs, we conclude that Tsg101 residues
151±180 are unlikely to form the two helices seen in canonical E2
enzymes because the protein sequence in this region (151PPY￾QATGPPNTSYMPGMPGGISPYPSGYPP180) is 50% Pro/Gly (15/30)
and has an extremely low helical propensity. Moreover, this sequence is
poorly conserved in alignments of Tsg101 proteins from multiple species
(Bishop and Woodman, 2001), and cannot be aligned meaningfully with
the C-terminal helices of E2 enzymes (Koonin and Abagyan, 1997;
Ponting et al., 1997).
To purify the soluble Tsg101 UEV proteins, cells were lysed using
lysozyme and sonication, and insoluble material was removed from the
lysate by centrifugation. Tsg101 UEV was precipitated from the soluble
fraction with ammonium sulfate at 28±55% saturation. The precipitate
was redissolved in buffer containing 25 mM MOPS pH 6.5 and
fractionated on a methyl sulfonate (SP)-Sepharose column (Pharmacia,
Uppsala, Sweden). Tsg101 UEV eluted at an ~300 mM NaCl linear salt
gradient (50±1000 mM NaCl over 400 ml). Fractions containing Tsg101
were pooled, adjusted to 1 M ammonium sulfate and refractionated on a
phenyl-Sepharose column (Pharmacia). Pure Tsg101 UEV eluted near the
beginning of a linear salt gradient (1±0 M ammonium sulfate over
200 ml), with typical yields of 15±20 mg pure protein per liter of E.coli
culture. N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry
analyses showed that the N-terminal methionine was quantitatively
removed during expression, and the masses of all puri®ed proteins were
within 1±3 Da of those expected (not shown). The 1H/15N-HSQC spectra
of Tsg1011±145, Tsg1011±150 and Tsg1011±157 were completely super￾imposable (except for C-terminal residues), and amide protons beyond
Phe142 displayed limited proton chemical shift dispersion and sharp
peaks with half-height linewidths of 14±19 Hz (versus 21±24 Hz for
structured residues of the domain), indicating that they are disordered. In
addition, all three UEV constructs bound with same af®nities to p6,
p6±Ub and Ub (data not shown). Tsg101 residues 1±145 therefore appear
to encompass the entire ordered UEV domain. Hence, all reported
structural and biochemical analyses were performed on this de®ned
domain. Mutant Tsg101 UEV constructs were cloned using the
megaprimer PCR method (Picard et al., 1994), and puri®ed as described
for the wild type.
Other protein samples
GST±p6 constructs and the free p6 domain of the HIV-1 Gag protein were
puri®ed as described previously (Jenkins et al., 2001). The PTAP peptide
(NH-PEPTAPPEE-COOH) was obtained by solid-phase synthesis and
puri®ed using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography.
Bovine ubiquitin, which is identical in sequence to human ubiquitin,
was purchased from Sigma and puri®ed using size exclusion chromato￾graphy. 15N-labeled ubiquitin was purchased from VLI Research, Inc.,
(Malvern, PA).
NMR spectroscopy
Samples for structure determination were ~1.5 mM Tsg101 UEV in
20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl pH 5.5 in 90% H2O/10% D2O.
Spectra were recorded at 25°C on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer
equipped with a triple-resonance 1H/13C/15N probe and z-axis pulsed ®eld
gradient capability. Backbone and side-chain assignments were made
using the following NMR experiments: 15N/1H HSQC (Mori et al., 1995),
HNCACB (Wittekind, 1993), HNCO (Kay et al., 1994), 13C/1H
CT±HSQC (Santoro and King, 1992; Vuister, 1992), 3D 15N-edited
TOCSY±HSQC (Zhang et al., 1994), H(CCO)NH, (H)C(CO)NH
(Grzesiek et al., 1993) and 4D 13C/13C-edited HMQC±NOESY±HMQC
(Vuister et al., 1993). The following NOE data were used to generate
distance restraints: 3D 15N-edited NOESY±HSQC (Zhang et al., 1994;
Mori et al., 1995) and 3D 13C-edited NOESY±HSQC (Muhandiram et al.,
1993; Pascal et al., 1994). NOESY mixing times were 80 ms. Three-bond
coupling constants (3JHN-HA) were obtained from a 3D HNHA experiment
(Kuboniwa et al., 1994). Hydrogen-bonded amides were identi®ed using
deuterium exchange as described previously (Bai et al., 1997). All spectra
were processed using FELIX (MSI).
Structure determination
Backbone and side-chain correlations were assigned and NOE intensities
were integrated using the tools in SPARKY (T.D.Goddard and
D.G.Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). Structures were
calculated using the torsion angle dynamics approach in DYANA
(GuÈntert et al., 1997). Initial structures were calculated from ~1500
NOEs. Iterative rounds of structure calculation and NOE assignments led
to 10 models that superimposed over secondary structure backbone atoms
with an average r.m.s.d. of ~0.5 AÊ . Hydrogen bonding restraints (two per
hydrogen bond) and phi and psi dihedral angle restraints were then added.
These restraints did not alter the structure, but improved convergence. To
generate the reported structures, 200 structures were calculated using
DYANA and geometries of the 20 lowest penalty structures were
regularized using the crystallography and NMR system (CNS) (BruÈnger
et al., 1998). The structures were analyzed using PROCHECK-NMR
(Laskowski et al., 1996), MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996) and INSIGHT
II (Molecular Simulations Inc.; www.accelrys.com/life/) (Table I).
Structure ®gures were created with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991),
BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997) and GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991).
Chemical shift perturbation
Titration experiments were performed at 20°C in 20 mM sodium
phosphate, 50 mM NaCl pH 6 in 90% H2O/10% D2O. To identify the
PTAP and Ub binding sites on the UEV domain, unlabeled p6, PTAP
peptide or Ub were titrated into 0.5 mM 15N-labeled UEV domain. To
identify the UEV binding site on Ub, unlabeled UEV domain was titrated
into 0.2 mM 15N-labeled Ub. Normalized chemical shift changes were
calculated using the equation: d = 25[(dHN)2 ± (dN/5)2]0.5 (Cheever et al.,
O.Pornillos et al.
24042001). Amides displaying the greatest normalized chemical shift changes
were displayed using cutoffs of d >1.8 (for Tsg101 UEV amides) or >1.0
(for Ub amides). Amide chemical shift assignments for human Ub were
obtained from the VLI Research, Inc. website (www.vli-research.com).
Binding experiments
Binding af®nities of puri®ed wild-type and mutant Tsg101 UEV domains
for immobilized GST±p61±27, GST±p61±27-Ub and GST±Ub were
quanti®ed using a BIAcore biosensor as described previously (Garrus
et al., 2001). Measurements were performed at 20°C in 20 mM sodium
phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% P20
(pH 7.2).
