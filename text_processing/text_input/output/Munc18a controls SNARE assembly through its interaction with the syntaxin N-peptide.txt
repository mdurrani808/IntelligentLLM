Sec1/Munc18-like (SM) proteins functionally interact
with SNARE proteins in vesicular fusion. Despite their high
sequence conservation, structurally disparate binding
modes for SM proteins with syntaxins have been observed.
Several SM proteins appear to bind only to a short peptide
present at the N terminus of syntaxin, designated the
N-peptide, while Munc18a binds to a ‘closed’ conformation
formed by the remaining portion of syntaxin 1a. Here,
we show that the syntaxin 16 N-peptide binds to the SM
protein Vps45, but the remainder of syntaxin 16 strongly
enhances the affinity of the interaction. Likewise, the
N-peptide of syntaxin 1a serves as a second binding site
in the Munc18a/syntaxin 1a complex. When the syntaxin
1a N-peptide is bound to Munc18a, SNARE complex
formation is blocked. Removal of the N-peptide enables
binding of syntaxin 1a to its partner SNARE SNAP-25,
while still bound to Munc18a. This suggests that
Munc18a controls the accessibility of syntaxin 1a to its
partners, a role that might be common to all SM proteins.

Introduction
Transport of cargo between organelles in eukaryotic cells is
mediated by vesicles that bud from a donor compartment and
specifically fuse with an acceptor membrane. The central
machinery involved in the fusion process is composed of
members of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
factor attachment receptor) protein family. SNAREs anchored
in the vesicle and target membrane are thought to assemble
in a zipper-like fashion into a four-helix bundle, providing the
energy to drive fusion of the two bilayers (Hong, 2005; Jahn
and Scheller, 2006). Although SNAREs are sufficient to drive
membrane fusion when inserted into liposome membranes
(Weber et al, 1998; Pobbati et al, 2006), this minimal
machinery is organized and controlled by additional factors
in vivo.
Members of the cytosolic Sec1/Munc18-like (SM) family of
proteins have been established as essential factors in different
intracellular transport steps, during which they functionally
interact with the SNARE machinery. However, the molecular
basis for this interaction is not entirely understood. In parti￾cular, the SM protein Munc18a (also known as Unc18, nSec1,
and Rop) has an ambiguous role in the Ca2 þ -dependent
discharge of neurotransmitter from synaptic vesicles (re￾viewed by Rizo and Sudhof, 2002; Gallwitz and Jahn, 2003;
Toonen and Verhage, 2003, 2007; Weimer and Richmond,
2005; Burgoyne and Morgan, 2007). This vesicular fusion
step is mediated by a well-characterized set of SNAREs,
consisting of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin/
VAMP 2 and the two plasma membrane proteins syntaxin
1a and SNAP-25. Munc18a binds with nanomolar affinity to
syntaxin 1a (Pevsner et al, 1994). The cytosolic domain of
syntaxin 1a contains a conserved N-terminal peptide, fol￾lowed by a three-helix bundle designated Habc (Fernandez
et al, 1998), a linker, and the H3 domain, which forms one of
the helices in the SNARE complex. When bound to Munc18a,
syntaxin 1a adopts a ‘closed’ conformation in which the H3
domain folds back onto Habc, rendering it inaccessible to its
partner SNAREs (Pevsner et al, 1994; Dulubova et al, 1999;
Misura et al, 2000; Yang et al, 2000). Therefore, for syntaxin
1a, to assemble into a SNARE complex, it is thought that it
must dissociate from Munc18a and switch to an open con￾formation in which the H3 domain is accessible. Dissociation
of the Munc18a–syntaxin 1 complex, however, is a slow
process (Pevsner et al, 1994), which is likely related to the
extensive interaction surface between syntaxin 1a and the
clamp-like structure formed by the three domains of
Munc18a (Misura et al, 2000).
Although biochemical and structural data imply an inhibi￾tory role for Munc18, loss of Munc18a function blocks
neurotransmitter release, indicating that this molecule has
an essential, positive role in neuronal secretion (Weimer and
Richmond, 2005). Studies of other SM proteins that serve in
different intracellular trafficking pathways also support an
activating role for this family (Toonen and Verhage, 2003;
Weimer and Richmond, 2005). A binding mode distinct from
that of Munc18a–syntaxin 1a appears to govern the interac￾tion of several SM proteins with their cognate syntaxins, in
particular, between Sly1 and Sed5/syntaxin 5, and Vps45 and
Tlg2/syntaxin 16. In these complexes, the very N-terminal
region of the syntaxin preceding the Habc domain, desig￾nated the N-peptide, binds to the outer surface of the SM
domain 1 (Bracher and Weissenhorn, 2002; Dulubova et al,
2002; Peng and Gallwitz, 2002), opposite the domain 1 sur￾face that interacts with the closed conformation of syntaxin
1a. Unlike Munc18a, these other SM proteins are thought not
to interact with the remainder of their cognate syntaxin
molecule, suggesting that the N-peptide interaction somehow
assists in the formation of SNARE complexes rather than

923inhibiting access of the syntaxin SNARE motif (Rizo and
Sudhof, 2002; Gallwitz and Jahn, 2003; Toonen and Verhage,
2003, 2007; Weimer and Richmond, 2005; Burgoyne and
Morgan, 2007). As Munc18a does not bind detectably to the
isolated N-peptide of syntaxin 1a (Dulubova et al, 2003; Shen
et al, 2007), it was thought that it cannot mediate a comparable
role in vesicle fusion. A third mode of SM function appears to
occur in yeast Sec1p, which does not bind to the plasma
membrane syntaxin Sso1p, but can instead bind to the as￾sembled plasma membrane SNARE complex (Scott et al, 2004;
Togneri et al, 2006).
Recent findings have begun to address the apparent dis￾crepancies in the mechanisms of SM proteins. The isolated
N-peptide of syntaxin 4 is able to bind to the outer surface of
Munc18c, in a manner similar to that observed in the Sly1–
Sed5 complex (Hu et al, 2007). Munc18c and syntaxin 4 are
closely related to Munc18a and syntaxin 1a. Furthermore,
Munc18a can bind to an assembled SNARE complex
(Dulubova et al, 2007; Khvotchev et al, 2007; Shen et al,
2007), and this interaction requires the syntaxin N-peptide.
As the N-peptide alone is not sufficient for binding, it is clear
that other regions of the SNAREs must participate in the
interaction.
Based on these data, it has been proposed that when
bound to the assembled SNARE complex via the syntaxin
N-peptide, Munc18a somehow stimulates the membrane
fusion reaction. This configuration is believed to be similar
to the binding mode employed by Sly1/Sed5 (endoplasmic
reticulum-Golgi trafficking), Vps45/syntaxin 16 (endosomal
trafficking), and Munc18c/syntaxin 4 (regulated secretion in
a variety of cell types), thus providing a common interaction
mechanism between SM proteins and syntaxins. In contrast,
the tight interaction between Munc18a and the closed
conformation of syntaxin 1a was proposed to represent an
additional role of Munc18a, either in sequestering syntaxin
1a from other SNAREs (Shen et al, 2007) or in the process of
docking and priming of the vesicle(Dulubova et al, 2007).
This latter binding mode was suggested to be specific for SM
proteins of the Munc18a-like type involved in regulated
secretion.
Although these models appear to explain some of the SM
properties, they do not answer a critical question regarding
the neuronal system: how can syntaxin 1a escape the tight
grip of Munc18a to participate in SNARE complex formation?
Moreover, the models are based on semiquantitative protein￾binding assays, and the effect of Munc18a on the kinetics of
SNARE assembly has not been examined. Here, we provide
thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural data indicating that
the conserved N-peptide of syntaxin 1a acts as a switch
controlling the binding of Munc18a to the closed, inhibited
conformation of syntaxin 1a or to the SNARE complex. We
also find that Vps45 interacts detectably with the N-peptide of
syntaxin 16, but the interaction is stronger when the remain￾der of syntaxin 16 is present. These findings suggest that both
modes of interaction may occur in many SM–syntaxin pairs.
Results
The syntaxin 1a N-peptide contributes to the affinity
for Munc18a
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence spec￾troscopy were used to accurately measure the thermo￾dynamics and kinetics of the Munc18a–syntaxin 1a interac￾tion. The cytosolic domain of syntaxin 1, Syx1a (1–262),
binds to Munc18 with a favourable binding enthalpy (DHE
35 kcal/mol) and a dissociation constant Kd of approxi￾mately 1 nM (Table I; Figure 1), which is at the lower limit
of the ITC instrument. This high affinity was confirmed by

and also by determining the dissociation and association rate
constants, which gave a Kd of 0.3 nM (Supplementary Figure
1). Our findings are in agreement with the affinity of 5.7 nM
determined by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy ex￾periments in which soluble Munc18 was flowed over immo￾bilized syntaxin 1a (Pevsner et al, 1994). The surface
plasmon resonance experiments also gave an association
rate constant of konE42000 M1 s
1 and a dissociation rate
constant of koffE0.00024 s1
. When we measured the rate of
dissociation in solution, we observed a roughly 10-fold
increase in the dissociation rate constant (koffE0.0011 s1
)
and a 100-fold increase the association rate constant
(E5 106 M1 s
1
) (Supplementary Figure 1).
Remarkably, a syntaxin 1a variant, Syx1a (25–262), in
which the 24 N-terminal residues are removed showed a
reduced affinity (KdE8 nM), accompanied by a clear decrease
in binding enthalpy (DH1E25 kcal/mol, Figure 1). The
difference in binding enthalpy very likely reflects the addi￾tional contribution of the syntaxin 1a N-peptide to the inter￾action.
The syntaxin 1a N-peptide is seen in the structure of the
Munc18a–syntaxin 1a complex
The finding that the N-peptide of syntaxin 1a enhances the
affinity of the Munc18a/syntaxin1a interaction led us to
re-examine the published structure of the Munc18a/Syx1a
complex. We originally reported that the first 26 residues of
syntaxin1a could not be modelled into the electron density
and were therefore likely to be disordered (Misura et al,
2000). However, there was some significant, but uninterpre￾table, residual electron density on the outer surface of domain
1 of Munc18a, which the subsequent structures of Munc18c–
syntaxin4 (Hu et al, 2007) and Sly1–Sed5 (Bracher and
Weissenhorn, 2002) revealed as the N-peptide-binding site.
Using these other structures as a guide, we could place the
conserved Asp3-Arg4-Thr5 (DRT) motif of the syntaxin1a
peptide into this density. Re-refinement of the published
structure (Table II) improved the electron density in this
region, and residues 2–9 of syntaxin 1a could be modelled
(Figure 2A). Thus, the N-peptide of syntaxin1a binds to its
predicted site (Hu et al, 2007) on Munc18a, while the Habc
and SNARE domain are bound in the closed conformation to
a second site on the inside of the Munc18a arch (Figure 2B).
The overall structure of the bound syntaxin 1a N-peptide is
similar to that of syntaxin 4 bound to Munc18c (Figure 3). In
both cases, a short extended structure at the N terminus is
followed by a short a helix. As described previously (Hu et al,
2007), the conserved DRT motif appears to stabilize the
observed conformation through intramolecular side chain
hydrogen bonds between Asp3 and Thr5, and Arg4 and
Glu7. However, syntaxin 1a forms only 4 hydrogen bonds
and B40 van der Waals contacts with Munc18a, whereas
syntaxin 4 forms 13 hydrogen bonds and B140 van der
Waals contacts with Munc18c (Figure 3). This is due, in
part, to sequence differences in the peptide-binding site. For
example, Asp3 of syntaxin 4 interacts with the side chains of
Arg132 and Lys134 of Munc18c; these residues are replaced
by threonine in Munc18a, and are not positioned to contact
the Asp3 side chain. Also, Glu223 in the a8 loop in domain 2
of Munc18c forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain
nitrogen of Asp3; in Munc18a, the a8 loop is in a different
conformation.
Although sequence differences can explain some of the
smaller number of interactions observed between the syntax￾in 1a N-peptide and Munc18a relative to syntaxin 4-Munc18c,
contacts involving certain conserved residues are also lost
or diminished. Most notably, syntaxin 1a Leu8 is not well
packed into the hydrophobic pocket formed by residues
Phe115, Val119, Ala124, Ile127, and Leu130 of Munc18a.
Electron density for the side chain of Leu8 is weak, suggest￾ing that it may be present in multiple conformations. In
addition, syntaxin 1a Arg4 is too far from the carbonyl
oxygen of Munc18a Cys110 to form the hydrogen bond seen
in the syntaxin 4–Munc18c structure.
Given the observed differences in the interactions of con￾served residues in the syntaxin1a–Munc18a versus syntax￾in4–Munc18c, we investigated the contribution of conserved
syntaxin 1a N-peptide residues to the affinity of the Munc18a
interaction by ITC (Table I). Thr10 is not seen in the structure,
and its mutation does not affect binding. On the other hand,
mutation of Ser14, which is not seen in the structure, slightly
diminishes the interaction. Most notably, mutation of Arg4 or
Leu8 to alanine reduces the affinity and enthalpy of the
reaction to the same values as complete removal of the
peptide, indicating that despite the fewer number of contacts
made by these residues, they have essential roles in the
Munc18a interaction. These results suggest that the confor￾mation of the syntaxin1A N-peptide in the crystal has been
perturbed relative to its Munc18a-bound conformation in
solution. Crystal packing interactions between neighbouring
syntaxin 1a N-peptides (Figure 2B) could influence the con￾formation of the peptide, although there is no obvious
explanation for why the observed lattice contacts would
prevent formation of the predicted syntaxin1a–Munc18a con￾tacts. The more likely reason for the loss of expected contacts
comes from the fact that the syntaxin construct used for
crystallization bears an N-terminal polyhistidine affinity tag.
This construct binds to Munc18a with an affinity intermediate
between full-length syntaxin bearing no extra residues at its N
terminus and the truncated syntaxin Syx1a (25–262) (see
Supplementary data; Supplementary Figure 2), suggesting

P Burkhardt et al
&2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 925        that the tag partially interferes with peptide binding. In this
regard, it should also be noted that we found that thrombin, a
protease that is widely used to specifically cleave affinity tags
of recombinant proteins, removes the first nine residues of
syntaxin 1a, rendering the N-peptide unable to bind to
Munc18a. A detailed account of the effect of affinity tags
on the syntaxin–Munc18 interaction is provided in the
Supplementary data.
The effect of the N-terminal affinity tag indicates that a
detailed description of the syntaxin 1a N-peptide interaction
with Munc18a will require crystallization of a construct with
a native N terminus. Nonetheless, the crystallographic data
clearly demonstrate that the syntaxin N-peptide interacts
with the outer surface of Munc18a domain 1 in a manner
similar to other syntaxin–Munc18 pairs, and are consistent
with the increases in binding affinity and enthalpy observed
in the ITC experiments.
Contribution of the three regions of syntaxin 1a to
Munc18a interactions
The results presented so far indicate that all conserved
regions of syntaxin 1a interact with Munc18a: the N-peptide

P Burkhardt et al
926 The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 &2008 European Molecular Biology Organizationbinds to the outer surface of Munc18a domain 1, while the
Habc, linker, and H3 regions interact with the concave
surface formed by domains 1 and 3a (Misura et al, 2000).
Approximately equal numbers of residues from the Habc
and H3 domains contribute to the syntaxin 1a–Munc18a
interaction. Habc forms an independently folded domain
whose structure is essentially unaltered whether free or
bound to Munc18a. In contrast, the structure of H3 depends
on context, where it is a single helix in the SNARE complex,
but three helices interrupted by irregular sections when it is
bound to the Habc domain in the closed conformation
(Misura et al, 2000).
To dissect the energetic contributions of the different
portions of the syntaxin cytosolic domain to the Munc18a
interaction, the thermodynamics of N- and C-terminal dele￾tion constructs were measured by ITC (Table I). As noted
above, removal of the N-peptide reduces the affinity from B1
to 8 nM (DDG1 ¼ 1.2 kcal/mol). If we assume that this peptide
binds independently of the remainder of syntaxin, this energy
corresponds to a Kd of 130 mM, explaining why no detectable
binding of the peptide is observed to either Munc18a or
Munc18a–Syx1a (25–262). In contrast, removal of C-terminal
sequences has more dramatic effects. Deletion of the C￾terminal 36 residues of the SNARE domain (Syx1a (1–226))
weakens the interaction substantially: the Kd changes from
1 to 621 nM, and the binding enthalpy is reduced from 35 to
8 kcal/mol (Table I). Comparable results are obtained when
the entire SNARE motif is deleted (Syx1a (1–179), Table I),
indicating that Munc18a binds only weakly to the N-terminal
region of syntaxin (i.e., the N-peptide þ Habc). In agreement
with a previous report (Wu et al, 1999), the mutation I233A,
which is in the C-terminal section of the H3-domain of
syntaxin 1a and directly contacts Munc18a, exhibits a
strongly reduced affinity of 333 nM (Table I), corroborating
the importance of this region for the strength of the
Munc18a–syntaxin 1a interaction.
The syntaxin 1a N-peptide is required for Munc18 to bind
to the assembled ternary SNARE complex (Dulubova et al,
2007; Shen et al, 2007), but it is less clear which other regions
of the SNARE complex contribute to this interaction. ITC
experiments confirmed that there is no detectable interaction
between Munc18a and the SNARE complex formed with
N-terminally truncated syntaxin 1a, Syx1a (25–262). In
contrast, the SNARE complex containing Syx1a (1–262) binds
to Munc18a, albeit with relatively low affinity (Kd ¼ 720 nM,
Table I). Importantly, both the affinity and binding enthalpy
of the SNARE complex are identical within error to those of
the isolated N-terminal region of syntaxin 1a, Syx1a (1–179).
This suggests that the N-peptide and Habc domain of syntax￾in 1a mediate the binding of Munc18a to the assembled
SNARE complex, whereas there is no significant energetic
contribution provided by the four-helix bundle region. This is
consistent with data demonstrating that the Habc domain is
flexibly linked to the H3 domain when the latter is part of the
four-helix bundle SNARE complex (Margittai et al, 2003).
Role of the N-peptide in controlling SNARE complex
assembly
To assess the functional effect of the syntaxin N-peptide, we
made use of the SDS resistance of assembled neuronal
SNARE complexes (Hayashi et al, 1994). When Syx1a
(1–262) or Syx1a (25–262) were mixed with SNAP-25 and
synaptobrevin, SDS-resistant complexes formed over time.
When Munc18a and Syx1a (1–262) were pre-mixed, hardly
any SDS-resistant complex was formed upon addition
of SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin. In contrast, when Syx1a
(25–262) was pre-mixed with Munc18a, a clear SDS-resistant
SNARE complex band appeared (Figure 4A and B). Therefore,
binding of the syntaxin 1a N-peptide to Munc18a is required
to block SNARE complex formation. Earlier studies using
syntaxin constructs starting at residue Arg4 also found that
Munc18a blocked SNARE assembly (Pevsner et al, 1994; Yang
et al, 2000); it is not clear what affinity tag residues preceded
Arg4, but apparently they allow the N-peptide to bind (see
also Supplementary data).
The effect of the N-peptide on SNARE complex formation
was investigated more quantitatively using fluorescence￾based assays in solution. When a fluorescently labelled
cytosolic domain of synaptobrevin 2 was mixed with SNAP￾25 and Syx1a (1–262) or Syx1a (25–262) in the absence of
Munc18a, an increase in fluorescence anisotropy correspond￾ing to the formation of a ternary SNARE complex was
observed. As was seen in the SDS resistance assay, pre￾mixing Munc18a with Syx1a (1–262) produced an almost
complete block of ternary SNARE complex formation,
whereas no inhibition was found when Munc18a and Syx1a

results were obtained for the binary complex of syntaxin and
SNAP-25 believed to be the intermediate in SNARE complex
formation: binding of fluorescently labelled SNAP-25 to
Syx1a (1–262), but not Syx1a (25–262), was inhibited by
Munc18a (Supplementary Figure 3). The importance of the
N-peptide in blocking SNARE assembly was also examined
using point mutants of Syx1a (1–262) that do or do not
significantly affect the affinity of the N-peptide (see above
and Table I). Syx1a (T5A) and Syx1a (T10A) blocked
SNARE complex formation, whereas Syx1a (R4A) and Syx1a
(L8A) allowed formation in the presence of Munc18a
(Supplementary Figure 4), albeit with lower efficiency than
in the absence of the N-peptide, that is, using Syx1a (25–262).
As Syx1a (25–262) binds with high affinity to Munc18a, it
is surprising that this interaction does not prevent SNARE
complex assembly (Figure 4B and D; Supplementary
Figure 3). Therefore, we compared the kinetics of the
Figure 4 Removal of the N-peptide of syntaxin allows for SNARE complex formation of Munc18-bound syntaxin. (A, B) Assembly of SNARE
complexes in the absence or presence of Munc18a was monitored by the formation of SDS-resistant complexes containing synaptobrevin
(Syb1–96) labelled with the fluorescent dye Alexa-488 at Cys79. For both syntaxin 1a variants, Syx1a (1–262) and Syx1a (25–262), SNARE
complexes formed in the absence of Munc18a. In the presence of Munc18a, however, SNARE complex formation was abolished for Syx1a
(1–262) (A), whereas a clear SDS-resistant band was visible for Syx1a (25–262) (B). Note that the SDS-resistant band in the presence of
Munc18a appears to be weaker than that in the absence of Munc18a. This might be due to the fact Munc18a, which runs at the same molecular
mass as the SDS-resistant SNARE complex, interfered with the intensity of the fluorescent band. (C–E) Ternary SNARE complex formation was
followed by the increase in fluorescence anisotropy of 40 nM fluorescent Syb1-96 upon mixing with 500 nM syntaxin 1a and 750 nM SNAP-25.
Munc18a (750 nM) inhibited SNARE complex formation for Syx1a (1–262) (B), but not for Syx1a (25–262) (D) and the ‘open’ syntaxin variant
SyxLE (E). Note that for Syx1a (25–262) SNARE complex assembly occurred at about similar speed as in the absence of Munc18a.

or lacking the N-peptide. Binding of Munc18a to either
syntaxin construct is approximately 10 000 times faster than
binding of SNAP-25 to syntaxin (Supplementary Figure 1).
The dissociation of the Munc18a–Syx1a (1–262) complex is
very slow (t1/2E15 min). In good agreement with a slightly
reduced affinity for the Munc18a Syx1a (25–262) interaction,
the syntaxin 1a construct lacking the N-peptide dissociated
about six times more rapidly from Munc18a (t1/2E2.5 min,
Supplementary Figure 1). The difference in rates for Munc18
versus SNAP-25 binding to syntaxin 1a is incompatible with a
requirement for syntaxin to dissociate from Munc18a before
it can bind to SNAP-25. Rather, the data strongly suggest that
binding of SNAP-25 occurs when Munc18a is still bound to
syntaxin 1a. Given the differences in the ability of syntaxin 1a
constructs containing or lacking the N-peptide to participate
in SNARE assembly in the presence of Munc18a, it is likely
that the N-peptide influences the conformation of the
Munc18a–syntaxin 1a complex such that in its absence
syntaxin can bind to SNAP-25.
Munc18a binds tightly to, but does not block SNARE
complex assembly of, the open syntaxin 1a variant
The linker between the syntaxin Habc and H3 domains,
residues 155–185, contains a short a helix (residues 161–
170) that forms intramolecular contacts with residues in Habc
and H3 that are thought to stabilize the closed conformation
of syntaxin (Misura et al, 2000). In addition, Glu166 lies near
an electrostatically positive region of Munc18a domain 3a
(Misura et al, 2000). The double mutant L165A/E166A
(Syx1LE) was reported to abolish binding to Munc18a in
pull-down assays (Dulubova et al, 1999), although the inter￾action is detectible in yeast two-hybrid assays (Dulubova
et al, 2003). This mutation likely destabilizes the closed
conformation by removing a critical hydrophobic contact
with Habc and H3 (Misura et al, 2000). When analysed by
ITC, Syx1LE binds to Munc18a with a Kd of 8 nM (Table I) and
exhibits association and dissociation kinetics similar to those
of Syx1a (25–262) (Supplementary Figure S1). Moreover, the
LE mutant binds much more strongly than a mutant lacking
the H3 SNARE domain (Syx1a (1–179)) and with the
same enthalpy as full-length syntaxin (DH ¼ 35 kcal/mol,
Table I), implying that the H3 domain of the LE mutant does
in fact interact with Munc18a. Indeed, we detected no bind￾ing of Munc18a to the isolated H3 domain of syntaxin 1a
(Syx1a (180–262)), but addition of Syx1a (180–262) to the
Munc18a–Syx1a (1–179) complex produced a ternary com￾plex with increased stability relative to the binary interaction
with Syx1a (1–179) (Table I), implying that in the presence of
the rest of syntaxin H3 can interact with Munc18a even when
the linker is severed.
The presence of Munc18a only slightly slowed the inter￾action of Syx1aLE with its partner SNAREs, despite the
fact that this variant contains the N-peptide (Figure 4E;
Supplementary Figure 5). As found for the Syx1a (1–262)
and Syx1a (25–262) constructs, the kinetics of Syx1aLE bind￾ing to SNAP-25 (Supplementary Figure 1) are incompatible
with its dissociation from Munc18a before binding to SNAP￾25. Thus, although Syx1aLE is still tightly bound by Munc18a,
its H3 domain is accessible to SNAP-25. The magnitude of the
change in intrinsic fluorescence upon interaction with its
SNARE partners was always slightly reduced for Syx1aLE
compared with wild-type syntaxin 1a (Supplementary
Figure 1), suggesting a small conformational difference
between the wild-type and mutant syntaxins. These observa￾tions support the notion that the contacts formed by the
syntaxin linker helix both with the rest of syntaxin and with
domain 3a of Munc18a are essential for the inhibition of
SNARE assembly.
Vps45 also exhibits two modes of interaction
with a cognate syntaxin
Our findings on the Munc18a–syntaxin 1a interaction
prompted us to re-inspect the binding mode of the SM protein
Vps45 to syntaxin 16, which are believed to interact only
through the N-peptide of syntaxin 16 (Dulubova et al, 2002).
When measured by ITC, the isolated syntaxin 16 N-peptide,
Syx16 (1–27), binds to Vps45 with a Kd of 27 nM and a
binding enthalpy of 11.6 kcal/mol (Figure 5). Similar bind￾ing affinity and enthalpy were seen when a larger fragment of
syntaxin 16 that includes the Habc domain, Syx16 (1–183),
was used (Table I). However, the entire cytosolic region of
syntaxin 16, Syx16 (1–302), shows a markedly higher affinity
(KdE1 nM) and binding enthalpy (DH ¼ 23.8 kcal/mol,
Figure 5). In contrast to the situation in Syx1a–Munc18a,
however, no binding of syntaxin 16 lacking the N-peptide,
Syx16 (28–302), was detectable. Thus, it appears that both
the N-peptide and the remaining portion of syntaxin 16
mediate high-affinity binding to Vps45, but with different
energetic contributions relative to syntaxin 1a binding to
Munc18a.
Interestingly, when we introduced a point mutation F10A
in the N-peptide of the full syntaxin 16 cytosolic region
(Syx16 (1–302)), which had previously described to largely
abolish binding (Dulubova et al, 2002), we detected binding
at reduced affinity (KdE117 nM, Table I). However, when the
same mutation was introduced into the isolated syntaxin 16
N-peptide, Syx16 (1–27, F10A), no binding was detectable.
Thus, as in the Munc18a–syntaxin 1a complex, the N-peptide
and the remaining portion of syntaxin 16 cooperate for high￾affinity binding to Vps45. To test whether syntaxin 16 adopts
a similar conformation as syntaxin 1a in the complex with the

Shown are the integrated areas normalized to the amount of
syntaxin 16 (kcal/mol) versus its molar ratio to Vps45. The solid
lines represent the best fit to the data for a single-binding-site model

of syntaxin 16 lacking part of the SNARE domain. Syx16
(1–279), which corresponds to Syx1a (1–240), bound with
1 nM affinity to Vps45. However, a shorter fragment, Syx16
(1–265), which corresponds to Syx1a (1–226), interacted
with a reduced affinity of 12 nM. This indicates an interaction
between the C-terminal portion of the syntaxin 16 SNARE
domain and Vps45 equivalent to that of syntaxin 1a with the
central cavity of Munc18a. The simplest interpretation of
these data is that syntaxin 16 can form a closed conformation
that binds to Vps45 similarly to the interaction of syntaxin 1a
with Munc18a.
Discussion
The interaction of SM proteins with the SNARE machinery is
known to be essential for the fusion of transport vesicles with
their target organelle. The two mechanistically distinct modes
of interaction of SM proteins with their cognate syntaxins
described so far have been thought to represent different
functions of these proteins. Binding of an SM protein to the
N-peptide of a syntaxin has been proposed to facilitate
SNARE complex formation (Bracher and Weissenhorn,
2002; Dulubova et al, 2002; Peng and Gallwitz, 2002, 2004;
Carpp et al, 2006; Latham et al, 2006), but no direct evidence
or a well-defined mechanism for this role have been de￾scribed. In contrast, binding to the closed conformation of
syntaxin 1a by Munc18a prevents syntaxin from engaging its
partner SNAREs (Pevsner et al, 1994; Dulubova et al, 1999;
Misura et al, 2000; Yang et al, 2000). Recently, it was shown
that Munc18a can also bind to an assembled SNARE com￾plex, and this requires the syntaxin 1a N-peptide (Dulubova
et al, 2007; Shen et al, 2007). It was therefore proposed that
binding to the SNARE complex reflects a function common to
all SM proteins, whereas binding to the closed conformation
reflects a specific function of the neuronal syntaxin-SM pair.
However, this notion does not reconcile the well-known
inhibitory role of Munc18a on SNARE assembly (Pevsner
et al, 1994; Dulubova et al, 1999; Misura et al, 2000; Yang
et al, 2000) with its essential role in neurosecretion (for
review, see Burgoyne and Morgan, 2007; Toonen and
Verhage, 2007).
We have shown here that the high-affinity (KdE1 nM)
binary interaction of Munc18a and syntaxin 1a involves
contacts with both the N-peptide and the closed conforma￾tion of syntaxin 1a, consistent with other recent reports
(Khvotchev et al, 2007; Rickman et al, 2007). Remarkably,
removal of the syntaxin N-peptide only slightly lowers the
affinity, but completely relieves the inhibition exerted by
Munc18a on the accessibility of the bound syntaxin for its
SNARE partners. Thus, Munc18a-bound syntaxin is only able
to form a SNARE complex when the N-peptide is released
from Munc18a, contrary to the proposal that Munc18a stays
bound to the N-peptide of syntaxin when the remainder of the
molecule assembles into a SNARE complex (Khvotchev et al,
2007). If binding to the assembled SNARE complex is an
essential function of Munc18a, then our finding that the
N-peptide and Habc domains are required for this interaction
implies that the N-peptide must rebind sometime after
syntaxin interacts with SNAP-25.
Recently, the binary Munc18a–syntaxin 1a interaction was
shown to be essential for vesicular docking, whereas an
interaction between Munc18a and syntaxin not requiring
the closed syntaxin conformation appears to be essential for
downstream priming reactions (Gulyas-Kovacs et al, 2007).
However, the mechanistic roles of these two modes of inter￾action and the transformation between them remain unclear.
A reasonable model is that when the syntaxin N-peptide is
bound, Munc18a prevents inappropriate SNARE complex
assembly. Interaction of the Munc18–syntaxin complex with
upstream docking factors required for coordinating vesicle
tethering with SNARE assembly or priming would control the
binding status of the syntaxin N-peptide, insuring that pro￾ductive trans pairing of SNAREs occurs at the correct location
and time. This model implies that binding of Munc18a to the
closed conformation and to the N-peptide of syntaxin 1a do
not represent functionally distinct modes (Dulubova et al,
2007; Khvotchev et al, 2007; Shen et al, 2007), but are rather
two aspects of the same function.
A plausible mechanism for the role of the syntaxin
N-peptide is that binding of the N-peptide to the outer face
of Munc18a stabilizes the interaction between the syntaxin
H3 domain and the arch formed by Munc18a domains 1 and
3a. Comparison of the Munc18a–syntaxin 1a complex struc￾ture presented here with structures of unbound squid
Munc18a reveals differences in the relative positions of
domain 1 as well as differences in domain 3a (Bracher and
Weissenhorn, 2001). In particular, the portion of domain 3a
that lies near the syntaxin Habc-H3 linker, as well as other
portions of syntaxin, is disordered in the absence of syntaxin.
The N-peptide and H3-binding sites are linked by a chain of
polar interactions that runs through the Munc18a domain 1–2
interface, so it appears that the two binding sites are coupled
through this portion of Munc18a. The observation that the
‘open’ Syx1aLE mutant containing the N-peptide binds tightly
to Munc18a, but allows SNARE complex formation, is con￾sistent with such coupling. Removing the interactions of the
Habc-H3 linker helix with syntaxin H3 and Munc18a domain
3a likely alters the conformation of the complex in a manner
similar to that produced by removal of the N-peptide, thereby
allowing SNAP-25 binding even when the N-peptide is bound
to Munc18a. Structural studies aimed at understanding the
allosteric regulation of H3 binding by the N-peptide are
underway.
Our model also explains previously incoherent genetic and
biochemical findings on Syx1aLE. First, in Caenorhabditis
elegans Syx1aLE has been shown to rescue a syntaxin null
mutant. Although Syx1aLE can bypass the requirement of
Unc13 (Richmond et al, 2001; Hammarlund et al, 2007) and
Rim (Koushika et al, 2001), factors that function in vesicle
priming, it is unable to bypass Unc18 (Weimer et al, 2003),
the C. elegans homologue of Munc18. The latter finding was
unexpected as an already open form of syntaxin was antici￾pated not to require the action of Munc18. The cooperative
binding mode described here suggests that Munc18a operates
as a switch that first locks syntaxin 1a, thereby controlling its
accessibility (N-peptide bound), while in the next step assists
syntaxin 1a in forming a SNARE complex (N-peptide re￾leased). Hence, like wild-type syntaxin 1a, the open syntaxin
variant must pass through the interaction with Munc18a,
which serves as an essential template for binding to syntaxin.
Second, the original experiments that reported no binding
between Munc18a and Syx1aLE used brain homogenate as
the source of Munc18a (Dulubova et al, 1999). The strong
Munc18a controls SNARE assembly
P Burkhardt et al
930 The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 &2008 European Molecular Biology OrganizationMunc18a-Syx1aLE interaction may not have been observed in
this case, because brain homogenate also contains the
SNARE partners of syntaxin 1a, which could form the
SNARE complex with Syx1LE in the presence of Munc18a.
In fact, Syx1aLE mostly coprecipitated SNAP-25 and synapto￾brevin, and the authors found an increased amount of com￾plexin (Dulubova et al, 1999), which is a soluble protein that
only binds to an assembled ternary SNARE complex (Pabst
et al, 2002).
Our data support the idea that SNAP-25, possibly together
with synaptobrevin, can directly bind to Munc18a-bound
syntaxin 1a to form an intermediate in the SNARE complex
assembly pathway. A similar notion has recently been sug￾gested for Munc18a based on experiments using exocytosis￾competent lawns of plasma membrane (Zilly et al, 2006).
This putative assembly must be weak or transient, as we were
unable to isolate it by size-exclusion chromatography. In vivo,
however, a tripartite complex of Munc18a, syntaxin 1a, and
SNAP-25 might be stabilized by additional factors. The con￾figuration of this assembly, however, is probably different
from that of Munc18a bound to the assembled neuronal
SNARE complex (Dulubova et al, 2007; Shen et al, 2007).
The physiological role of the low-affinity (KdE0.7 mM)
Munc18a-SNARE complex interaction remains unclear.
Although we have confirmed the interaction of Munc18a
with the assembled SNARE complex (Dulubova et al, 2007;
Shen et al, 2007), the data indicate that Munc18a binds to the
N-peptide and Habc domain of syntaxin 1a in the SNARE
complex, but not to the four-helix bundle formed by the
interacting SNAREs. Although this explains why Munc18a
can bind to syntaxin as part of the SNARE complex, it does
not explain how this interaction is related to SNARE complex
formation or membrane fusion. One study suggested that
Munc18a participates in the establishment of the membrane
fusion pore (Fisher et al, 2001), a step that is thought to occur
after complete zipping of the SNARE complex, but this
finding has been questioned (Gulyas-Kovacs et al, 2007).
Most in vivo studies indicate a role for Munc18a in docking
of the neurotransmitter-loaded vesicle and in priming of the
secretory machinery. In these processes, Munc18 appears to
operate in conjunction with syntaxin 1a, but not with the
vesicular SNARE synaptobrevin (Toonen and Verhage, 2007),
suggesting that the role of Munc18 is to control syntaxin and
to assist its assembly with its SNARE partners, as discussed
above. On the other hand, it has been shown that Munc18a
stimulates SNARE-mediated liposome fusion (Shen et al,
2007), although the accelerating effect was far smaller than
that observed in fusion experiments in which a stabilized
t-SNARE acceptor site, in a ratio of 1:1, was used (Pobbati
et al, 2006). It should also be noted that the accelerating effect
of Munc18a was only observed when the SM protein was
preincubated for several hours at 41C with t-SNARE and
v-SNARE liposomes. It thus cannot be excluded that
Munc18a mostly affected the status of the t-SNARE, which
in these experiments might have mostly resided in fusion￾incompetent syntaxin-SNAP-25 complexes exhibiting a 2:1
stoichiometry.
We have shown here that high-affinity binding of another
SM–syntaxin pair (Vps45–syntaxin 16), also requires two
binding sites, the N-peptide and the remainder of the syntaxin
molecule, the latter probably in a closed conformation. This
suggests that an interaction involving two spatially distinct
binding sites may occur in other SM–syntaxin pairs. Indeed,
point mutations in the SM protein Sly1 or in the N-peptide of
Sed5 that interfere with N-peptide binding are still functional
in vivo (Peng and Gallwitz, 2004), suggesting that additional
regions of Sed5 are involved in the interaction. Comparable
results have been obtained for the interaction of Vps45 and
Tlg2 (Carpp et al, 2006). Likewise, syntaxin 4 appears to
employ other regions than its N-peptide for the interaction
with Munc18c (Latham et al, 2006; D’Andrea-Merrins et al,
2007), consistent with the notion of multiple binding sites.
The data presented here indicate that the relative energetic
contribution of each binding site is different for each
SM–syntaxin pair. It is important to note that deletions of
the N-peptide due to cloning artefacts or unexpected throm￾bin cleavage, or the addition of N-terminal residues from an
affinity tag, can ablate the N-peptide interactions, which
might explain some conflicting observations in the literature
(Supplementary Figure 2). Further experiments will be
needed to assess whether binding of the N-peptide also serves
to control SNARE assembly in other SM–syntaxin pairs.
Materials and methods
Protein constructs
All proteins were derived from rat (Rattus norvegicus) and were
cloned, if not indicated otherwise, into a pET28a vector that
contains an N-terminal, thrombin-cleavable His6-tag. The basic
bacterial expression constructs for SNARE proteins, such as
cysteine-free SNAP-25A (1–206), the soluble portion of syntaxin
1a, Syx1a (1–262), the H3-domain of syntaxin 1a, Syx1a (180–262),
and the soluble portion of synaptobrevin 2 (Syb1–96), have been
described before. Likewise, the single-cysteine SNARE protein
variants used for labelling with a fluorescent dye, for example
SNAP-25 Cys130, Syb2 Cys79, and Syx1a (1–262) Cys 197, have
been published (Fasshauer et al, 1999; Margittai et al, 2001;
Fasshauer and Margittai, 2004). Full-length Munc18a, Vps45, and
several truncated syntaxin 1a variants were constructed: Syx1a
(1–240); Syx1a (1–226); Syx1a (1–179); Syx1a (25–206). In addition,
syntaxin 1a constructs (aa 1–262) containing the point mutations
I233A (Syx1a (I233A)), L165A and E166A (Syx1aLE), R4A (Syx1a
(R4A)), T5A (Syx1a (T5A)), L8A (Syx1a (L8A)), T10A (Syx1a
(T10A)), and S14A (Syx1a (S14A)) were generated. For Syx1aLE and
Syx1a (25–206), cysteine variants at position 197 were constructed.
Furthermore, the following syntaxin 16 constructs were used: Syx16
(1–302), Syx16 (1–279), Syx16 (1–265), Syx16 (1–183), Syx16 (28–
302), and Syx16 containing the point mutation F10A, Syx16 (1–302,
F10A). In addition, the following syntaxin 1a constructs with other
affinity tags were used: Syx1a (1–267) in the pQE9 vector encoding
a protein with an N-terminal, uncleavable His6-tag (Misura et al,
2000); Syx1a (1–265) in a modified pET11 vector (pHO4c) with a
short, uncleavable C-terminal His6-tag (Fasshauer et al, 1999);
Syx1a (1–267) in a modified pGEX-KG vector with a TEV-protease
cleavable GST tag; Syx1a (1–266) in the pTwin1 vector with an
intein-mediated self-cleaving chitin-binding domain affinity tag
(an overview is given in Supplementary Figure 2).
Protein purification
Recombinant proteins were purified by Ni2 þ -NTA or glutathione￾affinity chromatography followed by ion-exchange chromatography
essentially as described by Fasshauer et al (1999). SNARE
complexes consisting of Syx1a (1–262 or 25–262), SNAP-25, and
Syb2 (1–96) were assembled from purified components and purified
by ion-exchange chromatography. His6-tags were generally re￾moved using thrombin, but thrombin was omitted during the
purification of syntaxin 1a constructs and SNARE complexes
containing syntaxin 1a, as we found that thrombin also removes
the first nine N-terminal residues of syntaxin 1a (see Supplementary
Figure 3). Peptides comprising the N-peptide of syntaxin 1a, Syx1a
(1–20), syntaxin 16, (Syx16 (1–27), and with the point mutation
F10A, Syx16 (1–27, F10A), were synthesized.

&2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 931For analysis of the effects of non-native residues at the N
terminus of syntaxin on the Munc18–syntaxin interaction, syntaxin
1–266 with no extra residues was purified using the pTwin1-syn1a
(1–266) construct. Protein was purified from Escherichia coli by
chitin-affinity chromatography, and the affinity tag was removed by
addition of 40 mM DTT. The cleaved syntaxin was aggregated, and
was therefore denatured in 8 M urea and refolded into 20 mM Tris
pH 8, 500 mM NaCl. In addition, a syntaxin variant with the
sequence GGIL at the N-terminus was purified using the pGEX-TEV
syntaxin (1–267) construct. Here, protein was purified from E. coli by
glutathione affinity column, and the GST tag was removed with TEV
protease. In each case, the final purification step was anion-exchange
chromatography using a HiTrapQ column (GE Healthcare).
Isothermal titration calorimetry
ITC was performed on a VP-ITC instrument (Microcal) at 251C.
Samples were dialysed against degassed PBS buffer (20 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) or Tris buffer (20 mM
Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA). Titrations were
usually carried out by 20 ml, 15 ml, or 10 ml injections. The measured
heat released on binding was integrated and analysed with Microcal
Origin 7.0 using a single-site binding model, yielding the
equilibrium association constant Ka, the enthalpy of binding DH,
and the stoichiometry n.
Fluorescence spectroscopy
All measurements were carried out in a Fluorolog 3 spectrometer in
T-configuration equipped for polarization (Model FL322, Horiba
Jobin Yvon). Single-cysteine variants were labelled with Texas Red
C5 bromoacetamide, Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide, or Alexa
488 C5 maleimide according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Invitrogen). All experiments were performed at 251C in 1-cm
quartz cuvettes (Hellma) in PBS buffer. Measurements of fluores￾cence anisotropy, which reports the local flexibility of the labelled
residue and which increases upon complex formation, were carried
essentially as described (Fasshauer and Margittai, 2004; Pobbati
et al, 2006). The G factor was calculated according to G ¼ IHV/IHH,
where I is the fluorescence intensity, and the first subscript letter
indicates the direction of the exciting light and the second subscript
letter the direction of emitted light. The intensities of the vertically
(V) and horizontally (H) polarized emission light after excitation by
vertically polarized light were measured. The anisotropy (r) was
determined according to r ¼ (IVV–G IVH)/(IVVþ 2 G IVH). Intrinsic
fluorescence measurements were performed at an excitation
wavelength of 295 nm. Emission spectra were recorded in the
range of 305–450 nm. All spectra were corrected for background
fluorescence from buffer. The association of Munc18a and syntaxin
1a was measured using the Stopped-flow Device F-3009 (Horiba
Jobin Yvon). The data were analysed using the Pro-KII software
(Applied Photophysics).
Structure refinement
Prior to manual rebuilding of the structure of the Munc18a–
syntaxin1a complex, the published coordinates (1DN1.pdb) were
refined against the deposited structure factors by simulated
annealing, coordinate minimization, and isotropic atomic tempera￾ture factor refinement in CNS version 1.2 (Brunger et al, 1998). In
the resulting electron density maps, there was a large region of
unmodelled electron density at the predicted binding site for the
syntaxin N-peptide. Next, refinement was performed with phenix.-
refine version 2007_08_18_1856 (in the CCI Apps distribution).
Each round of refinement with phenix used three macrocycles of
coordinate minimization, TLS refinement using five TLS groups
(corresponding to the subdomains of Munc18a and syntaxin), and
isotropic atomic temperature factor refinement. The wxc_scale
parameter was set to 0.1. The improved electron density maps
allowed for building of residues 2–9 of the syntaxin N-peptide using
O (Jones and Kjeldgaard, 1997) and Coot (Emsley and Cowtan,
2004). In addition, a number of minor errors in the deposited
structure, including outliers in the Ramachandran plot and
disallowed rotamers, were corrected. Thirty-five water molecules
were also added. The re-refinement resulted in decreases in the
Rwork and Rfree of 3.6 and 3.1%, respectively. As judged by
Molprobity, the overall geometry of the re-refined structure is
greatly improved (score of 98th percentile, versus 54th percentile
for the starting model). Crystallographic figures were generated
with Pymol (DeLano, 2002).
Electrophoretic procedures
SDS resistance of ternary SNARE complexes in polyacrylamide gels
(Hayashi et al, 1994) was tested as described by Fasshauer et al
(1999) with the modification that the complexes were visualized by
the incorporation of synaptobrevin 2 labelled with the fluorescent
dye Alexa-488 at cysteine 79.
Protein Data Bank accession code
Coordinates and structure factors of the newly refined crystal
structure of the Munc18a-syntaxin 1a complex have been deposited
