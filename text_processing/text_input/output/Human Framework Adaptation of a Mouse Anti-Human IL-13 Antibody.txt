Humanization of a potent neutralizing mouse anti-human IL-13 antibody
(m836) using a method called human framework adaptation (HFA) is
reported. HFA consists of two steps: human framework selection (HFS) and
specificity-determining residue optimization (SDRO). The HFS step
involved generation of a library of m836 antigen binding sites combined
with diverse human germline framework regions (FRs), which were
selected based on structural and sequence similarities between mouse
variable domains and a repertoire of human antibody germline genes.
SDRO consisted of diversifying specificity-determining residues and
selecting variants with improved affinity using phage display. HFS of
m836 resulted in a 5-fold loss of affinity, whereas SDRO increased the
affinity up to 100-fold compared to the HFS antibody. Crystal structures of
Fabs in complex with IL-13 were obtained for m836, the HFS variant chosen
for SDRO, and one of the highest-affinity SDRO variants. Analysis of the
structures revealed that major conformational changes in FR-H1 and FR-H3
occurred after FR replacement, but none of them had an evident direct
impact on residues in contact with IL-13. Instead, subtle changes affected
the VL/VH (variable-light domain/variable-heavy domain) interface and
were likely responsible for the 5-fold decreased affinity. After SDRO,
increased affinity resulted mainly from rearrangements in hydrogen￾bonding pattern at the antibody/antigen interface. Comparison with
m836 putative germline genes suggested interesting analogies between
natural affinity maturation and the engineering process that led to the
potent HFA anti-human IL-13 antibody.

Humanization has played a fundamental role in
the approval of antibody-based drugs by the Food
and Drug Administration.1 The goal of a humaniza￾tion protocol is to produce molecules with minimal
immunogenicity when applied to humans while
retaining the specificity and potency of the parental
nonhuman antibody. The first step toward making
nonhuman antibodies more human-like was
chimerization.2 It consisted of combining the vari￾able domains of nonhuman antibodies with human
constant domains to generate molecules with ∼70%
human content. Chimeric antibodies successfully
retained parental antibody specificity, but still
elicited a human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA)
response. The incidence and effect of such a response
varied depending on the antibody and indication or
patient population.3,4 For instance, rituximab did not
induce a HACA response when administered for the
treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,5 whereas
abciximab indicated for percutaneous coronary
intervention induced a HACA response in 19.0% of
patients after readministration.6
In a further attempt to minimize immunogenicity,
Jones et al. envisioned complementarity-determin￾ing region (CDR) grafting.7 It was first applied to
humanize an antibody with therapeutic value in the
treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia,8
currently marketed as Campath® (generic name:
alemtuzumab).9 In subsequent work, Queen et al.10
humanized the first antibody approved by the Food
and Drug Administration for therapeutic use in the
United States, termed daclizumab, now with well￾established indication for organ transplantation.11
Daclizumab was generated by identifying the
human framework regions (FRs) with the highest
level of homology to the mouse antibody sequence.
Mouse CDRs were then grafted onto human FRs
together with a set of key mouse amino acids
outside the CDRs identified as interacting with the
CDRs or the antigen (i.e., backmutations).10 This
improvement to the original CDR grafting method
led to a molecule that retained one-third the affinity
of the parental nonhuman antibody.
After these pioneering works, a large number of
CDR-grafted antibodies have been reported, with
concomitant affinity losses.12 Thus, when starting a
humanization project, one should be aware that any
mutation introduced in the variable region could, in
principle, affect antibody conformation and hence
antigen binding. For instance, Foote and Winter
identified a set of residues referred to as the “Vernier
Zone,” which modulates the conformation and
positioning of CDRs and consequently impacts
affinity.13 Residues involved in the VL/VH (vari￾able-light domain/variable-heavy domain) interface
have also been found to play an important role in
affinity modulation.14 Furthermore, Wedemayer
et al. have shown that the affinity of an anti-hapten
antibody could be increased by more than 4 orders
of magnitude through mutations located 10 Å away
from the hapten binding site.15 Similar findings have
more recently been reported for anti-protein
antibodies.16 Therefore, several rounds of design
and testing might be needed to determine the
minimum number of backmutations required for
restoring or improving the affinity of the humanized
antibody. This process is termed design cycle.1
To simplify the design cycle, Dall'Acqua et al.
developed a humanization method based on the
generation of a library of humanized antibody
variants by combining nonhuman CDRs with a
repertoire of mixed human germline FRs, followed
by selection of variants with improved binding
profiles.17 For this method, called FR shuffling,
there is no need to design backmutations. Instead,
it allows for the selection of the most favorable
combinations of FRs in terms of maintaining parental
antibody binding. Because a large number of human
FRs are mixed and matched, a large combinatorial
space can be sampled, significantly increasing the
expected success rate of this strategy. The method
was applied to humanize an antibody with a
potential indication for cancer therapy.17 Still, the
best variants had an affinity 5-fold to 8-fold lower
than that of the parental antibody.17 Therefore,
depending on the indication of the antibody-based
drug, affinity may need to be restored or in some
cases improved beyond that of the parental antibody.
Affinity maturation is typically accomplished by a
display technology that allows the selection of
variants from large combinatorial libraries (e.g.,
phage,18 ribosome,19 or yeast display20). The most
critical step of the in vitro affinity optimization is the
diversification scheme, of which there are two schools
of thought. Diversity is either introduced randomly
across the variable gene21,22 or targeted to specific
regions of the antibody such as CDRs, with amino
acids in critical positions left invariant (determined
by, e.g., alanine scanning mutagenesis).23 The inher￾ent properties of ribosome display (i.e., PCR ampli￾fication between selection rounds) make it well suited
for the former, whereas the latter is typically applied
to phage and yeast display. As the need for very￾high-affinity antibodies is becoming commonplace in
therapeutic programs, combinations of different
display systems with both random and targeted
mutagenesis schemes have been implemented to
meet such goals.24,25
IL-13 is a member of the short-chain four-helix￾bundle family of growth-hormone-like cytokines.26
It has been shown to be a significant risk factor for
asthma development,27,28 and treatment with an IL￾13 neutralizing antibody in a mouse model inhibited
asthmatic response in stimulated animals.29 We
recently reported a potent anti-IL-13 neutralizing
antibody obtained by phage display.30 Here we
describe the humanization of a mouse anti-human
IL-13 antibody (m836) using a method called human
framework adaptation (HFA). The HFA method
consisted of two steps: (i) human germline FR
selection [human framework selection (HFS)], fol￾lowed by (ii) affinity improvement of HFS variants
by specificity-determining residue optimization
(SDRO). In the first step, a relatively small library

loops, and HFA regions used to generate the HFS library are shown on top of the alignment. Numbering and gaps follow the conventions of Chothia and Lesk.36 The second
column indicates the name of the human IGKV/IGKJ germline genes used as FR donors, as reported in the ImMunoGeneTics database.34,35
216 Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 AntibodyFig. 2. Alignment of parental VH m836, its putative mouse IGHV germline gene, and VH HFS library variants. Numbering and nomenclature are similar to those used in Fig. 1.
The second column refers to germline gene usage. For mGL, the putative IGHV/IGHD/IGHJ is given. For the VH HFS library variants, only IGHV/IGHJ is given. Note that one
variant (H4) was designed using Kabat's definition in CDR-H1.
217 Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 Antibodyof HFS variants was generated by combining the
binding site of m836 with human germline genes
selected based on sequence and structural consid￾erations. In the second step, residues proposed to be
involved in the interaction with antigen31 were
diversified in one of the best HFS variants, and
clones with improved affinity were selected using
phage display. To gain insight into the consequences
of adapting the m836 binding site to human FRs and
improving affinity by specificity-determining resi￾due variation, we solved the Fab crystal structures
of m836, the HFS variant chosen for SDRO, and one
of the best SDRO molecules in complex with IL-13.
Detailed analysis of the structures revealed that both
global and local changes affected the interaction
with IL-13 after HFS and SDRO.
Results and Discussion
m836 and its interaction with human IL-13
m836 was obtained by hybridoma technology,32
immunizing Balb/c mice with a natural variant of
human IL-13 known as R130Q.33 It should be noted
that this numbering refers to the full sequence as in
Swiss-Prot entry IL13_HUMAN prior to January
2010; now it should be R144Q when including the
signal peptide or R111Q of the mature sequence,
which is adopted throughout this work. The
putative germline genes of m836 were determined
by V-Quest at the international ImMunoGeneTics
information system®‡34,35 (see top of Figs. 1 and 2
for m836 VL and VH amino acid sequences,
respectively). The IGKV and IGKJ germline genes
closest to m836 VL were IGKV12-104*01 and
IGKJ2*01, with only two mutations: one in FR-L1
(Ile21Leu) and another in FR-L3 (Tyr87Phe). IGHV8-
8*01 was identified as the IGHV germline gene
precursor of m836 VH. It differed from m836 by
eight amino acid residues: four located in CDRs
(Kabat's definition)37 (Phe31aTyr in CDR-H1,
Asp56Val and Tyr58Arg in CDR-H2, and Ile95Met
in CDR-H3 and the remaining four located in FR3
(Lys75Gly, Asn76Ser, Asn80bSer, and Ala85Ser).
The IGHD and IGHJ genes closest to m836 VH were
IGHD2-4*01 and IGHJ3*01, respectively, with no
somatic mutations.
To gain insight into the interaction of m836 with
IL-13, we determined the structure of the chimeric
ch836 Fab (m836 variable domains and human
IgG1/κ constant domains) in complex with wild￾type (wt) IL-13 at 2.0 Å resolution (Table 1) and
deposited it in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (PDB
code 3L5W). The antibody/antigen interface covers
620 Å2 on each of the interacting molecules.
Residues at the structural epitope and paratope, as
defined by a 4-Å cutoff interatomic distance, are
shown in Fig. 3. The epitope (Fig. 3a) includes eight

218 Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 Antibodyresidues: three from helix A (Arg11, Ile14, and
Glu15) and five from helix D (Leu101, Lys104,
Phe107, Arg108, and Glu109). Arg11 and Arg108
seem to be key epitope residues, since they
participate in numerous interactions with ch836.
Arg11 stacks with the VL residue Tyr32 and forms
hydrogen bonds with the VH residue Asp100 and
the VL residue His91. Arg108 is positioned with its
aliphatic side chain against VH Trp52, and with the
guanidinium group opposite Asp54 at VH as well.
Comparison with another IL-13 neutralizing anti￾body recently published by our group,30 CNTO607,
indicates that five of the eight residues defining
ch836 epitope overlap with residues in contact with
CNTO607, thus suggesting a similar mechanism of
IL-13 receptor inhibition (Teplyakov et al., manu￾script in preparation).
The ch836 paratope (Fig. 3b) is defined by 12
residues located in all CDRs, except for CDR-L2. VH
has the predominant role in the interaction, with
nine residues contacting IL-13 (Tyr31a, Trp52,
Trp53, Asp54, Val56, Arg58, Asp98, Tyr99, and
Asp100). VL has three contact residues (Tyr32,
His91, and Asn92). The key anchor residue is
Tyr32, which stacks against Arg11 and forms a
hydrogen bond with Glu15 of IL-13. Comparison
with antibodies of known structure indicates that

Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 Antibody 219follows one of the established canonical structure
types,39 namely, types 2, 1, and 1 in CDR-L1, CDR￾L2, and CDR-L3, respectively, and types 3 and 1 in
CDR-H1 and CDR-H2, respectively.
To visualize the positions of putative somatic
hypermutations that lead to the in vivo maturation of
m836, we show the antibody/antigen complex in
Fig. 4. Three out of four mutated positions in CDRs
contact IL-13 (Tyr31a, Val56, and Arg58). The
Ile95Met residue in CDR-H3 is buried and thus
does not contact the antigen. As part of the
characterization of the m836 antibody interaction
with IL-13, we performed an alanine scan40 of the
residues in CDRs. Alanine replacements of any of
the three somatic mutations in contact residues
resulted in a dramatic loss of binding. This
suggested that mutations in these residues had a
contribution to the in vivo affinity maturation of
m836. Moreover, two of the four somatic mutations
in FR-H3 (Gly75 and Ser76) are residues adjacent to
the binding site in a loop known to have high
variability values,41,42 which we will refer to as
Fig. 4. IL-13/ch836 complex. Side chains of the residues identified as putative somatic mutations (Figs. 1 and 2) are
indicated in red and labeled accordingly.
220 Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 AntibodyCDR-H4. It has been shown that mutations at these
residues can modulate the affinity of antibodies.43
Thus, somatic mutations in CDR-H4 could also have
contributed to the in vivo affinity maturation of
m836.
HFS and its impact on IL-13 interaction
The first step in the HFA strategy was to generate
a library of human FR variants by combining
Kabat's CDRs and Chothia's hypervariable regions
of m836 (defined in Figs. 1 and 2) with diverse
human germline genes (HFS library). The HFS
library included 6 VH chains (H1–H6) and 15 VL
chains (L1–L15), designed based on sequence and
structural similarities with the variable regions of
m836. Three human FRs were selected from the VH2
germline gene family, two human FRs were selected
from the VH4 family, and one human FR was
selected from the VH3 family. For FR4, human IGHJ￾1 was chosen. The VL library was built by combining
11 genes from the Vk1 gene family and 2 genes each
from the Vk2 and Vk3 families with IGHJ-1, IGHJ-2,
IGHJ-4, and IGHJ-5 genes.
All 90 HFS variants were produced in IgG1 format
by transfection of each HFS VL variant paired with
each HFS VH variant. The resulting library was
initially screened using direct binding to biotiny￾lated IL-13R111Q (b-IL-13R111Q) in solution and
the ability to inhibit IL-13R111Q from binding to IL￾13 receptor α2 (IL-13Rα2) (Fig. 5). Both assays
showed similar results, although the receptor
inhibition assay allowed better discernment of
differences among the VL and VH combinations.
The H2 variant exhibited the best binding profile in
both assays combined with all VL chains, except for
L7, L9, L12, and L13. The promiscuity of VL usage is
consistent with the predominant role of m836 VH in
the interaction with IL-13.
To further characterize the interaction of HFS
variants with wt IL-13, we evaluated five VL chains
combined with H2 (H2L2, H2L3, H2L6, H2L8, and
H2L14) by BIAcore (Table 2). In addition, two VL
variants with H1—one positive in inhibition assays
(H1L3) and one negative in both assays (H1L7)—
were tested. The affinity of the parent m836
antibody and the chimeric ch836 antibody was
also determined. m836 and ch836 had the same
Fig. 5. HFS library screening. VL and VH regions of the HFS library (Figs. 1 and 2) were cloned into mAb vectors for
matrix transfection and production of intact IgG1 antibodies. A total of 90 clones were tested for binding (left) and
receptor inhibition (right) by ELISA. The performance of each mAb was ranked, and the color scheme indicates activity in
the two assays, with green being most active, black being average, and red being the least active.

from binding and inhibition assays (Fig. 5), H2
combinations showed similar Kd values (250–
370 pM). H1L3 exhibited a 2-fold affinity loss
(530 pM) with respect to the H2 variant having the
same VL. H1L7 expected to yield poor binding
indeed showed a 2000-fold loss in affinity when
compared to m836.
Human FRs used to build H1 and H2 (Fig. 2)
belong to the same VH germline gene family
(IGHV-2). These two genes only differ by four
amino acids in the FRs: three in FR1 (positions 10, 16,
and 24) and one in FR3 (position 76). Mutations in
positions 10 and 16 are distant from the IL-13
binding site, whereas the residues at positions 24
and 76 are in close proximity to the CDRs. m836 and
H1 have a Phe in position 24, whereas H2 has a Val.
In the structure of ch836 with IL-13, the side chain of
Phe24 packs against Leu29, the anchor residue of the
canonical structure at CDR-H1.39 The mutation in
position 76 is located in CDR-H4, which contacts
CDR-H1. Thus, amino acid replacements at posi￾tions 24 and 76 may account for the 2-fold difference
in affinity between the HFS H1 and H2 variants.
Remarkably, H4, H5, and H6 variants have a
substitution at residue 71. In m836, this position
has a Lys, which is retained in H1, H2, and H3,
whereas it is replaced with Val in H4 and H5, and
with Arg in H6. Position 71 is known to influence the
canonical structure of CDR-H2.44,45 Thus, a change
in this position could have contributed to loss of
binding in combinations with H4, H5, and H6.
Structural changes upon HFS
To gain insight into how the FR replacement
affected m836 interaction with wt IL-13, we solved
the structure of the H2L6 Fab/IL-13 complex at
1.9 Å resolution (Table 1). Comparison with the
crystal structure of ch836 in complex with IL-13

Comparison of the CDR-H4 regions between ch836 (blue) and H2L6 (orange). (c) Comparison of the FR-H1 kink regions
between ch836 (blue) and H2L6 (orange). The supposition and figures were generated with Discovery Studio (Accelrys).
222 Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 Antibodyindicated that the epitope was preserved after HFS.
The local conformation of the CDRs was also
preserved (Fig. 6a). Only two major conformational
changes in VH were observed: one is at CDR-H4 (Fig.
6b), and the other is around Pro9 in FR-H1 (Fig. 6c).
In both regions, the main-chain shift exceeds 5 Å.
The likely cause of the rearrangement in CDR-H4
is the substitution of Lys for Gly in position 75. The
Lys75 residue was introduced during HFS, and all
HFS variants had a Lys in this position. As
mentioned above, the mouse germline gene also
had a Lys at position 75 that mutated to a Gly during
somatic maturation of m836 (Fig. 2). Although CDR￾H4 packs against CDR-H1 in ch836, only immediate
neighbors, namely, residues 24 and 29, were affected
by HFS. The residue Tyr31a in CDR-H1, which is in
contact with IL-13, has not changed its conformation
(Fig. 6b). Thus, the conformational change at CDR￾H4 does not seem to have a direct impact on the
5-fold drop in affinity after HFS.
The change around Pro9 is located in a kink at the
N-terminal β-strand of FR-H1, so that it can form
β-bridges to both β-sheets of the VH domain. Gly10
adopts a conformation with positive φ that would be
unfavorable for any other amino acid. Substitution of
Val for Gly10 leads to the flip of the backbone, with
some β-bridges lost and some new β-bridges formed
(Fig. 6c). The rearrangement involves only residues
Gly8-Pro9-Gly10 at the kink, while the surrounding
residues retain their positions. The conformational
changes in FR-H1 are distal from the antigen binding
site and involve only a few residues. Therefore,
neither the conformational change at CDR-H4 nor
the conformational change at the FR-H1 kink region
apparently affected the binding of IL-13.
Further analysis of the structures indicated a
rotation of the aromatic ring of Tyr87 in H2L6
with respect to Phe87 in ch836 (Fig. 7). The hydroxyl
group of Tyr87 finds no room at the tightly packed
VL/VH interface resulting in a different side-chain
rotamer. The gap created by the swing of the phenyl
group is closed by the countermovement of the
entire domains, since the β-sheet structures are
fairly rigid. In fact, pairwise superposition of the
variable domains indicates a change of 7.5° in the
VL/VH tilt angle. This global rotation of the domains
translates into shifts of the FR residues of about 2 Å,
while the antigen-binding residues shift by only
about 0.5 Å. The change in the tilt angle between
ch836 and H2L6 is observed in both the antigen￾bound state (7.5°) and the free state (5.5°), as
evidenced by the superposition of the free Fab
structures (data not shown). On the other hand,
comparison of the free and bound forms of H2L6
shows no change in the tilt angle. Apparently, the
rearrangement of the variable domains is caused by
Fig. 7. Superposition of ch836 (VL, cyan; VH, blue) and H2L6 (VL, yellow; VH, orange) in the VL/VH interface region.
Rotation of residue 87 is associated with a change in the tilt angle between the VL domain and the VH domain.
Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 Antibody 223HFS mutations rather than induced by the interac￾tion with IL-13, and it is this rearrangement that
likely accounts for the 5-fold drop in affinity after FR
replacement. Interestingly, Phe in position 87 is one
of the two somatic mutations in VL, and Tyr
introduced during the FR replacement restored the
mouse germline sequence. All the human germline
genes used as FR donors had a Tyr at position 87
(Fig. 1). This mutation at VL, together with the
putative somatic mutations at the CDRs of VH,
seems to be responsible for the affinity improvement
of m836 in vivo. Therefore, analysis of putative
somatic mutations could offer a means for designing
changes to restore affinity after FR replacement.
Specificity-determining residue optimization
Following previous reports,46–49 we focused our
diversification scheme on CDR-L1, CDR-L3, CDR￾H1, and CDR-H2 to restore the affinity of one of the
best HFS variants (H2L6) to at least 50 pM, which
was the affinity of the mouse antibody. To limit the
size of each library, we targeted a subset of the
CDRs, the anti-protein-specificity-determining
residues,31,50 for diversification. Four combinatorial
phage display libraries were created by randomiz￾ing each targeted position within a given CDR using
NNK codons and then cloning the resulting libraries
into a phagemid Fab-pIX vector (Tornetta et al.,
manuscript in preparation). Phage was produced,
incubated with b-IL-13R111Q, and captured on
streptavidin beads. Expression of monoclonal Fabs
was induced after the second and third rounds of
panning and then screened for binding to b-IL￾13R111Q in a single-point ELISA (data not shown).
Clones with improved binding compared to the
parent Fab H2L6 came from the CDR-L3 library and
were picked for sequence analysis. All sequence￾unique hits were cloned into IgG1 expression
vectors, produced, and purified, and the binding

All mAb variants, except for ch836 and H2L6 (bold), were derived from Fabs selected from a phage pIX library. Amino acid numbering of
VL library positions as in Chothia and Lesk.36 The mAb variants were sorted based on affinity. Dashes indicate that the residue is identical
with the parent, whereas Del represents an amino acid deletion.
224 Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 Antibodyaffinity for IL-13R111Q of each clone was measured
by BIAcore.
The binding affinities and sequences in the CDR￾L3 library positions of the clones are summarized in
Table 3. A number of optimized clones restored
affinity similar to that of the murine antibody. In
position 91, the parental amino acid (His) was
preferred (75%); Gln and Pro were observed at a
lesser frequency (12% each). Tyrosine in position 94
was replaced by smaller amino acids such as Gly
(60%), Ser (15%), and Ala (13%). Specifically,
Tyr94Gly is prevalent in the highest-affinity clones.
In positions 92 and 93, any amino acid replacement
was well tolerated. Alanine scanning mutagenesis
results were consistent with this pattern (data not
shown). Replacements of His with Ala in position 91
prevented binding, whereas replacements at posi￾tions 92 and 93 were tolerated. Replacement of Tyr
with Ala in position 94 increased binding.
The best clone M460 had an 8 pM affinity for
IL-13R111Q, a 100-fold improvement over the HFS
variant H2L6. Interestingly, M460 had a three￾nucleotide deletion in CDR-L3, which was not part
of the library design. Of note, two other highly
ranked clones also had similar deletions (M442 and
M480). Clone M455 is a good example of how a
smaller amino acid in position 94 is favorable, since
the only change in M455 compared to the HFS
variant H2L6 is Tyr94Ala, which results in a 4-fold
affinity improvement (754–186 pM).
Structural changes upon SDRO
In addition to the modifications introduced in
CDR-L3 during affinity maturation, we tested
several mutants in the CDRs of VH. One of the
variants, M1295, had two methionine residues
replaced (Met32Val and Met95Leu). Thus, to avoid

Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 Antibody 225potential chemical instabilities due to methionine
oxidation, we combined this variant with the VL of
M460, resulting in a molecule with an affinity of
10.69 ± 4.7 pM (n= 3) for IL-13R111Q. The affinity of
M1295 for wt IL-13 was determined by BIAcore to
be 5.7 ± 1.3 pM (n= 4). Since the variability in
measuring affinity with BIAcore is large in the low
picomolar range, these affinity values were mea￾sured in KinExA, showing similar results (data not
shown).
In order to understand the structural effect of
amino acid replacement and deletion in CDR-L3, we
solved the structure of M1295 in complex with wt
IL-13 at 2.8 Å resolution (Table 1). Comparison of the
M1295 and H2L6 crystal structures indicated no
significant conformational changes at the CDRs of
VH, or at CDR-L1 or CDR-L2 (Fig. 8a). The critical
changes between M1295 and H2L6 are located in
CDR-L3. In Fig. 8b, the interaction between CDR-L3
of H2L6 and IL-13 is visualized. Fig. 8c shows a
similar interaction between the affinity-matured
M1295 and IL-13. The one-amino-acid deletion
pulled Asp92 to occupy the space previously held
by Asn-Glu, whereas the flanking residues His91
and Tyr94 stayed in approximately the same
positions. These changes allowed for a better
interaction with IL-13, enabling Asp92 to form a
salt bridge with a key epitope residue, Arg11. This
salt bridge does not exist in H2L6 because a
potential partner, Glu93, points away from Arg11.
Another possible improvement is the hydrogen
bond between Asp92 and Ser7 at the N-terminus
of IL-13. This new interaction extended the epitope
by one residue. As a result, the interface area
increased by 20 Å2
. Although this is a small increase
in surface area (only 3%), it contributes to significant
improvement in binding affinity. Therefore, replace￾ment of a weak interaction (Asn92) and a noninter￾acting residue (Glu93) with one residue (Asp92) that
is well suited for interacting with Arg11, as well as
the increase in surface area due to a new interaction
with Ser7, could explain the increase in binding
affinity with respect to H2L6.
The success of the CDR-L3 library could poten￾tially be attributed to the fact that the VL of m836
was essentially in germline configuration, whereas
the interactions with VH were perhaps optimized
during the in vivo affinity maturation process. m836
VL has only two somatic mutations, which are both
distal to the antigen binding site. In contrast, VH has
eight somatic mutations, including three in contact
residues with the antigen. Similarly to the present
work, structural analysis of a humanized and
affinity-matured antibody to vascular endothelial
growth factor51 indicated that the antigen binding
site was almost entirely composed of VH residues. In
contrast to our work, however, libraries were
created only in VH, resulting in the selection of
parental amino acids in most positions with small
improvements in affinity, with the exception being
one-amino-acid change (His97Tyr), which was
responsible for approximately one-log affinity im￾provement. The lack of publications on humaniza￾tion, followed by affinity maturation studies with
comprehensive structural data, makes it difficult to
assign a general benchmark method for affinity
maturation. Nonetheless, our experience indicates
that avoiding the most critical interactions while
targeting CDRs with limited somatic mutations, but
with the potential to create new contacts with the
antigen, could be one of the keys to success during
affinity maturation campaigns.
Concluding Remarks
We have described the humanization of the mouse
anti-IL-13 antibody m836 by HFA. We first studied
the in vivo maturation process that likely led to this
potent IL-13 neutralizing antibody. Next, the struc￾ture of ch836 in complex with IL-13 was determined
at high resolution. Only two somatic mutations in
VL/JL and eight somatic mutations in VH/D/JH
likely generated m836. From these 10 mutations,
only three took place in contact residues with IL-13.
The remaining mutations were in residues adjacent
to the CDRs or away from the antigen binding site.
The first step of the HFA protocol consisted of
generating a relatively small library of HFS variants
by combining the binding site of m836 with human
germline genes. Generation of the HFS library differs
in several respects from other humanization meth￾ods, including CDR grafting7,10 and FR shuffling.17
First, the definition of the binding site, and thus
regions used to transfer specificity from the nonhu￾man antibody in the human FRs, includes not only
CDRs but also the hypervariable loops definition.
Second, a relatively small library of HFS variants was
generated by taking into account sequence and
structural considerations. Third, FRs were not
mixed to generate the HFS library; only FRs coming
from the same human IGVH or IGVK genes were
used as building blocks of the library.
Several HFS VL variants, combined with the same
HFS VH, exhibited a similar binding profile, consis￾tent with the structural analysis of the ch836 complex
with IL-13, indicating the VH has a predominant role
in the interaction. Comparison of the ch836 and
H2L6 structures indicates that no major conforma￾tional changes were introduced in residues in direct
contact with IL-13 after FR replacement, even when
major local changes occurred in FR-H1 and CDR-H4.
The latter changes are adjacent to the binding site of
the antibody, but do not seem to have an impact on
binding to IL-13. Instead, changes in the VL/VH
interface induced a global shift in the relative
position of the CDRs, likely responsible for the 5-
fold affinity drop after FR replacement. Remarkably,
one of the residues replaced in FR-L3, away from the
antigen binding site and likely responsible for the
shift in the tilt angle between VL and VH, coincided
with a putative somatic mutation. Since determining
backmutations required for restoring or improving
affinity in humanization protocols is a difficult task,
this finding suggests that analysis of somatic muta￾tions could be a useful means for identifying
226 Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 Antibodybackmutations for testing as part of the design cycle
in future humanization protocols.
The second step of the HFA protocol led to SDRO
variants with a gain in affinity for IL-13R111Q of up
to a hundred fold. Structural analyses of the H2L6
and M1295 Fab/wt IL-13 complexes helped us to
dissect the mechanism of affinity maturation that
generated this two-log improvement in affinity. It
was achieved through a few major local changes in
CDR-L3, as opposed to the global conformational
changes that occurred during HFS and perhaps
during in vivo somatic hypermutation. The replace￾ment of two residues—one residue in contact
(Asn92) and a noninteracting residue (Glu93)—
with one residue (Asp92) that was well suited for
interacting with Arg11 in IL-13, as well as a new
interaction with Ser7, explained the increase in
binding affinity. Comparing these results to others,51
we suggest that as a design principle in affinity
maturation strategies after FR replacement, libraries
should focus on CDRs with few or no contact
residues and few or no somatic hypermutations
but with the potential to generate new contacts. This
strategy avoids major perturbations of the already
optimized interaction that took place during the
affinity maturation in vivo.
Materials and Methods
Human framework selection
Initial selection of human sequences for VH was based
on the sequence similarity of the VH germline genes to the
entire length of the mouse VH. In the next stage, the
selected human sequences were rank ordered using a
score that takes into account both the length of the CDRs
and the sequence similarities between the CDR of mouse
sequences and the CDR of human sequences. The
BLOSUM 62 substitution matrix52 was used for scoring
alignments of the CDRs of mouse and human sequences,
and a large penalty was applied if there was an insertion
and/or deletion in CDR loops. This leads to selection of
FR1, FR2, and FR3. FR4 was selected based on the
sequence similarity of the IGJH germline genes with
m836 FR4. A similar procedure was used for selecting
human VL FRs. The repertoire of human genes was
obtained from Vbase§.
HFS library synthesis
HFS variants of VH were fused to the human CH1–CH3
IgG1 domains, whereas the VL fragments were fused to
human CL. For each variable chain, a mouse–human IgG1
chimera construct was also made, bringing the total to 16
VL and 7 VH chains, respectively. The HFS library and the
chimera of parent molecules were synthesized and cloned
into the proper vectors. DNA was produced and used in
batch transient transfections using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Antibodies were purified on
AKTA Xpress or AKTA FPLC chromatography systems
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).
Cell supernatants from transiently transfected HEK293-
E or CHO-S cells were harvested 4 days after transfection,
clarified by centrifugation ( 6000 rpm for 30 min), and
filtered (using a 0. 2-μm PES membrane; Corning,
Corning, NY). The relative amount of IgG was determined
with the Octet instrument (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA).
Supernatants were loaded onto an equilibrated [phos￾phate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7] HiTrap MabSelect Sure
Protein A column (GE Healthcare) at a relative concen￾tration of ∼10 mg of protein per milliliter of resin. After
loading, we washed the column and we eluted the protein
with 10 column volumes of 0.1 M Na-acetate (pH 3). The
eluted protein fractions were neutralized immediately by
elution into tubes containing 2.0 M Tris (pH 7) at a 20%
fraction volume (i.e., if 2 mL of eluate was collected, the
tubes were prefilled with 0.4 mL of Tris buffer). Peak
fractions were pooled, filtered (0. 2 μm), and dialyzed
against PBS (pH 7) overnight at 4 °C. The proteins were
removed from dialysis and filtered (0.2 μ m), and the
protein concentration was determined by absorbance at
280 nm and 310 nm on a BioTek SynergyHT™ spectro￾photometer. If necessary, the purified proteins were
concentrated with a 10,000 MWCO centrifugal concentra￾tor (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The quality of the purified
proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion
HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Endotoxin levels were
measured by LAL assay (Cape Cod Associates, Cape Cod,
MA), when required. Purified proteins were stored at 4 °C.
Assay of anti-IL-13 activity
The pairing of each of the six heavy-chain variants and
each of the 15 light-chain variants resulted in 90
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), referred to as the HFS
library. These mAbs were expressed in HEK293-E cells,
and crude supernatants were used to screen for binding of
the naturally occurring variant IL-13R111Q and for
blocking of the binding of IL-13R111Q to its receptor, IL￾13Rα2. Human IL-13 variant R130Q was purchased from
PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). IL-13R130Q was reconstituted
in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and
dialyzed against Dulbecco's PBS. The sample was
biotinylated with the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS LC biotin kit
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) in accordance with the
manufacturer's instructions at a 4:1 biotin/protein molar
ratio. Afterwards, the sample was extensively dialyzed
against PBS and quantitated on a nanodrop (Thermo
Scientific) to determine recovery. A small portion was
analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The remaining amount
was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The HFS variant mAb
in the transfection supernatant was quantitated using the
AlphaScreen General IgG (Protein A) Detection Kit
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). The streptavidin-conjugat￾ed donor bead was coated with biotin-conjugated Goat
Anti-Human IgG(κ) antibody (Thermo Scientific). Briefly,
the supernatant was exposed to the Protein-A-coated
acceptor bead. After the mAb had been washed, its
amount was detected with the gt-anti-human IgG(κ)
donor bead. The signal was measured with the Envision
2102 Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer). The assays
were performed in 384-well white plates (Corning) The
amount of mAb was calculated against a standard curve
of purified reference mAb.
An ELISA-based assay was used to detect IL-13R111Q
antigen binding to HFS variants captured on a microtiter
plate. This assay was used to screen and rank the HFS
variants. Briefly, F-type black Nunc Maxisorp plates
§ http://vbase.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk/ (Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with goat anti-human
Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 Antibody 227Fc capture antibody. After blocking and washing, we
added the HFS variant transfection supernatants normal￾ized for IgG content for capture. Human b-IL-13R111Q was
added. After washing, we developed the amount of bound
IL-13R130Q with streptavidin–alkaline phosphatase and
BM Chemiluminescence substrate (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN). The amount of bound b-IL-13R111Q was read on the
Envision plate reader using luminescence application.
In IL-13Rα2 binding inhibition assay, soluble human
IL-13Rα2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used to
coat the plates. After washing and blocking, we added
the normalized HFS variant supernatants to be tested.
Next, a standard amount of b-IL-13R111Q was added
to each well. The amount of b-IL-13R111Q bound to
IL-13Rα2 was developed with streptavidin–alkaline
phoshatase with BM AttoPhos substrate. Luminescence
was read on the Envision plate reader and analyzed
using the Spotfire® software (Tibco).
Phage library construction
The phagemid vector used for the display of antibody
Fab fragments on phage coat protein 9 (pIX) was similar to
pCNTO-Fab-pIX (Tornetta et al., manuscript in prepara￾tion), with some modifications to restriction enzyme sites.
The pCNTO-Fab-pIX vector was derived from
pCGMT9.53 The variable regions of the mouse anti￾human IL-13 antibody m836 and HFS variant H2L6
were amplified directly from the mAb templates and
cloned into the pCNTO-Fab-pIX vector. These clones
served as controls for phage display, Fab expression, and
binding. The affinity maturation library was designed to
randomize four anti-protein specificity-determining resi￾dues in SDR-L3. More specifically, these residues were
H91, N92, E93, and Y94, and the library was designed to
introduce full diversity using NNK codons. The library
was assembled using nested PCR and cloned into a parent
construct that contained a sequence of a non-IL-13 binding
light chain. Thus, successful insertion of library sequences
would replace the non-IL-13 light-chain sequences. Un￾successful ligations would result in phage that could not
bind to IL-13. Library PCR products were cloned using
NheI and RsrII and electroporated into Escherichia coli
MC1061F′ cells.
Phage selections
Phage preparation from the transformed library plates
and selection using soluble b-IL-13R111Q were carried out
using standard protocols.54 For each round of panning,
antigen concentration was lowered (ranging from 10 nM in
the first round to 10 pM in the final round). Panning was
performed overnight at 4 °C or at room temperature for
1 h, and extensive washing procedures were employed to
enrich clones with improved affinity. No elution of phage
was needed as the Fab was displayed on pIX, which is
located on the opposite end of pIII on the phage particle,
thus not interfering with reinfection of E. coli.
Affinity determination by BIAcore
Affinity measurements using surface plasmon reso￾nance were performed using a BIAcore 3000 optical
biosensor (BIAcore; GE Healthcare). A biosensor surface
was prepared by coupling anti-human IgG Fc fragment
specific antibody (cat. no.109-005-098; Jackson ImmunoR￾esearch, West Grove, PA) to the carboxymethylated
dextran surface of a CM-5 chip (cat. no. BR-1000-14;
BIAcore) using the manufacturer's instructions for amine￾coupling chemistry. Approximately 20,000 RU (response
units) of anti-human IgG Fc antibodies was immobilized
in each of four flow cells. Kinetic experiments were
performed at 25 °C in PBS running buffer (containing
0.005% surfactant P20 and 3 mM ethylenediaminetetraa￾cetic acid). This buffer was filtered and degassed for at
least 30 min prior to use. Serial dilutions of IL-13R111Q
from 33 nM to 0.046 nM were prepared in running buffer.
About 250 RU of tested mAb was captured on flow cells 2,
3, and 4 of the sensor chip. Flow cell 1 was used as
reference surface. Capturing of mAb was followed by
a 3-min injection (association phase) of IL-13R111Q
at 50 μ L/min, followed by 10 min of buffer flow
(dissociation phase). The chip surface was regenerated
by two pulses of a 12-s injection of 100 mM H3PO4
(cat. no. 7961; Sigma) at 50 μL /min. The data collected
were processed using BIAevaluation software, version 3.2
(BIAcore). First, double-reference subtraction of the data
was performed by subtracting the curves generated by
buffer injection from the reference-subtracted curves for
analyte injections. Then kinetic analysis of the data was
performed using a 1:1 binding model with a global fit. The
result for each mAb was reported in the format of ka
(on-rate), kd (off-rate), and Kd (affinity constant).
Protein purification for crystallization
The His-tagged chimeric version of m836 Fab was
expressed in CHO cells (10 L) and purified as follows. The
supernatant concentrated to 700 mL was supplemented
with 77 mL of 10× PBS and loaded onto a 10-mL TALON
column at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, after which the
column was washed with 50 mL of wash buffer [50 mM
sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 350 mM NaCl]. The
column was then further washed with buffer A [7.5 mM
imidazole, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM sodium phosphate
(pH 7.0)] to remove proteins that were nonspecifically
bound to the column. The His-tagged ch836 Fab was
eluted from the column with a gradient of 0–80% of
buffer B [100 mM imidazole, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM
sodium phosphate (pH 7.0)]. The fractions containing
ch836 Fab were pooled and dialyzed into 20 mM Tris
(pH 7.4) with 50 mM NaCl. The Fab was further purified
using a Superdex200 column (GE Healthcare). The Fab
fragments of H2L6 and M1295 were prepared by papain
cleavage of corresponding mAbs and purified using
affinity and size-exclusion chromatography as follows.
mAb was dialyzed into a buffer containing 20 mM
sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 10 mM ethylenediami￾netetraacetic acid, and then concentrated to 20 mg/mL.
Antibody digestion was performed using the Immuno￾Pure Fab Preparation Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Immo￾bilized papain (10 mL, suspended) was incubated with
H2L6 mAb in the column (11 mm ID and 100 mm long) at
room temperature. The digested protein fragments were
eluted from the column, and Fab was separated from Fc
and intact mAb using a MabSelect column (GE Health￾care). Fab was then loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60
Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare), which was
developed at 2 mL/min with 50 mM NaCl and 20 mM
Tris (pH 7.4). Both Fabs H2L6 and M1295 eluted from the
Superdex 200 column as a single peak.
The purity of Fabs was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and
analytical size-exclusion chromatography. Under
228 Human Adaptation of a Mouse Anti-Human IL13 Antibodynonreducing conditions, SDS-PAGE shows a single band
of ∼49 kDa that corresponds to the covalently linked Fab.
Under reducing conditions, the heavy chain and the light
chain migrate as a single band of ∼28 kDa. The proteins
elute as a single peak on a TSKgel G3000SWXL column
(TOSOH Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan).
Complex preparation and crystallization
Recombinant human IL-13 was purchased from R&D
Systems (cat. no. 213-IL/CF). The sample was reconsti￾tuted in PBS buffer in accordance with the manufacturer's
protocol. Fab/IL-13 complexes were prepared by mixing
Fab and IL-13 at a molar ratio of 1:1.2 (excess of IL-13),
followed by purification on a Superdex 200 10/300 column
(GE Healthcare). Fractions corresponding to the main peak
were pooled, concentrated to 6.2 mg/mL with an Amicon￾Ultra (5 kDa) device , and used for crystallization.
Crystallization of the complexes was carried out by the
vapor-diffusion hanging-drop method at 20 °C. Screening
for crystallization conditions was performed with a Hydra
II eDrop robot (Thermo Scientific) using a 96-well plate
format. The experiments were composed of droplets of
0.5 μL of protein solution mixed with 0.5 μL of reservoir
solution. The droplets were equilibrated against 90 μL of
reservoir solution.
Initial screening was performed with Crystallization
Screen HT (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and in￾house crystallization screens. Needle-like microcrystals of
H2L6 Fab/IL-13 were obtained from 20% polyethylene
glycol (PEG) 3350, 0.2 M ammonium citrate, and 0.1 M
4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.5). The other two
complexes did not produce any crystals. The microcrys￾tals of H2L6 Fab/IL-13 were used as seeds for the second
screening by the microseed matrix method55 for all three
complexes. Diffraction-quality crystals of H2L6 Fab/IL￾13 were obtained from 14% PEG 3350 and 0.2 M
ammonium tartrate. They belong to the orthorhombic
space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a= 63.78 Å,
b= 73.02 Å, and c= 114.86 Å. The asymmetric unit
contains one molecule of the complex with a 45% solvent
content.
The crystals of M1295 Fab/IL-13 were obtained from
25% PEG 8000 and 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5).
They appeared to be isomorphous to the H2L6 Fab/IL-13
crystals. The crystals of ch836 Fab/IL-13 were obtained
from 20% PEG 3350, 0.2 M sodium tartrate, and 0.1 M
Hepes (pH 7.5). The crystals belong to the monoclinic
space group P21 with unit cell parameters a= 76.62 Å,
b= 65.56 Å, c= 118.74 Å, and β= 107.02°. The asymmetric
unit contains two molecules of the complex with a 48%
solvent content.
X-ray data collection and structure determination
For X-ray data collection, one crystal of each complex
was soaked for a few seconds in mother liquor supple￾mented with 20% glycerol and flash frozen in a stream of
nitrogen at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected and
processed at Centocor using a Rigaku MicroMax™-007HF
microfocus X-ray generator equipped with an Osmic™
VariMax™ confocal optics, a Saturn 944 CCD detector, and
an X-Stream™ 2000 cryocooling system (Rigaku, Wood￾lands, TX). Diffraction intensities were detected over at
least a 360° crystal rotation with 2-min to 3 -min exposures
per 0.5° image and processed with the program D⁎TREK
(Rigaku). X-ray data statistics are given in Table 1.
The structures were determined by molecular replace￾ment using the program PHASER.56 First, the structure of
the ch836 Fab/IL-13 complex was solved using the
structure of anti-carbohydrate antibody S25-2 (PDB code
1Q9Q) as search model.57 The refined structure of ch836
Fab/IL-13 was used for molecular replacement of the
other two complexes. Atomic positions and temperature
factors were refined with REFMAC.58 Water molecules
were added at the (Fo−Fc) electron density peaks within
hydrogen-bond distance of the protein atoms. All crystal￾lographic calculations were performed with the CCP4
suite of programs.59 Model adjustments were carried out
with Coot.60 Refinement statistics are given in Table 1.
Accession numbers
Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited
in the PDB with accession numbers 3L5W, 3L5X, and 3L5Y.
