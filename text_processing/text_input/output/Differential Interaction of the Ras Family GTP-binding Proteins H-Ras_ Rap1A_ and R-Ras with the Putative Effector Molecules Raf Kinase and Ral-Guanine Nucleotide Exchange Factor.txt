The interactions of H-Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1A with the
Ras-binding domains (RBD) of the c-Raf kinase and of
the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RGF) was
studied biochemically in solution. From deletion clon￾ing the RGF-RBD was defined as a 97-amino acid-long
fragment from the C-terminal end of the human RGF,
which is an independent folding domain with high sta￾bility. Interestingly, whereas H-Ras binds with high af￾finity (KD 5 20 nM) to Raf-RBD and with low affinity (KD
5 1 mM) to RGF-RBD, Rap1A shows the opposite behav￾ior. The binding of both RBDs to R-Ras is weak and
shows no specificity. The interaction between Rap1A
and RGF-RBD shows similar characteristics to the Ras￾Raf interaction because it is blocked by mutations in the
effector region (D38A) and it inhibits the dissociation of
guanine nucleotide, which is the basis for the quantita￾tive measurements in this work. Furthermore, the bind￾ing of RGF-RBD inhibits the interaction between Rap1A
and Rap-GAP. As long as the cellular localizations of the
different proteins and their biological functions are not
clarified, these biochemical data seem to indicate that
Ral-guanine nucleotide exchange factors is an effector
molecule of Rap1A rather than of H-Ras.
Ras proteins play a crucial role in the transduction into the
nucleus of extracellular signals that regulate different cellular
responses such as growth, differentiation, and metabolism.
They are activated by exchange of the protein-bound GDP for
GTP catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors like
Cdc25 and Sos. By its intrinsic GTPase activity Ras returns to
the inactive form, and this process can be accelerated by inter￾action with GTPase-activating proteins like p120GAP and
NF-1 (1–3).
Activated Ras interacts with downstream targets or effectors
that are operationally defined as proteins interacting more
tightly with the GTP-bound than with the inactive GDP-bound
state. The best characterized but probably not the only effector
molecule is the Raf kinase (4 –9), which binds to Ras-GTP with
20 nM and to Ras-GDP with 20 mM affinity, respectively (10),
and which is translocated by Ras to the plasma membrane for
further activation (11–13) molecular details of which are pres￾ently not understood. The activation of Raf initiates a phospho￾rylation cascade involving Mek and Erk protein kinases and
leads to the activation of transcription factors like Elk (14).
Recently it has become increasingly clear that the signal trans￾duction cascade via Ras branches out to produce changes in
cellular morphology in addition to induction of DNA synthesis
(15) and that entirely different pathways involving Ras might
exist (16, 17). A number of other bona fide or putative effector
molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (18, 19), MEK
kinase (20), RGF1 (also termed Ral-GDS in other publications)
(21–23), and a few other Ras-binding proteins (Rsb) (24) and Rin
(25) have been identified by demonstrating their direct interac￾tion with Ras-GTP. So far only for phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
has an enhancement in activity in vivo been shown. Among these
effectors we have focused our interest in this work to RGF, which
has nucleotide exchange activity specifically to Ral but not to
other Ras-related proteins (26).
In addition to the variety of possible Ras effectors, the situ￾ation has become even more complicated due to the finding that
other members of the Ras subfamily of GTP-binding proteins
such as Rap1 and R-Ras also bind to these possible effectors (8,
21, 23, 24, 27), most likely because the amino acid sequence in
their effector region is very similar. It has been shown recently
by x-ray crystallography that Rap1A and Ras use a common
core effector region in their interaction with Raf-RBD (28, 29).
Because most of the binding reactions mentioned above have
only been investigated qualitatively, mainly by using the yeast
two-hybrid system, we have measured these interactions more
accurately in solution to get more insight into the affinity and
specificity of these interactions.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cloning of COOH-terminal Fragments of RGF and the D38A Mutant
of Rap1A—The plasmids encoding four different protein fragments
from the COOH-terminal region of Ral-guanine nucleotide exchange
factor (named RGF), which contains the Ras binding domain, were
made by subcloning the proper fragments from pGAD-RGF127, which
encodes the 127 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of human RGF (23), into
pGEX-4T3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). pGEX-RGF127 was made by in￾sertion of a 0.7-kilobase fragment of EcoRI- and SmaI-digested pGAD￾RGF127 into EcoRI- and SmaI-digested pGEX. To create pGEX-RGF97,
encoding a protein of 97 residues starting with the same NH2-terminal
residue as the 127-residue fragment, the 0.3-kilobase EcoRI–AvaII
fragment (blunted with T4 DNA polymerase) from pGAD-RGF127 was
subcloned into EcoRI- and SmaI-digested pGEX. This subcloning also
generated pGEX-RGF83 consisting of 83 amino acids with the same
NH2 terminus as the proteins described above. pGEX-RGF61, which
codes for a protein of 61 residues having the same NH2 terminus was
made by insertion of a 0.2-kilobase EcoRI–Pst (blunted with T4 DNA

(GSPNSARA) between the thrombin cleavage site and the NH2 termi￾nus of RGF. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Rap-DNA was performed
in the pBks vector by the “transformer” site-directed mutagenesis kit
from Clontech. The mutagenic oligonucleotide was 59CCAACGATA￾GAAGCTTCCTACAGAAAG39 (substitution of Asp38 for Ala, mutated
codon underlined). The proper sequence of all plasmids was verified by
DNA sequencing.
Protein Preparations—An overnight culture of BL21(DE3) cells con￾taining one of the GST-RGF plasmids described was diluted 1:50 in
standard I medium (Merck) including 50 mg/liter ampicilline. After it
had grown to an OD 5 0.8, synthesis of the GST-RGF fusion protein was
induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopy￾ranoside and by further incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. The frozen bacterial
cell pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM
dithiotreitol and 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated
(Branson 450). The 30,000 3 g supernatant was run over a glutathione￾Sepharose (Pharmacia) column washed with 20 mM TriszHCl, pH 7.2,
and either incubated overnight at ambient temperature with 10
units/ml thrombin (Serva) or eluted with 10 mM glutathione in the same
buffer. The cleaved RGF97 protein was eluted and chromatographed
over 25 ml of Q-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia) using a 0 –1 M NaCl gradi￾ent. The RGF127 was chromatographed over 25 ml of SP-Sepharose FF
(Pharmacia) and eluted with a 0 –1 M NaCl gradient. The proteins were
concentrated to 20 mg/ml (centricon 10, Amicon) and stored at 280 °C.
For digestion studies of the GST fusion proteins with thrombin, phos￾phate-buffered saline or 20 mM Tris, pH 7.2, in the absence or the
presence of 1 mM CaCl2 was used. The samples were incubated for
various times at 4 or 37 °C and quenched with 1 mM phenylmethylsul￾fonyl fluoride.
H-Ras and the D38A mutant were prepared from Escherichia coli as
described before (30, 31). The truncated form of Rap1A (residues 1–167)
was expressed in ptac in the E. coli strain CK600K. The cells were
grown at 37 °C in standard I medium (Merck) to O.D. 5 0.7, and then
0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside was added, and the cul￾ture was incubated overnight at 32 °C. The cells were lysed using
lysozyme as described for Ras. The cleared cell lysate was chromato￾graphed over Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia), and the protein was eluted by
a NaCl-gradient (0 –300 mM) in a buffer containing 60 mM TriszHCl pH
7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM NaN3, and 10 mM dithiotreitol. The Rap￾containing fractions were concentrated to 20 mg/ml using ultrafiltra￾tion membranes (10 kDa, Amicon). The protein was then run over a gel
filtration column (Superdex 75, Pharmacia) where the buffer addition￾ally contained 400 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM GDP, again concentrated to 20
mg/ml, shock frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 280 °C. The D38A
mutant of Rap1A was prepared as the wild type protein. The plasmid
encoding R-Ras was kindly provided by Alan Hall, and the protein was
purified using a Q-Sepharose column and a G75 Sephadex column.
Proteins were analyzed for purity and proper molecular weight by
SDS-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis, and protein concentrations
were determined by the method of Bradford (32).
For fluorescence measurements the Ras proteins were loaded by
incubation with a 1.5-fold molar excess of the fluorescent GTP analogue
mGpp(NH)p prepared as described by John et al. (33) in the presence of
200 mM ammonium sulfate and 5 units/mgzp21 of alkaline phosphatase
(Boehringer Mannheim). Loading of the proteins with GTP was
achieved by incubation with a 100-fold excess of GTP in presence of 10
mM EDTA. After 2 h for H-Ras and R-Ras and 24 h for Rap1A at 4 °C,
the buffer was changed to 50 mM TriszHCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1
mM dithiotreitol (buffer A) using a gel filtration column (PD-10,
Pharmacia).
Measurement of the Interaction between Ras Proteins and Effector
Molecules—For measurement of the GTPase rates of H-Ras and Rap1A
in the absence or the presence of saturating amounts of RGF or in
presence of catalytic amounts of GAP334, the catalytic domain of Ras￾GAP (34), and Rap-Gap (kindly provided by T. Schweins and R. Ahma￾dian), respectively, the protein samples were incubated at 37 °C in
buffer A. Aliquots were taken at various time intervals and analyzed for
GDP and GTP content using a reversed phase C18 HPLC column as
described (30). The experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the
rate of hydrolysis was obtained by fitting a single exponential curve to
the decay of the GTP concentration.
The affinities between Raf-RBD or the RGF fragments and the Ras￾proteins, as defined in Equation 1, were determined using the inhibi￾tion of the nucleotide dissociation from Ras by the binding of the effector
to Ras. The rate constants (kobs) of the mGpp(NH)p dissociation from
the Ras protein were measured in the presence of varying effector
concentrations. The reaction mixtures in buffer A were incubated at
37 °C in a fluorescence cuvette, and the mGpp(NH)p dissociation was
initiated by the addition of 250 mM nonlabeled Gpp(NH)p. The fluores￾cence decay was monitored in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrometer with
excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 450 nm, respectively.
The fluorescence traces obtained were fitted by a single exponential
function yielding the rate constant for the mGpp(NH)p dissociation,
kobs. According to Scheme 1 and Equation 2, this rate constant is
composed of two contributions, the dissociation of the nucleotide (N)
from the Ras protein (R) alone, defined as k21, and from the complex
with the effector (E), defined as k22. Due to the large excess of non￾labeled nucleotide, the rate constants for the reassociation of
mGpp(NH)p, k11 and k12, can be ignored. Equations 1 and 2 are
combined to give the expression for kobs in Equation 3. According to this
equation the data are fitted using the program Grafit (Erithakus Soft￾ware) to give Kd within an error of 10%.
The affinity between RGF and the Ras mutant Y32W was also
measured by direct titration using the tryptophan fluorescence as read￾out. In buffer A, the Gpp(NH)p form of Y32W was kept at a constant
concentration of 0.8 mM, and the fluorescence emission (excitation wave￾length, 295 nm) at 350 nm was monitored as a function of the RGF
fragment concentration. A fit to the data yields a Kd within an error of
10%.
RESULTS
By biological and biochemical investigations, Raf kinase has
been identified as one of the Ras effector molecules. It binds
tightly to the active GTP form of Ras with a Kd of 20 nM,
whereas the binding to an effector region mutant such as D38A
is approximately 100-fold and to the GDP-bound form 1000-fold
weaker (10). The effector Raf competes with GAP and NF-1 for
binding to Ras (8, 9, 35). The interaction of the Ras homologous
proteins Rap and R-Ras with Raf kinase, or more specifically
Raf-RBD, has also been demonstrated (8, 23, 27, 36).
In recent studies using the yeast two-hybrid system RGF has
been found to be another putative Ras effector because the
COOH-terminal end of the molecule binds to Ras family pro￾teins in a GTP-dependent manner, and the interaction is in￾terrupted by mutations that show weaker nucleotide affinity
(21–23). To further define the minimal RBD of RGF and to
measure its interaction with Ras and Ras-like proteins and for
the comparison with the RBD of Raf kinase, protein fragments
of different length from the COOH-terminal part of RGF have
been expressed and characterized.
Purification of RGF Fragments—The DNA encoding the 127
carboxyl-terminal amino acids of human RGF, which has been
identified from a yeast two-hybrid screen involving R-Ras as a
bait (23), has been used for the construction of plasmids for the
bacterial expression of fragments of 61, 83, 97, and 127 resi￾dues in length, named RGFxx where “xx” denotes the number
of amino acids of the protein fragment. They all start with the
same NH2-terminal residue, which is the homologue of amino
acid 726 of mouse RGF. These proteins were expressed from
pGEX-4T3 as GST fusions, and all four fragments were
strongly overexpressed as shown in lanes 2–5 in Fig. 1. Only
GST-RGF127 and GST-RGF97 were found in large amounts in
the soluble extract whereas GST-RGF83 and GST-RGF61 ap￾peared to be mostly insoluble (Fig. 1, lanes 6 –9). Different E.
coli strains and growing conditions were tried to improve the
solubility, i.e. 20, 28, and 37 °C and concentrations of isopropyl￾1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside ranging from 10 mM to 1 mM. The
cleared cell lysate was chromatographed over glutathione￾Sepharose, and the fusion protein was cleaved on the column
by incubation with thrombin or was eluted from the column
with 10 mM glutathione. From a 10-liter bacterial culture about
100 mg of GST fusion protein of the two larger fragments were
obtained, whereas only 2–3 mg of fusion protein of the two
smaller fragments could be isolated. The cleaved protein frag￾ments RGF97 and RGF127 were then fractionated by gradient
elution (0 –1 M NaCl) at pH 7.2 from a Q-Sepharose column and

15 and 16). The smaller RGF fragments, GST-RGF61 and
GST-RGF83, could only be obtained in small amounts as GST
fusions (Fig. 1, lanes 10 and 11). On incubation with thrombin
under various experimental conditions, the two small RGF
fragments were degraded for the most part as measured by
densitometric scanning of the SDS gel whereas the two larger
fragments were not sensitive to thrombin digestion (Fig. 1,
lanes 12–14). It was found that particularly GST-RGF83 was
tightly associated with a 70-kDa protein (Fig. 1, lane 10),
because neither by use of a gel filtration column nor by chro￾matography over Q-Sepharose could this complex be separated.
On the addition of 1 mM Mg-ATP to the solution, the protein
precipitated. The 70-kDa protein was identified as bacterial
DnaK protein by sequencing 9 NH2-terminal amino acids.
Measurement of the Affinity between H-Ras and RGF—Raf￾RBD acts as a GDI on Ras-nucleotide complexes such that the
inhibition of nucleotide release can be used to measure complex
formation between Ras and Raf-RBD (10). The binding of Raf￾RBD to Rap and R-Ras produces a similar effect on nucleotide
release, and the three-dimensional structure of the Rap1A.Raf￾RBD complex has shown that this is not due to a steric blockage
of the nucleotide binding site but rather due to a number of
additional hydrogen bonds between nucleotide and Rap (28).
Fig. 2 shows that the interaction between RGF and Ras
proteins also inhibits the dissociation of the nucleotide. This is
not in contradiction with the observations of Albright et al. (26)
where the guanine nucleotide exchange factors activity of RGF
toward several Ras proteins had been addressed. Because only
4% of the protein-bound nucleotide was dissociated, an inhibi￾tion would not be detectable. In this work the GDI effect was
used as a tool to characterize the different fragments of RGF
and to quantify the affinities between Ras and its putative
effector molecule RGF. According to Scheme 1 and Equations 2
and 3, the dissociation rate of the nucleotide from the Ras
protein depends on the effector concentration. Nucleotide dis￾sociation in the absence of effector molecules is fast compared
with the dissociation from the effector complex. Therefore k22
can not be determined in high accuracy, and it was estimated to

mGpp(NH)p from the Ras proteins (as indicated) was measured in
dependence of RGF. The concentrations of H-Ras and R-Ras were 100
nM ,and Rap was at 30 nM. The curves were fitted to the data according
to Equation 3 as described in the text.

The results of these measurements are shown in Table I. The
affinities of H-Ras for RGF127 and RGF97 are the same. The
fragments containing 83 and 61 amino acids could only be
prepared as GST fusion proteins, and they did not inhibit
nucleotide dissociation from Ras. As a control GST-RGF97
showed the same inhibition and hence the same affinity to Ras
as the cleaved protein RGF97. Because the two smaller frag￾ments are rather unstable and mostly insoluble, it appears that
the smallest domain, which is stable enough for expression in
E. coli and which at the same time shows tight binding to Ras
proteins (see also below), contains between 83 and 97 amino
acids. In line with this observation, it has been shown by Hofer
et al. (22) that a fragment of 98 amino acids isolated as a GST
fusion protein is sufficient for binding to Ras. All the following
experiments have been done with RGF97, which in analogy to
Raf-RBD is named the Ras-Binding domain of RGF, RGF-RBD.
The quantitative data on protein affinities reported here and
earlier (10) are based on the inhibition of the dissociation of a
fluorescently labeled nucleotide from the Ras protein by the
effector molecules Raf-RBD and RGF-RBD (Fig. 2). We were
able to check the validity of this method by use of an independ￾ent assay in the case of the interaction between Ras and RGF￾RBD. We used the Ras mutant Y32W in order to measure
directly the binding between these two proteins because the
RGF fragments do not carry any tryptophans and therefore do
not show too much background fluorescence. It has been shown
that this Ras mutant has a normal intrinsic and GAP-catalyzed
GTPase activity (37) and that it can interact with exchange
factors like Cdc25 (38) in the same way as wild type Ras. On
the addition of RGF-RBD to a solution of Ras-Y32WzGpp(NH)p,
the fluorescence excited at 295 nm and monitored at 350 nm is
significantly decreased as shown in Fig. 3 (data set A). After
the binding is saturated, the fluorescence increases linearly
with further addition of RGF-RBD due to the fluorescence of
tyrosines in this molecule. This increase was also measured in
a second experiment where RGF-RBD was added to a buffer
solution. The resulting straight line was substracted from the
data obtained in the titration experiment (data set A) yielding
data set B in Fig. 3. Data set B was fitted according to Equation
3 where the parameters k21 and k22 were replaced by the
maximal and minimal fluorescence values, respectively, and
data set A was fitted using the same equation plus a linear
slope. For RGF127 and RGF97 Kd 5 0,7 mM and Kd 5 0,8 mM
were obtained, respectively. In addition the mGpp(NH)p disso￾ciation assay was performed with Ras-Y32W and RGF97. Here
Kd 5 0.7 mM was found, which is in good keeping with the result
obtained with the method described above.
The observation that the RBDs of Raf and RGF inhibit the
dissociation of nucleotides from Ras and Rap can also be used
to determine the concentration of active RBD in the protein
preparation. The fraction of active RBD protein has been meas￾ured at concentrations of Ras-mGpp(NH)p (10 mM), which is
much higher than the Kd value. Under these conditions kobs
decreases nearly linearly with increasing RBD concentration,
and the data (not shown) can be fitted according to Equation 3
to obtain the active RBD concentration. For these measure￾ments the Ras concentration has been carefully determined by
Bradford (32) and HPLC analysis, and for both Raf-RBD and
RGF-RBD, the concentrations of active protein were calculated
to be 50 –70%.
Affinity of Ras-like GTPases for RGF-RBD and Raf-RBD—It
has been shown before using the yeast two-hybrid system or
plate-binding assay with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
that RGF also interacts with other members of the Ras sub￾family such as R-Ras and Rap (21, 23). To get more quantita￾tive data we used the GDI assay to measure these interactions.
It turned out that the affinities between RGF-RBD and the
different Ras proteins vary over a range of approximately 3

monitored at 350 nm in dependence of RGF-RBD concentration, data

measured in the absence of Ras(Y32W), and these values were sub￾tracted from data set A yielding data set B (●). Curves were fitted to the

 by guest on August 21, 2017 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from orders of magnitude. Whereas R-Ras binds with only micromo￾lar affinity to RGF-RBD, Rap binds very tightly with a Kd of 10
nM, 100-fold tighter than Ras (Fig. 2, Table I). It has been
shown before that mutations in the effector region of Ras in￾hibit binding to Raf (39 – 41) and to RGF (22). Therefore, we
have mutated the effector residue Asp38 and show that the
D38A mutant of Rap reduces the affinity 4000-fold, an even
more drastic reduction than in the Ras-Raf interaction (10).
Furthermore, complex formation between RGF-RBD and Rap
is GTP-dependent because the affinity drops again 4000-fold
when Rap is in the GDP-bound form (data not shown), which
we take as further arguments in favor of RGF being an effector
molecule of Rap.
Because we were surprised to find such drastic differences in
affinities between RGF-RBD and the different Ras family pro￾teins, we wanted to obtain accurate binding constants also for
the interaction between Raf-RBD and the Ras family proteins,
which have been shown earlier to bind to Raf (8, 23, 27, 36).
Using our GDI assay we find that Rap and R-Ras bind less
tightly to Raf-RBD than Ras (Table I). It is intriguing to find
that the dissociation constants for the interaction of Ras and
Rap with Raf-RBD and RGF-RBD are just reversed. Ras binds
tightly to Raf-RBD and weakly to RGF-RBD, whereas Rap
binds weakly to Raf-RBD and tightly to RGF-RBD, the differ￾ences in affinities being approximately 100-fold (Table I). We
take this as an indication of high specificities of the different
Ras proteins toward their possible effector molecules.
Competitive Binding of RGF and GAP—For Raf-RBD or
larger NH2-terminal fragments of Raf it was shown that it
competes with GAP and NF-1 for the binding to Ras and that it
has no effect on the GTPase activity of Ras (7, 8, 35, 41). Here
we investigated the competition of RGF with GAP for binding
to Ras and with Rap-GAP for binding to Rap. As shown in Fig. 4
the measurements of the GTPase activities of Ras and Rap
were carried out in the absence or the presence of catalytic
amounts of GAP334 and Rap-GAP, respectively, in the presence
of saturating concentrations of RGF fragment and in the pres￾ence of both RGF and GAP334 or Rap-GAP. In all experiments
the concentrations of Ras-GTP or Rap-GTP were 50 mM, and the
intrinsic GTPase activities were 0.031 min21 and 0.0032
min21
, respectively (Fig. 4). This confirms the observations
made earlier that the intrinsic GTPase of Rap is approximately
10-fold lower than that of Ras (42). In the presence of 80 mM
RGF-RBD, the GTPase rates of Ras and Rap were decreased to
80 and 25% of the intrinsic rates, respectively. Apparently,
RGF has a considerable effect on Rap as a GTPase-inhibiting
protein, which is negligible on Ras. Subsequently, the effect of
RGF-RBD on the GTPase activities catalyzed by GAP334 and
Rap-GAP was measured (Fig. 4). The concentrations of GAP334
and Rap-GAP were chosen to accelerate the GTPase activity of
Ras and Rap, respectively, to a level that is still measurable on
a minute time scale. The GTPase stimulating activities of
GAP334 on Ras and of Rap-GAP on Rap were strongly inhibited
by the presence of 80 mM RGF-RBD. The GTPase rates found
are 0.026 min21 and 0.0010 min21
, respectively, and they are
very close to the rates measured in the presence of RGF-RBD
alone. The GTPase activity of Rap was also measured in the
presence of Raf-RBD (data not shown), and there was also a
little GTPase-inhibiting effect (60%) and an inhibition of the
Rap-GAP activity.
DISCUSSION
Raf kinase has been widely characterized as a target mole￾cule of Ras (4 –9) and it was shown that it is the translocation
of Raf to the plasma membrane that is essential for its activa￾tion (11–13). Other possible Ras-effector molecules such as
phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (18, 19), MEK kinase (20), RGF
(21–23), protein kinase Cz (43), Rsb’s (24), and Rin (25) have
since been described. Here we have focused our attention to￾ward the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RGF). Be￾cause the effector regions among the members of the Ras pro￾tein family are very similar, it is not surprising that Rap and
R-Ras were also found to interact with Raf and RGF. However,
the proteins of the Ras subfamily have different if not opposing
biological functions in the cell. Thus neither wild type nor a
GTPase-negative Rap1A can transform cells or lead to the
activation of the MAP kinase pathway, and it has in fact been
shown that it can inhibit these Ras-mediated functions (44, 45).
R-Ras and its homologue TC21 seem to have functions partially
overlapping with those of Ras because TC21 has been shown to
be transforming (46, 47), whereas R-Ras induces malignant but
not morphological transformation (36, 48, 49). Here we report
on a quantitative characterization of the interaction between
the Ras family proteins and the effector molecules Raf and
RGF, respectively, in order to address the question of specific￾ity of the interaction between GTP-binding proteins and their
effectors.
We used the inhibitory effect of the effector binding to Ras
proteins upon nucleotide dissociation in order to measure the
affinities in solution. The results obtained by this method were
compared with a direct fluorescence titration experiment that
was possible for the interaction between RGF-RBD and the Ras
mutant Y32W. The good agreement of the results demonstrate
the suitability of the GDI assay used in this work.
The minimal fragment of RGF that is responsible for the
interaction with the Ras proteins must be 83–97 amino acids in
FIG. 4. The GTPase activity of Ras and Rap in presence of
RGF-RBD and GAP. The GTPase activity of 50 mM Ras (upper panel)
or Rap (lower panel) was measured in the absence (E, M) or the pres￾ence (●, f) of 0.14 mg/ml GAP334 or 10 mg/ml Rap-GAP, respectively,
and in the absence (E, ●) or the presence (M, f) of 80 mM RGF-RBD.
6798 Interaction of Ras Proteins with Putative Effector Molecules
 by guest on August 21, 2017 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from length. Based on the solubility and stability of the RGF97
fragment and its CD and NMR spectroscopic properties,2 it
appears that it constitutes an independent folding domain. In
contrast, the GST-RGF83 fusion protein was only poorly solu￾ble, and it was isolated in complex with bacterial DnaK protein,
which indicates that this fragment of RGF is most likely at
least partially unfolded. On incubation of the protein with
thrombin, the RGF83 part turned out to be mostly degraded.
All these observations along with the finding that this protein
did not inhibit nucleotide dissociation from Ras indicate that
these 83 amino acids are not sufficient to constitute the full
RBD of RGF. The question of how many amino acids can be
truncated from the NH2 terminus without affecting the RBD
was not addressed in this work.
We find that the members of the Ras-family, H-Ras, Rap1A,
and R-Ras, show greatly varying affinities to the effector mol￾ecules Raf kinase and RGF. In the case of H-Ras and Rap1A we
find reversal of affinities toward these effectors. Based on these
findings we would suggest that in analogy to the high affinity
Ras-Raf interaction, RGF is the effector molecule of Rap1A.
The negative effect of the D38A mutation on the binding to
RGF-RBD, the fact that complex formation is strongly depend￾ent on GTP, and the finding that RGF-RBD competes with
Rap-GAP for binding to Rap1A are further arguments in favor
of RGF being the effector of Rap1A. It is possible that the
binding affinities of the full-length proteins are different from
those measured with the isolated domains, but the relative
affinities are likely to be the same.
Nothing is known about the function of Rap proteins except
that they have been shown to be possible antagonists of Ras￾dependent signal transduction (44, 45). In light of the low
affinity between Rap and Raf-RBD, which is the direct down￾stream target of Ras, it seems unlikely that this inhibition of
Ras function is due to inhibition of the Ras-Raf interaction by
Rap. It might be possible that the affinity between Ras and Raf
or between Rap and Raf becomes modulated by processes de￾pendent on extracellular signals such as phosphorylation or
translocation. Evidence for such a mechanism has appeared
because it has been shown that Rap1A, which is geranylgera￾nylated at the COOH terminus and is not located in the plasma
membrane but in other particulate fractions of the cell (50- 52),
becomes translocated to the plasma membrane upon cell stim￾ulation in neutrophils (51) or it is incorporated into the cy￾toskeleton after thrombin activation (53). Furthermore, be￾cause the intrinsic GTPase of Rap1A is 10-fold lower than that
of Ras and RGF-RBD slows the GTPase rate of Rap even
further, the low affinity between Raf and Rap might still be
sufficient to inhibit Ras-dependent function upon overexpres￾sion of Rap. It is also possible that Rap inhibits other Ras￾mediated pathways such as those leading to cellular transfor￾mation by mechanisms that are distinct from the kinase
cascade activation (15, 16). A most likely candidate for such a
mediator is GAP334, which has been shown to bind tightly to
Rap1A in vitro (42, 54) and to be associated with Rap1B, which
has the same effector region as Rap1A, during activation of
human platelets (55). In the future it might be useful to use
transfection experiments in order to clarify the relation be￾tween these Ras proteins and their possible effectors.
Apart from being a possible antagonist of Ras, Rap1A also
might have a direct target in cell signaling. Due to the high
affinity of Rap1A for RGF, which is the nucleotide exchange
factor for Ral, it appears that this function of Rap1A should be
mediated by the GTP-binding protein Ral, whose function in
the cell is, however, completely unknown at the moment, ex￾cept that recently the effector of Ral has been found to be a
Rho-type GAP specific for Cdc42 and Rac1 (56, 57). To further
address this point the intracellular localization of the proteins
involved must be investigated.
The structure of the complex between Rap1A and Raf-RBD
(28) has shown that Ras should bind to the effector Raf kinase
in the same way as Rap1A because the amino acid residues
located in the interface are more or less conserved. Because
R-Ras and TC21 also have the same residues in the effector
region, which is usually defined as residues 32– 40, we have to
postulate that a core effector region mediates the binding in￾terface between GTP-binding protein and effector and that
residues outside this core effector region are responsible for the
determination of specificity of these interactions. In contrast,
there is no homology in the primary sequence among the dif￾ferent effector molecules, and it will be very interesting to see
how these proteins, possibly by having a similar topology in
their RBDs, achieve the interaction with the Ras proteins and
how they fine tune their specificity.
