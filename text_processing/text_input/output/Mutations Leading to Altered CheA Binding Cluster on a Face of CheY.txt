CheY is the response regulator of Escherichia coli che￾motaxis and is one of the best studied response regula￾tors of the two-component signaling system. CheY can
receive phosphate from the histidine kinase, CheA.
Phospho-CheY interacts with the motor-switch complex
to induce clockwise flagellar rotation, thus causing the
cell to tumble. We used an enzyme-linked immunosor￾bent assay to study the direct interaction between the
kinase, CheA, and the regulator, CheY. The products of
random, suppressor, and site-specific cheY mutants
were assayed for their ability to bind CheA. Nine mu￾tants showed altered binding. We sequenced and
mapped these point mutations on the crystal structure
of CheY, and a high degree of spatial clustering was
revealed, indicating that this region of CheY is involved
in CheA binding. Interestingly, five of these altered
binding mutants were previously defined as being in￾volved in motor-switch binding interactions. This sug￾gested a possible overlap between the motor-switch
binding and CheA binding surfaces of CheY. Using CheY
(Trp-58) fluorescence quenching, we determined the
equilibrium dissociation constants of CheA (124 –257)
binding for these CheY mutants. The results from the
fluorescence quenching are in close agreement with our
initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results.
Therefore, we propose that the CheA and the motor
binding surfaces on CheY partially overlap and that this
overlap allows CheY to interact with either the CheA or
the flagellar motor, depending on its signaling (phos￾phorylation) state.
Bacterial response to hostile environmental conditions is
regulated by a complex network of interacting proteins, with
the most predominant interactions being generated by mem￾bers of two-component systems (1). In Escherichia coli chemo￾taxis, the interaction between the receptor-coupled histidine
autokinase, CheA, and the response regulator, CheY, controls
the bacterial response to chemical environmental changes (1–
4). In response to changes in the receptor’s occupancy and
adaptation, CheA autophosphorylates (5, 6) and subsequently
transfers its phosphate to either CheY or CheB (7, 8, 15). This
phosphotransfer results from CheY’s intrinsic autophosphoryl￾ation activity and is not due to catalysis by CheA (9, 10).
Studies indicate that phospho-CheY is the activated form that
binds to a motor-switch complex, causing a clockwise flagellar
rotation and a net change in the bacterial swimming direction
(11–13).
Allosteric changes within a large complex containing a re￾ceptor dimer, a CheA dimer, and two copies of a small coupling
protein, CheW, regulate CheA autophosphorylation and subse￾quent phosphotransfer to CheY (11, 14, 22, 23). The autophos￾phorylation site, His-48, lies on the N terminus of CheA, and
the CheY binding determinants lie between residues 124 and
257, commonly known as the P2 domain (17). However, the
CheA binding site on CheY is not defined. Structural studies
indicate that CheY is a single domain protein that folds into a
(b/a)5 topology, with five b-strands forming the hydrophobic
core, surrounded by five a-helices (18, 19). Three aspartate
residues, Asp-12, -13, and -57 form the molecule’s active site,
with Asp-57 being the site where CheY receives the phospho￾group from CheA His-48 (20, 21). Phosphorylated CheY loses
its affinity for CheA (23) and shows high binding affinity for
FliM, one of the motor-switch components (13).
It has been estimated that E. coli contains about 50 homol￾ogous two-component systems, which govern various cellular
responses to stress (1, 3). Since the active site of response
regulators is highly conserved (1), CheA must be able to differ￾entiate CheY from other potential response regulators. Very
recently, an NMR study on the interaction between an N￾terminal fragment of CheA (1-233) and CheY has defined the
CheA (1-233) binding site on CheY by measuring the chemical
shift changes in CheY upon CheA (1-233) addition (26). Resi￾dues identified here lie distinct from the active site on a-4, b-4,
a-5, and b-5 of CheY.
In the present study, we have employed a CheY-CheA bind￾ing assay, based on the ELISA,1 to characterize, in vitro, the
interaction between full-length CheA and CheY and to screen
CheY mutants for possible defects in CheA binding. The mu￾tants that altered the CheA interaction had amino acid posi￾tions clustered on a face of the CheY protein, and this three￾dimensional clustering suggested that this region of CheY is
involved in CheA binding.

 at BRUNEL UNIV on March 31, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from mid-exponential phase, induced appropriately for 4 –16 h, harvested
and resuspended in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.9), and stored at 270 °C until
sonicated. Overexpressing lysates were obtained by thawing cells and
sonicating them three to five times for 1 min and then centrifuging
them at 30,000 3 g for 20 min. The supernatant fraction was used as a
source of Che proteins. The wild-type CheY was overproduced from
plasmid pRL22DZ in the E. coli-K12 strain CY15040 by inducing ex￾pression at 42 °C (27). The mutant CheY proteins were overproduced
from similar plasmid constructs (Table I) in SG1 strain (devoid of
wild-type CheY), which was used to eliminate wild-type CheY contam￾ination. All CheY proteins (wild-type and mutants) were purified as
previously published (27). CheA was overproduced using the plasmid
pDV4DEcoRV, and the CheA and CheW were overproduced using
pDV4. CheA was purified as previously published (28). P2, a fragment
of CheA, was overproduced from plasmid pTM22 in RP437 cells by
inducing cells at mid-exponential phase with 100 mM isopropyl-b-D￾thiogalactoside, and the protein was purified using a protocol by
McEvoy et al.2
In Vitro Mutagenesis of the cheY Gene—The plasmid-carrying cheY
gene (pRL22DZ) was mutagenized using hydroxylamine mutagenesis
(29). The mutagenized plasmid DNA was transformed into competent
RP4079 cells, and transformants were plated by mixing with a tryptone
swarm agar. After overnight incubation at 30 °C, Che1 bacterial colo￾nies appeared as miniswarms. Colonies exhibiting no swarm or mini￾mal swarm were picked as mutants, and their mutant phenotype was
confirmed by transforming a fresh batch of RP4079 competent cells
with DNA isolated from each of the colonies.
DNA Sequencing—Double-stranded high copy number plasmid
pRL22DZ, bearing putative cheY mutations, was DNA sequenced by a
dideoxy chain termination method, using the protocol provided by the
manufacturer of Sequenase, version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Se￾quencing was facilitated by three appropriately situated, non-coding
strand oligonucleotide primers that were specific for cheY.
Binding Assay—The binding assay was performed by coating micro￾titer plate wells with 100 ml of 2-fold, serially diluted rabbit anti-CheY
antibody in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.9 (starting with 240 ng antibody in 100 ml
of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.9). The plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C, and
the following day the wells were washed three times with 200 ml of
blocking buffer (buffer B, 1% dry skim milk and 0.1% sodium azide in
50 mM Tris, pH 7.9) and incubated overnight with buffer B to block any
unoccupied sites. On the third day, the wells were washed three more
times with buffer B, and 100 ml of each protein (in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.9)
was added in a sequential manner to react with the antibody, with each
addition being followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h and
then washed three times with buffer B. The proteins used in the above
step include 1) purified CheY or freshly prepared cell lysate with over￾expressed CheY (50 –100 ng/ml), 2) cell lysate with overexpressed CheA/
CheW (0.5–1.0 ng/ml), 3) monoclonal anti-CheA antibody (CA1. 4.21, 1.0
ng/ml), and 4) IgG-specific antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase
(1:1000 dilution). Finally, the wells were washed five times with buffer
B, and each well had 200 ml of 37 mg of ortho-nitrophenyl phosphate
(substrate) in 22 ml of glycine buffer (1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, and
7.5 g of glycine in 1 liter adjusted to pH 10.0 with 1 M NaOH) added to
it. After incubating for approximately 1 h at room temperature, absorb￾ance readings were taken at 405 nm in an ELISA reader (Bio-tek
Instruments, EL311).
Fluorescence Quenching—Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of
P2 (CheA 124 –257) binding for the wild-type as well as the mutant
CheYs were determined according to Swanson et al. (26) by fluorescence
quenching using a Perkin Elmer LS50 bioluminescence spectrophotom￾eter. At a constant slit width of 10 nm, the Trp-58 of CheY was excited
at 285 nm, and the emission was recorded at 346 nm. The P2 solution
was added in small, measured increments, and the corresponding
changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of CheY, as a function of P2
concentration, were monitored as a direct assay for P2 binding (26).
In some experiments, at high concentrations of P2 (.20 mM), the
emission intensity, which until this point was approaching a mini￾mum, began to increase again. Control experiments with P2 alone (no
CheY) at concentrations over 20 mM showed some absorbance at 285
nm, indicating the presence of some contaminating tryptophan in the
P2 prep. More quantitative experiments (not described in detail)
yielded a maximum emission of 500 ppm (,10% that of 1 mM CheY) by
40 mM P2. The corresponding data for CheY-P2 binding were adjusted
accordingly.
RESULTS
Detection of CheY-CheA Binding with ELISA—Based on
ELISA, a sensitive and specific CheY-CheA binding assay was
developed, which used a CheY-CheA complex as the antigen
sandwiched between an anti-CheY antibody and an anti-CheA
monoclonal antibody. This whole complex was detected by
mouse-IgG-specific antibody conjugated with alkaline phos￾phatase (Fig. 1). Since the assay was done in microtiter plates,

CheA Binding Surface of CheY 24415
 at BRUNEL UNIV on March 31, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from it required a very small amount of the sample, and coating the
microtiter wells with polyclonal rabbit anti-CheY antibody pro￾vided a simple means to affinity purify and concentrate the
CheY from an overexpressed cell lysate (see “Materials and
Methods”).
The assay was performed using cell lysates overexpressing
CheY and CheA/CheW. To measure background activity, ly￾sates with either no CheY or a CheY deletion (D18 –28) were
used. As seen in Fig. 2, the wells containing wild-type CheY
produced stronger signals than the negative controls, with the
signal to noise ratio being at least 2 to 1. The signal obtained
from the negative controls was due to a cross-reactivity of the
anti-CheY antibody to CheA, which could not be completely
eliminated. The mouse monoclonal antibody to CheA and the
class-specific anti-mouse antibody did not cross-react with
CheY (data not shown).
Isolation and Screening of CheY Mutants Resulting in
Altered CheA Binding—65 random CheY mutants, generated
by hydroxylamine mutagenesis, 6 CheY suppressors to motor￾switch mutants, and 2 site-specific mutants, D13K and Y106W,
were examined for CheA binding. 9 of these mutants exhibited
altered binding properties, with 8 of the 9 showing decreased
binding and 1 showing a slight increase in binding (Fig. 3).
DNA sequencing revealed that all the random mutants, with
altered CheA binding, carried a single-point mutation in the
cheY gene (data not shown). The majority of the CheY mutants
screened by ELISA demonstrated CheA binding similar to that
of the wild-type CheY.
Mapping of Altered Binding CheY Mutants on the CheY
Structure—Red atoms in Fig. 4 depict the positions on CheY
where mutant CheY residues result in altered CheA binding.
They cluster to a region, distinct from the active site on the
CheY surface, and this high degree of clustering suggests that
it is the CheA binding surface. The CheY mutants that do not
alter CheA binding were not found on this proposed surface
(Fig. 4, green atoms). This proposed CheA binding surface
consists of solvent-accessible surfaces of the C terminus of b-4
(Thr-87), loop region between b-4 and a-4 (Ala-90, Glu-93), b-5
(Tyr-106, Val-108), the loop between b-5 and a-5 (Phe-111,
Thr-112), and a-5 (Glu-117). Interestingly, several of these
residues (Fig. 4, covered by stippling) were previously impli￾cated (25) in motor-switch interactions. This identified a sur￾face common to both interactions. All of these residues are
surface located and solvent accessible. Their side chains, with
the exceptions of Thr-87 and Phe-111, extend out to the sur￾rounding solvent, toward a region where it can easily make
contact with CheA. Asp-13 is not located on this proposed
surface, and it seems possible that the altered CheA binding
properties of the mutant D13K may be due to an altered con￾formation (see “Discussion”).
The substitutions that affected binding also make sense
chemically in the context of an altered protein-interaction sur￾face. For example, the two glutamate-to-lysine substitutions
(E93K, E117K) involve charge changes that could affect the
electrostatic interactions between the interacting proteins.
FIG. 2. Binding of CheA to immobilized CheY. Binding of CheA/
CheW complex to immobilized CheY was determined by the ELISA￾based CheY-CheA binding assay for wild-type CheY (circles) and CheY
(D18 –28, squares) by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm plotted as a
function of the anti-CheY antibody serial dilution. The background was
determined by using CheA/CheW without CheY (triangles). All the Che
proteins were obtained from overexpressing cell lysates.
FIG. 3. CheY mutants with altered
CheA binding. Nine CheY mutants
(bars), which showed significant differ￾ences in CheA binding (at least 625% of
wild-type binding, out of 73 screened) as
determined by ELISA. Results are mean
6 S.D. of three experiments, normalized
to binding of wild-type CheY to CheA. The
location (shown by the numbers) of muta￾tion and the amino acid change (shown by
single letter symbols, wild type first) in
the mutants were determined by DNA se￾quencing. The CheY mutants (also the
wild type indicated by WT) are arranged
in increasing order of KD values as deter￾mined by fluorescence quenching (line).
24416 CheA Binding Surface of CheY
 at BRUNEL UNIV on March 31, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from The other substitutions involve side group volume changes
(A90V, Y106W, V108M) as well as the hydrophobicity
changes (T87I, T112I). Among these residues, only Thr-87
and Phe-111 have their side chains directed in toward CheY’s
hydrophobic core, and in these cases, only the backbone por￾tion of these residues seems to contribute to the proposed CheA
binding surface, so the influence of the side chain may be more
indirect.
Determination of Binding Affinities Using Trp-58 Fluores￾cence Quenching—Tryptophan fluorescence quenching was
used to quantitate the CheY mutant affinities for the CheY
binding region of CheA. The P2 region of CheA has been shown
to contain the major binding determinants for CheY interaction
(16, 17). The P2 fragment is devoid of Trp and has been shown
to quench the fluorescence of CheY, Trp-58, upon binding (26).
Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) determined by fluores￾cence quenching of CheY (Table II) were found to be inversely
correlated to the binding determined by ELISA (Fig. 3). For
example, T87I showed slightly higher binding in the ELISA
method and, as expected, 2-fold lower KD. Whereas, E93K,
Y106W, V108M, F111V, T112I, and E117K showed decreased
binding in the ELISA method and severalfold increased KD
values (Table II). D13K and A90V show no changes in their P2
binding affinity as determined by fluorescence quenching. Al￾though it is known that D13K is defective in Mg21 binding (31)
and that Mg21 binding quenches the Trp fluorescence (30),
assaying P2 binding to D13K may not be comparable to the

CheA Binding Surface of CheY 24417
 at BRUNEL UNIV on March 31, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from wild type or other mutants, it is also possible that the residues
Ala-90 and Asp-13 may be critical for the intact CheA binding
but not for the P2 binding.
DISCUSSION
The goal of this study was to define the CheA binding face of
CheY. We screened cheY mutants for altered CheA interaction,
using a modified version of the ELISA (32), which is a specific,
economic, and sensitive assay. A technical problem with this
method was a reduced signal to noise ratio caused by a high
background. This was determined to be due to the cross-reac￾tivity of the polyclonal anti-CheY antibody to CheA. Affinity
purification of the CheY antibody on a CheY column reduced
but did not eliminate this cross-reactivity. However, none of the
other components nor antibodies demonstrated significant
background.
Use of this assay enabled us to identify nine point mutants,
D13K, T87I, A90V, E93K, Y106W, V108M, F111V, T112I, and
E117K, which showed altered CheA binding. The most striking
result is their location on the CheY molecule and the fact that
they clearly cluster on the face of CheY. This clustering be￾comes functionally more significant, since many of these resi￾dues (90, 108, 111, 112, and 117) were previously identified by
genetic suppression analysis to be involved in motor-switch
interaction (25). The motor-switch suppressor E27K was the
only putative position that interacts with the motor switch that
did not alter CheA binding. Another study, using NMR spec￾troscopy to examine the interaction of CheA1-233 with CheY
(26), came to the same conclusion that an overlap exists be￾tween the motor switch and the P2 binding surfaces on CheY.
Interestingly, another study indicated that a number of resi￾dues, showing chemical shift changes upon phosphorylation, lie
in this region (24). Combining these results with the observa￾tions that phospho-CheY does not stay in complex with CheA
(23) but binds to FliM with a higher affinity than apo-CheY
(13), we propose that 1) the overlap region in the unphospho￾rylated state contributes to the CheA binding surface, 2) phos￾phorylation alters the topology of this overlap region, and 3) the
phosphorylation-induced changes may be responsible for both
CheA releasing CheY and CheY’s increased affinity for the
flagellar motor. This kind of overlap enables CheY to interact
with several proteins with the specificity for each interaction
being governed by its signaling state.
Although the region where our mutants clustered is similar
to the region identified by the P2-CheY NMR study (26), some
residues were unique to each study. In our study, the mu￾tagenesis may not have been saturated, despite the recur￾rence of T112I, and since we screened for total non-chemo￾taxis, it is possible that we might have missed some mutants
that had reduced binding and partial chemotaxis function. In
the NMR study, chemical shift changes in the backbone am￾ide residues were measured, and only those chemical shift
changes greater than 60 Hz were considered significant. It is
possible that some residues, indicated in this study, may
affect the binding through their solvent-accessible side
chains but do not result in DHz greater than 60. The side
chain of Phe-111 is buried inside CheY’s hydrophobic core
(18) and may seem to be an exception, but NMR data show
that Phe-111 shifts upon adding CheA(1-233), although the
observed chemical shift change is less than 60 Hz. Since
CheA has been shown to bind to CheY as a dimer (23), some
of the residues we identified, which are not indicated by NMR
studies, may be critical for CheA dimer binding.
The D13K mutant is a dominant tumbly mutation, also
found to be defective in CheA binding. One possible explana￾tion is that this mutant has acquired a conformation resem￾bling phospho-CheY, and hence it is defective in CheA binding.
Welch et al. (13) found that it binds to FliM with higher affinity
than the apo-CheY, and this is consistent with the possibility
of a conformational similarity between this mutant and the
phospho-CheY.
Our results identify mutations that can alter the CheY-CheA
binding, and it is possible that some of our mutations may have
introduced a structural change that sterically disrupted bind￾ing rather than remove an interaction contributing to the bind￾ing. Also, a mutation can alter CheA binding, either by specif￾ically changing the interaction surface or by nonspecifically
causing a change in folding. Since all of the mutants we char￾acterized were overproduced in the stable form and can be
phosphorylated by CheA (except D13K (data not shown)), the
probability of any major folding defects occurring is reduced.
Also, the crystal structures of T87I and Y106W3 do not show
altered folding (33). The most striking evidence is derived
from the clustering of these mutations on one face of CheY
molecule. We also mapped the positions of five cheY mutants
not displaying altered CheA binding, and these mutations
are not found on our proposed CheA binding face (green
atoms, Fig. 4).
It is clear that the CheA binding face of CheY that our study
identified lies distinct from the active site of the molecule.
Recognition by CheA, away from the highly conserved active
site of CheY (3), may be a way of acquiring specificity for this
interaction. On the other hand, evidence for an overlap be￾tween CheA binding face and motor-switch binding face makes
the structural aspects of CheY more interesting. While more
work will be needed for the absolute determination of the
region of overlap between the two faces, it will be interesting to
know the region of CheY involved in the binding of CheZ, the
only protein besides CheA and motor-switch proteins, that is
known to interact with CheY (34). This will provide a better
understanding of the structural aspects of CheY’s activity and
the regulation of chemotaxis.
