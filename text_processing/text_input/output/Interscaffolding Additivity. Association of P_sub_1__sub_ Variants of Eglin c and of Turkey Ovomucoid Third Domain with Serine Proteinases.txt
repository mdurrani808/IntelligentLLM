ABSTRACT: Standard mechanism protein inhibitors of serine proteinases share a common mechanism of
interaction with their cognate enzymes. The P1 residue of the inhibitor interacts with the enzyme in a
substrate-like manner. Its side chain becomes imbedded in the S1 cavity of the enzyme. The nature of
P1, the primary specificity residue, greatly affects the strength and specificity of the enzyme inhibitor
association. In canonical inhibitors, residues P4-P2′(P3′), where P1-P1′ is the reactive site, share a common
main chain conformation that does not change on complex formation. The remainder of the inhibitor’s
structure, the scaffolding, is not always common. Instead, there are at least 20 inhibitor families, each
with a different scaffolding. In this paper, we ask whether the differences in standard free energy of
association of enzyme-inhibitor complexes upon P1 mutations are independent of the nature of the
scaffolding. We have already reported on 25 P1 variants of turkey ovomucoid third domain, a member
of the Kazal inhibitor family, interacting with six different serine proteinases. Here, we report on seven
different P1 variants of eglin c, a potato I family member, interacting with the same six serine proteinases
under the same conditions. The differences in standard free energy on P1 mutations in the eglin c system
agree very well, when P1 Pro is omitted. Complete agreement indicates that these P1 residues are
interscaffolding additive. This is consistent with the superimposition of the high-resolution structures of
eglin c and of turkey ovomucoid third domain with chymotrypsin. In both cases, the P1 Leu side chain
is similarly oriented in almost indistinguishable specificity pockets of the enzyme.
Association of standard mechanism (Laskowski & Kato,
1980), canonical (Bode & Huber, 1992) protein inhibitors
of serine proteinases with their cognate enzymes involves
about a dozen of the residues of the inhibitor (Figure 1)
making contact with the enzyme. Standard mechanism
inhibitors are ones where the enzyme-inhibitor complex can
reversibly dissociate into two different sets of products. One
set consists of the enzyme and the original inhibitor, with
all of its peptide bonds intact. Such an inhibitor is called
the virgin inhibitor. The other set consists of the enzyme
and the inhibitor with one of its peptide bonds, called the
reactive site peptide bond, hydrolyzed. Such an inhibitor is
called the modified inhibitor. It is an assertion of the
standard mechanism that the virgin and modified inhibitors
are both comparably thermodynamically efficient as inhibi￾tors, although (Ardelt & Laskowski, 1985) they may
dramatically differ in their kinetic efficiency. In the Schecter
and Berger (1967) notation, which is now widely used by
students of proteinase substrates and inhibitors, the reactive
site peptide bond connects residues P1 and P1′. Other
residues are numbered sequentially by their distance from
the reactive site (Figure 1). A large number of free inhibitors
and an even larger number of enzyme-inhibitor complexes
had their three-dimensional structures determined by X-ray
crystallography, NMR, or both. A general conclusion has
emerged that residues P4-P2′(P3′) exhibit the same Ram￾achandran angles in many free inhibitors studied. Upon
complex formation, these Ramachandran angles do not
appreciably change. Bode and Huber (1992) named inhibi￾tors with this conformation of P4-P2′(P3′) canonical inhibi￾tors. It is now commonly believed that being a standard
mechanism inhibitor is necessary and sufficient for being
canonical.
Upon complex formation, the P1 residue of the inhibitor
becomes imbedded in the S1 cavity of the enzyme. In most
natural trypsin inhibitors, the P1 residue is Arg or Lys. In
chymotrypsin inhibitors, it is an aromatic amino acid or Leu
or Met, and in porcine pancreatic elastase inhibitors, it is
Leu or Ala. Therefore, the P1 residue in substrates and in
protein inhibitors is often referred to as the primary specific￾ity residue and the S1 cavity as the primary specificity cavity.
Sealock and Laskowski (1969) devised the first method for
replacing amino acid residues in proteins. They replaced
P1 Arg63 in soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) by P1 Lys63
and found that it was still a powerful trypsin inhibitor. Leary
and Laskowski (1973) switched the P1 Arg63 residue to P1
Trp63 and as expected found it to be a powerful chymotrypsin
inhibitor. Since the advent of more elaborate semisynthesis,
total synthesis, and, most of all, site specific mutagenesis,
many replacements were made at P1 in many laboratories.
They were frequently successful in switching the specificity
of the inhibitor in a desired manner.

S0006-2960(96)02087-9 CCC: $14.00 © 1997 American Chemical SocietyA single-domain, standard mechanism, canonical protein
inhibitor can inhibit only one enzyme molecule at a time.
However, just as one kind of enzyme can be inhibited by
many different kinds of inhibitors, so can one kind of
inhibitor inhibit many different kinds of enzymes. Structural
studies and especially chemical studies (Bidlingmeyer et al.,
1972; Ardelt & Laskowski, 1985) show that all the inhibited
enzymes utilize the same reactive site peptide bond and the
same P1 residue is imbedded in the different S1 cavities of
the various cognate enzymes.
If the P1 residue is mutated to Gly, the positive interaction
between the S1 cavity and the P1 side chain disappears as
Gly has no side chain. Mutation to a very awkwardly shaped
or to a potentially charged side chain may actually make
the P1 side chain-S1 cavity interaction locally deleterious.
Turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3)1 (Figure 1)
is a standard mechanism, canonical protein inhibitor of serine
proteinases. We have prepared 25 P1 mutants (all 20 coded,
5 noncoded) of this protein. We studied (Lu et al., 1997)
their binding to six serine proteinases at pH 8.3 and 21 ( 2
°C. Among the six enzymes, one was SGPB. It turns out
that, of the 25 variants we studied, three (Pro, Asp, and Glu)
are locally deleterious. We obtained high-resolution struc￾tures of many of the 25 variants in complex with SGPB
(Huang et al., 1995; Huang, 1995; K. Huang, K. S. Bateman,
W. Lu, S. Anderson, M. Laskowski, Jr., and M. N. G. James,
unpublished). Among the completed structures are P1 Gly18
(neutral) and the three locally deleterious ones (P1 Pro18, P1
Asp18, and P1 Glu18). In each case, the P1 side chain binds
to the S1 cavity and the P1 O atom binds to the oxyanion
hole. The available evidence is consistent with the view that
the standard mechanism canonical inhibitors act as molecular
vises; they deliver the P1 side chain of the inhibitor to the
S1 cavity of the enzyme whether (as it generally is) the
interaction is favorable, or even when it is neutral or locally
deleterious.
As discussed above, Lu et al. (1997) acquired a set of 150
(6 × 25) enzyme-inhibitor equilibrium constants. The
obvious question to be addressed is how general are the data.
It is clear that the association equilibrium constants do not
directly apply to other inhibitors. It is well known that
bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz), BPTI, with a
Lys15 at P1 is one of the most powerful natural inhibitors of
bovine â-trypsin with a Ka of >1013 M-1 (Vincent &
Lazdunski, 1972; Finkenstadt et al., 1974). In sharp contrast,
chicken ovomucoid first domain with P1 Lys24 is ineffective
as an inhibitor of â-trypsin (Kato et al., 1987). Clearly,
residues other than P1 exert huge cumulative effects on Ka.
The P1 Ka data for X18 OMTKY3 can still be general if the
relatiVe Ka values apply to other inhibitors. The constancy
of relative equilibrium constants is totally equivalent to the
additivity of free energy contributions due to the P1 residue.
The concept of additivity of residue free energy contribu￾tions arose many times in many laboratories that were
interested in comparing properties of multiple mutants of
their protein to those of the same protein’s individual single
mutants. We used it for analysis of Ka’s of natural variants
of avian ovomucoid third domains (Laskowski et al., 1983).
Carter et al. (1984) used it for site specific mutants of Tyr

Avian ovomucoid third domains are abbreviated OMXXX3, where the
first two letters indicate ovomucoid, the next three show the species of
bird, and the final digit signifies the domain. TKY is turkey, Melleagris
gallopoVo, and MNQ is Montezuma or harlequin quail, Cyrtonyx
montezumae. BPTI is bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Residues
in OMTKY3 and in eglin c are numbered both sequentially and by
Schecter and Berger (1967) with the Pn and Pn′ notation from their
reactive sites (see Figure 1). When the distinction between enzyme
and inhibitor residues is required, the inhibitor residues are preceded
by I. 2 The consensus is among the complexes of eglin c with subtilisin
Carlsberg, CARL, subtilisin BPN′, thermitase, mesentericopeptidase,
and chymotrypsin (Bode et al., 1987; McPhalen & James, 1988; Gros
et al., 1989; Heinz et al., 1991; Dauter & Betzel, 1991; Frigerio et al.,

Wells (1990) defines additivity as the absence of the ∆GI°
term [interaction energy of Carter et al. (1984)] in
∆∆G(X,Y)° is the difference in ∆G° values between the
combined mutant X,Y and the wild type, and ∆∆G(X)° and
∆∆G(Y)° are the differences between the mutants X and Y
and the wild type, respectively. The X mutation and Y
mutation clearly must be made at different positions, but they
need not necessarily be single mutations. For our purposes,
mutation X will be a single change of the P1 residue.
However, Y can be a single change or several changes at
positions other than P1 as long as the same changes are made
in both the combined X,Y and the Y mutant. From the
extensive work of natural variants of avian ovomucoid third
domains, we had available data for the construction of many
additivity cycles. Figure 2 (top) may serve as an example.
It was found that, within the available group of avian
ovomucoids, the P1 substitutions were highly, although not
perfectly, additive [Figure 7 in Lu et al. (1997)]. It is
therefore clear that the data should be helpful in designing
multiple variants of OMTKY3 as strong and highly specific
inhibitors of serine proteinases. Unfortunately, data were
not conveniently available to extend the additivity tests to
other members of the Kazal inhibitor family such as
pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitors from various verte￾brates, ovoinhibitor domains, and even avian ovomucoid first
and second domains.
However, not all standard mechanism canonical protein
inhibitors of serine proteinase are homologous as might have
been expected. Instead, they consist of many families
(Laskowski & Sealock, 1971; Laskowski & Kato, 1980;
Laskowski, 1986). As more inhibitors are discovered, the
number of families is growing. At the current count, there
are 20 different families. The relationship between families
is best illustrated in Figure 3, where the combining regions
of OMTKY3 and of eglin c and their P1 Leu residues are
superimposed. In contrast to the expected excellent super￾imposition, the global three-dimensional structures are
entirely different. There is no recognizable sequence homol￾ogy. We refer to the nonsuperimposable global structures
as the scaffolding. If additivity comparisons are made among
inhibitors that share the entire global conformation, we talk
about intrascaffolding additivity. If, however, additivity
comparisons are made between two different scaffoldings,
we talk about interscaffolding additivity (Figure 2, bottom).
The objective of this paper is to carry out a test of
interscaffolding additivity.
In order to make interscaffolding comparisons, we needed
a moderately large set of P1 variants for an inhibitor other
than a Kazal family member. The Procter and Gamble group
had a set of seven P1 variants of eglin c and agreed to
cooperate with us. Eglin c (Figure 1) is a member of the
potato I family (Laskowski & Kato, 1980). Its sequence and
scaffolding (Figures 1 and 3) are strikingly different from
that of OMTKY3, as eglin c has no disulfide bridges and is
stabilized solely by noncovalent interactions. On the other
hand, the main chain conformations of the combining loops
of the two inhibitors superimpose superbly (Figure 3). The
sequences in this region are also similar (Figure 1). Both
inhibitors have P1 Leu (Leu18 and Leu45, respectively). In
this paper, we measure Ka values for the available eglin c
variants with six serine proteinases studied by Lu et al.
(1997). We compare the results to the OMTKY3 results
and show that the changes at P1 are highly additive except
for P1 Pro. An explanation for the lack of additivity of this
residue is proposed.
Both eglin c and OMTKY3 have been subject to extensive
structural studies. In particular, high-resolution structures
of eglin c (Frigerio et al., 1992) and of OMTKY3 (Fujinaga
et al., 1987) with the same enzyme, bovine chymotrypsin
AR, were reported. As the thermodynamic comparisons are

difference between the third and fourth lines gives interscaffolding

1600 Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 7, 1997 Qasim et al.focused on the binding of P1 side chains to S1 cavities, we
carried out a superimposition of these regions in both
structures. The finding of near identity of the conformation
of the S1 pocket of chymotrypsin and of the conformation
of the P1 Leu side chain in that pocket greatly raises the
confidence in the validity of the thermodynamic conclusion
that, for Leu and several other side chains, this is an additive
system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Expression of Eglin c Variants. A synthetic eglin c gene
was constructed which was identical to the EcoRI to BamHI
synthetic eglin c gene fragment described by Rink et al.
(1984) except that we omitted the ATG adjacent to the EcoRI
site.
The expression plasmid used (see Figure 4) was based on
a pUB110/pBS+ shuttle vector containing the Bacillus
amyloliquefaciens subtilisin gene (Vasantha et al., 1984). The
plasmid derived from a plasmid containing (1) 3.2 kb of
pBS+, from its HindIII site to its XbaI site, (2) a 4.2 kb
fragment of pUB110 from its XbaI site to its BamHI site,
(3) a 33 bp fragment of a synthetic human parathyroid gene
(Saunders et al., 1991) from its BglII site to its HindIII site,
and (4) a 1.8 kb segment consisting of the subtilisin gene,
flanked by HindIII sites. EcoRI and BamHI sites were
removed from this plasmid by digestion with those enzymes,
treatment with T4 polymerase in the presence of four
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, and ligation.
The subtilisin gene was modified to contain an EcoRI site
following the second codon of the prosequence, as identified
by Vasantha et al. (1984), and a BamHI site following the
stop codon. These changes were made using the oligo￾nucleotides 5′-GCC CAG GCG GCA GGG GAA TTC AAA
TCA AAC GGG GAA-3′ and 5′-GCG GCA GCT CAG
TAA GGA TCC AAC ATA AAA AAC CGG C-3′. The
synthetic eglin c gene was cloned into the expression plasmid
between the EcoRI and BamHI sites.
Because of the nature of the gene fusion, each eglin c
additionally contains four extra amino acid residues at its
amino terminus: Ala and Gly from the prosequence of
subtilisin and Glu and Phe from the EcoRI site at the fusion
(see Figure 1).
Site-Directed Mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was
carried out using the Kunkel method (Sambrook et al., 1989).
The following oligonucleotides were used to create the
indicated changes at the P1 position of eglin c: Ser, 5′-TCT

ACT CCG GAC CTG CGT TAC AAC CGT-3′. All
mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using Applied
Biosystems’ Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit and an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA
Sequencer.
Purification of Eglin c Variants. Eglin c variants were
harvested from plasmid-bearing derivatives of Bacillus
subtilis strain PG632 (Saunders et al., 1991). The culture
(200 mL) was incubated overnight at 37 °C in 2 X YT
(Sambrook et al., 1989) supplemented with 50 µg/mL
kanamycin. The cell pellet was removed by centrifugation,
and the pH of the supernatant was brought to 3 with the
addition of 1 N HCI. The insoluble material was pelleted
again by centrifugation at 22000g, and the supernatant was
filtered through a 0.2 µm membrane. The sample was
dialyzed overnight against 20 mM sodium acetate at pH 4.
The sample was then purified on an S Sepharose column in
the same buffer. Elution was performed with a 0 to 0.6 M
sodium chloride gradient. The sample was concentrated by
evaporation and dialyzed against 1 mM MES and 0.5 mM
EDTA at pH 6.2. The identity of samples was confirmed
by ion spray mass spectrometry.
Ka Determination. Determinations of equilibrium con￾stants were carried out by an extensively modified procedure
of Green and Work (1953), as described by Empie and
Laskowski (1982) with later modifications by Park (1985)
and Wynn (1990). CHYM, CARL, and HLE were purchased
from Worthington Biochemical Co., Sigma Chemical Co.,
and Elastin Products Co., respectively. PPE was a gift from
the late Dr. M. Laskowski, Sr. SGPA and SGPB were
purified from pronase (Sigma) in our laboratory. The results
on all commercial enzymes were compared to those on
enzymes obtained from expert (see Acknowledgment) do￾nors. The commercial samples were used only when the
results agreed. For most enzymes we studied, the procedure
allows for the determination of Ka values over 10 orders of
magnitude (Ka from about 103 to 1013 M-1
) with an accuracy
of (20%. The substrate hydrolysis data were collected on
a Hewlett-Packard HP8450A diode array spectrophotometer
at 21 ( 2 °C and pH 8.30 in 0.1 M Tris/HCI containing
0.005% Triton X-100 and 0.02 M CaCl2. The residual
enzyme concentrations in the incubation mixture were
measured using appropriate tri- or tetrapeptide p-nitroanilide
chromogenic substrates.
Superimpositions. Atomic coordinates were obtained from
the PDB (Bernstein et al., 1977) (CHYM and eglin c, lacb;
CHYM and OMTKY3, 1cho). The crystal forms used to
determine the structures of the two complexes were non￾isomorphous. Therefore, the crystal packing interactions are
expected to be different. InsightII was used to superimpose
the core chymotrypsin residues from the active site and S1
pocket. Specifically, atoms from residues 41-43, 55-59,
101-104, 189-196, 213-217, and 225-228 were chosen
FIGURE 4: To produce eglin variants, we used Bacillus subtilis
strains carrying a plasmid with four functional parts. One, the
plasmid contained most of pBS+ (open section) which enabled it
to replicate, confer ampicillin resistance, and be used as a template
for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in Escherichia coli. Two,
the plasmid contained pUB110 (hatched section) which enabled it
to replicate and confer kanamycin resistance in B. subtilis. Three,
the plasmid contained the B. amyloliquefaciens subtilisin gene (apr)
regulatory signals and signal sequence coding region (double￾hatched section). Four, the plasmid contained a synthetic eglin gene
(egl) (closed section).

the two complexes. Root mean square deviations (rmsds)
were calculated with the difres program from the CCP4
program suite.
RESULTS
Ka Values. The seven P1 eglin c variants were expressed
and purified as described. Their masses determined by ion
spray mass spectrometry were in excellent agreement with
those expected from their amino acid sequences (Figure 1,
modified at P1 as appropriate).
Table 1 lists Ka values for the interaction of each of these
seven variants with each of the six serine proteinases
employed by Bigler et al. (1993) and Lu et al. (1997) in
their extensive study of the interaction of 25 P1 variants of
OMTKY3. The 25 variant OMTKY3 set contains all seven
P1 residues found in the eglin c set. To further improve the
comparability of the eglin c and of the OMTKY3 sets, the
Ka values for both inhibitors were determined by the same
method, in the same laboratory, under common conditions
(pH, temperature, and ionic environment).
In the OMTKY3 work (Lu et al., 1997), Ka values were
determined for all 150 (25 × 6) combinations. All the values
fell within the 500-1013 M-1 dynamic range of measure￾ment. Surprisingly, this rather broad range proved insuf￾ficient for some of the eglin c variants. SGPA and SGPB
are much more strongly inhibited by eglin c variants than
by corresponding OMTKY3 variants. The Ka value for the
eglin c P1 Leu variant interacting with either SGPA or SGPB
is greater than 1013 M-1
. PPE is much more weakly inhibited
by eglin c variants than by corresponding variants of
OMTKY3. The Ka values for the P1 Asp and Glu eglin c
variants are lower than 500 M-1
.
Inspection of Table 1 shows that inhibition by correspond￾ing eglin c and OMTKY3 variants is not the same. This
was expected as eglin c does not have the same contact
residues at many positions other than P1. Eglin c is better
for five of the six enzymes: SGPB > SGPA > HLE >
CARL > CHYM. It is much weaker for PPE. However,

a In each case, the data in italics are for a corresponding variant of OMTKY3 (Lu et al., 1997) and the number in bold is the eglin c/OMTKY3
ratio. All the eglin c and OMTKY3 data were determined directly by the same method at pH 8.3 and t ) 21 ( 2 °C. Numbers in parentheses are
the non-hydrogen atoms in each side chain. These data were converted to -∆Ga°(P1 ) X), and the remainder of the paper uses only those values.
1602 Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 7, 1997 Qasim et al.in each column, the ratios of corresponding variants are
approximately the same (with some strong exceptions dealt
with below). This is analyzed quantitatively below. It may
be useful to point out that, if the system showed perfect
interscaffolding additivity, the ratios in each column would
be identical. Another way to word the same conclusion is
to say that the relative equilibrium constants within each
variant set would be identical.
Interscaffolding AdditiVity. In order to serve as input for
additivity comparisons, the Ka data of Table 1 were converted
into changes in standard free energy of association by the
use of the relation ∆Ga° (P1 ) X) ) -RT ln Ka(P1 ) X).
From these values, increments arising from mutating P1
residues were calculated. Consider the two horizontal lines
of the bottom part of Figure 2. For these we can write
and
It follows from Figure 2 and eqs 1-3 that
where ∆GI° is the free energy of interaction. For the specific
case of Leu f Ser mutation, ∆GI° can be calculated for each
of the six enzymes. However, as we are dealing here with
seven different P1 residues, we could calculate ∆GI° for 21
[(7 × 6)/2] combinations, each for six enzymes, provided
all Ka values were available. The lack of four eglin c Ka
values reduces the number of available ∆GI° values to 103
from the hoped for 126. These are listed in Table 2. If the
system were to be strictly additive, there would be no
standard free energy of interaction and all of the entries in
Table 2 would be zero. It is clear that except for G f S for
chymotrypsin all other values are not zero.
Experimental Errors Also Produce ∆GI° Terms. As is
seen in both parts of Figure 2, every additivity cycle involves
comparison of four different free energy terms. Measure￾ment of these terms involves errors. We estimate that the
errors in our Ka determinations are about (20% at the σ
level. This corresponds to about (100 cal/mol as the σ level
error in ∆Ga° values. The error in ∆GI° is therefore the
propagated error of four such measurements and about (200
cal/mol. In Bigler et al. (1993) and Lu et al. (1997), we
decided that the 2 σ level is better for examination of
deviations from additivity. We therefore regard ∆GI° values
in Table 2 between -400 and +400 cal/mol as additive
within the experimental error. As is seen in Table 3, 45.6%
of the entries in Table 2 meet this criterion. This is still
rather poor, as in the 65 intrascaffolding tests of Lu et al.
(1997) 67.7% met the criterion. It is likely that intra￾scaffolding additivity is better than interscaffolding additivity.
Pro Variant Is NonadditiVe. However, there is another
explanation. In the CHYM column of Table 2, all 15 entries
that do not involve P1 Pro have a |∆GI°| of <400, i.e. that
are additive within the experimental error. On the other
hand, |∆GI°| for all six cases involving Pro is between 1500
and 1870 cal/mol, a substantial deviation from additivity.
Inspection of the six rows involving Pro shows that they
show strong nonadditivity, with the exception of some SGPA
and SGPB entries. We therefore removed the Pro-involving
entries and retabulated the results in Table 3. The fraction
of remaining entries with a |∆GI°| of <400 cal/mol increased
to 57.8%. More remarkably, |∆GI°| > 1200 cal/mol dropped
from 17.5 to 4.2%. It is worth noting that the 65 intra￾scaffolding comparisons (Lu et al., 1997) listed in Table 3
do not involve Pro.
The removal of Pro may seem arbitrary. It is less arbitrary
than it may appear. Pro is the only member of the coded
set that is not an amino acid in a chemical sense. The Pro
side chain differs from all the others by being attached to
the main chain both at the CA atom (as all the others are)
and at the N atom. Modeling shows that the Pro side chain
is very difficult to fit into the S1 cavities of all six enzymes
that we study here. Additionally, all published three￾dimensional structures of complexes of standard mechanism,
canonical inhibitors with their cognate serine proteinases
show the N(H) of the P1 residue of the inhibitor donating a
hydrogen bond to the enzyme. P1 Pro does not have an
available H atom and therefore cannot participate in such a
bond. There are, as yet, no published three-dimensional
structures of complexes where the P1 residue is Pro.

Interscaffolding Additivity Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 7, 1997 1603However, K. Huang, W. Lu, S. Anderson, M. Laskowski,
Jr., and M. N. G. James (manuscript in preparation), as a
part of the X18OMTKY3-SGPB complex study, for all X18
residues determined the high-resolution structure of the Pro18
OMTKY3-SGPB complex structure. In all other X18
OMTKY3-SGPB complexes examined thus far (Huang et
al., 1995; Huang, 1995; Bateman et al., 1996), the nature of
the X18 residue does not affect the conformation of the
inhibitor’s main chain and the nature of the interactions
between the enzyme and the inhibitor’s contact residues other
than P1. The Pro18 complex is an exception. In this complex,
the inhibitor’s main chain is slightly distorted and some of
the interactions with SGPB at positions other than P1 are
altered. Such alterations might well differ in the two
inhibitor scaffoldings and might entail different free energy
costs, thus explaining nonadditivity. This argument is flawed
by our finding that P1 Pro is moderately additive for SGPB.
Clearly, structures of complexes of P1 Pro containing
inhibitors in complex with other enzymes would be very
helpful. We anticipate even greater main chain deviations
in such complexes.
Further inspection of Table 2 shows that, even after Pro
is removed, the HLE column contains especially many large
|∆GI°| values. Bode et al. (1989) and Lu et al. (1997) remark
on the much greater flexibility of the HLE S1 cavity
compared to that of the S1 cavities of other serine proteinases.
One of the arguments offered for this by Lu et al. (1997) is
that HLE accounts for most of the observed large deviations
from intrascaffolding additivity. The same conclusions apply
here to interscaffolding additivity.
With Pro omitted, the interscaffolding additivity is still
worse than the intrascaffolding additivity as might have been
expected. However, both are quite good and clearly have a
large predictive value in protein design.
Superimposition of Eglin c and OMTKY3 Complexes with
Chymotrypsin. X-ray crystallography of many different X18
OMTKY3-SGPB complexes shows that for all X18, except
Pro18, the nature of the P1 residue affects only the P1 side
chain-S1 cavity interaction; all other interactions are un￾affected (Huang et al., 1995; Huang, 1995; K. Huang, K. S.
Bateman, and M. N. G. James, unpublished; Bateman et al.,
1996). Huang et al. (1995) and Lu et al. (1997) also showed
that P1 Gly can serve as an excellent standard and ∆∆Ga°(Gly
P1 X) is a quantitative measure of the interaction of the side
chain of the X residue with the S1 cavity. From Table 1
for CHYM by analogy to eqs 2 and 3, we obtain
∆∆Ga°(Gly P1 Leu)OMTKY3 ) -6.15 kcal/mol and
∆∆Ga°(Gly P1 Leu)eglin c ) -6.18 kcal/mol. |∆GI°| ) 30
cal/mol is an exceptionally small deviation. It seems clear
that, in the two complexes, the P1 Leu residue must bind to
the S1 cavity of chymotrypsin in a nearly identical manner.
Fortunately, X-ray crystallographic data are available in the
literature to make the comparison. Even though a large
number of three-dimensional structures of enzyme-inhibitor
complexes were determined (Bode & Huber, 1992), there
are relatively few high-resolution structures of complexes
of two inhibitors belonging to two different families but
sharing the same P1 residue and interacting with the same
enzyme. The eglin c (Frigerio et al., 1992) and OMTKY3
(Fujinaga et al., 1987) complexes with CHYM are among
the few.
The results are listed in Table 4. First, when all the CA
atoms of the chymotrypsin molecules in the two complexes
are superimposed, the resultant rmsd is 0.51 Å. This
relatively large difference is presumably due to different
crystal contacts as the two crystal forms are nonisomorphous.
However, the environment in the enzyme-inhibitor contact
region is much more similar. All 196 atoms in the 31
residues of the active site and S1 pocket of chymotrypsin
were superimposed except for the CE atom of Met192 as this
methyl group shows an opposite orientation in both com￾plexes. The rmsd is 0.24 Å. These 31 chymotrypsin
residues are shown in a superimposition in Figure 5, where
CHYM in the OMTKY3 complex is in yellow and CHYM
in the eglin c complex is in red. The very small rmsd is not
only a testimonial to the high quality of work in both X-ray
laboratories but also a striking confirmation that the S1 cavity
in both complexes is virtually identical as expected from
experimentally indistinguishable ∆∆G°(Gly P1 Leu) values.
The similarity of the S1 pockets can be even better appreci￾ated in Figure 6, where the two pockets are shown separately.
While the similarity is astonishingly good, two differences
are readily seen. One of the water molecules in the
OMTKY3 complex is not seen in the eglin c complex. As
alluded to above, the CE atom of Met192 of chymotrypsin
points toward P1 Leu in the eglin c complex, while it points
away from it in OMTKY3. Figure 6 also shows a part of
both inhibitors. As the eight atoms of the P1 Leu are of
main interest, they were separately superimposed. As is seen
in Table 4, the rmsd for these four atoms is 0.39 Å. This is
quite small but clearly larger than the rmsd for the S1 pockets.
On balance, the additivity of the P1 Gly-P1 Leu cycle in
OMTKY3 and eglin c as determined by thermodynamic
measurements is confirmed by X-ray crystallography.
Less Stringent Criteria. Additivity is the most stringent
criterion for the similarity in behavior of relative equilibrium
constants in two different systems. The finding in this paper
that 45.6% of all P1 combinations are strictly additive
between eglin c and OMTKY3 is most impressive. Even
more impressive is that 57.7% are strictly additive when Pro
is omitted. On the other hand, 54.4 and 42.2%, respec￾tively, are not. It is definitely of interest to use less stringent
criteria.
Probably the least stringent is rank order. For chymo￾trypsin, this is L > I > S > G > E > P both for eglin c and
for OMTKY3. Examination of Table 1 shows that it is not
identical but nearly the same for the remaining five enzymes.
Pro does not need to be omitted for this analysis. It is the
worst in both the eglin c and OMTKY3 scaffoldings for
CHYM, CARL, SGPA, and SGPB. It is poor but better than
Asp and Glu for PPE and HLE in both scaffoldings.
Since one of the mutations we study is always a single
change at P1, the -∆Ga°(P1 ) X) eglin c values can be
plotted vs -∆Ga°(P ) X)OMTKY3. Figure 7 is a plot for
chymotrypsin. Similar plots for five other enzymes are given

perfectly additive, all the points in such plots would lie
precisely on a straight line of unit slope. For each plot, we
provide the slope s which is a measure of sensitivity of the
eglin c system compared to that of the OMTKY3 system to
substitutions at P1. We also provide the Pearson-product
moment correlation coefficient, r (Campbell, 1989). r ) 1.00
for data that are perfectly correlated, 0.00 for no correlation,
and -1.00 for anticorrelation. In this case, r is a measure
of how well the points fall on the lines. The r and s values
for sets of all seven (or as many as could be measured)
variants and for sets without Pro are listed in Table 5. It is
seen there that r is very near the perfect unity for all cases,
except perhaps PPE, and s rather is close to unity with several
exceptions. This analysis restates all the previous conclu￾sions. Changing P1 in eglin c and in OMTKY3 produces
closely similar relative effects.
DISCUSSION
Bigler et al. (1993) and Lu et al. (1997) measured Ka
values for 25 different (5 noncoded, all 20 coded) P1 variants
of OMTKY3. They asked the following. Are their results
general? A partial answer was obtained by comparing their
∆∆G° values with those obtained in other avian ovomucoid
third domains. One of the 12 additivity cycles they employed
is shown in the top part of Figure 2. They showed that their
system was strictly additive for 67.7% of the cycles examined
and that |∆GI°| was always less than 1.4 kcal/mol. This
excellent additivity was, however, observed among inhibitors
with remarkably similar amino acid sequences. They all
belong to the same branch of the Kazal inhibitor family.
As already pointed out, standard mechanism, canonical
inhibitors of serine proteinases consist of 20 different
families. Each family is characterized by a common
scaffolding that differs from that employed by other families.
The scaffolding supports about a dozen residues that contact
the enzyme in the proper orientation. Among these, the six
or seven [P4-P2′(P3′)] residues surrounding the reactive site
share the common, canonical main chain conformation. Are
the Bigler et al. (1993) and Lu et al. (1997) results applicable
to the other inhibitor families?
Bigler et al. (1993) and Lu et al. (1997) answered the
question by comparing their data to the literature data. The
results are listed in the middle part of Table 4 of Lu et al.
(1997) and compared in Table 5 of this paper. There was
great difficulty in finding sufficiently comparable data.
Different methods were used to measure Ka. Some of the

Interscaffolding Additivity Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 7, 1997 1605noncoded P1 variants differed from ours. The measurements
were often made at a temperature (37 °C) different than ours
(21 °C) or most importantly at different pH values. Qasim
et al. (1995) recently showed that for ionizable P1 residues
(Asp, Glu, and Lys) the enzyme-inhibitor equilibrium
constants show a large dependence on pH in the neutral and
slightly alkaline pH region. Additionally, the enzyme sets
with which the inhibitors were tested did not overlap well,
reducing the number of useful comparisons. In view of all
of the above, it is surprising that the r values are excellent
and many s values are reasonably good.
In order to answer the question less ambiguously in this
paper, we expressed seven P1 variants of eglin c, an inhibitor
from the potato I family, whose scaffolding is very different
from that of OMTKY3. We measured the Ka’s for these
variants, whenever possible (see Results), with all six
enzymes in the same laboratory, by the same measuring
technique at the same pH, temperature, and ionic environ￾ment. We subjected the data to the most stringent compari￾son technique, additivity, and found them impressively
additive especially when Pro is excluded. The exclusion of
Pro seems reasonable, as it is the only member of the 25-
residue set that is not an R-amino acid in a strict chemical
sense. Therefore, while we studied only seven variants, we
hope that interscaffolding additivity extends to 24 of the 25
residues studied by Lu et al. (1997), Pro being the only
exception.
In combination with the data listed in Table 4 of Lu et al.
(1997), our results make us optimistic about a claim that
the results apply to all 20 protein families. However, this
conclusion is not in accord with all of the published literature,
especially if qualitative rather than quantitative data are
considered. As an example, we cite the work of Kossiakoff
et al. (1993), who found by phage display that among the
coded P1 variants of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
(Kunitz), BPTI, P1 Asn and His are best for the inhibition
of chymotrypsin. In sharp contrast, Lu et al. (1997) report
that in OMTKY3 P1 Tyr, Trp, and Phe are best, followed
by Leu and Met. If the results of both groups are correct,
OMTKY3 and BPTI are not interscaffolding additive for the
inhibition of chymotrypsin.
We proposed generalizing (with some caveats) the results
to all L-R-amino acid and glycyl residues and to all standard
mechanism, canonical protein inhibitor families. Another
generalization is of great interest. Are substitutions at
positions other than P1 but in the canonical region of the
combining loop also interscaffolding additive? The available
data seem too scarce to deal with this question now.
Concerning P1 Pro, for every one of the six enzymes tested,
P1 Pro is locally deleterious in both eglin c and OMTKY3
scaffoldings. However, for every enzyme, it is much less
deleterious in eglin c than in OMTKY3. It seems likely that
the presence of a disulfide bridge at P3 of OMTKY3 makes
its main much harder to deform than the eglin c main chain,
thus causing an additional problem in binding of P1 Pro.
Eglin c as an Inhibitor. As already pointed out, we did
not expect and did not find Ka’s for the P1 ) Leu wild types
of eglin c and of OMTKY3 to be the same. Eglin c inhibits
five of the six enzymes we study more strongly than
OMTKY3. It inhibits PPE much more weakly. These
results raise to questions. One is about the molecular
explanation of the differences. Unfortunately, the only cases
for which there are three-dimensional structures of both eglin
c and OMTKY3 interacting with the same enzyme are their
complexes with chymotrypsin. While eglin c inhibits more
strongly, the difference is so slight that it is difficult to
attempt an explanation. Dramatic differences are seen for
SGPA and SGPB on one hand and for PPE on the other.
The second question is a practical one. In suggesting
potential inhibitors to try for newly characterized enzymes,
it is best to use eglin c mutants if the enzyme shows a
substrate specificity similar to that of SGPA and SGPB and
OMTKY3 mutants if the enzyme shows a substrate specific￾ity similar to that of PPE. In a few recent studies in our
laboratory, we have adopted such a strategy. It was
successful, but until a molecular explanation is provided, this
is largely anecdotal.
