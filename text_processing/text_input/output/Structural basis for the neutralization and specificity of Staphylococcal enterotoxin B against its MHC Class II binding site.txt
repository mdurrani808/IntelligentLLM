Introduction
Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is one of the most potent 
superantigens (SAgs) secreted by Staphylococcus aureus.
1,2 It 
belongs to a family of toxins that also includes Staphylococcal 
enterotoxin A (SEA), Staphylococcal enterotoxin C1-C3 (SEC1–
SEC3), Staphylococcal enterotoxin D (SED), Staphylococcal 
enterotoxin E (SEE), and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST￾1).3
 SAgs act by binding to the Vβ regions of T cell receptors 
(TCRs) and to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 
II molecules to activate T cells and initiate a systemic release 
of inflammatory cytokines.4
 These toxins are responsible for a 
number of severe human illnesses, including food poisoning, 
scarlet fever, and TSS. Due to their high pathogenicity and 
toxicity, SAgs are considered potential agents for biological 
weapons.5
In the past decade, structural studies of the free forms of 
SEA,6
 SEB,7
 SEC2,8
 and TSST-1,9,10 as well as the SEB-MHC 
class II complex,11 have revealed the details of the binding of 
SAgs with target receptors and the working mechanism of SEB￾induced toxicity. Specifically, SEB bypasses internalization 
and processing by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and triggers 
T cell proliferation and cytokine production by cross-linking 
TCRs on T cells and the MHC class II molecules on APCs.7,12-15
Exposure to SEB can lead to TSS, which can rapidly progress 
to severe and intractable hypotension, multisystem failure, and 
death. Although therapies for enterotoxin-induced TSS are not 
available, a number of attempts have been made to investigate 
the inhibition of SEB function. Bunonpane et al. reported that 
a soluble form of a single immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain 
of TCRs (Vβ) could neutralize the lethal activity of SEB with 
picomolar binding affinity.4
 The generation of Vβ proteins with 
picomolar affinities to several toxins that are potential biological 
weapons has also been reported.5
 Moreover, mimetic peptides 
have been shown to diminish the toxicity of SAgs in some animal 
models.16,17
Passive immunization with toxin-neutralizing antibodies 
is widely regarded as an efficient post-exposure therapy option

Keywords: Staphylococcus aureus; enterotoxin B; neutralizing antibody; crystal structure; mechanism
Staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) B is among the potent toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus that cause toxic shock 
syndrome (TSS), which can result in multi-organ failure and death. Currently, neutralizing antibodies have been shown 
to be effective immunotherapeutic agents against this toxin, but the structural basis of the neutralizing mechanism is 
still unknown. In this study, we generated a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 3E2, against SEB, and analyzed the crystal 
structure of the SEB-3E2 Fab complex. Crystallographic analysis suggested that the neutralizing epitope overlapped with 
the MHC II molecule binding site on SEB, and thus 3E2 could inhibit SEB function by preventing interaction with the MHC 
II molecule. Mutagenesis studies were done on SEB, as well as the related Staphylococcus aureus toxins SEA and SEC. 
These studies revealed that tyrosine (Y)46 and lysine (K)71 residues of SEB are essential to specific antibody–antigen 
recognition and neutralization. Substitution of Y at SEA glutamine (Q)49, which corresponds to SEB Y46, increased both 
3E2’s binding to SEA in vitro and the neutralization of SEA in vivo. These results suggested that SEB Y46 is responsible 
for distinguishing SEB from SEA. These findings may be helpful for the development of antibody-based therapy for SEB￾induced TSS.

for the prevention of host cell intoxication. Human intravenous 
immunoglobulin (Ig) is sometimes effective in the treatment 
of SAg-related inflammatory diseases.18 Moreover, specific 
antibodies given passively to naive mice or non-human primates 
concomitant to or hours after toxin exposure have been shown 
to protect against toxic shock.19,20 SEB-neutralizing monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) typically act by sterically blocking protein–
protein interactions and therefore require a high affinity to 
compete with the TCR and MHC class II affinity reactions 
of host cell activation. Several well-characterized neutralizing 
antibodies, such as 20B10, 82M.1.2, and MAb5,21-23 act by 
binding to epitopes that are identical or overlap with the surfaces 
that recognize the cellular receptor. Their exact neutralizing 
mechanisms, however, remain unknown. Understanding the 
mechanisms by which antibodies specifically neutralize SEB 
requires detailed knowledge not only of the SEB structure, but 
also of the SEB–antibody interactions at the amino acid level.
To gain a better understanding of these mechanisms, we 
performed in vitro and in vivo studies of 3E2, a neutralizing mAb 
that recognizes SEB with high specificity and sub-nanomolar 
affinity. We found that 3E2 strongly inhibits SEB-induced 
T cell proliferation and activation. We subsequently determined 
the crystal structure of the 3E2 Fab in complex with SEB, and 
obtained detailed molecular insights into the inhibition and 
specific recognition mechanisms. The structural information 
provided in this study may help in the development of antibody￾based therapies for SEB-induced TSS.
Results
Identification of 3E2 as a neutralizing antibody against SEB
Recombinant SEB proteins were expressed in soluble form 
in prokaryotic cells and purified for preparation with a toxoid 
immunogen to generate mAbs capable of neutralizing SEB. Ten 
hybridomas were obtained and screened for the production of 
anti-SEB mAbs using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) with purified SEB (Fig. 1A). In addition, serial dilutions 
of mAbs were assessed for their ability to inhibit SEB-induced 
T cell mitogenesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) (Fig. 1B). Six mAbs, 3C1, 1D1, 2H4, 3E2, 
4A3, and 1A5, were initially found to inhibit SEB-induced 
mitogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. 3E2 showed the 
greatest inhibitory effect among these mAbs. Primary human

T cells stimulated with SEB in vitro upregulated the secretion 
of cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF). Seven mAbs, 3C1, 1D1, 2G5, 2H4, 3E2, 4A3, 
and 1A5, showed significant inhibitory effect on SEB-induced 
cytokine production (P < 0.01), whereas an irrelevant mouse 
IgG1κ control demonstrated no inhibitory activity (Fig. 1C). 
3E2 could also block SEB-induced activation of human T cells 
with the highest potency. Furthermore, we analyzed the affinity 
of mAb 3E2 when binding to SEB on the surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR)-chip (Fig. 1D). 3E2 was found to bind SEB 
with very high affinity (Kd
 = 5.787 × 10-10).
Overall structure of the SEB-3E2 Fab complex
SEB achieves its toxicity by interacting with TCRs and MHC 
class II molecules.1
 To elucidate the mechanism of SEB inhibition 
through the neutralizing antibody 3E2, we determined the crystal 
structure of the SEB–3E2 Fab complex using the molecular 
replacement method and refined it to 3.1 Å resolution with a 
final Rwork value of 19.6% (Rfree = 26.1%) (Table S1) (PDB code: 
3W2D). In the asymmetric unit, one SEB molecule bound with 
one 3E2 Fab (Fig. 2), which is consistent with the gel filtration 
results (Fig. S1).
The superimposition of SEB molecules in free form and 3E2 
Fab in bound form yielded a root-mean-square deviation of 0.73 
Å for the Cα atoms of 236 residues, particularly for the residues 
on the interface (Fig. S2). There was no distinct overall structural 
difference between the free and Fab bound forms of the SEB 
molecule exists. Notably, residues SEBD101-SEBK109 and SEBD55-
SEBK57, which are not in antibody binding interface, are removed 
from the final model due to their lack of interpretable electron 
density. We hypothesized that this is the result of a lack of flexibility 
and loss of antibody binding. Similar to the apo form, the overall 
fold of the SEB molecule consists of two domains connected by 
a six-residue extended loop: domain I (SEBD30–SEBE120) and 
domain II (SEBD127–SEBK238), which adopt an oligosaccharide￾oligonucleotide fold (OB fold)24 and a microbial SAg-specific 
fold,25 respectively. MHC class II molecules are located in domain 
II, whereas TCR binding sites are located in the connecting region 
between domain I and domain II (Fig. S3A). In the SEB molecule, 
the 3E2 Fab interaction surface overlaps with the MHC binding 
site but does not interact with the TCR binding site (Fig. S3).
The 3E2 Fab molecule presents a canonical Ig fold consisting 
of four β-barrel domains (Fig. 1). The light chain is composed of 
residues M1 to C237, which fold into the VL
 and CL
 domains; by 
contrast, the heavy chain is composed of residues M1 to C241, 
which fold into the VH and CH domains. L
T74, which is located 
in the classical γ-turn in the Ig family, displays a disallowed 
stereochemical geometry similar to its counterparts in other 
reported Fab structures.26 Intramolecular disulfide bonds are found 
in the expected positions for typical Ig Fab molecules: two between 
L
C45-L
C111 and L
C157-L
C217 and two others between HC40-HC114 
and HC166-HC221. The elbow angle of 3E2Fab, which is defined as 
the angle subtended by the two pseudo 2-fold axes relating VH to VL
and CH to CL, is ~170° in the SEB-3E2 Fab complex.
Interface between SEB and 3E2 Fab
3E2 Fab binds to SEB using a large and highly complementary 
interface (Fig. 3), which is consistent with the picomolar 
binding affinity between 3E2 and SEB (Fig. 1D). The total 
buried surface area between 3E2 Fab and SEB is 1620 Å2
[calculated by PISA27], of which the light and heavy chains of 
3E2 Fab contribute 40% and 60%, respectively. The interaction 
is demonstrated by a high shape complementarity value28 of 
0.72 (compared with the average shape complementarity value 
of 0.64–0.68 for antibody-antigen complexes). Comparison 
between the interfaces of SEB–3E2 Fab and TCR and the 
MHC binding sites on SEB suggested that the 3E2 binding site 
partially occupies the MHC class II molecule binding site, thus 
allowing 3E2 to inhibit SEB function effectively (Fig. S3).
According to the interaction between the heavy and light 
chains of 3E2, the 3E2 epitope on SEB could be divided into 
three regions: region A is formed by the residues in the β3–β4 
linking region of SEB domain I and the residues of the heavy 
chain in 3E2 Fab; region B conducts the interaction between the 
loop region connecting β1–β2 of SEB and residues in the light 
chain of 3E2 Fab; and region C, containing SEBQ43, SEBY46, 
SEBF47, SEBK71, SEBK78, and SEBK98, bonds with both heavy 
chains and light chains (Fig. 2; Fig. S4). The SEB–3E2 Fab 
complex is stabilized by 10 hydrogen bonds, two salt bridges, 
and a number of van der Waals bonds (Table S2). The side 
chains of SEBY46, SEBF47, SEBK71, and SEBD72, which are located 
in region C, insert into the deep groove formed by the heavy 
and light chains of the 3E2 Fab. Particularly, the side chain of 
SEBY46 has the deepest insertion into the binding hole. This 
observation is consistent with the specificity of 3E2 to SEB and 
denotes SEBY46 and SEBK71 might play an important role in the 
interaction between 3E2 and SEB.

In the SEB–3E2 Fab complex structure, a subset of SEB 
amino acids located on the interface were identified to bind 
to 3E2 Fab, including SEBQ43, SEBF47, SEBF68, SEBK69, SEBK71, 
SEBD72, SEBD75, SEBK76, SEBK78, SEBK80, SEBK98, and SEBN218.
To determine the key amino acids that could be involved in 
the epitope structure, we generated a series of substitutions of SEB 
by replacing the interacting residues with glycine (Table 1) based 
on structural information. The binding of 3E2 to the mutated 
proteins and to wild-type (WT) SEB were compared by western 
blot analysis and ELISA (Fig. 4). Substituting either the SEBY46 or 
SEBK71 residue with glycine residues dramatically reduced SEB’s 
capacity to bind with 3E2. Moreover, residue SEBD75 was shown 
to play a role in the binding of 3E2, based on a reduction in its 
binding ability. Furthermore, the combinations of SEB43G47 and 
SEB71G76 were also found to have defective binding capabilities 
with 3E2. Incubation with PBS control resulted in no detectable 
response. These results suggest that residues SEBY46 and SEBK71 
play pivotal roles in the interaction with 3E2, which is consistent 
with the structural information (Fig. 5A).
To further investigate the effect of amino acids side chains on 
binding affinity between SEB and 3E2, we constructed several 
point mutations on SEBY46 and SEBK71. These point mutants were 
evaluated by ELISA (Fig. 5B) and SPR assay (Fig. 5C–F) for their 
binding affinities to 3E2. The kinetic binding constants were 
summarized in Table 2. Substitution of leucine or phenylalanine 
at SEBY46 (Y46L or Y46F) resulted in an affinity for 3E2 that was 
4- to 60-fold lower. The mutant SEBY46E resulted in complete 
loss of binding ability. These results suggested that both the 
hydrophobic side chain and the hydroxyl group are essential for 
the function of SEBY46 in the interaction between 3E2 and SEB. 
The same phenomenon was observed in the mutation SEBK71. The 
mutant SEBK71N resulted in a 2800-fold reduction in affinity, 
and the SEBK71Q mutant could not bind 3E2 to the same extent 
as the WT. In contrast, the mutant SEBK71R had no effect on 3E2

binding, indicating that the positively charged characteristics of 
the SEBK71 side chain play a critical role in 3E2 binding.
To further investigate the role of these two residues in SEB￾induced T cell activation, we measured the proliferative responses 
of PBMCs to each mutant and WT SEB by analyzing [3
H]
thymidine uptake (Fig. S5). The WT SEB molecules induced 
a proliferative response of PBMCs in a concentration-dependent 
manner. The proliferative responses of PBMCs treated with 
SEBY46G, SEB43G47, SEBK71G, and SEB71G76 mutants were found 
to be significantly lower than those of PBMCs treated with WT 
SEB. The PBMC proliferation induced by mutant SEBD75G was 
only ~50% of that induced by WT SEB (Fig. S5A). Furthermore, 
we used a cytokine secretion assay to investigate the ability of 
WT SEB and mutants to induce cytokine secretion from PBMCs 
directly. The stimulatory activity of the cytokine secretion of 
SEB was not completely reduced by the SEBD75G modification 
alone; however, SEBY46G, SEBK71G, and the combination of 
SEB43G47 or SEB71G76 modifications drastically reduced the 
secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IFN-γ
(Fig. S5B). These results suggest that SEBY46 and SEBK71 play 
crucial roles in the biological function of SEB, but that SEBD75 
is involved in SEB-induced T cell activation. The mechanism of 
3E2’s neutralizing function is to block the interaction between 
SEB and MHC class II molecules through binding with the key 
residues in SEB function domain.
Type diversity between SAgs on the 3E2 binding site
SEA, SEB, and SEC are the most important SAgs secreted 
by S. aureus and have high sequence and structural homologies1
(Fig. 6). 3E2 shows high binding affinity and neutralizing activity 
to SEB; however, it does not bind to SEA and SEC (Fig. 4A). To 
further understand the specificity of the mAb 3E2 toward SAgs 
(i.e., SEA, SEB, and SEC), we analyzed the key positions and 
residues, e.g., glutamine (Q), tyrosine (Y), lysine (K) glutamic 
acid (E), that affect the molecular interaction.
In the 3E2 epitope, SEBY46 plays an essential role for the 
interaction, but the same position in SEA is a glutamine residue 
(Fig. 6). By contrast, the lysine residue at the SEBK71 position 
is found in both SEA and SEB. Mutagenesis analysis revealed 
that the SEBY46E mutation completely eliminates binding with 
3E2. These findings suggest that SEBY46 accounts for the specific 
recognition of SEB, but not SEA, by 3E2. Moreover, neither 
SEBY46 nor SEBK71 are conserved in SEC2 (Fig. 6). In SEC2, 
an alanine residue and a glutamic acid residue substitute the 
Y46 and K71 residues in SEB, respectively. The SEBY46A and 
SEBK71E mutants both show defective binding affinities to 3E2, 
suggesting that both sites play a role in 3E2 interaction. These 
observations led us to hypothesize that the residues in the amino 
acids SEBY46 and SEBK71 are essential to differentiating between 
the three types of SAgs secreted by S. aureus.
To validate this hypothesis, we generated four constructs by 
swapping amino acids SEBY46 and SEBK71 on SEA and SEC2 (i.e., 
SEAQ49Y, SEC2A46Y, SEC2E71K, and SEC2A46Y+E71K). Western 
blot analysis revealed that the mutant SEAQ49Y dramatically 
increased its binding activity to 3E2, whereas other substitutions 
on SEC2 did not show detectable binding with 3E2 (Fig. 7A). 
Proliferation of PBMCs induced by WT SEB, SEA, SEC2, and 
their mutants showed that swapping mutation did not affect the 
toxicities of SEA and SEC2. However, 3E2 could only inhibit WT 
SEB and SEA Q49Y induced mitogenesis significantly (Fig. 7B).
We also tested serum IFN-γ and TNF levels induced by 
SEB, SEA and their mutants, with or without treatment with 
3E2, in the TSS mouse model. The results (Fig. 7C) showed that 
cytokines induced by SEBY46G were much less than those induced 
by SEB WT and SEA WT; however, the serum cytokines levels 
following SEA Q49Y treatment were almost the same as those 
induced by SEA WT. These results suggest that the swapped 
mutant of SEA retains its T cell stimulating activity in vivo. 
3E2 could efficiently inhibit the release of cytokines induced by 
SEB WT and SEAQ49Y, but had no inhibitory effects on SEBY46G 
and SEA WT in vivo. SEA Q49 was also the critical residue for 
3E2 to distinguish SEA from SEB. To determine if co-treatment 
with 3E2 results in a significantly enhanced survival of mice 
pre-treated with SEB WT or SEA Q73Y, survival was monitored 
every 6h after treatment for 72h. Mice treated with SEAQ49Y died 
of TSS during the 3-d period, suggesting that this mutant does 
not affect the toxicity of SEA. By contrast, mice co-treated with 
SEAQ49Y and 3E2 survived (Fig. 7D). Taken together, these facts 
suggest that SEBY46 plays a crucial role in SEB activity and 3E2’s 
specific recognition of it.
Discussion
SEB is a SAg secreted by S. aureus that is known to cause 
food poisoning and other fatal diseases by inducing high levels 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are released 
from CD4+
 T cells and MHC class II APCs, which are activated 
through binding of SEB to both MHC class II molecules and 
Figure 4. Binding of SEB and its mutants to mAb 3E2. The binding activi￾ties of WT SEB (SEB) and its different mutants with mAb 3E2 were deter￾mined by western blot analysis (A) and ELISA (B). The mAb 3C1, which 
recognizes a non-overlapping epitope on SEB, was used as control, as 
were WT SEA (SEA) and SEC (SEC).

specific TCR Vβ chains.1,2 To establish the potential for treating 
SEB-induced diseases and further understand its inhibitory 
mechanism, we identified a neutralizing mAb with sub￾nanomolar binding affinity and determined its crystal structure 
in complex with SEB.
The complex structure of SEB–3E2 Fab revealed a neutralizing 
conformational epitope on SEB that partially occupied the MHC 
class II molecule binding site (Fig. S3), suggesting that 3E2 
functions to block the interaction between SEB and MHC class 
II molecules. Although the TCR and MHC class II binding sites 
are adjacent on the surface of SEB and both are crucial for the 
toxicity of SEB,11 the key residues (SEBY46 and SEBK71) for 3E2 
binding are located in the region of the MHC class II molecule 
binding site, distal to the TCR binding cleft. This suggests that 
binding of SEB to MHC class II molecules, but not to TCRs, 
would be affected by the relevant mutations.
In addition, 3E2 specifically recognizes the MHC class II 
molecule binding site of SEB. Mutational analysis demonstrated 
that SEBY46 and SEBK71 are key residues for 3E2 recognition and 
neutralization. Notably, the antibody 3E2 specifically neutralizes 
SEB, but not SEA and SEC. To understand how 3E2 discriminates 
between different SAgs, we compared the sequences of the 3E2

binding sites on SEA, SEB, and SEC and swapped the distinct 
residues to examine the binding ability of 3E2. We found that 
SEBY46 is essential for 3E2 to distinguish SBE from SEA. The 
results presented here may assist the design and development of 
specific novel inhibitors for SEB.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statements
Mice were purchased from the Animal Center of Chinese 
Academy of Sciences and maintained under pathogen-free 
conditions. All animal experimental procedures were performed 
in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Experiment 
Committee of the International Joint Cancer Institute, and 
were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of the 
International Joint Cancer Institute.
Blood was collected from healthy human volunteers 
(anonymous) at the International Joint Cancer Institute for the 
preparation of PBMCs, following written consent in accordance 
with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines. The 
International Joint Cancer Institute IRB approved protocol 
Hu20110217 for the purpose of the studies described here.
Construction, expression, and purification of recombinant 
SEB, SEA, SEC2 and their mutants
The gene encoding SEB (S407030), SEA (ATCC 29293) 
and SEC2 (FRI 1230) was chemically synthesized by Sangon 
and then subcloned into expression vector pGEX-4T-2. SEB, 
SEA and SEC2 mutants were constructed using QuikChang 
II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the 
instructions of the manufacturer. The PCR primer sequences for 
each mutant are listed in Table 1. The recombinant SAgs were 
expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) under the induction 
of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The expressed product 
was purified using a B-PER GST Fusion Protein Purification 
Kit (Pierce). The GST fusion sequence was cleaved from the 
enterokinase recognition sequence DDDDK by enterokinase 
(Sino Biological Inc.). Digested proteins were dialyzed against 
10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) before being applied to a Superdex-75 
column and eluted in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline 
(pH 7.6) containing 150 mM NaCl. Fractions containing SEB 
were collected and dialyzed against 10 mM TRIS-HCl (pH 7.5).
Immunization and generation of anti-SEB mAbs
BALB/c mice were primed by intraperitoneal injection of 
10 μg of SEB emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant and 
boosted once or twice after a 21-d interval by intraperitoneal

injection of 20 μg of native SEB in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered 
saline. Immunized mice were killed 3 d after secondary or tertiary 
immunization, and hybridomas were derived and processed as 
previously described.29
Anti-SEB-secreting hybridoma cells were identified by ELISA 
and cloned twice at limiting dilution to ensure monoclonality. The 
mAbs were purified from ascitic fluid using a HiTrap protein A 
affinity chromatography system (GE Healthcare). The Ig isotype 
of each mAb was determined by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion 
using goat antibodies specific for mouse Ig subclasses (Sigma).
Surface plasmon resonance assay
The kinetic parameters of anti-SEB antibodies for SEB were 
determined using Biacore T100 (Biacore AB). Protein A was 
immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using an amine coupling 
kit according to the manufacturer (Biacore AB). Purified anti￾SEB antibody was diluted with running buffer (BIA-certified 
HBS buffer: 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 
mM EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant p20) to a final concentration 
of 20 μg/ml and applied onto the CM5 chip at a flow rate of 
30 μl/min. The CM5 sensor chip was washed with running 
buffer and recombinant SEB (or SEB mutants) was applied at 
a flow rate of 30 μl/min. As control, each sample was passed 
over a reference flow cell containing no ligand (protein A). All 
binding experiments were performed at 25 °C. The sensor chip 
could be regenerated with three washes of 3 μl of 20 mM glycine 
(pH 2.0). The kinetic rates of IgG-SEB binding were derived 
by globally fitting the Langmuir (1:1) model to the family of 
association and dissociation curves collected at different ligand 
concentrations, using BIAevaluation 2.01 software provided by 
the manufacturer.
Cell proliferation assays
Human PBMC suspensions (5 × 106
 cells/ml) were distributed 
in 100 μl aliquots to the wells of 96-well flat-bottom plates 
(5 × 105
 cells/well) containing 50 μl of various concentrations 
of SEB and 50 μl of the indicated concentration of anti-SEB 
antibody. Each condition was tested in triplicate. The cells were 
incubated at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2
 for 48 h and then pulsed with 
1 μCi of [3
H]thymidine (Amersham-GE Healthcare) per well, 
incubated for 18 h more, and then harvested onto glass fiber filter 
strips with a PhD cell harvester (Brandel). The incorporated 
radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.
Cytokine detection
Human PBMCs were adjusted to 1 × 106
 per ml. One 
hundred microliters of the cell suspension was seeded in a 
96-well microplate and then incubated in DMEM at 37 °C in 
10% CO2
 with the indicated concentrations of SEB or SEB and 
antibody. After 24 h of incubation, supernatants were collected 
and IFN-γ and TNF were measured by ELISA using a sandwich 
assay involving capture and detection anti-IFN-γ or anti-TNF 
antibodies (BD PharMingen).
Protein production
For the preparation of Fab fragments, 3E2 IgG was proteolysed 
for 4 h at 37 °C with immobilized papain (Roche) in buffer 
A (0.05 M Bis–Tris, pH 6.3). After being stopped with E-64, 
the proteolysed 3E2 was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in buffer B 
(0.025 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0); Fab fragments were separated 
from Fc fragments by protein A affinity chromatography. 
Further purification was achieved through cationic exchange 
chromatography and gel filtration on a Superdex-200 column 
(GE Healthcare).
SEB and 3E2 Fab protein were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio 
and incubated for 10 h at 4 °C to allow the complex to form 
before crystallization. The mixed protein was further purified 
using Superdex-200 gel filtration columns (GE Healthcare) 
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Fractions were analyzed 
by SDS-PAGE, and their purity was determined to be greater than 
95%. The purified proteins were then concentrated to 30 mg/ml 
in 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl for 
crystallization.
Crystallization
Crystallization was performed at 18 °C using the hanging￾drop vapor-diffusion technique as previously described.30
Crystals were obtained by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution 
with an equal volume of a reservoir solution and equilibrating 
the mixture drop against 500 μl of the reservoir solution. The

crystals were obtained with a reservoir solution containing 
150 mM ammonium iodide, 15% PEG 3350, 250 mM 
ammonium sulfate, and 25 mM Bis-Tris (pH 5.5), and their final 
dimensions were 30 × 30 × 90 µm3
 within 2 mo. The crystals 
were cryo-protected by soaking in a cryo-protectant consisting 
of the reservoir solution with additional 10% (v/v) glycol. The 
cryo-protected crystals were subsequently flash-cooled in liquid 
nitrogen and then transferred into a dry nitrogen stream at 
100 K for X-ray data collection.
X-ray data collection, processing, and structure determination
Diffraction data for SEB–3E2 Fab complex crystals were 
collected at best to 3.1 Å at 100 K using an ADSC Q315 CCD 
detector on beamline BL5A at Photon Factory. The data sets for 
complex crystals were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the 
HKL2000 package.31 The crystals belong to space group P2 with 
cell parameters a = 40.6 Å, b = 109.3 Å, c = 86.23 Å, and d = 96.1°. 
The molecular replacement method was used to calculate the 
phases using the PHASER program.32 Manual model building 
and refinement were performed with COOT33 and PHENIX.34
Solvent molecules were located from stereochemically reasonable 
peaks in the σA-weighted 2F–Fc
 difference Fourier electron 
density map (1.2 σ). The model geometry was verified using 
PROCHECK.35 Structural figures were drawn with PyMOL 
(www.pymol.org).
Neutralizing effects of 3E2 against SEB, SEA, SEC2, and 
their mutants in vitro
PBMCs (5 × 105
 cells per well) were plated in triplicate with WT 
SEB, WT SEA, WT SEC2, or their mutants (0.1 µg/ml), with or 
without various concentrations of 3E2, for 24 h at 37 °C in 96-well 
microtiter plates. Cells were pulsed with 1 mCi of [3
H]thymidine 
(Amersham-GE Healthcare) per well, incubated for 12 h more, 
and then harvested onto glass fiber filters. The incorporated [3
H]
thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation.
Neutralizing effects of 3E2 against SEB, SEA, and SEA 
Q49Y in vivo
The neutralizing effects of 3E2 against SEB, SEA, and 
SEA Q49Y in vivo were tested in a lipopolysaccharide￾potentiated mouse lethality model for SEB-induced shock with

as well as SEB, SEA, and SEA Q49Y (20 µg/mouse; 10 LD50). After 4 h, 3E2 (600 µg/mouse) was injected in the indicated groups. Mice sera were collected 
and cytokines were detected by ELISA. Results are mean ± SE for triplicate measurements in 6 different donors. (*P < 0.01; one-way ANOVA)(D)Animal 
survival was monitored every 6 h for 72 h.. Statistical significance was calculated by the log-rank test (*P < 0.01) (n = 10).

d-galactosamine.36,37 BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old; 10 mice per 
group) were first injected intraperitoneally with a mixture of 
D-GalN (Sigma) (20 mg per mouse), lipopolysaccharide from 
E. coli O55:B5 (Sigma) (1 ng per mouse), and SEB, SEA, or 
SEA Q49Y (20 µg per mouse; 10 LD50). Four hours later, 3E2 
(600 μg per mouse) was injected into the mice of indicated 
groups. For the detection of cytokine production in vivo, 
blood was collected at 9 h after SAgs administration. Blood 
was allowed to clot and then centrifuged in microtiter serum 
separator tubes (Becton Dickinson). Serum levels of cytokines 
TNF and IFN-γ were determined by ELISA according to the 
manufacturer’s specifications (R&D Systems). Survival rate 
was recorded every 6 h for 72 h.
Statistics analysis
Scientific differences were determined by using a Student’s 
t test and multiple treatment groups were compared within 
individual experiments by ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis t test. 
Mouse survival was analyzed for significance using the two￾tailed log-rank test. Data are presented as means ± SEM 
and P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant.
