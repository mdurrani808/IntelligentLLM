We have examined the differential binding of Hck and
Fyn to HIV-1 Nef to elucidate the structural basis of
SH3 binding affinity and specificity. Full-length Nef
bound to Hck SH3 with the highest affinity reported
for an SH3-mediated interaction (KD 250 nM). In
contrast to Hck, affinity of the highly homologous Fyn
SH3 for Nef was too weak (KD >20 AM) to be accurately
determined. We show that this distinct specificity lies
in a variable loop, the 'RT loop', positioned close to
conserved SH3 residues implicated in the binding of
proline-rich (PxxP) motifs. A mutant Fyn SH3 with a
single amino acid substitution (R961) in its RT loop
had an affinity (KD 380 nM) for Nef comparable with
that of Hck SH3. Based on additional mutagenesis
studies we propose that the selective recognition of Nef
by Hck SH3 is determined by hydrophobic interactions
involving an isoleucine residue in its RT loop. Although
Nef contains a PxxP motif which is necessary for the
interaction with Hck SH3, high affinity binding was
only observed for intact Nef protein. The binding of a
peptide containing the Nef PxxP motif showed >300-
fold weaker affinity for Hck SH3 than full-length Nef.

Introduction
Src homology 3 (SH3) domains are found in many
different proteins involved in intracellular signaling and
cytoskeletal organization (Mayer and Baltimore, 1993;
Pawson and Schlessinger, 1993; Musacchio et al., 1994b;
Schlessinger, 1994; Cohen et al., 1995). Characterization
of cellular proteins that bind to them has led to the
identification of short proline-rich protein sequences as
ligands for SH3 domains (Cicchetti et al., 1992; Ren
et al., 1993; Musacchio et al., 1994b; Cohen et al., 1995).
Selection of additional SH3 binding sites from peptide
libraries has further established a minimal PxxP consensus
as a critical determinant for SH3 binding (Rickles et al.,
1994; Yu et al., 1994).
The three-dimensional structures of many different SH3
domains have been determined by NMR spectroscopy
or X-ray crystallography (Kuriyan and Cowburn, 1993;
Musacchio et al., 1994b), including complexes of the SH3
domains of Src (Feng et al., 1994), P13K (Yu et al., 1994),
SemS/Grb2 (Lim et al., 1994; Terasawa et al., 1994;
Wittekind et al., 1994), Abl, Fyn (Musacchio et al., 1994a)
and Crk (Wu et al., 1995) with short peptides containing
PxxP motifs. Despite the variability in their primary
structures, these SH3 domains share a very similar overall
structure and mode of binding to PxxP peptides. The SH3
target peptides adopt a left-handed polyproline II helix
(PPII) conformation in which the critical proline residues
are on two edges of the helix and face the relatively flat
binding surface formed by conserved hydrophobic residues
in the SH3 domain. Part of the binding affinity is con￾tributed by hydrophobic interactions between residues of
the SH3 domain and the PxxP defining prolines, as well
as other residues in the peptide. In addition, most SH3-
PxxP interactions involve ionic interactions between a
basic residue positioned before or after the PxxP motif
and a highly conserved acidic residue in the SH3 domain
(D99 in Src; g in Figure 4B). Interestingly, the position
of this basic residue relative to the PxxP motif appears to
determine the orientation ('plus' or 'minus') of the pseudo￾symmetric PxxP-containing peptide on the SH3 surface
(Feng et al., 1994; Lim et al., 1994) (see Figure 4A).
An important function of SH3 domains is to participate
in highly selective protein-protein interactions. Therefore,
it seems paradoxical that PxxP SH3 binding generally
appears to be of low affinity and specificity. Some degree
of specificity in peptide recognition has been described,
however. Abl SH3 does not bind well to ligands of the
Src family SH3s and vice versa (Cheng et al., 1994;
Rickles et al., 1994; Yu et al., 1994; Alexandropoulos
et al., 1995). This appears to be due to the lack of an
acidic residue in Abl SH3 (equivalent to Src D99) that is
found in Src family SH3s, as well as in most other SH3
domains. Furthermore, binding of a peptide from the
guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G to the N-terminal
SH3 domain of Crk is relatively specific (Knudsen et al.,
1994, 1995). This interaction was shown to involve a
lysine residue in the C3G peptide that is coordinated by
three negatively charged side chains in a highly acidic
loop of Crk SH3 (Wu et al., 1995), known as the RT loop
because of functionally important arginine and threonine
residues in the Src SH3 domain (Kato et al., 1986;
Potts et al., 1988). Nevertheless, an additional level of
complexity giving rise to more specificity for SH3-
mediated protein-protein interactions is anticipated to
exist.
It has recently been found that the human immuno￾deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef protein binds to the
SH3 domains of a subset of Src family kinases in a
distinctly specific manner (Saksela et al., 1995). Nef
contains a PxxP motif which can mediate binding to the
56
SH3 domains of Hck and Lyn, but not to those of other
5006 Oxford University PressRT loop determines SH3 specificity
tested Src family kinases, such as Fyn, or less related SH3
domains. The SH3 binding capacity of Nef is necessary
for optimal spread of HIV-1 infection in primary cell
cultures, suggesting that the virus has evolved to exploit
SH3-mediated cellular processes to enhance its replication.
Molecular characterization of the interaction between
HIV- 1 Nef and Hck SH3 could therefore not only elucidate
the structural basis of SH3 binding specificity, but may
also be helpful for development of novel therapeutic
strategies aimed at inhibition of HIV-1 replication.
In this study we have used quantitative assays to
examine the structural determinants of the differential
affinity of Hck and Fyn SH3 domains for Nef. We show
that the high affinity of binding of Hck SH3 to Nef can
be transferred to Fyn by a single Arg-dle substitution in
the RT loop. Furthermore, we show that the high affinity, as
well as the distinct specificity, of the Nef-Hck interaction is
evident only when the Nef PxxP motif is present within
the intact Nef protein. These studies indicate that regions
of intact SH3 binding proteins outside the linear sequence
containing the PxxP motif can play a critical role in
determining affinity and specificity.
Results
High affinity binding of Nef to Hck SH3
To study the structural basis of the affinity and selectivity
of the interaction between HIV-1 Nef protein and the Hck
SH3 domain we have used surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) measurements and isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) (Wiseman et al., 1989; O'Shannessy et al., 1993;
Ladbury et al., 1995) to examine binding of wild-type
and mutant Nef proteins to various SH3 domains. These
SH3 domains were expressed as glutathione S-transferase
(GST) fusion proteins, biotinylated and immobilized onto
streptavidin-coated chips of a BlAcore biosensor appara￾tus. The full-length wild-type Nef protein produced for
these experiments corresponds to the HIV-1 NL4-3 Nef,
but has a Thr-4Arg mutation at position 71 in order to
mimic the amino acid sequence that occurs in this region
of most Nef alleles that have been obtained directly from
patients (Shugars et al., 1993; Huang et al., 1995). Arg7l
is adjacent to amino acid residues of Nef that are involved
in SH3 binding and may influence this interaction (Saksela
et al., 1995). As a negative control we also produced and
tested a mutant HIV-1 NL4-3-derived Nef protein (Nef￾PAl) which carries a double Pro--Ala substitution that
disrupts the two internal prolines of the conserved Nef
tetraproline repeat. Nef-PAI is unable to bind to Hck SH3
(Saksela et al., 1995).
Figure IA shows SPR profiles obtained after flowing
buffer containing various concentrations of Nef over a
biosensor chip coated with Hck SH3. Corresponding
SPR signals obtained in parallel by testing identical
concentrations of Nef on biosensor chips without SH3
proteins (to control for bulk refractive index effects)
have been subtracted from these values. Therefore, these
profiles, as well as those shown later, reflect specific
association between Nef and the immobilized SH3 protein.
Based on these measurements, the equilibrium dissociation
constant (KD) for the interaction between Nef and Hck
SH3 was determined by Scatchard analysis of the SPR
response at equilibrium (Figure 1B) and was found to be

(A) The response functions (sensorgrams) shown illustrate specific
binding and dissociation profiles obtained after Nef protein at various
concentrations was added to the buffer flowing over a biosensor chip
coated with GST-Hck SH3. The data in these sensorgrams and (B) in
the Scatchard analysis are expressed as corrected response units
(cRU), as the contribution by the bulk refractive index (background)
has been subtracted. For clarity only the sensorgrams obtained using
0.08, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 2 and 6 gM Nef are shown in (A), whereas the
SPR response values from all 10 concentrations of Nef tested (ranging
from 0.06 to 6 ,uM) were included in the Scatchard analysis in (B).
The data is best fitted by a line with equation y = -0.255x + 173.6,
the coefficient of determination (r2) being 0.99.
250 nM. The linearity of the Scatchard plot over a wide
range of tested Nef concentrations (0.06-6 ,uM) indicates
that Nef-Hck SH3 binding represents a simple bimolecular
interaction. As seen in Figure IA, the on-rate for Nef
binding to Hck SH3 was very rapid. Due to this rapid on￾rate, significant re-binding of dissociated Nef probably
also occurred under these conditions. Therefore, it was
not possible to reliably measure off- or on-rates, since
both would be artificially influenced by experimental
variables of the system, such as the flow rate, concentration
of Nef and the surface density of Hck SH3. In contrast,
the Scatchard analysis used to determine the KD values is
not sensitive to these effects, since it relies only on the
SPR response at equilibrium.
The low KD value determined for binding of Nef to
Hck SH3 (250 nM) indicates an affinity that is significantly
greater than previously reported for any other SH3-PxxP
interaction (KD 1-50 ,uM). To confirm this unusually
high affinity using another independent methodology we
examined the Hck-Nef interaction by ITC (Wiseman et al.,
1989; Lemmon and Ladbury, 1994). In ITC experiments
we used free Hck SH3, rather than the GST-Hck SH3

Fig. 2. Characterization of Nef binding to the Hck SH3 domain using
ITC. The titration consisted of 16 injections of 15 pl Hck SH3 domain
into Nef protein solution. The points correspond to the enthalpy per
mole of injectant per injection. The first two data points were
removed because of a noisy baseline. The remaining data points were
fitted by a non-linear least squares algorithm, giving a KB of
53.3 ± 9.3x 10-5/M (corresponding to a KD of 188 ± 34 nM), a AH
of -12.75 ± 0.32 kcal/mol and a stoichiometry (N) of 0.893 ± 0.013.
fusion protein, while the other ITC experimental condi￾tions, including buffer composition and temperature, were
essentially identical to those used in the SPR studies. The
heat released upon each of the 16 sequential injections of
Hck SH3 into a Nef solution was integrated and normalized
per mole of injectant. As shown in Figure 2, a plot of
heat released per mole of Hck SH3 injected against the
SH3:Nef molar ratio takes the form of a sigmoid titration
curve, with its midpoint occuring at a ratio of 1:1. The
data were fitted to the curve shown using a non-linear
least squares algorithm (Wiseman et al., 1989) and the
enthalpy per mole of ligand added (AH), the association
constant KB (= 1/ KD) and stoichiometry were derived.
The KD value (188 ± 34 nM) obtained using ITC is
comparable with that observed by SPR and the stoichio￾metry for this interaction (1:0.89) was found to be very
close to a ratio of 1:1. The AH for this interaction at
25°C was -12.75 kcallmol, which together with the
experimentally derived KB value, gives an entropy change
ASO = -12.0 calIK/mol. The large negative enthalpy
change and the small unfavorable entropy change observed
for the Nef-Hck SH3 interaction indicate that under the
experimental conditions used this interaction is mainly
driven by exothermic enthalpy.
In direct contrast to Nef, no binding to Hck SH3 was
observed when the mutant Nef-PA1 protein was tested
using SPR (Figure 3A), indicating that the high affinity
of the Nef-Hck SH3 interaction is critically dependent on
an intact Nef PxxP motif. To confirm that this lack of
binding was due to the defective PxxP motif of Nef-PAI,
rather than a non-specific structural alteration in the protein
caused by the introduced Pro-4Ala changes we compared
the wild-type Nef and Nef-PA proteins by circular

dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. As seen in Figure 3B, under
experimental conditions similar to those used for the SPR
measurements, the CD spectra of Nef and Nef-PAI were
virtually identical, excluding the possibility of gross struc￾tural abnormalities in Nef-PAI. It should be noted that
Nef proteins used in all these experiments were highly
purified and free of GST. The lack of apparent structural
alterations in Nef-PA1 by CD is in agreement with our
previous observations, which indicate that despite loss of
SH3 binding and hence the ability to increase HIV
replication, Nef-PA1 can still mediate down-modulation
of surface expression of the CD4 molecule (Saksela
et al., 1995). Moreover, the CD spectra obtained for these
Nef proteins appear identical to those published by
Wittinghofer and colleagues in their biochemical
characterization of the HIV-1 NL4-3 Nef protein (Wolber
et al., 1992).
In summary, these data show that native Nef protein
can bind in solution to the Hck SH3 domain with very
high affinity and that this binding is absolutely dependent
on a functional Nef PxxP site.
Sequence comparison and molecular modeling
In an effort to understand the structural basis of specific
SH3 binding by Nef we have aligned the PxxP motif of
5008
Nef
Nef-PAIRT loop determines SH3 specificity
Nef with other PxxP motifs (Figure 4A), as well as the
sequence of Hck SH3 with those of other SH3 domains
(Figure 4B). To illustrate the potential interactions between
the Nef PxxP peptide and the Hck SH3 domain we have
modeled the complex on the basis of known SH3 peptide
structures (Figure 4C). Figure 4A shows an alignment of
various SH3 binding ligands adapted from Lim et al.
(1994). Based on the molecular modeling, as well as on
experimental data, we suggest that the two middle prolines
of the HIV-1 Nef tetraproline repeat constitute the PxxP
defining residues and that the positioning of the HIV-1
Nef residue Arg77, which is very well conserved among
different primate immunodeficiency viruses, defines bind￾ing of the Nef PxxP peptide in the 'minus' orientation.
This arginine residue, in the P_3 binding pocket, would
thus be involved in interactions with acidic residues in
the RT loop of Hck SH3 (residues f and g in Figure 4B
and C). The critical role of the two internal prolines
(PVRPQVPLRP) is supported by data from filter binding
experiments indicating that mutation of either one of
them alone (PVRAQVPLRP or PVRPQVALRP) abolishes
binding to Hck SH3 and that a peptide overlapping the
corresponding region in SIVmac239 Nef (LVGISVRPKV￾PLRTMSYK) can bind to Hck SH3, despite its lack of
both of the external prolines (data not shown). Moreover,
a hydrophobic residue (Val74) assigned to binding pocket
PO is also extremely well conserved among Nef proteins
encoded by different viruses (including SIVmac239). Thus
this valine and the arginine in the P_3 pocket form
the two asymmetric interactions defining the 'minus'
orientation (Feng et al., 1994; Lim et al., 1994).
The structural model (Figure 4C) described here was
generated in a simplistic manner and relies on the strong
conservation of three-dimensional structure in SH3
domains (Wu et al., 1995). In particular, the model is
based on the structures of the highly homologous Fyn
and Lck SH3 domains, as well as the Crk-SH3-peptide
complex (Noble et al., 1993; Eck et al., 1994; Wu et al.,
1995). We modeled the other arginine residue in this
region of Nef (Arg71) in position P3, so that the aliphatic
region of the side chain packs against the face of two
conserved tyrosines residues, Tyr66 and Tyri 11 (a and 1),
of the Hck SH3 domain. The guanido group of Arg7l1
may hydrogen bond with Asp67 (b) and Glu69 (d). Unlike
the laboratory-adapted strain HIV- 1 NL4-3, almost all Nef
genes isolated from patients encode an arginine or a lysine
at position 71 (Shugars et al., 1993; Huang et al., 1995)
and an arginine residue in this position of Nef (as
compared to Thr) increases its binding to Hck SH3
(Saksela et al., 1995).
The RT loop determines the differential affinity of
Hck and Fyn SH3 domains
The SH3 domains of Hck and Lyn can bind to Nef,
whereas the highly homologous SH3 domains of Fyn or
Lck do not (Saksela et al., 1995). Based on our modeling
of the Hck SH3-Nef interaction (Figure 4A and C) and
the alignment of the amino acid sequences of various SH3
domains (Figure 4B), our attention was drawn towards
adjacent isoleucine (e in Figure 4B) and histidine residues
that are present in the SH3 RT loops of Hck and Lyn, but
not in other SH3 domains. To test the importance of this
part of the RT loop in differential binding to Nef PxxP
we made a reciprocal change involving the three divergent
amino acids in this region of Hck and Fyn SH3s. This
resulted in a mutant Hck SH3 domain which has a Fyn￾like RT loop (Hck-RTE) and a mutant Fyn SH3 which
has a Hck-like RT loop (Fyn-IHH) (see Table I).
The affinity of these mutant SH3 domains in binding
to Nef was then compared with wild-type Hck and Fyn
SH3 domains by SPR. As expected, in contrast to the
strong interaction between Nef and Hck SH3, binding of
Nef to Fyn SH3 was very weak (Figure 5). Although
some binding over the background was observed using
high concentrations of Nef (8 ,uM), these sensorgrams
were not sufficiently well defined to accurately determine
a KD value for this interaction (estimated to be weaker
than KD 20 ,uM) by Scatchard analysis. In contrast, when
the Fyn SH3 domain with a Hck-like RT loop (Fyn-IHH)
was tested, good binding to Nef (KD 2.0 FM) was observed
(Table I). Conversely, substituting the RT loop of Hck
SH3 with that of Fyn (Hck-RTE) resulted in loss of
quantifiable binding to Nef (KD >20 FM).
We then constructed and tested additional mutant Fyn
SH3 domains to examine the individual contribution of
each of the three Hck-specific amino acids (IHH) in
providing Nef binding affinity for Fyn SH3 (see Table I).
We found that the affinity of Fyn-IH was similar (KD
3.1 ,uM) to that of Fyn-IHH (KD 2.0 ,uM), suggesting that
the second histidine residue in Fyn-IHH did not contribute
to its increased affinity for Nef. Like wild-type Fyn SH3,
binding of Nef to Fyn-H was too weak to be accurately
quantitated by the current assay (KD >20 ,uM), indicating
that the first histidine in the Hck-like RT loop of Fyn￾IHH does not increase binding to Nef when introduced
alone into Fyn SH3. In contrast, Fyn-I bound to Nef even
better than Fyn-IHH (or Fyn-IH), showing an affinity for
Nef (KD 380 nM) almost as great as that of Hck SH3 (KD
250 nM). This suggests that the increased affinity of Fyn￾IHH for Nef resulted primarily from replacement of the
Fyn residue Arg96 by an isoleucine (position c in Figure
4B). The fact that Fyn-I binds Nef more strongly than
Fyn-IH or Fyn-IHH seems counterintuitive, given that
both Hck and Lyn have a histidine residue following this
isoleucine. The reason for this is unclear in the absence
of a structure of the mutant Fyn SH3 domain. One
possibility is that in Fyn-IH and Fyn-IHH the presence of
this histidine may interfere with interaction between the
arginine residue of the Nef PxxP motif and Asp 100 in Fyn.
To explore the basis for the increased affinity of the
mutant Fyn SH3 domain (Fyn-I) for Nef we replaced
the naturally occurring arginine residue (Arg96) in this
position of Fyn with other amino acids (Table I). These
substitutions included a basic residue (lysine, Fyn-K), an
acidic residue (aspartic acid, Fyn-D) and a non-polar
residue with reduced hydrophobic surface (alanine,
Fyn-A). None of these Fyn SH3 mutants bound to Nef as
strongly as Fyn-I. However, in contrast to Fyn-K and
Fyn-D, which did not bind to Nef any better than wild￾type Fyn SH3, Fyn-A showed a relatively high affinity
for Nef (KD 4.4 ,uM). The fact that lysine and aspartate
substitutions at this position lead to equally poor binding
indicates that repulsion by the positive charge of the Fyn
residue Arg96 (e in Figure 4B) is not the major determinant
of the low affinity of Fyn. Rather, the interaction involves

Fig. 4. (A) Alignment of the Nef PxxP motif (RPQVPLR, amino acids 71-77 in HIV-1 NL4-3 Nef) with other peptides binding to different SH3
domains in 'plus' or 'minus' orientations according to Lim et al (1994) and Feng et al (1994). The Nef residues which are highly conserved among
primate immunodeficiency viruses are indicated in bold type. The positions P-3, P-1, PO, P2 and P3 contain the ligand residues which interact with
the conserved hydrophobic residues forming the binding interface of SH3 domains. The spacing of positions are also shown in the ribbon diagram
representing a left-handed PPII helix. (B) Alignment of SH3 domain amino acid sequences. The indicated secondary structure is based on the crystal
structure of the Fyn SH3 domain (Noble et al., 1993). The five antiparallel f-sheets (A-E) forming the SH3 structure, as well the loops between

similarity (D/E, K/R, S/T, W/FY and A/L/I/V were considered similar) is indicated by light blue coloring. The conserved acidic (b, d, f and g) and
hydrophobic (a, c, h, i, j, k and 1) residues implicated in ligand binding are indicated on top of the amino acid alignment. (C) Hypothetical model of
potential interactions between Hck SH3 and the Nef PxxP motif. The Ca backbone of Hck SH3 is shown in red and the Nef PxxP motif (sequence
VRPQVPLRP, modeled in the 'minus' orientation, right to left) is shown in yellow. The conserved hydrophobic residues (a, c, h, i, j, k and 1)
forming the binding surface of the Hck SH3 domain are shown in white, except for residue Phe77 (h), which is omitted for clarity. The acidic
residues (f and g) in the RT loop which are shown to interact with the arginine residue at the P13 position of the Nef PxxP motif and the acidic
residues (b and d) which are modeled to interact with the arginine residue at the P3 position are shown in purple. The isoleucine residue (e) in the
RT loop which is implicated in the interaction with Nef is shown in blue. This model is based on SH3-peptide complexes of known structure (Noble
et al., 1993; Eck et al., 1994; Wu et al., 1995).

Amino acid sequences in the region of the SH3 domain RT loop that were targeted for mutagenesis analysis are shown for wild-type (wt) Hck and
Fyn and the derived altered SH3 proteins. The introduced amino acid changes are underlined. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for
binding of these SH3 domains to Nef protein or a 12mer peptide overlapping the Nef PxxP motif (PVRPQVPLRPMT), measured based on surface
plasmon resonance or tryptophan fluorescence respectively, are shown on their right.
specific selection of Hck because of the isoleucine side
chain at this position.
Nef PxxP peptide alone has low affinity and
limited specificity in SH3 binding
The loss of binding to Hck SH3 by the Nef mutant with
a double Pro->Ala substitution within its tetraproline
repeat region indicated that this PxxP motif is essential
for high affinity SH3 binding by Nef. To study the binding
properties of an isolated peptide containing the Nef PxxP
motif we synthesized a 12mer peptide PVRPQVPLRPMT
spanning this region and studied its interaction with
different SH3 domains by tryptophan fluorescence
(Knudsen et al., 1995). This method is well suited for
detection of interactions involving small polypeptides and
has the capacity to measure affinities of interactions with
KD values in the high micromolar range.
We found that the affinity of the 12mer Nef peptide in
binding to Hck SH3 was 91 ,uM, indicating that this
interaction is >300-fold weaker than that with full-length
Nef protein (Table I). Furthermore, we measured a KD
value of 202 ,uM for the interaction between Fyn SH3
and the Nef peptide, indicating that the differential specifi￾city of Hck SH3, as compared with Fyn SH3, in binding
to native Nef protein is much less evident when the Nef
PxxP peptide is separated from its natural context.
Nef PxxP motif-mediated SH3 binding examined
by a co-precipitation assay
To confirm our results on the specificity and affinity of
different SH3 domains in binding to Nef and the Nef
PxxP peptide by another technique we developed a robust,
semi-quantitative co-precipitation assay (see Materials and
methods). As can be seen, increasing amounts of co￾precipitating Nef protein was observed using agarose
beads coated with the SH3 domains of Hck or Fyn-I,
showing apparent saturation between 4 and 16 gg/ml Nef
(Figure 6A, panels Hck and Fyn-I). In contrast, no Nef
could be co-precipitated using beads coated with Fyn
SH3, even when the highest Nef concentration (16 ,ug/ml)
was tested (Figure 6A, right panel). Also in agreement
with the BlAcore experiments (Table I), some Nef could
be co-precipitated with Fyn-A, but not with Fyn-K or
Fyn-D (data not shown).

domains. Shown are sensorgrams obtained by testing the binding of
8 ,uM Nef to wild-type Hck (upper line), Fyn-I (middle line) and wild￾type Fyn (lower line) SH3 domains. The amounts of Hck, Fyn-I and
Fyn SH3 proteins immobilized on the biosensor chips were similar,
corresponding to 430, 400 and 490 RU respectively. All sensorgrams
have been corrected for the bulk refractive index effect.
To compare the relative affinities of native Nef protein
and the Nef PxxP peptide PVRPQVPLRPMT in binding
to the Hck SH3 domain increasing concentrations of this
peptide were added into the co-precipitation assay to
compete with a constant amount of Nef (4 gg/ml). As
seen in Figure 6B, an 800-fold molar excess of the peptide
was required to significantly compete with full-length Nef
protein in binding to Hck SH3, supporting the magnitude
of the differences in their affinities measured by SPR
(Nef) and tryptophan fluorescence (Nef PxxP).
As expected, mutant Nef-PAI protein with a disrupted
tetraproline repeat could not be co-precipitated with Hck
SH3 (Figure 6C). In contrast, another mutant form of Nef
containing a Pro->Ala substitution at position 147 (Nef￾A147) bound to Hck SH3 with an apparently similar
affinity to the wild-type Nef (Figure 6C), 'indicating that
in the context of native soluble Nef protein the residue
Prol47 is not involved in binding to Hck SH3.
Discussion
In this study we show that the basis of the differential
affinity of the Hck and Fyn SH3 domains in binding to
the HIV-1 Nef PxxP site lies in their RT loops. Both the
high affinity and the high selectivity of the Nef-Hck SH3

Fig. 6. SH3-Nef co-precipitation assay. (A) One microgram of the
bead-immobilized GST fusion proteins containing Hck, Fyn or Fyn-I
SH3 domains were incubated with increasing concentrations of Nef as
indicated. The amount of Nef protein retained with the beads after
washes was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The positions of the GST-SH3
and Nef proteins in the Coomassie Blue stained gels are indicated on
the left. (B) Beads containing 2 ,ug GST-Hck SH3 protein were

in the presence of increasing molar excess of the Nef PxxP peptide
PVRPQVPLRPMT, as indicated, followed by analysis of co￾precipitated Nef protein as in (A). (C) Beads containing 4 gg GST￾Hck SH3 protein were incubated with increasing concentrations of
Nef, Nef-PAl or Nef-A147, followed by analysis of co-precipitated
Nef proteins as in (A). The Nef-A 147 protein preparation contained
traces of residual free GST protein, which binds to the glutathione
beads and can be seen migrating below the Nef protein in these lanes.
interaction were dependent on the presence of the Nef
PxxP sequence in the Nef protein, yet were not observed
when a 12mer synthetic peptide spanning the Nef tetra￾proline repeat region was tested. This could be due to at
least two reasons: Nef protein might present its Nef
PxxP peptide for Hck SH3 in a distinct conformation or
additional contacts between Nef and Hck SH3 might
contribute to the affinity and specificity of this interaction.
Based on filter binding experiments, it had been sug￾gested that the distally located Nef residue Pro147 might
fold to directly participate in Hck SH3 binding (Saksela
et al., 1995). However, the present data (Figure 6C) do
not support this hypothesis and suggest that mutation of
this proline affected binding only through effects on
refolding of denatured Nef after transfer to the filter.
Nevertheless, our present data support the hypothesis that
additional regions of Nef are important for interaction
with Hck SH3. Our data indicate that the Hck residue
Ile71 (e in Figure 4B) plays a positive role in selection
of Nef as a high affinity ligand for its SH3 domain. Since
molecular modeling of the Hck SH3-Nef PxxP interaction
on the basis of known structures of SH3-peptide com￾plexes does not provide an adequate structural explanation
for this observation, we speculate that additional contact(s)
provided by the native Nef protein might target this
isoleucine residue in the RT loop of Hck SH3.
The weak affinity of Hck SH3 for the synthetic 12mer
Nef tetraproline peptide (KD 91 ,uM) is in agreement with
the KD values obtained by others using short peptide
ligands to measure affinities of SH3-PxxP interactions.
Even when optimized sequences have been selected from
libraries of synthetic peptides, SH3 binding affinities >KD
1 jiM have not been observed (Yu et al., 1994). Such low
values, as well as limited binding specificity, have raised
doubts about whether SH3 domains alone can mediate
highly selective protein-protein interactions in vivo. In
fact, most peptides containing a PxxP motif in a hydro￾phobic background are likely to show some SH3 binding,
particularly if a basic residue (b) is present nearby in an
appropriate position (bxxPxxP or PxxPxb). Even peptides
comprised exclusively of proline bind weakly to SH3
domains and in a <10-fold molar excess can substitute
for presumably specific PxxP peptides in competing for
binding of cellular proteins to Src family SH3 domains
(Weng et al., 1994). It is possible that many of the
identified PxxP peptides could mediate much stronger and
more selective SH3 binding when present in their native
contexts than as free peptides. Conversely, if such an
increased affinity is not observed for the full-length protein,
not all proteins that contain an SH3 binding peptide may
be physiologically involved in interactions with cellular
SH3 proteins.
The low selectivity of Hck and Fyn SH3 domains in
recognizing the Nef PxxP peptide in solution (91 versus
202,M) is somewhat surprising in the light of the apparent
selectivity that we have previously observed for binding
of Hck SH3 (but not Fyn SH3) to fusion proteins containing
the Nef PxxP peptide (Saksela et al., 1995). It is possible
that the 2-fold difference in their binding affinities may
have appeared disproportionately large in the filter binding
assay used if the affinity of the weaker interaction (Nef
PxxP-Fyn SH3) was below the threshold of efficient
detection in this system. In summary, it appears that the
presence of the Nef PxxP peptide in the context of whole
Nef protein both provides an increased affinity for SH3
binding, as well as influences its specificity.
Guided by the sequence differences between the trans￾forming v-Src and non-transforming c-Src proteins,
previous investigations have indicated an important role for
the SH3 RT loop in determining the biological properties of
the Src protein tyrosine kinase (Kato et al., 1986; Potts
et al., 1988). Strikingly, some, but not all, single amino
acid changes involving the c-Src residue Arg95 (corres￾ponding to Arg96 in Fyn; e in Figure 4C) resulted in
activation of its transforming potential (Potts et al., 1988).
While such changes in the RT loop might also result in an
altered substrate specificity of the Src kinase, a significant
increase in its overall enzymatic activity was observed
(Kato et al., 1986; Potts et al., 1988). Recent investigations
have provided a possible explanation for this observation,
by revealing a role for the SH3 domain in suppression of
the intrinsic enzymatic activity of the Src family kinases.
This effect has been attributed to the SH3 domain facilitat￾ing formation of an intramolecular interaction between
the SH2 domain and a phosphotyrosine residue in the

C-termini of Src kinases, resulting in inhibition of catalytic
activity (Murphy et al., 1993; Okada et al., 1993; Superti
Furga et al., 1993).
A recent mutagenesis analysis by Erpel et al. (1995)
showed a good correlation between mutations in the Src
SH3 domain that resulted in loss of intermolecular ligand
recognition and failure to co-operate in its catalytic down￾regulation. Interestingly, one Src mutant that had an altered
SH3 RT loop was unable to cooperate in Src down￾regulation, yet retained its ability to bind to PxxP￾containing target proteins. Thus, in the light of our present
data and previous published studies, it appears that the
RT loop is involved in Src autoregulation, as well as in
ligand selection, and the specific structural requirements
for these two functions may be different. The gain of
function observed in this study upon introducing a single
amino acid change into the RT loop of Fyn SH3, such
that its affinity towards Nef increased >100-fold, strongly
argues that, in contrast to the conserved hydrophobic SH3
residues, the role of the RT loop in ligand binding is not
only to provide a scaffold for basic accommodation of
the PxxP motif structure, but also to provide selective and
high affinity recognition of specific ligands.
In summary, this study defines the specificity and affinity
of the Nef-Hck SH3 interaction and the necessity for
presentation of the PxxP motif within the context of the
intact protein. By examining binding of native Nef protein
to the SH3 domain of Hck we demonstrate that SH3-
PxxP-mediated protein-protein interactions can have a
very high affinity and that in such a case, a small difference
in the RT loop region can provide remarkably selective
binding properties for two highly homologous SH3
domains. These data seem encouraging for the prospect
of interfering with specific SH3-PxxP interactions in the
treatment of human disease, specifically, modulating the
pathogenesis of HIV infection by blocking the function
of Nef.
Materials and methods
Expression vectors and protein purification
Construction of plasmids encoding GST fused to the N-terminus of
HIV- 1 NL4-3-derived Nef proteins containing various mutations has been
described previously (Saksela et al., 1995). Expression and purification of
GST-Nef-R71 fusion proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)
were carried out as suggested by the supplier of the components of the
GST fusion protein expression system (Pharmacia). After elution from
glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) GST-Nef fusion proteins were
dialyzed against cleavage buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.4, 150 mM KCI,
2.5 mM CaCl2, 20% glycerol) overnight and subjected to thrombin
cleavage (6 U thrombin/100 mg fusion protein) for 6 h. This resulted in
full-length Nef protein with an additional six amino acids (GSPEFT) at
its N-terminus. Cleavage was terminated by adding 1 mM phenylmethyl￾sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), followed by
an overnight dialysis against buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mM
KCI, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM DTT). To separate Nef protein from released
GST and from uncleaved fusion protein the dialyzed material was loaded
onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated
with buffer B (buffer A with 1 mM DTT) and eluted with a linear NaCI
gradient up to 1 M NaCl. Nef protein eluted at 0.1 M NaCl. The fractions
containing Nef were pooled and applied to a 20 ml glutathione-Sepharose
column to remove residual GST (in buffer B). The flow-through material
was collected and precipitated with 80% saturated ammonium sulfate,
resuspended in a small volume of buffer B and applied to a Superdex
75 HiLoad gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with buffer B. Nef
eluted in a single peak corresponding to the size of a monomer. The
fractions containing highly purified Nef protein were concentrated with
Centriprep- 10 (Amicon) to 30 mg/ml in the same buffer. For each
purification 12 1 of culture was typically used and the final recovery of
purified (>99% purity judged by SDS-PAGE) Nef protein was -30 mg,
as determined spectrophotometrically from their extinction coefficients
E280 = 48 790 (experimental value E280 = 44 190; Wolber et al., 1992).
cDNA encoding human Hck (RT-PCR amplified from blood cell RNA
from K.Saksela) and Fyn (Kawakami et al., 1986; a kind gift from
Avery August and H.Hanafusa, the Rockefeller University) were used
as templates to amplify the corresponding SH3 domain regions (Fyn
residues 86-143) using primers containing sites for EcoRI and XhoI
restriction endonucleases for cloning into the corresponding sites in
pGEX-IZT [pGEX-lXT (Pharmacia) with a modified polylinker]. The
Hck and Fyn SH3 constructs with mutagenized RT loops (Table I) were
derived by using a long 5' PCR primer extending over this region and
containing the designed mutations. All SH3 constructs were confirmed
by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. GST-SH3 proteins were expressed
from these constructs and purified according to the protocol provided
with glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and biotinylated using the
ImmunoPure NHS-LC-Biotin reagent as suggested by the supplier
(Pierce).
To produce Hck SH3 domain (without GST) for ITC experiments
cDNA encoding the SH3 domain of Hck was amplified by PCR using
the GST-Hck SH3 construct as template. The amplified DNA fragment
was subcloned into an expression vector, pET3a (Novagen), through
NdeI and BamHI sites. Expression of the Hck SH3 domain using the
resulting plasmid was performed according to the protocol provided by
the supplier of the pET expression system (Novagen). Protein was
purified using standard chromatography techniques, including a DEAE
Fast Flow column, a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column, a Phenyl Sepharose
(high performance) column and a Superdex75 HiLoad 16/60 column on
an FPLC system (Pharmacia). The protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml
by ultrafiltration (Amicon). For each purification 6 1 of culture was
typically used and the final recovery of purified (>99% purity judged
by SDS-PAGE) Hck SH3 domain was -12 mg.
Peptide synthesis
Peptide PVRPQVPLRPMT was synthesized by the Biopolymer Synthesis
Facility at the Rockefeller University, using conventional technology.
The peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography
and lyophilized prior to resuspension in the buffers used in different
experiments. The identity of the peptide was confirmed by mass
spectroscopy and its concentration was determined by quantitative amino
acid analysis.
Molecular modeling
Crystal structures of the Fyn SH3 (Noble et al., 1993) and Lck SH3-
SH2 domains (Eck et al., 1994) and Crk SH3-C3G complex (Wu et al.,
1995) were used for modeling Hck-peptide interaction. The Fyn SH3
domain (PDB access number 1 shf) shows the highest sequence homology
(62% identity) to the Hck SH3 among SH3 domains whose three￾dimensional structures have been determined and was therefore used to
provide the scaffold of our Hck SH3 model, except for the region of
the n-Src loop, in which the sequence of the Lck SH3 domain is more
similar to Hck. Three SH3 domain structures were superimposed and
residues of Fyn SH3 that are dissimilar to Hck SH3 were changed using
program 'O' (Jones et al., 1991). Peptide coordinates were taken from
the structure of Crk SH3 complexed with the C3G peptide (Wu et al.,
1995) and the residues were changed according to the Nef PxxP motif.
X-PLOR (Brunger, 1988) was used to remove unfavorable van der Waals
contacts and to improve the geometry by energy minimization and the
resulting model was displayed using QUANTA (Molecular Simulations
Inc.).
Surface plasmon resonance analysis
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were carried out on a
BIAcore Biosensor apparatus (Pharmacia Biosensor). Data analysis was
performed with the interactive software BIAevalution v2.0 (Pharmacia
Biosensor). Biotinylated GST-SH3 proteins were immobilized through
biotin-streptavidin interaction onto a Biosensor Chip SA5 (Pharmacia
Biosensor) containing pre-immobilized streptavidin. Immobilizations
were performed at 25°C with a flow rate of 5 gIl/min in HBS running
buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.05%
Surfactant P20). The amount of biotinylated GST-SH3 fusion protein
bound to the chip was monitored by the change in refractive index and
controlled to be -450 RU (response units). To measure the equilibrium
background response signal (bulk refractive index effect) control experi￾ments were performed using a blank cell at Nef concentrations identical
5013C.-H.Lee et aL
to those used for specific binding studies. Equilibrium background
response values (-0-20% of total response, depending on the concentra￾tion of Nef) were subtracted from the values obtained for the specific
binding reactions to yield the specific response value, cRU (corrected
response unit), for each concentration of Nef tested. All binding
experiments were performed at 25°C with a flow rate of 10 ,ul/min in
HBS running buffer with 1 mM DTT. The concentration range of Nef
and Nef-PAl used for binding to various GST-SH3 fusion proteins was
6-0.06 FM. After completion of an individual binding experiment the
chip was washed for a further 20 min with running buffer (HBS with
1 mM DTT) at a flow rate of 15 gl/min, which was found to be sufficient
to regenerate the chip. Due to the extremely high affinity interaction
between biotin and streptavidin (KD -O1- M), this washing did not
result in loss of the immobilized GST-SH3 proteins. The level of the
SPR response was examined using a standard Nef solution before and
after 20 programmed runs and revealed no significant change in Nef
binding capacity of the chips.
Isothermal titration calorimetry
Titrations employed the OMEGA instrument (MicroCal; Wiseman et al.,
1989) and were performed at 25°C in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl,
3.4 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.4. Both Hck SH3 and Nef were
dialyzed exhaustively, in the same container, against this buffer prior to
titration. The titration was then performed as described (Lemmon and
Ladbury, 1994) with 16 injections of 15 ,ul each of Hck SH3 (at
1.09x l0-4 M) into a solution of Nef (1.09X 10-5 M) in the calorimeter
cell (1.39 ml). The heat of dilution of the Hck SH3 solution was
determined in a separate titration of SH3 domain into buffer solution
present in the cell. The heat per injection remained constant throughout
this dilution and a mean value for this heat was subtracted from heats
per injection measured in the binding titration. An additional control
was performed for the heat of dilution of buffer into the Nef solution
and this heat was also subtracted from experimental heats of dilution.
In all cases the value for [sites]KD (c value) was <100. Titration curves
were fitted using ORIGIN software (MicroCal), using a non-linear least
squares algorithm based on a model for a single class of binding site,
as indicated by the shape of the titrations (Wiseman et al., 1989).
Stoichiometry, binding constant (KB = I/KD) and AH were all allowed
to float in the fitting procedure.
Tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy
Fluorescence measurements were done at 18°C using a Perkin-Elmer
760-40 fluorescence spectrometer (Knudsen et al., 1995). The wavelength
for excitation was 290 nm and the wavelength for emission was 345 nm.
Increasing amounts of 23 mM Nef PxxP peptide solution were added to
1 cm square quartz fluorescence cuvettes containing 1 ml of a 0.5 jM
solution of the GST-SH3 domain fusion protein of interest in HBS
buffer and the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD values) for these
interactions were determined based on the observed changes in fluores￾cence. Since the concentrations of SH3 domains were low, the experi￾mental data were fitted using the following equation: F = Fmax X
[peptide]/([peptidel + KD), where [peptide] and F are the peptide
concentration and the measured protein fluorescence intensity at each
point and Fmax is the observed maximal fluorescence intensity of the
protein when saturated with the peptide. Non-linear regression curve
fitting using ORIGIN (MicroCal Software Inc.) was done to fit the
experimental data to the above equation. In the case of Hck purified
SH3 domain cleaved free of GST was also similarly tested and showed
binding kinetics very similar to those observed using the GST-Hck SH3
fusion protein.
CD spectroscopy
CD measurements were done using a AVIV 62 DS CD spectrometer
and data collection and processing were performed using the program
provided by the manufacturer. Experiments using 50 jM protein in HBS
buffer containing 1 mM DTT were carried out at three different
temperatures (4, 15 and 25°C) using a 0.1 mm path length cuvette.
Spectra were recorded in the wavelength range 195-240 nm with a
0.5 nm spacing and values from five individual measurements were
averaged and expressed as molar mean residue ellipticity values as a
function of the wavelength.
Co-precipitation assay
To examine binding of wild-type and mutant Nef proteins to different
GST-SH3 fusion proteins in solution 1-4 ,ig (as detailed in the legend
to Figure 6) of each GST-SH3 fusion protein were immobilized on
glutathione-agarose beads and incubated at 4°C for 20 min with various
concentrations of Nef in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1%
Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, I mM DTT (in a total volume of 1 ml).
After a 20 min incubation at 4°C the beads were washed three times
with the same buffer, followed by electrophoretic analysis in a 15%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Bound Nef protein, as well as the GST-SH3
fusion protein, were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Peptide
inhibition assays were done in an identical manner except that, in
addition to Nef, a 2- to 800-fold molar excess of the peptide
PVRPQVPLRPMT was also included in the binding reaction.
