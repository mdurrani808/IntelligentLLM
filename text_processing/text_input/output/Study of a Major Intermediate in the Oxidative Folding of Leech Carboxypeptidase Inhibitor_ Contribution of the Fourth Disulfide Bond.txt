The oxidative folding pathway of leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI;
four disulfide bonds) proceeds through the formation of two major
intermediates (III-A and III-B) that contain three native disulfide bonds and
act as strong kinetic traps in the folding process. The III-B intermediate
lacks the Cys19–Cys43 disulfide bond that links the b-sheet core with the
a-helix in wild-type LCI. Here, an analog of this intermediate was
constructed by replacing Cys19 and Cys43 with alanine residues. Its
oxidative folding follows a rapid sequential flow through one, two, and
three disulfide species to reach the native form; the low accumulation of
two disulfide intermediates and three disulfide (scrambled) isomers
accounts for a highly efficient reaction. The three-dimensional structure
of this analog, alone and in complex with carboxypeptidase A (CPA), was
determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.2 A˚ resolution. Its overall
structure is very similar to that of wild-type LCI, although the residues
in the region adjacent to the mutation sites show an increased flexibility,
which is strongly reduced upon binding to CPA. The structure of the
complex also demonstrates that the analog and the wild-type LCI bind to
the enzyme in the same manner, as expected by their inhibitory capabilities,
which were similar for all enzymes tested. Equilibrium unfolding
experiments showed that this mutant is destabilized by w1.5 kcal molK1
(40%) relative to the wild-type protein. Together, the data indicate that the
fourth disulfide bond provides LCI with both high stability and structural
specificity.

Introduction
Protein folding commonly proceeds through a
series of intermediates that define the folding
landscape from the unfolded polypeptide to the
native structure.1,2 Understanding the fundamental
relationship between the amino acid sequence and
the three-dimensional structure of a native protein
is advanced by structural analysis of those folding
intermediates. Although characterizing the inter￾mediates is usually a difficult task due to their short
half-life, studies of proteins stabilized by disulfide
bonds have provided considerable insight into the
field of protein folding.3 In disulfide-rich proteins,
the coupling of the covalent chemistry of disulfide
bond formation to the non-covalent folding pro￾cesses makes it feasible to trap, isolate and

oxidative folding pathways of disulfide-containing
proteins such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
(BPTI),5,6 ribonuclease A (RNase A),7,8 and lyso￾zyme 9,10 have been investigated in great detail.
However, the role and significance of many
structured intermediates that accumulate during
folding are still largely unknown.
Leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI) is a
cysteine-rich polypeptide of 67 residues that
behaves as a tight binding inhibitor of different
metallo-carboxypeptidases.11 Assuming that
leeches secrete LCI during feeding, this inhibitor
seems to maintain blood in the fluid state by
inhibiting plasma carboxypeptidase B (CPB), also
known as thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibi￾tor (TAFI), which acts as a potent attenuator of
fibrinolysis.12,13 Indeed, LCI significantly enhances
clot lysis in vitro induced by tissue plasminogen
activator (S. Salamanca et al., unpublished results),
suggesting a potential use in the prevention or
treatment of thrombotic disorders.14,15 The three￾dimensional structure of LCI shows that it folds in a
compact domain consisting of a five-stranded
antiparallel b-sheet and a short a-helix,16 with
four disulfide bonds between cysteine residues
11–34, 19–43, 22–58, and 18–62, all of them located
within regular secondary structure elements. The
folding, unfolding and thermodynamic studies
performed in our laboratory 17–19 have shown
that LCI is a highly stable molecule with slow
rate constants of unfolding. Its reduced and
denatured form refolds rapidly through a
sequential flow of one, two, and three disulfide
intermediates to reach a rate-limiting step in
which two major three disulfide intermediates
(designated as III-A and III-B) act as kinetic
traps in the folding reaction. Both intermediates
exclusively contain native disulfide pairings and
inter-convert between them, reaching equili￾brium prior to the formation of a heterogeneous
population of four disulfide (scrambled) iso￾mers.19 III-A and III-B are metastable forms in
which both native disulfide bonds and free
thiols appear to be similarly protected from the
solvent; major structural rearrangements through
the formation of scrambled isomers are required to
render native LCI.
We have recently determined the NMR
structure of the III-A intermediate showing that it
contains a native-like structure, which is respon￾sible for its strong accumulation along the LCI
folding.20 It displays, however, greater flexibility
when compared to the native form. Here, we
intend to characterize the physical properties of
the III-B intermediate. Because it was not
possible to obtain this species directly from the
folding reaction, we decided to characterize a
III-B analog in which the native Cys19 and
Cys43 residues were replaced with alanine
residues (C19A/C43A LCI). The differences in
kinetic, thermodynamic, structural and
functional properties resulting from the removal
of the Cys19–Cys43 disulfide bond were ana￾lyzed for a better understanding of the folding
process, conformational stability and function￾ality of LCI. The derived results have general
implications for folding studies of disulfide-rich
proteins, including folding/stability relationships
and protein design.
Results
Oxidative folding of C19A/C43A LCI in the
absence of redox agents
Oxidative folding studies of C19A/C43A LCI
were carried out in Tris–HCl buffer in the absence
(control K) and presence (control C) of the
reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol. Folding inter￾mediates were trapped in a time-course manner by
either acid quenching with trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) or reaction with the alkylating reagent
vinylpyridine. The heterogeneity and chromato￾graphic behavior of the folding intermediates was
characterized by reversed phase (RP)-HPLC, and
the disulfide content was determined by matrix￾assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis.
For this analog, few intermediates populate the
initial phase of the folding process. The RP-HPLC
profiles clearly show the accumulation of three
fractions of major intermediates in the early stages
of the reaction (up to 2 h), designated as a, b, and c
(Figure 1(a)). At this stage the RP-HPLC patterns
remain similar regardless of the presence of
reducing agent and the MS analysis of disulfide
species after derivatization with vinylpyridine
shows the same percentage of one and two disulfide
species (Figure 2, control K and C), indicating that
the presence of the reducing agent has no apparent
effect on these early stages. The analysis of disulfide
species of fractions a, b, and c after their purification
and derivatization showed that they contain mainly
two disulfide species. During the reaction only a
low percentage of species corresponds to three
disulfide non-native (scrambled) isomers, located
mainly in the fraction designated as scr
(Figure 1(a)). Therefore, the presence of 2-mercap￾toethanol, which promotes the partial reduction of
the terminally oxidized species to finally convert
them into the native structure, slightly affects the
last folding stages of C19A/C43A LCI. It becomes
apparent from the quantitative analysis of disulfide
species (Figure 2) that no intermediates represent
high-energy barriers trapping the folding reaction.
Consequently, the folding process is highly efficient,
allowing more than a 90% recovery of the protein as
native form after 24 h of refolding (Figure 2). In
contrast, the folding of wild-type (wt) LCI cannot
reach completion in the absence of a thiol catalyst,
due to the strong accumulation of III-A and III-B
intermediates as well as scrambled species along its
folding (Figure 1(b)), and only w30% of the protein

Folding was performed in Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.4) in the absence (control K) and presence of redox agents: 0.25 mM
2-mercaptoethanol (control C), 0.5 mM GSSG or 0.5 mM GSSG/1 mM GSH. 0 S-S, 1 S-S, 2 S-S, and 3 S-S represent the
completely reduced, one disulfide, two disulfide, and three disulfide species, respectively. The three disulfide species
include the native form and all scrambled isomers. Quantitative analysis of disulfide species was based on the peak
response of MALDI-TOF spectra (data not shown). The recovery of native form is represented by bars and was
calculated from the peak areas in the corresponding RP-HPLC chromatograms.

Characterization of a Three-disulfide Mutant of LCI 963is recovered in the native form after 48 h of
refolding.
Native C19A/C43A LCI can be clearly distin￾guished from the folding intermediates by its
RP-HPLC elution position (Figure 1(a)). To deter￾mine its disulfide pairing, the native analog was
digested with thermolysin as described in Materials
and Methods, and the resultant peptides were
separated by RP-HPLC, and analyzed by mass
spectrometry and Edman sequencing (data not
shown). Together, the data permitted us to deduce
the disulfide pairings Cys11–Cys34; Cys18–Cys62;
Cys22–Cys58, which are the three disulfide bonds
displayed by III-B intermediate of wt LCI.19
Oxidative folding of C19A/C43A LCI in the
presence of redox agents or denaturants
Oxidative folding of C19A/C43A LCI was
performed in the presence of either 0.5 mM
oxidized glutathione (GSSG) or a mixture of 1 mM
reduced and 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione (GSH
and GSSG) and the acid-trapped intermediates
were analyzed by RP-HPLC. Although the addition
of GSSG does not have an effect on the folding
efficiency of C19A/C43A LCI, it strongly acceler￾ates its folding rate (Figure 1(a)). Analysis of the
composition of time-course-trapped intermediates
reveals that this acceleration is caused by a rapid
disulfide oxidation that leads to the generation of
three disulfide species (Figure 2). Indeed, the
fraction corresponding to scrambled isomers (scr)
accumulates much faster when compared with the
control experiment. The RP-HPLC patterns
obtained in the presence of GSSG/GSH were
similar to those obtained in the presence of GSSG
alone (Figure 1(a)), indicating that the addition of
GSH does not strongly affect the folding of C19A/
C43A LCI. Since the redox potential of GSH has
been shown to promote the reduction of three
disulfide scrambled isomers to obtain the native
form,21 the low accumulation of scrambled forms
during C19A/C43A LCI folding would account for
its minimum effect.
Oxidative folding of the C19A/C43A analog was
subsequently performed in Tris–HCl buffer contain￾ing different concentrations of guanidine hydro￾chloride (GdnHCl) or urea, both in the absence
(control K) and presence (control C) of thiol
catalyst. The prevalence of two disulfide inter￾mediates under low denaturing conditions (up to
2 M urea concentration) when compared with the
control experiments is an indication of the stability
of these species (Figure 3(a)). The formation of
native C19A/C43A LCI is strongly accelerated by
the presence of 0.5–1 M GdnHCl similarly to the
effect obtained on wt LCI (Figure 3(a) and (b)).
However, the quicker folding acceleration and
lower accumulation of these metastable forms of
C19A/C43A LCI, when compared to wt LCI folding
under these conditions, reflects the lower stability
of C19A/C43A intermediates relative to those of wt
LCI and prevents them from acting as strong kinetic
traps (Figure 3(a) and (b)). The folding pathway of
this mutant drastically changed when the refolding
experiments were carried out at high denaturing
conditions (e.g. 5 M GdnHCl), with a low recovery
of the native form (less than 5% after 24 h of folding)
(data not shown).
Conformational stability of C19A/C43A LCI
The reductive unfolding of C19A/C43A LCI was
studied at pH 8.4 using increasing concentrations of
dithiothreitol (DTT) as reducing agent to test the
stability of its disulfide bonds. The unfolding
intermediates were trapped in a time-course
manner by acidification and were analyzed by
RP-HPLC. Reduction of this analog undergoes an
apparent all-or-none mechanism in which all three

allowed to refold in Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.4) in the presence of 1 M urea or 0.5 M GdnHCl with (control C) or without
(control K) 2-mercaptoethanol. Folding intermediates were trapped by acidification and analyzed by RP-HPLC. N and
R indicate the elution positions of native and fully reduced species, respectively. III-A and III-B are two intermediates of
wt LCI containing three native disulfides.
964 Characterization of a Three-disulfide Mutant of LCIdisulfides are reduced in a cooperative and
concerted manner, with no accumulation of par￾tially reduced intermediates (data not shown). This
mechanism of disulfide reduction has been pre￾viously shown in numerous small single domain
proteins.22,23 The analysis also reveals that C19A/
C43A LCI resists much lower concentrations of DTT
than wt LCI: similar percentages of unfolded
protein are obtained using 100 mM and 10 mM
DTT for wt and C19A/C43A LCI, respectively (data
not shown).
In the presence of denaturant and thiol initiator,
unfolding of a native disulfide-containing protein
is accompanied by reshuffling of its native dis￾ulfides (disulfide scrambling).24,25 Denaturation of
the native form of wt and C19A/C43A LCI was
analyzed in the presence of increasing concen￾trations of denaturant and monitored by RP-HPLC,
intrinsic fluorescence and CD. All the transition
curves of the three experiments were sigmoid and
the data were fit to a two-state mechanism (see
Materials and Methods). The denaturation curves
obtained by RP-HPLC analysis of disulfide scram￾bling in the presence of urea and GdnHCl show that
the extent of unfolding, and hence the equilibrium
constant between scrambled isomers and the native
protein, is clearly dependent upon the strength of
denaturant (Figure 4). Urea requires higher concen￾trations than GdnHCl to fully denature C19A/
C43A LCI, with midpoint denaturant concen￾trations of 1.9 M and 4.2 M for GdnHCl and urea,
respectively. As expected, the value of DGH2O
U for
C19A/C43A LCI is independent of the denaturant
used in the assay (Table 1). The stability data
obtained from GdnHCl transition curves indicate
that the mutant is destabilized in about
1.5 kcal molK1 with respect to the wt form and the
cM values for the mutant and wt forms are 1.9 M
and 4.2 M, respectively.
Fluorescence spectroscopy provides a convenient
and sensitive means for probing the environment of
Trp residues and has been widely used in the
equilibrium investigation of the folding/unfolding
of proteins.26,27 The fluorescence spectrum of LCI is
dominated by the contribution of two Trp residues
(sequence positions 42 and 50) buried in the interior
of the protein that give an emission maximum at
350 nm (Figure 5(a)). In the presence of denaturant,
the formation of scrambled isomers exposes Trp
residues to solvent, causing both a red shift to
355 nm and an increase of intensity, to its fluor￾escence emission. These differences between the
fluorescence emission of native and scrambled
forms allow us to easily monitor the unfolding

Characterization of a Three-disulfide Mutant of LCI 965reaction. The denaturation curves for wt and C19A/
C43A LCI monitored by Trp fluorescence are very
similar to those obtained by RP-HPLC analysis and
similar thermodynamic parameters are also
obtained (Table 1): DDGmut-wt ZK1.4 kcal molK1
upon disulfide elimination, and 1.8 M and 4.0 M
concentrations of GdnHCl are needed to denature
50% of C19A/C43A LCI and the wt form, respect￾ively (Figure 5(b)). This experiment clearly indicates
that the scrambling process observed upon unfolding
in both the mutant and the wt form results in a
progressive exposition of the Trp residues to solvent.
The CD spectrum of native LCI displays a
well-defined minimum in ellipticity at 210 nm and
a maximum at 228 nm, whose disappearance
correlates with the unfolding of the protein.11 The
shape of the CD spectrum of C19A/C43A is very
similar to that of wt LCI (Figure 6(a)), except for a
slight decrease in the intensity of the 228 nm
maximum. Denaturation of the native form of wt
and C19A/C43A LCI in the presence of increasing
concentrations of GdnHCl was followed by moni￾toring the CD signal at 228 nm. The transition
GdnHCl concentration was again very similar to
that obtained in the previous assays: 1.8 M and
4.0 M for C19A/C43A and wt LCI, respectively
(Figure 6(b)). Although the calculated free energy of
unfolding for both the wt and mutant forms is
higher than those calculated in the other exper￾iments, the global destabilization upon mutation
(1.6 kcal molK1
) is in agreement with the previous
results.

966 Characterization of a Three-disulfide Mutant of LCIIt is worth mentioning that, independently of the
technique used to monitor equilibrium unfolding,
in all cases the m value is higher for C19A/C43A
than for wt LCI (Table 1). Since the m values
correlate with the changes in protein accessible
surface area upon unfolding,28 this increase would
indicate that the mutant displays a less compact
unfolded state, with a higher accessibility of the
unfolded polypeptide to solvent.
Function of C19A/C43A LCI
LCI is a tight binding competitive inhibitor of
pancreatic-like metallo-carboxypeptidases (sub￾family A/B) that possess an inhibitory activity in
the nanomolar range.11 Inhibition constants for the
complexes of C19A/C43A LCI with different
carboxypeptidases were determined. As shown in
Table 2, the inhibitory potential of this mutant is
similar to that of wild-type LCI for both carboxy￾peptidases type A and B.
Crystal structure of C19A/C43A LCI
To understand the structural features underlying
the folding, stability and functionality of C19A/
C43A LCI we determined the crystal structure of
the free form and its complex with bovine CPA.
Each asymmetric unit in the crystal contains two
complexes of C19A/C43A LCI-CPA and two free
C19A/C43A LCI molecules. The C19A/C43A LCI
structure determined at 2.2 A˚ resolution shows that
this analog is very similar to the wt form,16
consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel b-sheet
with a b3-b1-b2-b5-b4 topology, and a short a-helix
that packs into the most compact part of the
b-structure (Figure 7(a)). This antiparallel b-sheet
involves residues Glu7–Gln13 (b1), Gln16–Arg23
(b2), Glu33–His37 (b3), Val51–Tyr53 (b4) and
Gly56–Ile63 (b5), while the short a-helix is located
between residues Pro41 and Gly46. The disulfide
pairings of this mutant, as determined from its
three-dimensional structure calculations, are
Cys11-Cys34, Cys18-Cys62, and Cys22-Cys58, in
agreement with the previous chemical analysis.
The structure of the analog upon interaction with
CPA closely resembles that of the wt form
(Figure 7(b)), with a root-mean-square deviation
(r.m.s.d.) between the bound analog and bound wt
form of 0.42 A˚ for backbone, lower than the r.m.s.d.
between the bound and free forms of the analog
(0.91 A˚ for backbone) (Figure 7(c)). The free form of
the mutant shows greater flexibility in the Pro38–
Trp50 region and displays a shifted a-helix (1.8 A˚ )
away from the molecule center when compared to
the wt form. Both deviations are corrected by
complex formation with CPA. In addition, direct
comparison of temperature factors (B-factors) also
shows that the analog is stabilized in the complex,
with average B-value of 29 A˚ 2 for the bound form
and 40 A˚ 2 for the free molecule.
C19A/C43A LCI interacts extensively with the
carboxypeptidase (Figure 8). The occlusion of the C
terminus of this analog in the active site groove of
the carboxypeptidase constitutes the “primary
binding region”. The interactions of the C-terminal
residues of the inhibitor (Val66, Tyr65 and Pro64)
with this region of the enzyme define the binding
subsites S1, S2 and S3, respectively (Figure 8). These
interactions are nearly indistinguishable from those
found in the wt LCI–CPA2 complex16 and differ
only in residue Glu67, which is cleaved off in both
cases but remains bound in the LCI–CPA2 complex
while it leaves its product binding site in C19A/
C43A LCI–CPA. The “secondary binding region”,
established by interactions between the carboxy￾peptidase surface and the neighboring residues of
the mutant, is also highly similar to that of the wt
LCI–CPA2 complex.
Discussion
C19A/C43A LCI is an analog of one of the major
rate-limiting intermediates in LCI oxidative folding.
Here, the in-depth study of its folding pathway and
its functional, thermodynamic and structural prop￾erties provides complementary data for a better
understanding of wt LCI nature and the relation￾ship between its folding and structure. In addition,
the structural determination of its complex with
carboxypeptidase A constitutes one of the few
examples of an analog bound to its target enzyme
and helps in advancing the rational design of LCI
inhibitory capability.
The analysis of the acid-trapped folding inter￾mediates of this analog shows that its folding
process differs significantly from that of wt LCI.
While the oxidative folding of the wt protein does
not show preferential accumulation of one or two
disulfide species, the absence of the Cys19 and
Cys43 causes the accumulation of two disulfide
intermediates in the early stages of the analog
folding. In addition, no strong kinetic traps like
those displayed by wt LCI are able to freeze the
mutant folding reaction, resulting in a fast and
efficient process as compared to that of the wt form.
The strong acceleration of the analog folding in the
presence of GSSG and the lack of effect of the
addition of reducing agents suggests that the native
protein is preferably attained by direct oxidation of

968 Characterization of a Three-disulfide Mutant of LCIconstitutes the rate-limiting step of many three
disulfide proteins such as hirudin or potato
carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI).29,30 In these
proteins the scrambled isomers act as strong kinetic
traps, accumulating in the late stages of the folding
process and therefore the addition of thiol com￾pounds greatly facilitates the efficiency of their
folding.
When C19A/C43A LCI folding is performed
under mild denaturing conditions (e.g. 0.5–1 M
GdnHCl) the two disulfide intermediates accumu￾late to a lesser extent, indicating that the partial
destabilization of these species prevents them from
acting as transient intermediates and thus,
smoothes the folding funnel to the native protein,
resulting in an acceleration of the folding rate. In
contrast, the complete destabilization of these
intermediates observed in concentrations of
GdnHCl higher than 1 M negatively affects the
folding rate and efficiency. In these conditions
secondary structure propensities no longer direct
protein folding through preferential pathways in
which predominantly productive disulfide bonding
occurs. Thus, the folding process proceeds through
a sequential oxidation of one, two, and three
disulfide species that finally accumulate as
scrambled forms. The lower folding rate in strong
denaturing conditions is caused by the difficulty of
these scrambled isomers to attain the native form.
The addition of thiol agents accelerates the folding
reaction, confirming that in these conditions
scrambled isomers have become a new kinetic
trap, resembling now the folding process of the
other three disulfide proteins such as PCI or
hirudin. The differences in the relative abundances
among the scrambled forms when compared to
those observed in the absence of denaturant
agents suggests that scrambled isomers displaying
more open and relaxed conformations, for instance
the beads form, show a higher prevalence, as also
observed for other proteins such as tick anti￾coagulant peptide (TAP) or PCI.24,31
The structure of wt LCI consists of a five-stranded
antiparallel b-sheet and one short a-helix.16 The
intermediate III-B has two free cysteine residues,
Cys19 and Cys43, which connect the a-helix and the
b-sheet in the native structure of LCI, suggesting
that its structure might display a disconnected
a-helical section and a main core of a five
antiparallel b-sheet stabilized by the remaining
three native disulfide bonds. The fact that this
intermediate elutes in the RP-HPLC very close to
other species precludes its homogeneous purifi￾cation and further precise structural characteriz￾ation; therefore, an analog was constructed by
replacing the two free Cys with Ala (C19A/C43A
LCI). The X-ray structure of C19A/C43A LCI alone
and in complex with carboxypeptidase A (CPA)
shows that its overall chain fold is very similar to
that of wt LCI. The comparison between wt LCI–
CPA2 complex and C19A/C43A LCI–CPA complex
reveals that, despite the missing disulfide bond in
the analog, both backbone and side-chains adopt a
conformation that closely resembles that in the wt
form. This includes those residues close to the
carboxypeptidase or near the mutation point, with
an r.m.s.d. between both molecules of 0.42 A˚ for the
backbone. Despite the similarity of both crystal
structures, close examination reveals that the
B-factors of the atoms in the side-chains of the
analog near the place of mutation are clearly higher
than those in the wt structure. The B-factor

Characterization of a Three-disulfide Mutant of LCI 969characterizes not only thermal motion but also the
lack of static order in the crystal, and could be
indicative of a net gain in flexibility in the regions
spatially adjacent to the mutation sites. This
increase in flexibility around the mutation points
becomes more obvious in the crystal structure of the
uncomplexed analog form. Although the backbone
of the bound wt LCI and unbound analog are very
similar, the electron densities of the latter are absent
from the residues forming the last turn of the
a-helix (residues 45–47), clearly indicating a greater
flexibility in this region. This result is sharply
coincident with our previous observation that in
the solution structure of the III-A intermediate, the
other major kinetic intermediate in LCI folding, the
absence of the fourth disulfide bond results in a
native-like structure with an increase of backbone
flexibility around the free cysteine residues (Cys22
and Cys58).20 According to our data, the docking of
the analog to the carboxypeptidase leads to a
reduction of conformational flexibility and thus a
net gain of structural specificity.
As in the case of LCI, analogs of BPTI and RNase
intermediates that lack only one native disulfide
bond and act as major kinetic traps along the
folding process display structures similar to the
native one.32–35 However, there are critical differ￾ences among the folding pathways of these proteins
and that of LCI. For BPTI and RNase A the native
form can be obtained by direct oxidation of the
two free Cys displayed by the productive kinetic
traps.6,8 On the contrary, to attain the native LCI
structure its kinetic traps (III-A and III-B) need to
undergo a general rearrangement and form a
heterogeneous ensemble of non-native four di￾sulfide (scrambled) isomers. We have previously
postulated III-A and III-B intermediates to be
metastable forms equivalent to what Scheraga and
co-workers refer to as “disulfide-insecure” inter￾mediates.36,37 In these intermediates the free thiol
groups are as well protected as their disulfide bonds
by the secondary structure elements; therefore, such
thiols cannot be simply exposed and oxidized by a
local unfolding. Structural fluctuations that expose
the thiol groups are also likely to expose the
disulfide bonds and promote their reshuffling
instead of direct oxidation of the free thiols to
obtain the native pairing. Indeed, we have recently
demonstrated by NMR amide exchange experi￾ments that the free cysteine residues (Cys22 and
Cys58) and disulfide bonds of III-A are buried
inside its native-like structure.20 The crystal struc￾ture of the III-B analog shows that residues Ala19
and Ala43 expose less than 7% of their surface to
solvent, similar or even lower values than those of
the rest of the cysteine residues involved in native
disulfide bonds (Cys11, Cys18, Cys22, Cys34, Cys58
and Cys62). Thus, by analogy we could assume that
the reactive thiol groups in the free Cys of the III-B
intermediate (Cys19 and Cys43) are also well
protected. This fact, together with a previously
reported experiment where we demonstrated that
the presence of an external thiol reagent did not
affect the rate of conversion of III-B into scrambled
forms,19 would confirm that this species behaves as
a disulfide-insecure intermediate and highlights
again the critical role of accessibility in oxidative
folding.36 Two other factors with a general influence
on oxidative folding are the proximity and reactiv￾ity of thiols and disulfide bonds. Both are respon￾sible for the quasi-equilibrium of different disulfide
forms in the pre-folding stages of oxidative folding,
but obviously they are not specific enough to either
strongly favor native disulfide bonding over non￾native ensembles or to direct the protein towards its
native conformation. Thus, the present study
provides a mechanistic explanation for the role of
III-B as a strong kinetic trap in LCI folding,
suggesting that its accumulation relies mainly on
its ability to protect from rearrangement both, its
native disulfide bridges and free cysteine residues.
Lysozyme is a 129 residue four disulfide protein
that folds into two highly structured domains. Its
major oxidative folding intermediate has three
native disulfide bonds and lacks the Cys76–Cys94
bond that connects the a-domain with the b-domain
in the native protein. Preliminary structural charac￾terization of this kinetic trap suggested that, as in
the case of the two folding intermediates of LCI, it
displayed a highly native-like structure.9,10 Later
on, the structure of an analog of this intermediate
(C76A/C94A lysozyme) was determined by NMR,
confirming that its two domains are tightly folded
into a compact structure and the interface between
them is relatively stable despite the loss of the inter￾domain disulfide bond.38 In sharp agreement with
the present study and those reported for BPTI and
RNase analogs, in spite of its nativeness the analog
of the lysozyme major intermediate is three times
less stable against GdnHCl denaturation than the
wild-type form.39 Similar to what happens with
III-A and III-B intermediates of LCI, in this
lysozyme intermediate one of the free cysteine
residues is buried in the protein core. Since its direct
oxidation to render the native form is restricted by
the inaccessibility of this residue it accumulates
during refolding. Thus, the burying of free cysteine
residues inside the core of a metastable kinetic trap,
whose oxidation requires conformational excur￾sions and in some cases non-native cysteine pairing
schemes to attain the native protein, seems to be a
common phenomenon during the folding of highly
stable and rigid disulfide-rich proteins. Never￾theless, this mechanism does not apply to the
folding of more flexible, less structured and/or
less stable disulfide-containing proteins. A good
model of this latter kind of protein is the insulin
superfamily, in which two members, insulin and
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), have been
extensively studied. Both proteins consist of two
chains with three a-helical segments stabilized by
one intra-chain and two inter-chain disulfides. In
these proteins disulfide intermediates have been
shown to exhibit progressive stepwise acquisition
of native structure.40 The contribution of disulfide
pairings to the native structure of insulin and IGF-1
970 Characterization of a Three-disulfide Mutant of LCIhas been investigated in analogs lacking selected
disulfide bonds,41,42 and unlike in the case of
C19A/C43A LCI, pairwise substitutions have led
to a segmental loss of organized structure and even
to the lack of unfolding cooperativity.
Previously reported conformational data of the
III-B intermediate indicated that this molecule
corresponded to a rather stable but less structured
form than native LCI.19 In C19A/C43A LCI the lack
of the two free Cys makes impossible the equili￾brium between the III-A and III-B forms that is
established in wt LCI folding and modifies the
redox potential of the interior of the protein, which
results in the consolidation of a more native-like
conformation. This analog shows the same overall
structure, a similar activity and a faster and more
efficient folding process than wt LCI. The question
is then, why LCI has evolved to be a four disulfide
protein. The data from the equilibrium unfolding
experiments herein provide an unequivocal answer
to this query: the disulfide bond established
between Cys19–Cys43 provides additional stability
to the protein. C19A/C43A LCI shows a global
destabilization about 1.5 kcal molK1 relative to the
wt form, as shown by all methods assessed. In other
words, wt LCI is about 40% more stable than the
three disulfide analog. Probably, the primary effect
of the Cys19–Cys43 disulfide bonding in LCI is the
inherent destabilization of the unfolded state of
the protein relative to the native state, arising from
the decreased entropy of the denatured state.
Accordingly, disruption of this disulfide cross-link
destabilizes the native state relative to the
denatured state because of the increased entropy
of the denatured protein. However, entropic con￾tributions arising from an increase in global/local
flexibility upon disulfide-disruption resulting in a
more disordered folded state in the disulfide￾deleted mutant protein than in the native structure
of wt LCI cannot be discarded; such effects have
been reported for folding intermediate analogs of
RNase A.35
Overall, the fourth disulfide provides LCI with
conformational stability as well as reduced flexi￾bility, that is, increased structural specificity. These
qualities appear to be highly desirable for its
function in vivo, since LCI is a protease inhibitor
from leech saliva evolved to act in blood. Lower
conformational stability or higher backbone fluctu￾ation in a three disulfide version of this molecule
would probably render a protein with a decreased
half-life. The advances made in understanding
the function, stability and folding behavior of LCI
provide more insight into the nature of this protein
and constitute a basis for the development of
variants of this molecule with enhanced activity
and/or stability. This is of great interest given that
carboxypeptidase inhibitors such as LCI or PCI
strongly accelerate the tissue plasminogen
activator-induced lysis of plasma clots by modulat￾ing TAFI activity43,44 and may be used as lead
compounds for the optimization of thrombolytic
therapies.
Materials and Methods
Mutagenesis and protein expression
The synthetic gene for LCI11 was cloned into the pBAT4
plasmid,45 fused in-frame to the OmpA signal sequence
for extracellular expression. The C19A/C43A analog was
constructed using a two-step PCR method for site￾directed mutagenesis. All constructs were verified by
DNA sequencing. Wild-type and C19A/C43A LCI were
obtained by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli
strain BL21(DE3) using M9CAS medium containing 0.5%
(v/v) glycerol. Proteins were purified from the culture
medium using a Sep Pak C18 cartridge (Waters), followed
by anion-exchange chromatography on a TSK-DEAE
5PW column (Tosohaas), and by RP-HPLC on a 4.6 mm
Protein C4 column (Vydac). Protein identity and purity
(O98%) were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS on a Bruker
Ultraflex spectrometer and automatic Edman degra￾dation using a Procise 492 Protein Sequencer (Applied
Biosystems), respectively.
Oxidative folding
The native protein (1 mg) was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris–
HCl buffer (pH 8.4) containing 7 M GdnHCl and 50 mM
DTT and kept at 23 8C for 2 h. The reduced and denatured
sample was then passed through a PD-10 gel-filtration
column (Amersham Biosciences), previously equilibrated
with 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.4). The protein was
recovered in 1.2 ml and immediately diluted to a final
protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in the same Tris–HCl
buffer, both in the absence (control K) and presence
(control C) of 0.25 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Folding
intermediates were trapped in a time-course manner at
selected times by mixing aliquots from the different
solutions with an equal volume of 2% TFA, and analyzed
by RP-HPLC on a Protein C4 column. Using water
containing 0.1% TFA as solvent A and acetonitrile
containing 0.1% TFA as solvent B, a linear gradient from
20% to 40% B over 50 min was applied, at a flow rate of
0.75 ml/min.
Oxidative folding in the presence of redox agents or
denaturants
The procedures of unfolding and refolding were as
described in Oxidative folding. Immediately after desalt￾ing the unfolded protein through a PD-10 column,
0.5 mM GSSG, 0.5 mM GSSG and 1 mM GSH, or selected
concentrations of denaturants (0.5–5 M GdnHCl, 1–8 M
urea) were added. Folding intermediates were similarly
trapped by acidification and analyzed by RP-HPLC.
Disulfide analysis
Acid-trapped intermediates were purified from
RP-HPLC and freeze-dried. The samples were deriva￾tized with 0.2 M vinylpyridine in 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer
(pH 8.4) at 22 8C for 45 min. The reaction was quenched
with 2% TFA. The derivatized samples were analyzed by
MALDI-TOF MS to characterize the number of disulfide
bonds of the folding intermediates. To determine the
disulfide pairing of native C19A/C43A LCI, the protein
was purified by RP-HPLC and freeze-dried. The sample
(20 mg) was derivatized with 0.2 M vinylpyridine in 0.1 M
Tris–HCl buffer (pH 6.4) at 22 8C for 45 min. The
derivatized sample was further purified by RP-HPLC,
Characterization of a Three-disulfide Mutant of LCI 971freeze-dried, and digested with 2 mg of thermolysin
(Sigma, P-1512) in 30 ml of 50 mM N-ethylmorpholine/
acetate buffer (pH 6.4) at 37 8C for 16 h. Thermolytic
products were purified by RP-HPLC using a 4.6 mm C18
column (Vydac); a linear gradient from 0 to 60% solvent B
over 60 min was applied. The molecular masses of
disulfide-containing peptides were determined by
MALDI-TOF MS. The amino acid sequences of selected
thermolytic peptides were analyzed by automatic Edman
degradation.
Reductive unfolding
Native proteins (0.5 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml of
0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.4) with different concen￾trations of DTT (0.1–100 mM). Reduction was carried out
at 23 8C. To monitor the kinetics of unfolding, aliquots of
the sample were removed at various time-points,
quenched with 2% TFA, and analyzed by RP-HPLC as
detailed under Oxidative folding.
Denaturation and unfolding in the presence of
denaturant
Native proteins were dissolved to a final concentration
of 0.5 mg/ml in 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.4) containing
0.25 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and selected concentrations
of denaturants (0–8 M GdnHCl, 0–8 M urea). The
reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium and was
typically performed at 23 8C for 20 h. The samples were
then quenched with 2% TFA and analyzed by RP-HPLC
using the same conditions described in Oxidative
folding.
Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy
Samples were prepared dissolving the protein in 0.1 M
Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mM 2-mercapto￾ethanol and selected concentrations of GdnHCl (0–8 M).
The final protein concentration was 27 mM for CD and
10 mM for fluorescence studies. The reaction was allowed
to reach equilibrium and was performed at 23 8C for 20 h.
CD analyses were carried out in a Jasco J-715 spec￾trometer at 25 8C using a cell of 2 mm pathlength.
Fluorescence spectra were recorded at 25 8C on a
Perkin-Elmer 650-40 spectrofluorometer using 280 nm as
the excitation wavelength. Excitation and emission slits
were set at 5 nm and 7 nm, respectively.
Thermodynamic parameters
Thermodynamic parameters were calculated by fitting
experimental data to equation (1):

where y is the observed fractional population of native

the absence of denaturant, m is a parameter for
cooperativity of unfolding, and (aCb[denaturant]) and

on denaturant concentration. The midpoint concentration
of unfolding, cM, is calculated by equation (2):

The fitting was performed using the non-linear,
least-squares algorithm provided with the software
KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck Software) assuming a two-state
unfolding mechanism.
CP inhibitory assays
The inhibitory activity of C19A/C43A LCI was assayed
by measuring its ability to inhibit the hydrolysis of the
chromogenic substrates N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-
Phe-OH and N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Arg-OH
(Bachem) by carboxypeptidases type A and type B,
respectively. The assay was performed using a substrate
concentration of 100 mM in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer
(pH 7.5) containing 100 mM NaCl. The inhibition
constants (Ki) were determined at the pre-steady-state
as described for tight binding inhibitors.46 Bovine CPA
and porcine CPB were purchased from Sigma and human
CPA1 and CPB were prepared following described
procedures.47,48 The concentration of the purified
solutions of wt and C19A/C43A LCI was determined
from the A280 of the final solution (extinction coefficient:
E0.1%Z2.12).
Crystallization and structure determination
C19A/C43A LCI was crystallized in complex with
bovine CPA. The complex was obtained by mixing both
proteins in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing
100 mM NaCl. The analog was added in excess until
complete inhibition of the enzyme was reached. The
complex was maintained for 2 h at 20 8C and purified by
gel-filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 HiLoad
26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) using the same
buffer, and further concentrated to about 10–12 mg/ml.
Suitable crystals for data collection were obtained at 20 8C
using the sitting-drop, vapor-diffusion method in a few
weeks growing period. Drops were obtained by mixing
equal volumes of protein solution (C19A/C43A LCI–
CPA) and reservoir buffer containing 1.5 M lithium
sulfate monohydrate and 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5).
A dataset up to 2.2 A˚ was collected on the MPG/GBF
beamline BW6 at DESY, Hamburg (Germany) at 90 K.
Diffraction images were taken on MARCCD detectors.
The summary of the data collection is shown in Table 3.
The collected data were integrated, scaled and merged by
XDS and XSCALE programs.49 The structure was
determined by molecular replacement using the Molrep
program from the CCP4 suite.50 The structure of the
LCI–CPA2 complex taken from the PDB entry 1DTD16
was used as a probe after removing the inhibitor part. The
initial R-factor of the model was 0.46. The model was then
refined by Refmac550 and rebuilt by XtalViev/Xfit51 and
by a subsequent Refmac5 refinement. Water molecules
were added by Arp/warp.52 The final R crystallographic
factor was 0.19 and Rfree was 0.23. The asymmetric unit
contains two complexes of C19A/C43A LCI–CPA and
two additional C19A/C43A LCI molecules encaged in the
crystal lattice. The unbound inhibitor molecules display
significant flexibility in the loop regions and therefore
their models are not completely built because of the lack
of interpretable electron density. Most of the other
molecules had a clear and interpretable electron density.
However, the loop region between Val132 and Ser136 is
missing from the map in both CPA molecules. There are
also solvent-exposed side-chains with missing density;
these parts were omitted from the final model.
