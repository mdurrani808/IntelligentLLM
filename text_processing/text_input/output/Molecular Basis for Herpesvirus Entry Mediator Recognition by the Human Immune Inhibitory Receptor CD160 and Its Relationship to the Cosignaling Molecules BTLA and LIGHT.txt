T cell regulation
CD160 was recently identified as a T cell coinhibitory molecule that interacts
with the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) on antigen-presenting cells to
deliver a potent inhibitory signal to CD4+ T cells. HVEM also binds to the
coinhibitory receptor BTLA (B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator) and the
costimulatory receptor LIGHT (which is homologous to lymphotoxins,
exhibits inducible expression, and competes with the herpes simplex virus
glycoprotein D for HVEM, a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes, or
TNFSF14), thus regulating the CD160/BTLA/LIGHT/HVEM signaling
pathway. To date, the detailed properties of the formation of these
complexes, especially HVEM binding to the newly identified receptor
CD160, and the relationship of CD160 with BTLA and LIGHT are still
unclear. We performed N-terminal sequencing and a mass spectrometric
analysis, which revealed that the extracellular domain of CD160 exists
primarily in the monomeric form. The surface plasmon resonance analysis
revealed that CD160 binds directly to the cysteine-rich domain 1–3 of
HVEM with a similar affinity to, but slower dissociation rate than, that of
BTLA. Notably, CD160 competed with BTLA for binding to HVEM; in
contrast, LIGHT did not affect HVEM binding to either CD160 or BTLA. The
results of a mutagenesis study of HVEM also suggest that the CD160
binding region on HVEM was slightly different from, but overlapped with,
the BTLA binding site. Interestingly, an anti-CD160 antibody exhibiting
antiangiogenic properties blocked CD160/HVEM binding. These results
provide insight into the molecular architecture of the CD160/BTLA/
LIGHT/HVEM signaling complex that regulates immune function.

T cell activation requires two signals: the T cell
receptor (TCR) recognition of the major histocom￾patibility complex/peptide complex and the
cosignal delivered by the interaction between the
cosignaling molecule and its receptor. 1,2 The
cosignaling molecules function as costimulatory or
coinhibitory molecules because of their functional
effect upon host immune responses. TCR engage￾ment without costimulation leads to suboptimal T
cell activation and unresponsiveness to the antigen
during secondary stimulation, a phenomenon called
T cell anergy.3 Cosignaling molecules control T cell
activation by regulating T cell proliferation, cyto￾kine production, cytotoxicity, T cell apoptosis, and
survival.4,5
CD160 (murine CD160 is named BY55) was
recently identified as a coinhibitory molecule that
binds to one of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
receptor superfamily members, herpesvirus entry
mediator (HVEM) (also called HveA or TNFRSF14),
which is expressed on the surface of a broad range of
immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer
(NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), as well as
endothelial cells. 6 CD160 is a type I membrane
protein with one immunoglobulin (Ig)-V set domain
in its extracellular region, and it is expressed on NK
cells, natural killer T cells, intraepithelial T cells,
γδTCR+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells. 6 Cai
et al. recently demonstrated that the CD160/HVEM
interaction inhibits CD4+ T cell activation. 7 More￾over, several reports have indicated that CD160 has a
significant stimulatory effect on immune responses,
including NK and CD8+ T cell effector functions.8–10
A pathological study revealed that the expression
level of CD160, as well as those of other immuno￾suppressive genes, increased in the lymphatic tissue
of human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected pa￾tients who were in the acute stage of the disease.11
CD160 was also up-regulated in exhausted CD8+ T
cells in a mouse model of a chronic lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus infection.12 These emerging
details suggest that CD160 is one of the key
cosignaling molecules controlling immune re￾sponses. Interestingly, CD160 is mainly glycosylpho￾sphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored; thus, it is likely to
be located in lipid rafts, as suggested by a cell surface
staining study. 7 However, due to the lack of
definitive signaling components, its signaling mech￾anism has not been clarified.
With regard to CD160 ligands, it is not yet fully
understood whether CD160 can bind to major
histocompatibility complex class I molecules [either
a wide range or a specific allele (HLA-Cw3 or HLA￾G1)].7–10 A newly identified interaction between
CD160 and HVEM has been confirmed by cellular￾level function studies and binding studies, which
also have demonstrated that the cysteine-rich do￾main (CRD) 1 of HVEM is essential for CD160
binding. 13 However, the underlying molecular
properties mediating the precise binding of CD160
to HVEM and the relationship between CD160 and
other HVEM receptors are still poorly understood.
Intriguingly, HVEM, the ligand of CD160, acti￾vates both stimulatory and inhibitory pathways and
serves as a molecular switch by engaging at least five
receptors: two costimulatory molecules, two coin￾hibitory molecules, and the herpes simplex virus
(HSV) envelope glycoprotein D (gD). The costimu￾latory HVEM receptors consist of the TNF-related
cytokine LIGHT (which is homologous to lympho￾toxins, exhibits inducible expression, and competes
with HSV gD for HVEM, a receptor expressed by T
lymphocytes, or TNFSF14) and lymphotoxin-α
(LTα). LIGHT is a type II membrane protein, and it
forms a homotrimer on the cell surface in the same
manner as other TNF family members. LIGHT is
expressed on immature DCs, granulocytes, mono￾cytes, and activated T cells.6 LIGHT and HVEM are
predicted to form a 3:3 complex, and their interaction
delivers costimulatory signals that lead to T cell
activation14–18 and enhanced production of pro￾inflammatory cytokines. 15,19–22 The coinhibitory
molecules consist of CD160 and BTLA (the CD28
family member B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator).
BTLA is a type I membrane protein with an
extracellular Ig-V domain, and it is broadly
expressed on hematopoietic cells, including CD8+
T cells, CD4+ T cells, B cells, DCs, macrophages, and
NK cells. BTLA binds to CRD1 of HVEM to form a
1:1 complex.23 BTLA-deficient mice exhibited hy￾persensitivity to TCR stimulation24,25 and persistent
inflammation of the lung in an acute allergic airway
inflammation model. 26 These data suggest that
BTLA plays critical inhibitory roles in suppressing
T cell activation. Alternatively, HVEM−/− mice
exhibit overactivation of the T cell response; 22 thus,
the essential, nonredundant function of HVEM is
inhibitory. These results suggest that the coinhibi￾tory HVEM receptors, CD160 and BTLA, play
important roles in the regulation and maintenance
of T cell immune responses.
Cai et al. demonstrated by confocal microscopy that
GPI-anchored CD160 is present in discrete patches of
the plasma membrane and does not colocalize with
BTLA. 7 Furthermore, CD3 does colocalize with
CD160, suggesting that CD160 is likely translocated
into lipid rafts along with immune signaling com￾plexes including TCR/CD3. These results introduced
the possibility that CD160 may have discrete (and/or
complementary) roles in the regulation of T cell
function relative to those of BTLA. From another
attractive viewpoint, the CD160/HVEM and BTLA/
HVEM interactions are so far the only examples of
signaling complexes between members of the Ig and
tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamilies of
immune cell surface receptors.
Molecular Basis for CD160-HVEM Recognition 763A recent study of HVEM binding to HSV gD, as
well as to other HVEM receptors, showed that gD
can block the binding of HVEM to BTLA but not to
LTα and LIGHT.13 Furthermore, BTLA did not
interfere with HVEM binding to LTα and LIGHT. 13
With regard to CD160, the competition study for the
HVEM binding of CD160 and BTLA was performed
at the cellular level, but this did not yield a definitive
result because the inhibition of BTLA/HVEM
binding by excess CD160-Ig protein was not clearly
observed.7 The understanding of CD160-mediated
regulation of the HVEM pathway of T cell function
remains quite limited.
Here, we have elucidated the molecular character￾istics of CD160 and the binding of CD160 to HVEM
using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and compe￾tition binding studies for the other HVEM receptors,
BTLA and LIGHT. First, we show that the extracel￾lular domain of CD160 primarily exists in the
monomeric form, as revealed by comprehensive
techniques, including N-terminal amino acid se￾quence analysis and mass spectrometry. These data
essentially preclude the possibility that CD160 can
exist as a homotrimer, which is in contrast to the
report by Anumanthan et al.
27 We also demonstrate
that the anti-CD160 antibody CL1-R2, which exhib￾ited antiangiogenic activity in several animal models
of neovascularization, 28 blocks CD160 binding to
HVEM. CD160 directly interacts with HVEM with
low affinity, which is consistent with a previous
report. 13 Although this characteristic is similar to
that of BTLA binding to HVEM, CD160 exhibits a
slower dissociation rate than does BTLA, which
might confer stronger signaling. Notably, CD160
competes with BTLA for HVEM binding, and a
series of HVEM mutants that either decreased or
completely lost the ability to bind to BTLA23 also
exhibited reduced CD160 binding, but to a different
extent. Collectively, these results suggest that CD160
has various similar and distinct HVEM binding
properties relative to those of BTLA and that these
proteins can form a 3:3:3 (CD160 or BTLA:LIGHT:
HVEM) full signaling complex. Finally, we discuss
the implications for the function of CD160 in the
immunoregulatory CD160/BTLA/HVEM pathway.
Results and Discussion
CD160 exists in the monomeric form
One group previously reported that CD160
existed as a highly disulfide linked homotrimer;27,29
however, a recent study revealed that baculovirus￾expressed CD160 existed in a monomeric form.13
Thus, to clarify the precise molecular characteristics
of CD160 under physiological conditions, we
expressed the entire extracellular region of CD160
(residues 1–159) in human HEK293S GnTI− cells
and designated it CD160h. The CD160h protein was
purified using Ni-NTA column chromatography
followed by gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. 1a).
A Western blot analysis of the eluted fractions with
an anti-6×His antibody under nonreducing condi￾tions (Fig. 1b) clearly indicated that CD160h
predominantly existed in the monomeric form
(fractions 4–6). The other fractions (1–3) in Fig. 1a,
which might include higher-molecular-weight
forms, contained only a slight amount of the
disulfide-linked CD160h dimer (Fig. 1b), and trimers
or multimers were barely detectable. Matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass an￾alyses of the main fractions also showed only the
monomeric molecular mass of CD160 (Supplemen￾tal Fig. 1). Furthermore, N-terminal amino acid
sequence analyses of this fraction revealed that the
CD160h extracellular region starts with the sequence
27INITS31 (Fig. 1c), which is consistent with the
recently updated prediction by the “SignalP 3.0”
program† (the previous version of this program
calculated 26CINIT30 as the starting sequence). This
analysis suggests that the extracellular domain of
CD160 contains five cysteines after cleavage of the
signal sequence (Fig. 1c, boxed). A homology
alignment demonstrated that CD160 should form
two intramolecular disulfide bonds and have one
free cysteine, which excludes the possibility of the
formation of the previously reported intermolecu￾larly disulfide linked homotrimer.27,29 Furthermore,
we expressed the Ig-V set domain (residues 27–159
or 26–159) of CD160 in Escherichia coli as inclusion
bodies and refolded the proteins in vitro. The gel￾filtration chromatography again showed that CD160
eluted in the monomer fraction (15 kDa) (Supple￾mental Fig. 2). We next determined the number of
free thiol groups in the refolded CD160 using 5,5′-
dithiobis 2-nitrobenzoate, and one non-paired thiol
group was detected (Supplemental Fig. 3). Collec￾tively, these results indicate that the extracellular
domain of CD160 exists mainly in the monomeric
form, consistent with the recent study using the
baculovirus-expressed CD160 protein.13
Binding affinity of CD160 toward HVEM
To analyze the binding properties of CD160 and
HVEM, we performed affinity measurements using
SPR. The extracellular domain of CD160 (I27–S159,
15 kDa) and the CRD1–3 (L1–Y103, 11 kDa) of
HVEM with a biotin tag were expressed in E. coli
and purified as described in Materials and Methods.
Although HVEM has at least eight disulfide bonds
in its extracellular region, it was successfully
refolded from inclusion bodies expressed in E. coli.

equilibrium binding responses of the extracellular Ig-V

purified, recombinant, C-terminally biotin-tagged HVEM
was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, and different
concentrations of purified CD160 were injected on the
chip. (b) Kinetic analysis of CD160 binding to HVEM. Low
concentrations of purified CD160 (80, 40, 20, 10, 5, or
2.5 nM) were injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min on the
same sensor chip used in (a) (continuous lines). The rate
equations derived from the 1:1 binding model were fitted
to the association and dissociation phases of all injections
(dotted lines). (c) Kinetic analysis of BTLA binding to
HVEM. Low concentrations of purified BTLA (40, 20, 10,
5, 2.5 nM) were injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min on the
same sensor chip used in (a) (continuous lines). Rate
equations derived from the 1:1 binding model were fitted
to the association and dissociation phases of all injections
(dotted lines).
Molecular Basis for CD160-HVEM Recognition 765The extracellular domain of CD160 was injected
over sensor surfaces bearing biotinylated HVEM or
biotinylated bovine serum albumin (negative con￾trol). The affinity of CD160 to HVEM was measured
by an equilibrium binding analysis. A range of
CD160 concentrations was injected through the
flow cells containing the immobilized HVEM
(Supplemental Fig. 4a).
The equilibrium binding curve for the binding of
CD160 to HVEM is shown in Fig. 2a. Consistent with
the report by Stiles et al.,13 our results show that
CD160 binds directly to HVEM with a Kd of 0.34 μM
(Table 1), which is within the affinity range typical of
cell surface receptors (Supplemental Table 1). This
result strongly suggests that the monomeric form of
CD160 is the predominant physiological species. We
also performed a kinetic analysis of this interaction.
The binding curves shown in Fig. 2b fit well to a 1:1
Langmuir binding model. Although the Kd of the
CD160/HVEM binding is comparable with that of
the BTLA/HVEM binding, the CD160 binding
displayed 2-fold slower kinetics than did BTLA
(Table 1 and Fig. 2c and Supplemental Table 1).
CD160 may have a more inhibitory signaling
function than BTLA because CD160 has a slower
dissociation constant (Supplemental Table 1).
The effect of HVEM on the binding of CD160 to
the antiangiogenic anti-CD160 antibody CL1-R2
CL1-R2, a commercially available Medical &
Biological Laboratories CO., LTD. anti-CD160 anti￾body, has been used in many studies; however, its
binding characteristics toward CD160 are unknown.
Therefore, we performed an SPR binding study
between CD160 and the anti-CD160 antibody CL1-
R2. The antibody was immobilized on a CM5 sensor
chip by direct amine coupling. CD160 was injected
over the sensor chip and exhibited strong binding to
the anti-CD160 antibody (Fig. 3). We next injected
HVEM over the same chip to examine the effect of
HVEM on the binding of CD160 to the anti-CD160
antibody (Fig. 3). The response did not change
during the HVEM injection, indicating that the anti￾CD160 antibody CL1-R2 blocks CD160 binding to
HVEM.
CD160 competes with BTLA for binding to HVEM
BTLA is another coinhibitory molecule that in￾teracts with HVEM. Although a cellular-based
binding study showed that the CRD1 of HVEM
was essential for both CD160 and BTLA binding and
suggested that their binding sites potentially
overlap,7 it was not clear from the results of this
study whether their binding sites actually over￾lapped or whether the molecules interfered with
each other when binding to HVEM. Therefore, we
performed a competition assay of CD160 and BTLA
binding to HVEM using SPR.
We first expressed the extracellular domain of
BTLA (residues S33–D135, 12 kDa) in E. coli as
inclusion bodies, refolded the protein in vitro
(Supplemental Fig. 5), and performed an analysis
of the binding of BTLA to HVEM (Supplemental Fig.
4b). BTLA alone binds to HVEM with a Kd of 0.29 μM
(Fig. 4a and Table 1), which is similar to the affinities
of the murine BTLAs (0.42 and 0.97 μM) obtained by
an SPR analysis.31 We next examined the binding
response when increasing concentrations of BTLA
were injected over the HVEM with (squares) or
without (triangles) an almost saturating concentra￾tion (1.5 μM) of CD160 (Fig. 4b). The difference
between the responses in the presence or absence of
CD160 (crosses) decreased as the concentration of
BTLA increased, indicating that the binding was not
additive and that BTLA showed typical competitive
inhibition with CD160 for binding to HVEM.32 These

766 Molecular Basis for CD160-HVEM Recognitionresults suggest that the CD160 and BTLA binding
sites on HVEM overlap or are close enough to each
other that the binding of one molecule to HVEM
blocks the binding of the other molecule.
To investigate the detailed features of the in￾teractions of CD160 and BTLA with HVEM, we
prepared two different-length HVEMs with biotin
tags, (1) L1–H162: CRD1–4 and (2) L1–Y103:
CRD1–3, using HEK293S GnTI− cells. The HVEMs
were enzymatically biotinylated and immobilized
on a streptavidin-coupled CM5 chip for the SPR
analysis. Next, we tested whether recombinant

Molecular Basis for CD160-HVEM Recognition 767their receptor binding. CD160 and BTLA exhibited
almost the same affinities toward HVEM (L1–Y103)
expressed in HEK293S GnTI− cells, indicating that
the sugar modifications on HVEM do not contribute
to the binding (Table 2). We used HVEM expressed
in HEK293S GnTI− cells, designated as HVEMh, for
the following assays.
To investigate the details of the CD160 binding site
on HVEM, we prepared a longer version of HVEMh
(L1–H162). It exhibited a slightly lower but still
similar binding affinity to the receptors, indicating
that the CRD4 of HVEM does not play a significant
role in CD160 and BTLA binding (Table 2). We then
produced a series of HVEMh mutants (P17A, Y23A,
V36A) because the mutated sites in CRD1 are known
to be crucial for BTLA affinity, as identified by
mutagenesis 23 (Fig. 4c–e). A previous cellular-level
binding report showed that the Y23A mutation
reduced CD160 binding. 33 We performed affinity
measurements of CD160 and BTLA to these HVEMh
mutants (Fig. 4c and d). Although the P17A and
V36A HVEMh mutants displayed 6-fold and 60- to
70-fold decreases in affinity for both CD160 and
BTLA, respectively, the Y23A mutation resulted in a
20-fold reduction in the affinity for BTLA and
completely abolished the affinity for CD160 even at
concentrations exceeding 30 μM (Fig. 4c and Table 2).
These results indicate that the Y23 residue of HVEM
is more critical for CD160 binding than for BTLA
binding; in contrast, the other mutations (P17A and
V36A) have effects on the binding of HVEM similar
to those of both CD160 and BTLA. Interestingly,
the Y23A mutation of HVEMh also abolished
the binding of HVEMh to HSV gD, 13 similar to the
results for CD160. The crystal structures of the
gD/HVEM30 and BTLA/HVEM23 complexes
demonstrate that Y23 of HVEM penetrates deeply
into HSV gD but that this residue simply attaches
to the peripheral surface of BTLA (Fig. 4e). These
results suggest that the CD160/HVEM binding
mode is similar to that of gD, but it is somewhat
distinct from that of BTLA.
LIGHT does not affect the binding of CD160 and
BTLA to HVEM
Like other TNF-related ligands, LIGHT forms a
homotrimer and potentially interacts with three
HVEM molecules. In accordance with previous
reports,13 LIGHT binding to immobilized HVEMh
exhibits an extremely high affinity with an avidity
effect, quite unlike the binding to CD160 and BTLA
(Fig. 5a).
We next examined the effect of LIGHT on the
HVEMh binding of CD160 and BTLA (Fig. 5b). The
binding responses observed for CD160 and BTLA to
HVEMh were the same before and after the HVEM
was saturated with LIGHT (Fig. 5b). Furthermore,

LIGHT, indicating that the LIGHT binding site on
HVEM does not overlap with either the CD160 or
BTLA binding site, consistent with the previous
cellular-based studies. 23,34
Functional implications
A previous study showed that CD160 and BTLA
do not colocalize on the same cell surface,7 suggest￾ing that these two coinhibitory molecules function in
different compartments and do not associate before
their interactions with HVEM. GPI-anchored CD160
probably exists in the lipid raft where the main
signaling complexes, including the TCR/CD3 com￾plexes, are normally localized and, thus, may have a
more direct inhibitory effect on TCR/CD3 signaling.
A transmembrane form of an alternative splice
variant of CD160, possessing a putative phosphor￾ylation site in its cytoplasmic region, was recently
reported.35 Alternatively, because BTLA is widely
dispersed on the cell surface, we propose that CD160
and BTLA exert their inhibitory activities in different
cell surface areas.
The present study has provided clear evidence that
human CD160 is a monomeric receptor. CD160 and
BTLA have similar affinities, but somewhat distinct
kinetic parameters, for binding to HVEM. The
slower dissociation of CD160 from HVEM suggests
that CD160 may have the potential to induce
dominant inhibitory signaling. Our competition
assay showed that CD160 and BTLA cannot bind
to HVEM simultaneously. Moreover, the mutagen￾esis study revealed that HVEM recognition by
CD160 and BTLA seems to be similar, but some
differences exist. Whether the potential dominant
inhibitory function of CD160 is based on the slower
dissociation of HVEM binding relative to that of
BTLA will be addressed in future studies, specifically
an in vivo study using CD160 knockout mice, which
are not currently available. Furthermore, the CD160
expression on T cells and NK cells in the human
immune system is significantly induced upon
activation.6,7 These results strongly suggest that
CD160 has an inhibitory function similar to that of
another coinhibitory molecule, CTLA4, to prevent
overactivation and terminate unnecessary immune
responses. Therefore, the elucidation of the precise
functional characteristics of the CD160/HVEM
binding will be quite important for understanding
its regulation, using either the soluble CD160 protein
or an anti-CD160 antibody, for future medical
treatment of immune disorders, such as autoim￾mune diseases. Notably, a recent report 28 clearly
demonstrated that the administration of the CD160
antibody, CL1-R2, in animal disease models signif￾icantly improved palliation, suggesting that CL1-R2
can be used in the medical treatment of ocular and
tumor neoangiogenesis. HVEM can function not
only as a ligand for its receptors including CD160 but
also as a stimulatory receptor, resulting in a
bidirectional signaling system. HVEM activates
nuclear factor κB to produce pro-inflammatory
signals by binding to its receptors (ligands). Our
present study demonstrates that the CL1-R2 anti￾body competes with HVEM for binding to CD160,
introducing the possibility that HVEM-mediated
cellular activation could be reduced by the CL1-R2
antibody. Further studies to investigate the molecu￾lar mechanism induced by the CL1-R2 antibody will
be quite important for future medical applications.
Materials and Methods
Production of the entire extracellular region of CD160
in HEK293S GnTI− cells and N-terminal amino acid
sequence analysis
The DNA encoding the Ig-V domain (residues C26–
S159) of CD160 was amplified from pGMCD160 (see the
following section) by using 5′-GTA CCG GTT GCA TTA
ACA TCA CCA GCT C-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-
CTG GTA CCT GAG AGA GTG CCT TCA TTA TGG C-3′
as the reverse primer (designated RP1). The resultant
fragments were digested with the restriction enzymes AgeI
and KpnI and were ligated into the pHLsec vector
(designated pHLCD160).36 For the expression of the entire
extracellular region of CD160 (M1–S159), we extended the
N-terminal region of CD160 by PCR using 5′-TGT GCC
CTG GCC ATC CTG CTG GCA ATT GTG GAC ATC CAG
TCT GGT GGA TGC ATT AAC ATC ACC AGC TC-3′ as
the forward primer and RP1 as the reverse primer, with
pHLCD160 as the template. The resultant fragments were
amplified using 5′-CGG AAT TCG CCA CCA TGC TGT
TGG AAC CCG GCA GAG GCT GCT GTG CCC TGG
CCA TC-3′ as the forward primer and RP1 as the reverse
primer and were ligated into the EcoRI/KpnI-digested
pHLsec vector. The final construct included CD160 (M1–
S159) with the original signal sequence and the 6×Histi￾dine-tag in tandem. The plasmid was transiently trans￾fected by adding polyethyleneimine into 90% confluent
HEK293S cells lacking N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I
(GnTI) activity or 293T cells.36,37 The cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (SIGMA) supple￾mented with 10% fatal calf serum (HyClone), L-glutamine,
and nonessential amino acids (GIBCO). During transfec￾tion, the medium was changed to OPTI-MEM (GIBCO).
The supernatant containing the His-tagged CD160 was
collected 4 days after transfection and was purified by Ni￾affinity chromatography and gel filtration with a Superdex
75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). The purified extracel￾lular region of CD160 was then digested with PNGase F
(New England Biolabs) for 8 h and analyzed by N-terminal
amino acid sequencing (Shimadzu Biotech).
Expression and refolding of the CD160 Ig-V domain,
the BTLA Ig-V domain, and LIGHT in E. coli
The DNA encoding the Ig-V domain (residues I27–S159)
of CD160 was amplified from a human peripheral blood
Molecular Basis for CD160-HVEM Recognition 769mononuclear cell cDNA library using 5′-GGA GAT ATA
CAT ATG ATT AAC ATC ACC AGC TCA GC-3′ as the
forward primer and 5′-TAG GCA AGC TTA ACT GAG
AGT GCC TTC ATT ATG GCT G-3′ as the reverse primer.
The resultant fragments were digested with the restriction
enzymes NdeI and HindIII and were ligated into the
pGMT7 vector (1) (designated pGMCD160). E. coli strain
BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) harboring pGMCD160
produced CD160 within inclusion bodies. The inclusion
bodies were isolated from the cell pellet by sonication and
washed repeatedly with a wash solution containing 0.5%
Triton X-100. The purified CD160 inclusion bodies were
solubilized in a denaturant solution containing 6 M
guanidine hydrochloride. The solubilized protein solution
was diluted slowly in refolding buffer [0.1 M Tris–HCl
(pH 8.0), 0.6 M L-arginine, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, 3.73 mM cystamine, and 6.73 mM cysteamine] to a
final protein concentration of 1–2 μM and was stirred for
48 h at 4 °C. The refolded mixture of CD160 was then
concentrated with a VIVA FLOW50 system (Sartorius).
CD160 was purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75
column (GE Healthcare). The DNA encoding the Ig-V set
domain (S33–D135) of BTLA was amplified from the cDNA
(Accession No: BC107092; Open Biosystems) using 5′-GGA
GAT ATA CAT ATG TCA TGT GAT GTA CAG CTT TAT
ATA AAG AGA-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-G GAA
TTC TCA ATC TGT CAC ATA AAG AGT TGT TGA GTG￾3′ as the reverse primer. The resultant fragments were
ligated into the pGMT7 vector. Inclusion bodies containing
BTLA were obtained and purified according to the method
described above. The DNA encoding the extracellular
region of LIGHT (N93–V240) was amplified from the
cDNA (Accession No: BC018058; Open Biosystems) using
5′-GGA GAT ATA CAT ATG AAC CCA GCA GCG CAT
CTC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-CCC AAG CTT TCA
CAC CAT GAA AGC CCC C-3′ as the reverse primer. The
resultant fragments were ligated into the pGMT7 vector,
and three mutations derived from the cDNA were corrected
by the QuikChange method. Inclusion bodies containing
LIGHT were obtained and purified according to the method
described above.
Expression, refolding, and biotinylation of HVEM
(L1–Y103) in E. coli
The DNA encoding the CRD1–3 (L1–Y103) of HVEM
was amplified from spleen cDNA (PCR-Ready cDNA
Human Spleen, PC40016; Maxim Biotech, Inc.) using 5′-
GGA GAT ATA CAT ATG CTG CCG TCC TGC AAG
GAG G-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-CGC GGA TCC
GTA AGC GCG GCA CGC G-3′ as the reverse primer. The
resultant fragments were digested with the restriction
enzymes NdeI and BamHI and were ligated into the
pGMT7 vector (designated pGMHVEM). The construct
consisted of HVEM (L1–Y103) and the biotin tag in
tandem. The pGMHVEM vector was transformed into
BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, and inclusion bodies containing
HVEM (L1–Y103) with the biotin tag were obtained and
purified by the method described above. The purified
HVEM (L1–Y103) was biotinylated with Biotin Protein
Ligase (BirA; Avidity) and subjected to gel filtration in
HBS-EP buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl,
3 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 0.005% Sur￾factant P20] for the SPR analysis.
Production and biotinylation of HVEMs in HEK293S
GnTI− cells
The DNA encoding the CRD1–3 (L1–Y103) of HVEM
was amplified from pGMHVEM using 5′-GT ACC GGT
CTG CCG TCC TGC AAG GAG G-3′ as the forward
primer (designated FP1) and 5′-CCG CTC GAG TCA TTA
ACG ATG ATT CCA CAC CAT TTT CTG-3′ as the reverse
primer. We also amplified CRD1–4 (L1–H162) of HVEM
from spleen cDNA using FP1 as the forward primer and 5′-
CCG CTC GAG TTA ACG ATG ATT CCA CAC CAT TTT
CTG TGC ATC CAG AAT ATG ATG CAG GGT ACC GTG
GGA GCT GCT GGT CCC-3′ as the reverse primer. The
resultant fragments were ligated into the pHLsec vector
using the AgeI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites.36 The
final constructs consisted of the signal sequence (β-actin),
HVEM (CRD1–3) or HVEM (CRD1–4), and the biotin tag in
tandem. The plasmids were transiently transfected into
HEK293S GnTI− cells, and the supernatants containing the
biotin-tagged HVEMs were biotinylated with Biotin
Protein Ligase. The biotinylated HVEM was then dialyzed
in HBS-EP buffer and used for the SPR analysis.
SPR analysis
SPR experiments were performed with a BIAcore3000
instrument (GE Healthcare). The biotinylated form of
either HVEM or bovine serum albumin (negative control)
was immobilized on a research-grade CM5 chip (GE
Healthcare), onto which streptavidin was covalently
coupled. After exchanging the buffer to HBS-EP, we
injected the HVEM receptors (CD160, BTLA, and LIGHT)
over the immobilized HVEM. The binding response at
each concentration was calculated by subtracting the
equilibrium response measured in the control flow cell
from that in the HVEM flow cell. Kinetic constants were
determined using the curve-fitting facility of the BIAEVA￾LUATION 4.0 program (GE Healthcare) to fit the rate
equations derived from the simple 1:1 Langmuir binding
model (A+B↔AB). Additional curve fitting was per￾formed with the ORIGIN 7 program (Microcal Software,
Northampton, MA). Affinity constants (Kd) were derived
by fits to a single-site saturation model of the nonlinear
curve fitting of the standard Langmuir binding isotherm.
In the competitive binding experiment, BTLA preparations
with or without CD160 (1.5 μM), which was almost
saturated, were passed over the immobilized HVEM. For
the binding assay of CD160 toward the anti-CD160
antibody, CL1-R2 (MBL), the anti-CD160 antibody or the
anti-CD161 antibody (negative control) was immobilized
directly on a CM5 chip by amine coupling. CD160 and
HVEM were injected over the immobilized anti-CD160
antibody.
