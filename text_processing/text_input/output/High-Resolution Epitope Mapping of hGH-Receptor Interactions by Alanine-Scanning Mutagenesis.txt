High-Resolution Epitope Mapping of hGH-Receptor
Interactions by Alanine-Scanning Mutagenesis
BRiAN C. CUNNINGHAM AND JAMES A. WELLS*
A strategy, called alanine-scanning mutagenesis, was used to identify specific side
chains in human growth hormone (hGH) that strongly modulate binding to the hGH
receptor cloned from human liver. Single alanine mutations (62 in total) were
introduced at every residue contained within the three discontinuous segments of
hGH (residues 2 to 19, 54 to 74, and 167 to 191) that have been implicated in receptor
recognition. The alanine scan revealed a cluster of a dozen large side chains that when
mutated to alanine each showed more than a four times lower binding affinity to the
hGH receptor. Many of these residues that promote binding to the hGH receptor are
altered in homologs of hGH (such as placental lactogens and prolactins) that do not
bind tightly to the hGH receptor. The overali folding of these mutant proteins was
indistinguishable from that of the wild-type hGH, as determined by strong cross￾reactivities with seven different conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies. The
alanine scan also identified at least one side chain, Glu"74, that hindered binding
because when it was mutated to alanine the receptor affinity increased by more than a
factor of four.
SYSTEMATIC REPLACEMENT OF SEG￾ments (7 to 30 residues in length) of
human growth hormone (hGH) with
sequences derived from nonbinding growth
hormone homologs (homolog-scanning
mutagenesis) defined a binding patch on a
structural model of hGH that included the
NH2-terminal portion of helix 1, a loop
between residues 54 and 74 and the
COOH-terminal portion ofhelix 4 (1). This
analysis provided a general outline of the
receptor binding site, but did not identify
the specific residues involved in receptor
binding. Here, side chains that are impor￾tant for modulating binding are located by
sequential replacement of residues encom￾passed in the binding patch with alanine.
Alanine was chosen as the replacement resi￾due because it eliminates the side chain
beyond the , carbon yet does not alter the
main-chain conformation (as can glycine or
proline) nor does it impose extreme electro￾static or steric effects. Furthermore, alanine
is the most abundant amino acid and is
found frequently in both buried and ex￾posed positions and all variety of secondary
structures (2). Alanine-scanning mutagene￾sis generates a small and systematic set of
mutant proteins that can be readily assayed

mutants by a genetic screen or selection.
A total of 62 single alanine mutants were
produced (Table 1) by restriction-selection

a synthetic hGH gene template (1). The

ed form from Escherichia coli (4), and their
binding constants were determined for the
extracellular portion ofthe cloned hGH liver
receptor by Scatchard analysis (1, 5). This
receptor fragment is highly soluble and re￾tains high affinity and specificity for hGH
(5). The use of the purified truncated recep￾tor in binding assays avoided artifacts associ￾ated with binding to receptors on mem￾branes or whole cells.
Overall, the results of the alanine scan
(Fig. 1) are consistent with those from the
homolog scan (1) in showing that the mid￾dle and COOH-terminal segments are more
important in binding than the NH2-termi￾nal segment. The largest reductions in bind￾ing (-20 times lower) occurred for specific
alanine substitutions within the 54 to 74
loop and the COOH-terminal sequence 167
to 191. We extended the alanine scan to
include residues 2 to 19 because of uncer￾tainties in the positions of the NH2-terminal
residues in the porcine GH (pGH) structure
(6). In this segment, alanine substitutions
caused more modest reductions in binding;
the largest reduction (-6 times lower) was for
F1OA. For one mutant (E174A) that is locat￾ed near a number of disruptive alanine muta￾tions (Fig. 1), the affinity for the receptor was
actually increased (4.5 times higher).
The most disruptive alanine substitutions
form a patch that extends from F10 to R64
and from D171 to V185 (Fig. 2). These
side chains appear to be facing in the same
direction in the model of hGH. For exam￾ple, all of the alanine mutants tested in helix
4 that most affect binding (D171A, K172A,
E174A, F176A, 1179A, C182A, and
R183A) are confined to three and one-half

2). From this model, it would appear that
T175 is involved in binding because it occu￾pies a central position. Although the T175A
mutant could not be expressed in high
enough yields from cultures grown in shake
flasks to be assayed, a more conservative
mutant (T175S) could be. Indeed, the
T175S mutant caused a 16-fold reduction in
affinity for the hGH receptor (Fig. 1). Simi￾larly, although R178A was poorly ex￾pressed, a more conservative mutant
(R178N) could be expressed and exhibited
an eightfold reduction in receptor binding
affinity. The next most disruptive mutant in
the COOH-terminus was V185A. Although
V185A is outside of helix 4, it is predicted
by the model to face in the same direction as
the disruptive mutations within helix 4. By
comparison, alanine mutations tested out￾side the binding patch (R167A, K168A,
E186A, S188A, and F191A), or within it
but facing in the opposite direction from
those above (V180A, Q181A, and S184A)
generally had little or no effect on receptor
binding.
A similar interpretation can be made for
alanine mutants in helix 1, although the
reductions in binding affinity are more mod￾erate. Within the helix, the alanine substitu￾tions that most disrupt binding are at resi￾dues 6, 10, and 14, which are located on the
same face of the helix. The least disruptive
alanine mutations (L9A, N12A, and LI5A)
are located on the opposite face of helix 1.
This is further confirmed by the fact that
monoclonal antibodies (Mab's) 3 and 4,
which do not compete with the receptor for
binding to hGH (1), are strongly disrupted
by the N12A mutation (Table 2).
The relative positions of side chains with￾in the 54 to 74 loop cannot be fixed from
Table 1. Dissociation constants measured for alanine substitutions of residues 2 to 19 in hGH. Site￾specific mutagenesis was carried out on a single-stranded template (pB0475) that had unique restriction
sites distributed uniformly about every 15 codons throughout a synthetic hGH gene (1). Synthetic
oligonucleotides (generally 20 to 40 bases long) that coded for the desired alanine (or other)
substitution and altered the closest singly occurring restriction site, were used to prime heteroduplex
synthesis (3). Mutations between codons 2 to 12, 13 to 19, 54 to 60, 61 to 69, or 70 to 74 were
generated by primers that hybridized over and altered the restriction sites Sal I, Apa I, Cia I, Nru I, or
Sac I starting at codons 7, 16, 56, 65, or 74, respectively. For mutations between codons 167 to 191,
we first introduced a Kpn I site at codon 179 that was subsequently altered by restriction selection (3).
Heteroduplexes were transformed into E. coli BMH 71-18 mutL (23) and the mixture was grown in LB
broth (Luria broth) plus ampicillin (50 ,ug/ml). The mutant sequence was enriched from a mini-lysate
of DNA (24) by restriction with the enzyme

in which the restriction site was altered by the
oligonucleotide (3). Residual undigested DNA
was transformed directly into E. coli JM11, and
the correct mutants were identified by dideoxy
sequencing (25). The combined mutagenesis effi￾ciency for recovery of the 64 correct mutants
(from -150 total clones analyzed was about
60%). Mutant and wild-type GH were secreted
from E. coli W3110 grown in 20 ml of minimal
media containing low phosphate for 24 hours at
37°C in 250-mi shake flasks; periplasmic extracts
were prepared by osmotic shock (4). The growth
hormones were purified uniformly to about 60%
homogeneity after an (NH4)2SO4 precipitation
(final concentration equal to 45% saturation) and
their concentrations were determined to precision
of SD ± 5% by densitometric scanning of Coo￾massie-stained SDS gels (1). Control experiments
showed that the contaminating proteins from E.
coli extracts had no effect on binding of wild-type
hGH to the hGH receptor. The dissociation
constant for the soluble portion ofthe cloned liver
hGH receptor was determined by competitive
displacement of 1251I-labeled hGH and Scatchard
analysis (5). The standard deviations for Kd were
at or generally below ±25% of the values report￾ed. Mutants are abbreviated by the wild-type
residue (single letter amino acid designation)

the model as they can be for those within
helices 1 and 4. However, there is a striking
periodicity in the binding data in which
mutations of even numbered residues cause
large reductions in binding relative to odd
numbered residues. This is especially true
for the first part of this region (54 to 59)
and may reflect a structure in which even
numbered residues project toward the re￾ceptor and odd ones away.
Although it is possible that some or all of
the alanine mutations that disrupt the recep￾tor binding do so by causing the molecule to
be globally misfolded, it is unlikely for the
following reasons. (i) Eight different Mab's
to hGH (anti-hGH) whose epitopes are
distinct from each other (1) and seven of
which (Mab's 2 to 8) are sensitive to the
folded structure of hGH (7, 8) bind as
tightly with almost all of the alanine mutants
that disrupt binding to the receptor as they
do with hGH (Table 2). The exceptions are
R64A and C182A, which selectively disrupt
binding to the Mab's 6 and 5, respectively.
It is likely that these mutations disrupt
binding determinants in common between
the receptor and Mab's 5 and 6 because
these Mab's compete with the receptor for
binding to hGH (1). As additional controls,
two alanine mutants are shown that do not
affect receptor binding; one of these
(N12A) affects the binding of two Mab's
and the other (K168A) affects none of the
Mab's. Together these data suggest that
binding to either the Mab's or receptor is
disrupted by a very local perturbation in the
mutant structure, the most obvious being
the side chain replacement. (ii) The far
ultraviolet circular dichroic spectra for seven
of these mutants that have been analyzed so
far are virtually identical to that of wild-type
hGH (9). These observations are consistent
with crystallographic data showing that sin￾gle amino acid substitutions in proteins
generally cause only small and local structur￾al perturbations apart from the altered side
chain (10). We cannot exclude the possibili￾ty that small perturbations in structure,
which are propagated beyond the side chain
substitution (11), may affect receptor bind￾ing (12). Thus, the alanine scan identifies
side chains in hGH that can most affect
binding; such residues are likely but not
necessarily in direct contact with the recep￾tor.
About 20% of the alanine mutants
(DIlA, T60A, P61A, T67A, N72A, E74A,
D169A, M170A, V173A, T175A, L177A,
R178A, C189A, and G19OA) were not
secreted at high enough concentrations in
shake flask cultures to be isolated and ana￾lyzed (Table 1). Each mutant gene was
expressed in the same vector and expression
was independent of the specific alanine co￾IO82 SCIENCE, VOL. 244don. We therefore believe variations in
steady-state expression reflect differences in
the amounts of mutant protein secreted or
proteolytic degradation (or both) of the
secreted mutant protein. Mutations in bur￾ied positions are often destabilizing (13) and
can lead to proteolysis in vivo (14). Indeed,
several of the nonexpressing alanine mutants
in helix 4 are located on its hydrophobic face
(M170A, V173A, and L177A) (Fig. 2). It
is likely that mutation of these residues
contributed to the instability of an hGH￾pGH hybrid that contained residues 1 to
163 of hGH followed by 164 to 191 of
pGH (1). However, this is not a general
effect because several alanine substitutions
were tolerated on the hydrophobic face of
helix 1 (L6A, L9A, and FIOA) and helix 4
(F176A and V180A). In addition to muta￾tions in hydrophobic residues, sometimes
replacing charged or neutral side chains with
alanine-impaired expression (DI IA, T60A,
T67A, N72A, E74A, D169A, T175, and
R178A). Disruption of the disulfide loop by
C182A or C189A mutations leads to very
low expression. Several nonexpressing ala￾nine mutants (T60A, P61A, and T67A)
were also located in a loop structure contain￾ing residues 60 to 67. Thus, although the
phenotype of low or nonexpression is char￾acteristic of the mutant protein, this can
result from a multitude of structural effects.
A more complete interpretation of these
results must await a high-resolution struc￾ture of hGH and detailed analysis of the rate
of secretion and degradation of these mole￾cules in vivo. Moreover, because we have
not tested these poorly expressed alanine
mutants we do not know whether these
wild-type residues are also important for
receptor binding.
In two cases tried (T175S and R178N),
more conservative substitutions that pre￾served the hydrogen bonding functional
group could be expressed at concentrations
near wild type. In another case (C182A), it
was possible to purify small amounts of the
poorly expressed protein from a high cell
density fermentor. Neither of these ap￾proaches are very practical for overcoming
the problems with poor expression for anal￾ysis of large numbers of mutant proteins.
However, these alternatives can be applied
to a limited extent.
Human growth hormone is a member of
a family of hormones that includes the
growth hormones (GH), placental lactogens
(PL), and the prolactins (PRL) (15). Unlike
most of its homologs, hGH is capable of
binding to somatogenic and lactogenic re￾ceptors from a wide range of species. From
the alanine-scanning mutagenesis experi￾ments, it is now possible to identify some of
the sequence changes that impair binding of
2 JUNE 1989
hPL, pGH, and hPRL to the soluble hGH
receptor (Fig. 3). For hPL, the only differ￾ences from hGH among residues where
alanine mutations cause more than a four￾fold reduction in binding are E56D and
R64M. Indeed, when these two hPL resi￾dues were introduced into hGH they caused
a 30-fold reduction in binding to the hGH
receptor (1). The combination of these mu￾tations plus I4V and I179M (Table 1) can
account (16) for greater than a 100-fold
reduction in binding for hPL to the somato￾genic receptor (17). Larger sequence
changes occur throughout the three discon￾tinous segments encompassing the binding
site for pGH and hPRL (Fig. 3). Of the 13
major sites that alanine replacements cause
disruption in binding, 3 are changed in
pGH and 9 are changed in hPRL. The
combination of these changes can account
for a large portion of the reduction in
binding for pGH and hPRL to the hGH
receptor.
Analysis of sequence divergence among
the GH-PRL family has been largely incon￾clusive in identifying the somatogenic recep￾tor binding site (15). The basis for this
becomes more clear with information
gained from the mutagenesis experiments
about the receptor binding site. First, the
overall sequence identity for hPL, pGH, and
hPRL compared to hGH (85, 68, and 23%,
respectively) is essentially the same as the
identity within the three discontinuous
binding regions (84, 58, and 30%, respec￾tively) (Fig. 3) or within the set of 13
residues where mutations are most disrup￾tive to binding (85, 77 and 31%, respective￾ly). In general, functional differences among
these molecules is modulated by sequence
differences spread throughout the three dis￾continuous regions of the binding site.
Thus, natural variation within the binding
site is no more or less than it is over the
entire molecule. Although sequence diver￾gence is a good predictor of the variant
binding site regions in such rapidly evolving
molecules as protease inhibitors (18), it is a
poor predictor for identifying sequences re￾sponsible for functional differences among
the growth hormone family.
Alanine-scanning mutagenesis is a more
thorough probe of the receptor binding site
than is homolog-scanning mutagenesis (1).
The latter approach entails anlaysis of multi￾ply mutated proteins, whereas by single
substitutions the alanine scan reveals which
of these are most crucial in binding (Fig. 2).
Moreover the alanine scan identifies impor￾tant side chains that were missed by the
homolog scan such as F10, Q68, and K172.
The homolog scan usually introduces con￾servative side chain substitutions and so may
not truly test energetic importance as the
alanine scan does. For example, converting
Arg 64 to Lys (as in pGH and hPRL) does
not reduce binding to the receptor, yet

greater than a fourfold weakening (U) or strengthening (A) of the binding
affinity of the hormone to its receptor (from Fig. 1). The assignment of residues
within each helix was determined by interpolating between the helical boundaries (6), and those
residues within the loops from the positions of the kinks in the pGH model relative to the disulfides
(C53 to C165 and C182 to C189). Helical wheels for helices 1 and 4 are viewed from their
corresponding NH2-terminus (26) and include only those helical residues that were mutated (6 to 19
and 165 to 183). These helices are strongly amphipathic (1), as shown by the distribution of charged
(filled symbols), neutral (shaded symbols), and hydrophobic residues (open symbols). The most
hydrophobic side of each helix (nonshaded) is oriented on the model to be facing toward the interior of
the protein, which fixes the position of helical residues that most affect receptor binding to be facing
outward.

conversion of Arge" to Met (as in hPL)
reduces binding to the extent of the R64A
mutation (8). This probably accounts for
why the reductions in binding affinity pro￾duced by homolog scanning were generally
much less than the product of the reductions
in binding from component alanine substi￾tutions at the same sites (16). For instance,
in the mutant pGH (57 to 73) there are ten
substitutions but only a 17-fold reduction in
binding (1). The product of reductions for
alanine substitutions at eight of these sites is
273-fold (two of the alanine substitutions
were not analyzed because of low expres￾sion); most of this discrepancy (-20 times)
can be accounted for by the lack of reduc￾tion in binding from the R64K substitution
as discussed above.
We view the homolog-scanning and ala￾nine-scanning strategies as complementary
approaches. The former provides a general
location for receptor or antibody epitopes,
whereas the latter gives information about
specific side chains within a given epitope
that are most important for molecular recog￾nition. Both approaches produce a manage￾able set of mutant molecules that can be
analyzed quantitatively. In some instances
the mutants could not be expressed in good
IO84
yield. This problem could sometimes be
overcome by selecting more conservative
substitutions, or culturing in high cell densi￾ty fermentors (1). In addition, when alanine
and glycine side chains are present in the
wild-type protein they cannot be probed by
mutagenesis except with larger or more con￾formationally disruptive substitutions, nor
can main chain contacts be probed except by
potentially disruptive proline substitutions.
However, structural analysis of protein-pro￾tein interactions have shown that antigenic
determinants (19) or subunit-subunit inter￾faces (20) are dominated by side chain con￾tacts. In fact, we find the alanine substitu￾tions that most alter binding affinity are
replacements of large side chains (both
charged and hydrophobic). Finally, disrup￾tion of binding by these alanine mutations
does not prove a residue is making contact,
further structural analysis of the complex is
necessary for that.
Although it is anticipated that all epitopes
in native globular proteins are to some
extent discontinuous (21), they invariably
contain multiple contacts within a short
continuous stretch (<15 residues) of the
polypeptide chain (19). Thus, once a puta￾tive contact region is identified by mutagen￾esis, chemical modification or another meth￾od, the importance of neighboring residues
to binding affinity can be assessed by alanine
scanning. For example, recently it was re￾ported that alkylation of K172 in hGH
substantially reduces binding (22). Our data
show that other nearby residues in helix 4
are indeed crucial in receptor binding. Final￾ly, alanine scanning has identified at least
one side chain in hGH (E174) that naturally
disrupts binding to the hGH receptor.
Thus, it is likely that the binding between
hGH and its somatogenic receptor may be
strengthened by optimizing this and other
residues that modulate binding. Alanine￾scanning mutagenesis is a systematic func￾tional analysis that should be of general use
to identify (and subsequently engineer) the
side chains that most strongly modulate the
interaction between a polypeptide hormone
and its receptor (or in other protein-ligand
complexes).

The NFL gene (NF1) has been recently
mapped to chromosome 17 by linkage anal￾ysis (3), and genetic analysis of 142 families
by an Intemational Consortium has indicat￾ed that NF1 lies on proximal 17q (4). Mark￾ers on both sides of the gene have been
identified that are within 5 centimorgans of
NF1 (5).
In support of this localization, two unre￾lated patients with NFL and apparently bal￾anced translocations involving chromosome
17 [t(1;17) and t(17;22)] have been identi￾fied (6, 7). In each instance, the chromo￾some 17 breakpoint is in band ql1.2, pre￾cisely where NF1 maps by linkage analysis.
Somatic cell hybrids have been constructed
that contain the translocation chromosomes
from these patients (7, 8). Flanking genetic
markers for NFl map on opposite sides of
the translocation breakpoints (7-10), sup￾porting the hypothesis that these transloca￾tions directly disrupt the gene. Other somat￾ic cell hybrids created by microcell-mediated
gene transfer have been used to further
define the location of markers around the
NF1 locus (9, 10). The combination of
linkage and physical mapping has now ruled
out several chromosome 17 genes, including
ERBA1, ERBB2, and NGFR, as candidates
for direct involvement in NF1 (9-11).
Thus NF1 is an appropriate target for
cloning by reverse genetics (12). We have
reported (9) initial results of physical map￾ping of this region by pulsed-field gel elec￾trophoresis (PFGE). Although these results
allowed us to physically connect some of the
closely linked genetic markers, gaps were
present in the map and none of these mark￾ers detected either NFL translocation break￾point. Therefore additional markers were
required to visualize this region in more
detail. The use of linking clones, which are
genomic fragments containing rare restric￾tion sites (13), has advantages in such an
effort: such clones allow convenient con￾struction of a physical map, and often mark
the site of expressed genes. We generated a
phage library of Not I-linking clones from
flow-sorted chromosome 17 material (14)
and localized these clones using a somatic
cell hybrid panel (9). The clones that
mapped to 17ql 1 were tested on PFGE
blots (15) to see whether abnormal frag￾ments were present in DNA from either
NF1 patient with a translocation.
Of 16 linking clones studied, one (called
17LL) identified novel PFGE bands in
DNA from the t(1; 17) NF1 patient. Specifi￾cally, a 0.8-kb Not I-Xho I fragment of
17L1, denoted I7L1A, detected abnormal
fragments with the enzymes Bss HII, Sac II,
and Not I (Fig. 1A) and also with Mlu I. No
abnormality was seen with Sfi I, Eag I, or
Xho I (16).
A potential pitfall in this analysis can arise
from variability in cutting of rare restriction
sites. This can occur as a result of actual
sequence polymorphism (17) or, more com￾monly, as a result of DNA methylation
differences (15). Strong evidence that such
effects cannot account for the data shown
here include: (i) No novel PFGE fragments
have been seen with 17L1A in Not I analysis
of more than 60 normal chromosomes in
several different tissues. (ii) These fragments
cannot be accounted for by the effects of
incomplete digestion; for example, the in￾tentional partial Not I digest in Fig. 1A
demonstrates that the t(1;17)-specific band
at 550 kb (lane 9) is distinct from the 460-
and 680-kb partial fragments in normal
individuals (lanes 10 and 11). (iii) The
t(l;l7) DNA, which also includes a normal
chromosome 17, always shows a normal
band as well as the abnormal band, in
approximately a 1:1 ratio. (iv) The abnor￾REPORTS io85

The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1), one of the most common
autosomal-dominant disorders ofhumans, was recently mapped to chromosome 17 by
linkage analysis. The identification of two NF1 patients with balanced translocations
that involved chromosome 17qI1.2 suggests that the disease can arise by gross
rearrangement ofthe NFI locus, and that the NF1 gene might be identified by cloning
the region around these translocation breakpoints. To further define the region of
these translocations, a series ofchromosome 17 Not I-linking clones has been mapped
to proximal 17q and studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. One clone, 17L1
(D17S133), clearly identifies the breakpoint in an NF1 patient with a t(l;17)
translocation. A 2.3-megabase pulsed-field map of this region was constructed and
indicates that the NF1 breakpoint is only 10 to 240 kilobases away from 17L1. This
finding prepares the way for the cloning of NFI.
