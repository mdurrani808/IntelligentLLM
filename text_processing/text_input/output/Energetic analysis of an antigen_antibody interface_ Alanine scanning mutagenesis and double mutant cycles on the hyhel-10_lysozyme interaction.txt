Abstract
Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the HyHEL-10 paratope of the HyHEL-100HEWL complex demonstrates that
the energetically important side chains ~hot spots! of both partners are in contact. A plot of DDGHyHEL-10_mutant vs.
DDGHEWL_mutant for the five of six interacting side-chain hydrogen bonds is linear ~Slope 5 1!. Only 3 of the 13 residues
in the HEWL epitope contribute .4 kcal0mol to the free energy of formation of the complex when replaced by alanine,
but 6 of the 12 HyHEL-10 paratope amino acids do. Double mutant cycle analysis of the single crystallographically
identified salt bridge, D32H0K97, shows that there is a significant energetic penalty when either partner is replaced with
a neutral side-chain amino acid, but the D32HN0K97M complex is as stable as the WT. The role of the disproportion￾ately high number of Tyr residues in the CDR was evaluated by comparing the DDG values of the Tyr r Phe vs. the
corresponding Tyr r Ala mutations. The nonpolar contacts in the light chain contribute only about one-half of the total
DDG observed for the Tyr r Ala mutation, while they are significantly more important in the heavy chain. Replacement
of the N31L0K96 hydrogen bond with a salt bridge, N31DL0K96, destabilizes the complex by 1.4 kcal0mol. The free
energy of interaction, DDGint, obtained from double mutant cycle analysis showed that DDGint for any complex for which
the HEWL residue probed is a major immunodeterminant is very close to the loss of free energy observed for the
HyHEL-10 single mutant. Error propagation analysis of double mutant cycles shows that data of atypically high
precision are required to use this method meaningfully, except where large DDG values are analyzed.

Crystallographically defined two-protein complexes are especially
useful as starting points to evaluate the quantitative details of
protein–protein interaction. Several specific additional advantages
are provided by antibody0protein antigen complexes because the
vast antibody recognition repertoire is isolated to the small CDR
region while the remainder of the antibody is largely invariant. The
interfaces of antibody0protein antigen complexes are characterized
by 650–1,000 Å2 of buried surface area, 12–20 contact residues
from each partner, 8–13 hydrogen bonds, and an occasional salt
bridge ~Janin & Chothia, 1990!. These complexes also show an
intermediate degree of shape complementarity at the interface ~that
is less than that of protease–protease inhibitor complexes, but greater
than that of a T cell receptor with a major histocompatibility com￾plex complex ~Ysern et al., 1998!!. The complex formed from
hen egg-white lysozyme ~HEWL! and the monoclonal antibody
HyHEL-10 has been extensively studied in this ~Kam-Morgan
et al., 1993; Rajpal et al., 1998; Taylor et al., 1998! and other
laboratories ~i.e., Smith-Gill et al., 1984; Padlan et al., 1989; Xavier
& Willson, 1998!.
Fourteen hydrogen bonds, 111 van der Waals contacts, and one
salt bridge have been crystallographically identified in the inter￾face of the complex Fab-100HEWL ~Padlan et al., 1989!. Kam￾Morgan et al. ~1993! showed that replacement of Arg21 with any
of eight other amino acids destabilizes the complex by ;2.2 kcal0

~Rajpal & Kirsch, 1999!. The kinetics of interaction of HyHEL-10
with WT and mutant HEWL proved important in developing an
experimental strategy for delineating protein docking trajectories
~Taylor et al., 1998!.
Previous studies on the contribution of the HyHEL-10 paratope
residues have focused on the mutational analysis of the single salt
bridge ~Tsumoto et al., 1996! and the heavy chain Tyr residues
~Tsumoto et al., 1995! ~see Results and discussion!. Xavier and
Willson ~1998! recently compared the kinetics of HEWL associa￾tion with HyHEL-10 with those of the nonoverlapping monoclonal
antibody HyHEL-5.
Although the HEWL epitope has been extensively probed, the
general energetic topology of the HyHEL-10 paratope needs fur￾ther analysis. The free energy changes in complex formation re￾sulting from paratope mutation that are complementary to those
already available from the epitope would allow double mutant
cycle analysis ~Schreiber & Fersht, 1995!.
We report here the thermodynamic and kinetic results of alanine
scanning mutagenesis of the HyHEL-10 paratope. Tyrosine resi￾dues were additionally replaced with Phe to dissect the effect of the
hydroxyl group from that of the aromatic ring. Single and double
mutant cycle analysis allows the evaluation of the energetic con￾tributions of all of the putative hydrogen bond and salt bridge
interactions. A salt bridge was introduced to replace the N31L0K96
hydrogen bond interaction to test a theoretical prediction that this
combination would increase the stability of the complex by 5.6
kcal0mol ~Pomès et al., 1995!.
Results and discussion
Mutant selection rationale
The complete data set of all determined rate and equilibrium con￾stants, their associated standard errors, and calculated DDG values
are provided in the Appendix.
Eighteen of the CDR residues of HyHEL-10 interact with
HEWL ~Table 1!. The complexes containing alanine mutants of
those amino acids whose side chains interact with HEWL, indi￾cated by underscoring in Table 1, were investigated to explore
individual contributions to overall stability. The tyrosines were
also converted to phenylalanine to isolate the effects of the phe￾nolic hydroxyl groups from the ring interactions. Additionally, the
mutations D32HN, N31L ~D,E!, and W95HF were introduced to
evaluate the D32H0K97 salt bridge, the N31L0K96 hydrogen bond,
and the effect of a more conservative substitution for tryptophan,
respectively.
The paratope residues G30L and N92L were not mutated because
these amino acids make only main-chain contacts in the complex.
A single framework residue, T30H, makes contact with HEWL.
However, the T30HA mutation does not affect the stability of the
complex ~data not shown!.
Alanine mutants: Paratope topology
The changes in DDG values for the stabilities of the HyHEL-100
HEWL complexes effected by alanine and phenylalanine substitu￾tions in the paratope are shown in Figure 1 ~top right!, together
with the corresponding effects for alanine replacements in the
epitope ~Fig. 1, bottom right!. The color coding is defined in the
legend.
As a rule, the antibody hot, warm, and null spot residues interact
with the correspondingly important HEWL amino acids. D32H and
Y50H are, respectively, warm and hot spot exceptions that are
discussed below. Previous investigations of protein–protein inter￾action report similar correspondence of the importance of com￾plementary residues ~Clackson & Wells, 1995; Goldman et al.,
1997!. Such complementarity should be expected; i.e., if residue X
makes a strong interaction only with Y as signaled by the large
DDG associated with an X r Ala substitution, then that specific
relationship would be sharply reduced or eliminated by alteration
of either partner. The lack of such correspondence is in fact an
indication of additional interaction affecting at least one of the
partners ~see below!.
It is notable that 6 of the 12 HyHEL-10 residues in the paratope
qualify as hot spots as defined in Figure 1, but only 3 of the 13
epitope residues fall into this category. The six HyHEL-10 hot spot
side chains all contact the three dominant lysozyme hot spots. This
difference in number of important affinity residues shows that
stabilization of the complex is achieved by the accumulation of
many productive cooperative interactions of the CDR residues
with the fewer HEWL hot spots. Differences in the number of
important residues between the two interfaces of a reacting pair of
proteins have recently been reported for the interaction between
human growth hormone and its receptor ~Clackson et al., 1998!.
These authors suggest that quantitatively important side chains
placed in loops will show more cooperativity than will those lo￾cated in rigid structures, such as a-helices. The HyHEL-100

Energetic analysis of HyHEL-100lysozyme interaction 959HEWL interaction can be described similarly as two of the three
hot spots contributed by HEWL are in an a-helix ~Rajpal et al.,
1998!, while those from the antibody are distributed in the CDR
loops.
The topology of the interaction shows that the hot spots are
centrally located, but there is no clustering of hydrophobic hot
spots in the core surrounded by hydrophilic residues in the periph￾ery. Two of the three hot spots in the epitope have charged side
chains, and 3 of the 10 important residues in the paratope are
hydrophilic, 1 is hydrophobic, and 6 are tyrosines. Goldman et al.
~1997! have noted that there appear to be two topological classes
of protein–protein interaction. The first consists of a hydrophobic
core surrounded by hydrophilic amino acids, and is exemplified by
protein hormone0receptor complexes ~Wells, 1996!. The second is
found in reactions of antibodies with protein antigens where hy￾drophobic and hydrophilic residues are not clustered ~Dall’Acqua
et al., 1996!. A recently defined additional grouping is seen in the
interaction between a T cell receptor with a nonapeptide0MHC
complex, where an estimated 37% of the free energy of association
was attributed to interactions with the centroid peptide while the
remainder results from peripheral interactions of MGC with the T
cell receptor ~Manning et al., 1998!.
Role of salt bridges
The E-amino group of HEWL K97 forms a salt bridge with the
side-chain carboxylate of D32H in the crystallographic structure of
HEWL with Fab-10 ~Padlan et al., 1989!. These authors also noted
a highly polar H-bond between the E-amino group of HEWL K96
and Od1 of N31L. Computational studies by Pomès et al. ~1995!
suggested that this H-bond might be converted to a salt bridge by

Fab-100HEWL complexes ~Rajpal et al., 1998!. Literature values for the Y53H ~A,F!, Y58H~A,F!, Y33HF, and Y50HF0HEWL ~WT!

960 J. Pons et al.placing a negatively charged residue at position N31L, resulting in
a calculated 5.6 kcal0mol increase in the stability of the complex.
To study the contributions of the above-described interactions to
the stability of this complex, the previously prepared HEWL mu￾tants K97A, K97M, and K96A ~Taylor et al., 1998! were employed
together with the HyHEL-10 mutants D32HA, D32HN, N31LA,
N31LD, and N31LE. A double mutant cycle approach was applied
to each interaction.
The double mutant cycle describing the effect of Ala replace￾ments of HEWL K97 and of HyHEL-10 D32H on the thermo￾dynamics of complex formation ~Scheme 1, bottom! shows that
there is a 1.6 kcal0mol gain in the stability of the complex when
the second mutation is added to the deleterious HyHEL-10~WT!0
HEWL ~K97A! single mutant complex. Thus, these results indi￾cate that the role of the negative charge of the HyHEL-10 D32H is
only to neutralize the uncompensated positive charge of HEWL
K97. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the
value for the D32HA0K97M complex is also 1.1 kcal0mol less
stable than that of the WT ~Appendix!. Thus, burying the negative
charge of D32H by neutralization of the Lys97 ~HEWL! is incon￾sequential. Further support for this hypothesis was obtained by
constructing a pair of mutants designed to maintain approximately
the same steric bulk of the original ion pair, but which contribute
only van der Waals interactions. The stability of the D32HN0
K97M complex is experimentally indistinguishable from that of
the WT ~Scheme 1, top!. Thus, the salt bridge per se is thermo￾dynamically insignificant. This set of substitutions emphasizes the
need to extend replacement sets beyond simple alanine substitu￾tions ~see Rajpal et al., 1998, for additional examples!, i.e., the
results of the alanine scanning substitutions ~D32HA with or with￾out K97A! imply that the sale bridge contributes $1.9 kcal0mol
while the mass conservative mutations D32HN0K97M yield a much
smaller figure ~0.3 kcal0mol!.
The effects of the D32HA, D32HN, and D32HE mutations on the
free energy of the corresponding WT HEWL complexes were eval￾uated calorimetrically by Tsumoto et al. ~1996!. The values of the
DDG of destabilization with respect to the WT complexes are close
to those reported here. These mutations yield decreases in entropy
of complex formation that are partially compensated by enthalpy
decreases. The D32HN mutant showed the highest decrease in
enthalpy, probably due to formation of a H-bond, but this mutation
has a negligible effect on the stability of the complex. The de￾creased entropy of complex formation was interpreted in terms of
an effect of a larger structural change when binding the mutant
antibodies. Tsumoto et al., proposed that the salt bridge suppresses
excess local conformational change upon association. The present
work shows that the same result in terms of free energy is obtained
by mutations that anchor the protein exclusively through inter￾actions of uncharged residues.
The role of the HEWL K960HyHEL-10 N31L hydrogen bond
was evaluated by the double mutant cycle of Scheme 2, bottom. In
double mutant cycles, the changes in free energy in the double
mutant complex for a pair of residues ~DDGABrA9B9! is subtracted
from the sum of the two single mutations to calculate the coupling
energy ~DDGint! between those amino acids ~Equation 1!:
DDGint 5 DDGArA' 1 DDGBrB' 2 DDGABrA'
B' . ~1!
K96 and N31L interact only through this hydrogen bond; there￾fore evaluation of the DDGint in this case allows the calculation of
the contribution of this hydrogen bond to the free energy of for￾mation of the complex as 4.7 kcal0mol ~Table 2!. This value is
close to that obtained for the single N31LA mutation in HyHEL-10
~5.2 kcal0mol!; therefore, the contribution of this H-bond is iso￾lated and it is worth ;5 kcal0mol.
The proposal of Pomès et al. ~1995! that replacement of N31L
with aspartic acid to create a salt bridge and thus stabilize the
complex by a calculated 5.6 kcal0mol was tested here via the
N31LD and N31LE constructs. The calculated result was not ver￾ified experimentally; rather these mutant complexes are 1.4 kcal0
mol ~N31LD! and 5.7 kcal0mol ~N31LE! less stable than those
formed with WT HyHEL-10 ~Scheme 2, top!.
The two examples discussed above demonstrate that a charged
residue in the epitope can be stabilized equally or better by a
neutral H-bond donor0acceptor than by a counter ion. Hendsch and
Tidor ~1994! have pointed out that, in the majority of cases, the
expected stabilization of salt bridges is compromised by large
unfavorable desolvation contributions, and Mian et al. ~1991! have
argued that oriented dipoles are usually preferred over counter
charges in stabilizing buried ionized groups. The burying of an
uncompensated charge is highly unfavorable. This fact may be

Energetic analysis of HyHEL-100lysozyme interaction 961generally useful in dictating the specificity of antigen0antibody
interactions, because antibodies that fail to compensate for charged
residues will not bind well to the antigenic protein even with
otherwise excellent surface complementarity. A particularly poi￾gnant demonstration of the role of salt bridges in specificity is
found in the interaction between human growth hormone and its
receptor, where the removal of a salt bridge by mutation of the
receptor Arg43 to Leu destabilizes the complex by only 0.5 kcal0
mol ~Clackson et al., 1998!, but this mutant receptor cross-reacts
with bovine growth hormone, whereas the WT receptor does not
~Souza et al., 1995; Goodman et al., 1996!.
Role of hydrogen bonds
The energetic contributions to the free energy of formation of the
complex of 13 of the 14 H-bonds proposed from the crystallo￾graphic structure are shown in Table 3. It is not possible to probe
the main-chain0main-chain H-bond between N92L and HEWL R21
by site-directed mutagenesis. The role of the important H-bond
K960N31L was discussed above.
The values of DDG obtained by amino acid replacements on
HyHEL-10 correspond well with those obtained by mutation of the
directly interacting residues on HEWL ~Fig. 2!. The strong corre￾lation between DDG occasioned by mutation of either partner ar￾gues that single mutations ~Y to F, and others to Ala! do not
generally overestimate hydrogen bond contributions. Most of the
significant H-bonds in the interface contribute between 1–2 kcal0
mol to the free energy of stabilization, as expected ~Fersht et al.,
1985; Alber et al., 1987; Serrano et al., 1992; Goldman et al.,
1997!. The proposed HyHEL-10 S31H0HEWL R73, Y58H0G102,
S910Y20, and T300R73 H-bonds do not contribute significantly.
One neutral-neutral H-bond stands out for its high contribution
to the stability of the complex: the HyHEL-10 N32L Nd2 with G16
O ~5.1 kcal0mol, r 5 3.24 Å!. The Nd2 atom of N32L also appears
to contact CE1 and Cd1 of Y20, and CE of K96, in the crystallo￾graphic structure. Tyr20 and K96 are HEWL hot spots, and the
later contacts are thus eliminated in the mutant N32LA. This ob￾servation suggests that the value of 5.1 kcal0mol is an overesti￾mate of the contribution of this H-bond. We tried to determine the
energetic value for the interaction between N32L and Y20 by dou￾ble mutant cycles, but no association with HEWL was observed in
the double mutant, N32LA0Y20A at @scFv# 5 4 mM; therefore, the
KD is .8 mM. This H-bond cannot be examined by double mutant
cycles as the backbone oxygen of G16 cannot be eliminated by
site-directed mutagenesis. A possible explanation for this result
would be that the N32LA mutation elicits a conformational change
in the antibody. This is, however, unlikely because the residue in
position 32 is not a conformational determinant for the 2011A class
of CDR-L1 ~Chothia et al., 1989; Martin & Thornton, 1996!, to
which the corresponding CDR of HyHEL-10 belongs.
Quantitative dissection of the free energy contribution
of each of the paratope tyrosine residues
Davies and Cohen ~1996! and Kabat et al. ~1977! have noted the
disproportionate number of tyrosine residues in CDRs, and Mian
et al. ~1991! have pointed out that there is a higher percentage in
the heavy chain. It has been proposed that the explanation for the
overabundance of tyrosine in CDRs is that the hydroxyphenyl side
chain allows participation in both polar and apolar interactions.
This is quantitatively significant for HyHEL-10, as 6 of the 10
important paratope residues are tyrosines ~DDG Tyr r Ala . 2.7
kcal0mol!. Factoring the van der Waals interactions from the
H-bonding contributions was accomplished by comparing the DDG
value of the Tyr r Phe vs. the corresponding Tyr r Ala mutation.
The former isolates the H-bond value as nearly as can be done by
site-directed mutagenesis, while the latter measures the sum of
hydroxyl and ring contributions. The results given in Figure 1
show that the DDG associated with each Tyr r Ala is invariably
greater than that of the corresponding Tyr r Phe mutation. The
relative contributions vary however. It is notable that the nonpolar
contacts in the light chain contribute only about one-half of the
total DDG observed for the Tyr r Ala mutation, while they are
significantly more important in the heavy chain. This difference is
highlighted by the plot of Figure 3, where separate linear correla￾tions are observed for plots of DDG~Tyr r Phe! vs. DDG~Tyr r
Ala! for the light and heavy chains. Any conclusion drawn from
the relation of Figure 3 must be tempered by the limitation that
there are only two tyrosines in the light chain. Nonetheless, the
difference for each of the two light chain tyrosines is clearly out￾side the range of the much better defined heavy chain correlation.
The slope for the light chain tyrosine mutations is 0.5 while that
for the heavy chain residues is 0.2, emphasizing the relative dom￾inance of nonpolar interactions in the heavy chain. Consistent with
this set of observations is the fact that nonpolar residues dominate
the important ~DDG~XrAla! . 1 kcal0mol! heavy chain contribu￾tions to the HyHEL-10 paratope ~Fig. 1; Tyr4, Trp1, and Asp1!

hydrogen bond to the stability of the HyHEL-100HEWL complex. Upper:
Replacement of the neutral0positive hydrogen bond with a putative salt
bridge by N31LD and N31LE mutations. Lower: Alanine replacement
double mutant cycle. The numerical values are in kcal0mol and give the
DDG with respect to the WT complex ~shown at the center of the figure!
that are obtained for the indicated mutations. Local charges are shown as
~2! negative, ~1! positive, and ~C! neutral next to each complex.
962 J. Pons et al.while the converse obtains for the light chain ~Tyr2, Asn2!. Thus,
at least for the HyHEL-100HEWL interaction, it can be concluded
that the molecular “cement” is composed of rather clearly divided
nonpolar heavy chain and polar light chain contributions.
Interestingly the magnitudes of energetic contributions of the
dominant tyrosines of the light chain ~Y50L! and heavy chain
~Y50H! cannot be rationalized readily from the structure of the
complex. The large effect of the Y50LF mutation ~2.4 kcal0mol!
leads to the expectation of the most significant H-bond; however
the closest atoms to this hydroxyl group are Cb and Cd of HEWL
K96, at 3.57 and 3.72 Å, respectively, and the closest heteroatom,
the main-chain O of HEWL N93, is too distant to make a H-bond
~4.03 Å!. Thus, the explanation for the importance of this Tyr
hydroxyl group is not apparent. Y50H shows the highest contribu￾tion for a paratope residue ~DDG Tyr r Ala 7.4 kcal0mol!, and it
is the only antibody hot spot that is not in direct contact with an
epitope hot spot. However, it does contact with the HEWL warm
spot, R21. Y50H also makes multiple contacts with the important
paratope side chains ~W95H, Y96L, Y58H!, suggesting that the
large contribution identified by the Y50HA mutation is the result of
a structural perturbation of the paratope binding site. Rajpal and
Kirsch ~1999! noted that warm spot mutations affect the value of
adjacent hot spots in the HEWL epitope, and suggested that the
warm spot residues function as buttresses of the hot spot contrib￾utors. The preceding discussion excludes the possible role of in￾tervening water molecules in H-bond complexes, as their positions
are not apparent ina3Å structure.
The role of the heavy chain tyrosines was previously studied by
Tsumoto et al. ~1995! who converted Y33H, Y50H, Y53H, and
Y58H to Ala, Leu, and Trp. The enthalpic and entropic contribu￾tions for those mutants that could be obtained in sufficient quantity
were evaluated calorimetrically. The Y33HA and Y50HA constructs
could not be purified by HEWL affinity chromatography, and it
was proposed that Y33H and Y50H are major contributors to the
free energy of complex formation. This suggestion is supported by
the present results.
The Tyr r Phe and Tyr r Ala mutations taken singly and
together define the quantitative importance of the CDR tyrosines
of HyHEL-10 in the formation of the HyHEL-100HEWL complex.
Padlan ~1990! discussed the advantages of aromatic over aliphatic
side-chain amino acids in the CDRs. He pointed out that the fusion
of many atoms in a ring system immobilizes that side chain in the
free antibody, while aliphatic side chains generally have more
conformational entropy in the free antibody, which would have to
be frozen out in the complex.
Double mutant cycles
Carter et al. ~1984! introduced double mutant cycle analysis to
study structural changes in the active site of a tyrosyl-tRNA syn￾thetase. Subsequent applications include those of Serrano et al.
~1990, 1992! in barnase and Pons et al. ~1995! in a b-glucanase.
These investigations are applications of double mutant cycles on
two amino acids within the same molecule, but the technique has
been recently extended to the investigation of protein–protein in￾teractions ~barnase0barstar, Schreiber & Fersht, 1995; Frisch et al.,
1997; Schreiber et al., 1997; and D1.30E5.2, Goldman et al., 1997;
and D1.30HEWL, Dall’Acqua et al., 1998!. As described above
~see Role of salt bridges!, double mutant cycles allow the calcu￾lation of the free energy of interaction ~DDGint! between specific
amino acids. A DDGint 5 0 is expected for completely independent
mutations. The interpretation of DDGint Þ 0 is model dependent,
i.e., this quantity may reflect a change in solvation resulting from
the mutation of one partner in an ion pair ~Horovitz et al., 1990!
and0or an associated conformational change ~Serrano et al., 1990!.

Energetic analysis of HyHEL-100lysozyme interaction 963Double mutant cycles for 12 amino acid pairs in the HyHEL￾100HEWL interface were constructed to understand more fully the
energetic contributions obtained for the single mutants. Seven of
these 12 pairs have side chains that are appropriately positioned to
form H-bonds, salt bridges, or significant van der Waals contacts
while the other five are well separated. The results for contacting
pairs are shown in Table 2. The DDGint for any complex for which
the HEWL residue probed is a major immunodeterminant, i.e.,
K96 or K97 ~Rajpal et al., 1998!, is very close to the loss of free
energy observed for the HyHEL-10 single mutant, i.e., from Equa￾tion 1.

where A and B refer to the antibody and HEWL, respectively. In
other words the DDG associated with the double mutation is real￾ized entirely by mutation of the lysozyme hot spot.
Although the DDGint values for remote pairs of amino acids are
generally small ~Table 4!, there are two exceptions: the Y50LA0
K97A and the W95HA0K96A pairs. One interpretation is that the
Y50LA or W95HA mutations effect a conformational change that
allows the recapture elsewhere in the complex of some of the free
energy lost when the K97A or K96A mutation is introduced into
the WT antibody complex, e.g., 7.3 , ~6.2 1 4.6! kcal0mol, for
Y50LA0K97A, because less free energy of association is lost in the
double mutant than in the sum of the two single mutants. This
interpretation is supported by the observation that the correspond￾ingly more conservative Y50LF and W95HF mutants do not bind as
well ~DDG .8.5 kcal0mol! to the K97A and K96A HEWL as do
the Y50LA and W95HA antibodies, while the opposite situation is
obtained for association with WT HEWL ~Table 4!. The values of
DDGint are small for the double mutant cycles not involving K96 or
K97 ~Table 4!.
Mariuzza’s laboratory has recently published the results of dou￾ble mutant cycle analyses with the antibody D1.30HEWL com￾plexes ~Dall’Acqua et al., 1998! and the D1.30E5.2 ~Goldman
et al., 1997! complexes, E5.2 is an anti-idiotypic antibody. The
values of KD are both in the 10 nM range. These complexes are
about 300-fold less stable than the HyHEL-100HEWL complex.
Comparison of the results of single and double mutations between
high affinity and weaker complexes is instructive. A clear differ￾ence is the observation that no single amino acid in HEWL makes
a comparable contribution to the free energy of association with

964 J. Pons et al.the D1.3 antibody as do the three previously identified dominant
residues of HEWL in the HyHEL-10 complex. Alanine scanning
has provided values of DDG 5 4.2, 7.0, and 6.1 for the Y20A,
K96A, and K97A complexes, respectively ~Rajpal et al., 1998!;
whereas the largest effect of an Ala replacement of HEWL in the
D1.3 complex, Q121A, decreases the stability only by 2.0 kcal0
mol. The same two complexes also show striking differences in
alanine scanning mutagenesis of the paratope. Six of the 12 alanine
substitutions in the HyHEL-10 paratope yield DDG values $4
kcal0mol ~Fig. 1!, while only one of nine in the weaker D1.30
HyHEL-10 complex is that large.
Errors in double mutant cycle analysis
The following considerations argue that the quantitative value of
double mutant cycle results is limited to analysis of large values of
DDGint unless data of more than typical precision are collected.
The propagated error in DDGint ~Equation 1!, sDDGint is
sDDGint 5 %sDDGArA'! 2 1 ~sDDGBrB'! 2 1 ~sDDGABrA'
B'! 2
. ~3!
Typical reported errors in the determination of values of KD
range from 12% ~Schreiber & Fersht, 1995; Frisch et al., 1997;
Schreiber et al., 1997! to 30% ~Dall’Acqua et al., 1996, 1998;
Goldman et al., 1997! or a spread between those values ~Acker￾mann et al., 1998!. Those reported here are 10–15%, except for
very deleterious double mutants where they increase to 50% ~Ap￾pendix!. These values represent the reported precision not the ac￾curacy. Some subsequent determinations of the identical constructs
from the same laboratory using the same or an alternative tech￾nique yield significantly more variation.
Table 5 reports the calculated propagated errors in DDGint for
a range of percent errors in the individual KD determinations.
For example, a 30% error in KD values propagates to an error of
1 kcal0mol in DDGint. Many workers consider a spread of 2s
values ~90% confidence level! to be a satisfactory threshold level
of quantitative significance ~Schreiber et al., 1997!. This means,
for example, that errors in KD values must be #20% to draw
meaningful conclusions for DDGint # 2 kcal0mol. This figure falls
well within the range of H-bond interactions. The conclusion is
that without highly precise data, double mutant cycle analysis can
only be applied with confidence to the consideration of “hot spots.”

Energetic analysis of HyHEL-100lysozyme interaction 965Material and methods
The materials and procedures not described here are to be found in
Rajpal et al. ~1998!.
HyHEL-10 expression and purification
All determinations were carried out with the scFv gene for the mono￾clonal antibody HyHEL-10 ~scFv-10!, a gift of Professor Andreas
Plückthun. The scFv-10 gene was cloned with XhoI0AvrII into the
pPIC-9 secretion vector for Pichia pastoris ~Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
California!. Five histidine residues were added to the C-terminus to
allow Ni-column purification. The recombinant plasmid was lin￾earized by StuI restriction digest for genomic integration into P. pas￾toris GS115. Transformants were selected for their capacity to grow
in histidine free media. One of 10 transformants showing the high￾est expression level was used to express the protein in BMMY me￾dia ~1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5%
methanol, 431025
% biotin, 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0!.
Expression cultures were incubated at 30 8C for 5 days inducing with
0.5% methanol ~final concentration! every 12 h. The culture was cen￾trifuged ~11,000 g, 15 min!, the supernatant collected, the pH ad￾justed to 7.0 with KOH, and the suspension centrifuged ~11,000 g,
30 min! to remove precipitated proteins. The supernatant was loaded
onto Ni-NTA~nitrolotriacetic acid!superflow resin ~Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany! equilibrated with 66 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH
7.0, 300 mM KCl. The column was washed with 5 volumes of
66 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 300 mM KCl, and the
scFv-10 was eluted with a shallow linear gradient of imidazole ~0–
0.3 M in the same buffer!. Fractions enriched ~analyzed by SDS￾PAGE! with scFv-10 were pooled and dialyzed against 66 mM
potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The purity of the samples was
verified by SDS-PAGE. Absence of glycosidation was confirmed by
mass spectrometry and no dimers were detected by HPLC gel fil￾tration ~Bio-sil-sec 250 Column, Bio-Rad, Richmond, California!.
The proteins were stored at low concentration to minimize dimer￾ization ~,0.5 mg0mL, Dougan et al., 1998!. Mutant proteins were
concentrated by Centriprep-10 prior to use when required. The con￾centration of scFv-10 was determined with the molar extinction co￾efficient ~E280 5 53,200 M21 cm21, calculated from the amino acid
sequence and verified for the WT protein by titration with HEWL!.
Twenty to 50 mg of purified protein per liter of culture were typ￾ically obtained.
Site-directed mutagenesis
The HEWL mutant genes were available from previous investiga￾tions of this laboratory ~Rajpal et al., 1998; Taylor et al., 1998!.
The HyHEL-10 mutants were produced by PCR with the mega￾primer method ~Landt et al., 1990; Pons et al., 1997!. All mutants
were fully sequenced.
Determination of kinetic parameters for complex
formation and dissociation
HyHEL-10 occludes the active site of HEWL. The complex has
only 5% of the catalytic activity of free HEWL; therefore, the
extent of HyHEL-10 association with HEWL can be determined in
homogeneous solution by monitoring the rate of loss of activity of
HEWL following addition of HyHEL-10 as described by Taylor
et al. ~1998!. The values of kon were determined from nonlinear
regression of the data from Equation 4.

The dissociation rate constants koff were determined by moni￾toring the rate of recovery of active HEWL from a preformed
HyHEL-100HEWL complex. The nascent free antibody was se￾questered with an excess of E35Q HEWL, an inactive mutant. The
data were fitted to Equation 5 ~Rajpal et al., 1998!.

acid composition!. The kon and koff values for the formation and
