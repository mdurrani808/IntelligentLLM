Subtilisins represent a large class of microbial serine proteases. To date, there
are three-dimensional structures of proteinaceous inhibitors from three
families in complex with subtilisins in the Protein Data Bank. All interact
with subtilisin via an exposed loop covering six interacting residues. Here
we present the crystal structure of the complex between the Bacillus lentus
subtilisin Savinase and the barley α-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor (BASI).
This is the first reported structure of a cereal Kunitz-P family inhibitor in
complex with a subtilisin. Structural analysis revealed that BASI inhibits
Savinase in a novel way, as the interacting loop is shorter than loops
previously reported. Mutational analysis showed that Thr88 is crucial for the
inhibition, as it stabilises the interacting loop through intramolecular inter￾actions with the BASI backbone.

Introduction
Subtilisins represent a large class of microbial se￾rine proteases, of which those secreted by the Bacillus
species (e.g., BPN′ from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens,
subtilisin Carlsberg from Bacillus subtilis and Savi￾nase from Bacillus lentus) are the most studied. Sub￾tilisins are endopeptidases with a catalytic triad con￾sisting of Asp32, His64 and Ser221 (with BPN′
numbering used consistently1
). Subtilisins are glob￾ular proteins, with the active site situated in a
shallow groove on the surface. The mechanism is
identical with that of trypsin-like family enzymes but
is evolutionary and structurally different.2 The sub￾strate binding cleft of Savinase provides six subsites
for binding of the side chains of the protein to be
degraded, designated S4–S2′ (nomenclature accord￾ing to Ref. 3). Inhibitor residues corresponding to the
subsites are numbered P4–P2′, and adjacent inhibitor
residues are numbered sequentially; cleavage occurs
between the P1 and P1′ residues. More than 50% of
the 275 amino acids have been subjected to muta￾genesis, and this has provided great insight into en￾zyme catalysis.4 Furthermore, subtilisins are impor￾tant industrial enzymes, being used in various fields
such as detergent production, food production, feed
production, leather and textile processing, pharma￾ceutical production, diagnostics and waste manage￾ment.5 The three-dimensional fold is highly con￾served, with a central seven-stranded parallel β-sheet
flanked on both sides by α-helices.6–8 There is a highly
conserved calcium binding site in most Bacillus sub-

made up by residues 75–81. There is a second and
much weaker ion binding site on the surface 32 Å
away from the strong calcium site that coordinates to
residues 195 and 197. This region actually has two ion
binding sites close to each other; one accommodates
sodium and the other accommodates calcium. These
two sites cannot be occupied simultaneously.4
Complexes of the serine proteases with proteinac￾eous inhibitors have been the object of intensive
study. Inhibitors identified to date fall into about 20
structural families.9 Proteinaceous subtilisin inhibi￾tors are found in 3 families [Potato I inhibitor family,
Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) family and
Kazal inhibitor family7,10,11] and are all canonical in￾hibitors. The structures of inhibitors from all 3 classes
have been solved in complex with a subtilisin: chy￾motrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI-2, from the Potato I inhi￾bitor family)7 and SSI (from the SSI family) both in
complex with subtilisin Novo (BPN′)
10 and the tur￾key ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3, from the
Kazal inhibitor family) in complex with subtilisin
Carlsberg.11 Although the 3 families of inhibitors
have different overall folds, they all interact with
subtilisin via a structurally conserved exposed loop
surrounding the fully exposed P1 residue. The
interaction is stabilised through a highly conserved
hydrogen bonding pattern.7,12–15
Hordeum vulgare α-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor
(BASI) is a double-headed inhibitor that acts both on
α-amylase 2 (AMY2) from barley and on serine pro￾teases from the subtilisin family. BASI is thought to
have two functions: to control degradation of starch
during premature sprouting16 and to protect the seed
from pathogen-derived subtilisin-type serine
proteases17 (for a review, see the work of Bellincampi
et al.18 and Nielsen et al.19). It is a single-chain protein
of 181 amino acids and belongs to the Kunitz-P-type
inhibitor family.16,20,21 BASI shares about 30%
sequence identity with Kunitz-type inhibitors from
other plants that contain two conserved disulfide
bridges.22 The closest homologues to BASI are from
wheat (WASI) and rice, and these share 92% and 58%
sequence identities, respectively.23,24 The structure of
BASI has been solved in complex with AMY225 and
barley thioredoxin (HvTrxh2)26: In both complexes,
BASI displays the β-trefoil topology. BASI does not
inhibit barley thioredoxin but rather serves as a
substrate.
In this study, we present the X-ray structure of
BASI in complex with the B. lentus subtilisin Savi￾nase, which shows that BASI inhibits subtilisins in a
novel way.
Results and Discussion
Architecture of the BASI–Savinase complex
There are two independent complexes in the asym￾metric unit, with very similar structures: superpo￾sition of the two results in a root-mean-square (rms)
difference of 0.8 Å over 450 Cα atoms. The inhibitor
binds to the active site of the enzyme, situated in a
shallow groove on the surface (Fig. 1), in agreement
with biochemical experiments that supported a
strictly competitive inhibition mode.27 Eighteen resi￾dues of the inhibitor interact with 28 residues of the
enzyme. The overall contact area between the en￾zyme and the inhibitor is 1800 Å2
, which is equi￾valent or slightly higher than areas in other subti￾lisin–proteinaceous inhibitor complexes (Fig. 2a,
upper panel).28 In the standard mechanism for
canonical protein inhibition of serine proteases, the
inhibitor binds to the protease in a substrate-like
manner, with the protease interacting loop kept in a
well-ordered conformation. BASI residues Ala86–
Thr89 bind to Savinase S5 to S2 by hydrogen bon￾ding. At the interface, there are 144 contacts less than
4 Å. BASI residues Ala86–Thr89 (P5–P2) make 77
contacts with 17 residues in Savinase, 7 of which are
hydrogen bonds. In the cleft leading to the active site,
the P4–P2 residues make five main chain–main chain
hydrogen bonds, which follow the expected hydro￾gen bonding pattern typical for P4–P2 interactions
(Fig. 2, lower panel).6 Two additional side chain–
main chain hydrogen bonds are formed between
BASI Ala86–Savinase Ser126 and BASI Tyr87–Savi￾nase Ser130.
Savinase fold and mobility
Savinase displays the subtilisin-like fold with the
same topology as reported previously.2 Superposi￾tion of the Cα atoms from the two Savinase mole￾cules in the asymmetric unit gives an rms difference
of 0.3 Å for 269 Cα atoms. Superposing the current
model on native Savinase (1SVN)2 gives a similar
rms of 0.3 Å over the same 269 Cα atoms. There is no
significant rearrangement of Savinase side chains in
the active site on BASI inhibition.
BASI fold and mobility
In the complex, BASI displays the β-trefoil topol￾ogy with the same topology as reported previous￾ly.25,26 Superposition of the 181 Cα atoms from the
two independent BASI molecules gives an rms differ￾ence of 1.1 Å. Furthermore, BASI can be superposed
with the BASI molecule (chain C) in complex with
AMY2 (1AVA)25 and with the BASI molecule in com￾plex with HvTrxh2 (2IWT),26 resulting in rms differ￾ences of 2.3 and 1.8 Å, respectively (based on 181
and 179 Cα atoms, respectively). The relatively high
differences for superposition of BASI are due to the
high level of flexibility of the loops (definition of
loops and β-strands as in Vallee et al.25). Twenty-eight
residues, all situated in loops found on the surface of
BASI, have B-factors above 50. When those residues
are omitted from the superposition and the remain￾ing 153 Cα atoms are superposed, the rms difference
drops to 0.8 Å, whereas if only the core structure,
omitting all loops, is superposed, the rms is 0.5 Å
(62 Cα
). In the BASI–AMY2 complex, a large part of
682 Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisinthe BASI surface is tightly bound in the interface; the
loops involved in the BASI–AMY2 interface are
therefore in a different conformation compared with
the BASI–Savinase complex. The rms value drops to
1.4 Å (113 Cα atoms used, BASI–Savinase chain C and
1AVA chain C) when residues involved in the AMY2
binding are omitted from the superposition (Fig. 3).25
Positioning of the metal ions
All subtilisins are calcium dependent, and many of
the Bacillus enzymes have a conserved strong
calcium binding site (site A) and a weaker ion
binding site (site B).2,7,8 In addition to the four
peptide chains, 4 calcium ions, 6 sodium ions and 24

Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisin 683chloride ions were modelled into the electron
density. All identified ions are present in the crystal￾lisation solution. Two of the calcium ions are bound
in site A and coordinate to Savinase as previously
described.2,7,8,29 The other two calcium ions are coor￾dinated to Savinase Val153 and four water mole￾cules; there is no coordination with BASI. Site B is
occupied by a sodium ion in both complexes (Fig. 1).
Comparison of the two complexes in the
asymmetric unit
The overall structures of the two complexes are
essentially identical. However, there are some small
differences, with one significant difference in the
enzyme–inhibitor interface. The buried surface area
in the interface of the AC complex is 1866 Å2
, while
that of the BD complex is 1798 Å2
.
28 In the interface,
only two BASI residues, Arg61 and Arg85, differ
significantly in the interface area contribution, due to
side chain rearrangement (Fig. 4). The solvent-acces￾sible surface (SAS) for the two residues was calcu￾lated (Table 1) in order to better understand the
effects of the side chain rearrangements on the inter￾face area. The biggest difference arises from Arg61.
Taking the entire residue into account, 77% and 86%
of the SAS are covered by BASI itself in the C and D
chains, respectively; in addition, when BASI is
bound to Savinase, 70% and 0% of the SAS are
covered by Savinase in the AC and BD complexes,
respectively. Thus, Arg61 contributes to the interface
area with 60 and 0 Å2 in the AC and BD complexes,
respectively. The opposite situation is seen for Arg85,
which contributes to the interface area with 40 and
80 Å2 in the AC and BD complexes, respectively.
Furthermore, in the AC complex, BASI Ala181 has
seven contacts with Savinase Thr132, two of which
are hydrogen bonds; on the other hand, in the DB
complex, Ala181 is not involved in the interface. In
general, there are more contacts and hydrogen bonds
in the AC complex compared with the BD complex.
These differences probably reflect differences in the
crystal contacts of the two complexes. The D chain is
more solvated than the C chain, and this could
explain the difference observed in the mobility of the
two chains.
Comparison with other subtilisin–inhibitor
complexes
BASI interacts with Savinase via an exposed loop,
but the length of the loop differs from that observed
in the complexes previously reported (Fig. 2). Where￾as the subtilisin interacting loops in the previous
structures constitute the P4–P2′ residues, the loop in
BASI is composed of the P5–P2 residues (Ala86–
Thr89). After the P2 residue, the BASI loop is pulled
out of the Savinase cleft, as Cys90 (which would be
the P1 residue) forms a disulfide bond with Cys43.
This moves the potential scissile bond, between
Cys90 and Leu91, 6.4 Å away from the active serine,
compared with about 2.6 Å in the other three types of
inhibitors (Fig. 2, lower panel). Since the interacting
loop in BASI is shorter, the triple-stranded β-sheet
seen in other subtilisin–proteinaceous inhibitor com￾plexes is missing (Fig. 2, lower panel). This is a novel

684 Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisinway for a proteinaceous inhibitor to interact with a
subtilisin. The inhibition is basically canonical, but as
the interacting loop is shorter, it lacks the reactive
bond. As the potential scissile bond is pulled away
from the active serine, BASI is not degraded, in
contrast to other known serine protease inhibitors
where the P1–P1′ bond is slowly degraded by the
enzyme.30–32 This suggests that the BASI–subtilisin
complex is more stable than other known subtilisin–
inhibitor complexes. The cysteine that prevents BASI
from being degraded is conserved in the close homo￾logues in WASI23 and rice α-amylase/subtilisin
inhibitor,24 which can be assumed to share this
novel mode of interaction.
Biological role and regulation of BASI
In addition to inhibiting Savinase, BASI inhibits
AMY2 from barley, and indeed both enzymes can be
inhibited simultaneously.16,33 The Savinase inhibi￾tion is calcium independent, while the AMY2 inhibi￾tion is calcium dependent, as there is a fully hydrated
calcium ion in the interface between BASI and AMY2
that is absent from the AMY2 structure.25 It has been
suggested that the calcium ion in the BASI–AMY2
interface plays an important role in the regulation of
the AMY2 inhibition.33 Amylases in grains must be
inhibited to prevent premature sprouting, but the
inhibition needs to be regulated in order for the seed
to germinate at a later point. The ability of BASI to
simultaneously inhibit AMY2 and Savinase, the
possible regulatory role of the calcium ion in the
BASI–AMY2 interaction and the unregulated nature
of the BASI–Savinase interaction are consistent with
the proposed biological roles of BASI: to prevent
premature sprouting and to inhibit pathogen￾derived proteases. The AMY2 and the Savinase
binding sites are located on opposite surfaces of BASI
(Fig. 5). Therefore, the ternary complex between
AMY2, BASI and Savinase might occur naturally,
although it has not yet been isolated to date.
Savinase inhibition by BASI mutants
The binding loop of CI-2 is supported and confor￾mationally constrained by an extensive network of
hydrogen bonds and intramolecular interactions.7,34
This network is not present in BASI, but BASI has a
more extended hydrogen bond network between the
P5–P2 residues and the residues in the subtilisin
groove. Although BASI and CI-2 hydrogen bond to
Savinase in the same manner with respect to the P4–
P2 residues and the cores of the loop consisting of the
P7–P2 residues have the same conformation, only the
P2 residue is conserved (BASI Thr89 and CI-2 Thr58).
All BASI P7–P2 residues were mutated individually
to those present in the CI-2 P7–P2 sequence to gain a
better understanding of the role of each residue in the

Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisin 685inhibition. In addition, Y87A and T89A, two BASI
point mutations, previously reported to have a 3.5-
fold decrease in affinity and no affinity change, res￾pectively,35 were included in this study.
The effect of the mutations on the inhibition of
Savinase was assayed on N-Suc-AAPF-pNA (N￾succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine
4-nitroanilide). The Ki values increased for all
mutants, ranging from a few to more than 120-fold
(Fig. 6 and Table 2). Mutation of the outermost resi￾dues of the P7–P2 loop (P7, F84V; P6, R86G; P2, T89A)
had little effect on Ki, while mutation of the P3–P5
residues resulted in changes ranging from 11-fold to
more than 120-fold. Both the A86T and the Y87T
mutants showed a 25- to 30-fold reduction in Ki.
Ala86 is situated in a hydrophobic pocket, and,
presumably, introducing a hydrophilic residue desta￾bilises the interaction. In the wild-type BASI, Tyr87 is
involved in a side chain hydrogen bond to Savinase
Ser130. When mutated into a residue with a shorter
side chain, the hydrogen bond is presumably lost; the
Y87A mutant showed an 11-fold decrease in affinity.
The Y87A mutant was previously reported to in￾crease Ki by only 3.5-fold35 compared with the 10-
fold increase seen here. In addition, Bønsager et al.
reported a value for Ki for the wild-type enzyme
higher than that measured in this study. The differ￾ences seen in the two studies must be due to experi￾mental differences, including assay conditions, pro￾tein expression, protein purification method and
protein modifications.
The most significant change in inhibition effect
results from mutation of the P3 residue (T88V). The
side chain of Thr88 forms two intramolecular hydro￾Fig. 6. Inhibition of Savinase by BASI wild type and

686 Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisingen bonds to Cys90 and Leu91; in addition, there are
several intramolecular interactions between the
Thr88 side chain and the BASI backbone, which are
presumably lost when valine is introduced.
From the present study, it is clear that Ala86, Thr87
and especially Thr88 are important for Savinase in￾hibition, and all are conserved in the wheat inhibitor,
while only Ala86 and Thr88 are conserved in the rice
inhibitor.23,24 The variation in loop sequence in
subtilisin inhibitors suggests that the side chains
play a major role in constraining the loops in the right
conformation necessary for subtilisin inhibition.
Sequence conservation of protease inhibiting
loops
Within inhibitor families, there is high sequence
variability in the interacting loops, with some clear
amino acid preferences. The Kunitz-P-type inhibitors
from soybean have a conserved proline at the P3
position, whereas in the barley, wheat and rice inhi￾bitors, there is a threonine.9 The present study shows
that threonine is crucial for BASI inhibition of Savi￾nase. In canonical inhibitors, the side chain of the P3
residue is not involved in the interface with the
enzyme, as it points away from the enzyme and to￾wards the solvent or the inhibitor itself.6 In contrast,
in the BASI–Savinase complex, the side chain of
Thr88 forms hydrogen bonds with the backbones of
Cys90 and Leu91, leading to stabilisation of the P5–
P2 loop. When the polar OH moiety of Thr88 is
replaced by a hydrophobic CH3 (T88V), the loop is
no longer restrained in the conformation necessary
for binding, and the inhibitory power is lost.
Proteinase K inhibition by cereal Kunitz-P-type
inhibitors
A low-resolution structure of the WASI, which
shares 92% sequence identity with BASI, has been
solved in complex with proteinase K.36 Given the
high sequence identity between BASI and WASI, the
ability of BASI to inhibit proteinase K was tested, and
it was observed that BASI inhibits proteinase K to the
same extent as it inhibits Savinase (data not shown).
A model of the complex between BASI and pro￾teinase K was generated by superposing proteinase
K [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1OYO] onto Savinase
in complex with BASI (the coordinates for the pro￾teinase K–WASI complex are not available). Al￾though proteinase K and Savinase share only 37%
sequence identity, the region around the active site
superposes well and the enzyme–inhibitor interface,
including the hydrogen bonding pattern, is con￾served. The only clash in the interface is seen bet￾ween the side chain of proteinase K Tyr104 and BASI
Tyr87. However, a significant side chain rearrange￾ment has been reported in the proteinase K complex
with WASI, leading to stacking of proteinase K
Tyr104 and WASI Tyr86 (equivalent to BASI Tyr87),
thereby contributing to the tight binding in this
complex.36 It is reasonable to assume that the same
side chain rearrangement would occur in a protei￾nase K complex with BASI.
Conclusions
In this study, the first cereal Kunitz-P-type inhi￾bitor in complex with a subtilisin has been deter￾mined. BASI inhibits subtilisin in a novel way, as the
interacting loop only includes the P4–P2 residues,
while the interacting loop of inhibitors from other
families consists of the P4–P2′ residues. The inter￾acting loop is pulled away from the active serine by a
disulfide bridge between Cys90 and Cys43, prevent￾ing cleavage of the inhibitor. BASI also inhibits pro￾teinase K, and it is reasonable to assume that the
same residues are involved in the interface, based on
superposition of Savinase and proteinase K. The roles
of the loop residues have been analysed by mutating
them one by one. All seven variants showed in￾creased Ki values, ranging from a few times to more
than 120 times. The P3 residue (Thr88) is shown to be
crucial for the inhibition, as it stabilises the conforma￾tion of the interacting loop, through hydrogen bon￾ding and intramolecular interactions with the BASI
backbone.

Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisin 687Protein expression, purification and characterisation
Wild-type BASI and all seven variants were expressed as
reported previously.37 Mutation did not alter the expres￾sion levels, indicating proper global folding of the proteins.
Molecular size and purity were verified by SDS-PAGE and
mass spectroscopy (not shown). BASI was precipitated
from the supernatant by adding solid ammonium sulfate
[(NH4)2SO4] to a final concentration of 3.2 M, and the so￾lution was stirred for 30 min. The precipitate was collected
by centrifugation (20,000g, 20 min) and dissolved in a
minimal volume of buffer A (20 mM CH3COOH/NaOH,
pH 5.0). The dissolved BASI was transferred to buffer A by
gel filtration (desalting) on a G25 Sephadex column. The
desalted BASI solution was slightly turbid, and this tur￾bidity was removed by 0.45-μm filtration. The filtrate was
applied to a HighLoad SP-Sepharose column equilibrated
in buffer A. After washing with buffer A, the column was
eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0→0.5 M) in buffer A
over 10 column volumes. Fractions from the column with
BASI were pooled and diluted 10 times with deionised
water to reduce the conductivity. The diluted BASI pool
was applied to a SOURCE S column equilibrated in buffer
A. After washing with buffer A, the column was eluted
with a linear NaCl gradient (0→0.5 M) in buffer A over 10
column volumes. BASI-containing fractions from the
column were analysed by SDS-PAGE, and pure fractions
were pooled. G25 Sephadex, HighLoad SP-Sepharose and
SOURCE S are column materials from GE Healthcare.
Crystallisation
Savinase was purified by affinity chromatography and
ion-exchange chromatography. BASI and Savinase were
mixed with a small molar excess of BASI. The mixture was
dialysed overnight in 10 mM Mes (4-morpholineethane￾sulfonic acid) and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 6.0, and concentrated
by centrifugation in an Amicon Ultra-15 device (with a
cutoff of 5000 Da, Millipore Corporation). The BASI–Savi￾nase complex was concentrated to 23 mg ml−1 in 10 mM
Mes buffer, pH 6.0, and 2 mM CaCl2. Crystallisation
screening was conducted using sitting-drop vapour diffu￾sion with Crystal Screen 1, Crystal Screen 2, Index Screen
(all from Hampton Research) and PACT Screen (Molecular
Dimensions Limited). Small single crystals were obtained
in index screen condition A9 (0.1 M Bis–Tris, pH 5.5, and
3 M NaCl). Subsequently, hanging-drop vapour diffusion
was applied to optimise those conditions that had led to
the most promising results, as well as exploring a range of
different pH levels and types and concentrations of
precipitant. Drops containing 1 μl of the protein and 1 μl
of reservoir solution were equilibrated against 500 μl of
reservoir solution at 18 °C. Crystals suitable for X-ray
diffraction were obtained from 0.1 M sodium acetate
buffer, pH 5.6, and 4 M NaCl in the form of bipyramids of
average dimensions 0.4 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.3 mm, which
appeared after 5–10 days.
Data collection and processing
Prior to data collection, crystals were mounted in nylon
CryoLoops (Hampton Research) and vitrified. No cryo￾protectant was required due to the high concentration of
NaCl in the mother liquor. Data were collected at ESRF
ID23-1 at 100 K with an ADSC Q315 detector. The crystals
diffracted to a resolution of 1.85 Å and belong to the
primitive tetragonal space group P41212, with unit cell
parameters a=b= 100.64 Å and c= 216.24 Å. There are two
molecules of the BASI–Savinase complex per asymmetric
unit giving a Matthews coefficient39 of 2.77 Å3
/Da, corres￾ponding to a solvent content of ∼56%. The intensity data
were indexed, integrated and scaled using the HKL2000
package with DENZO and SCALEPACK40 (Table 3).
Structure solution and refinement
The structure was solved by molecular replacement
using the program PHASER,41 with the wild-type Savinase
(PDB ID 1SVN) and BASI (PDB ID 1AVA) molecules as
independent components in the rotation and translation
parameter search. Both complexes of BASI–Savinase were
clearly placed in the asymmetric unit, and the R-factors
after the first 10 cycles of maximum-likelihood refinement
by REFMAC542 were 25.8% and 33.6% for Rcryst and Rfree,
respectively.
The model was completed by visual inspection of the
2Fo−Fc and Fo−Fc electron density maps using the prog￾ram Coot.43 Non-crystallographic symmetry averaging
was used to improve the map, and non-crystallographic
symmetry restraints were applied during the first steps of
refinement. The R-factors converged to 23.3% and 28.1%
for Rcryst and Rfree, respectively.
At this stage, a number of water molecules were added
to the model using Coot. The data were at first refined to
2 Å. In the final part of the refinement, the data set was
reprocessed to 1.85 Å, but with the Rfree test set of reflec￾tions imported from the original 2-Å data set. This im￾proved the electron density maps and helped rebuild the
flexible loops. Following several steps of refinement,
combined with visual checking of the model, Rcryst and
Rfree dropped to 20.2% and 23.9%, respectively. The final
model contains 6620 non-hydrogen protein atoms and 574
water molecules. Electron density peaks greater than the

Interface calculations
The interface area of the complex between Savinase and
BASI was obtained by evaluating the solvent-accessible
area of A12 of the complex and then the solvent-accessible
areas of A1 and A2, the surface areas of dissociated Savinase
and BASI, respectively, and then computing B= (A1+A2−
A12). The surfaces were computed analytically using the
Lee and Richards algorithm28 and a probe radius of 1.4 Å.
Inhibition of Savinase and proteinase K
BASI wild type, F84V, R85G, A86T, Y87I, Y87A, T88V
and T89A (seven concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 nM)
were preincubated with Savinase or proteinase K (40 nM)
for 10 min at room temperature in 50 mM glycine, pH 9.8,
150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM CaCl and 0.01% Triton X-100. N-Suc￾AAPF-pNA (Sigma S 7388) was added (five concentrations
ranging from 0.16 to 6.4 mM, in 250 μl). Changes in ab￾sorbance at 405 nM were measured and converted into
initial rates of reaction. Km, Vmax and Ki were calculated for
all BASI variants by non-linear regression; competitive in￾hibition was calculated using GraphPad prism, version
5.01 (GraphPad Software).
