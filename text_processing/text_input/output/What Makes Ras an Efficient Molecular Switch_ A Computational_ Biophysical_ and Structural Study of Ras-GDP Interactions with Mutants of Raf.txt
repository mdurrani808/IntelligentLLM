Ras is a small GTP-binding protein that is an essential molecular switch
for a wide variety of signaling pathways including the control of cell
proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. In the GTP-bound
state, Ras can interact with its effectors, triggering various signaling
cascades in the cell. In the GDP-bound state, Ras looses its ability to bind
to known effectors. The interaction of the GTP-bound Ras (RasGTP) with
its effectors has been studied intensively. However, very little is known
about the much weaker interaction between the GDP-bound Ras (RasGDP)
and Ras effectors. We investigated the factors underlying the nucleotide￾dependent differences in Ras interactions with one of its effectors, Raf
kinase. Using computational protein design, we generated mutants of the
Ras-binding domain of Raf kinase (Raf) that stabilize the complex with
RasGDP. Most of our designed mutations narrow the gap between the
affinity of Raf for RasGTP and RasGDP, producing the desired shift in
binding specificity towards RasGDP. A combination of our best designed
mutation, N71R, with another mutation, A85K, yielded a Raf mutant with
a 100-fold improvement in affinity towards RasGDP. The Raf A85K and
Raf N71R/A85K mutants were used to obtain the first high-resolution
structures of RasGDP bound to its effector. Surprisingly, these structures
reveal that the loop on Ras previously termed the switch I region in the
RasGDP·Raf mutant complex is found in a conformation similar to that of
RasGTP and not RasGDP. Moreover, the structures indicate an increased
mobility of the switch I region. This greater flexibility compared to the
same loop in RasGTP is likely to explain the natural low affinity of Raf
and other Ras effectors to RasGDP. Our findings demonstrate that an
accurate balance between a rigid, high-affinity conformation and
conformational flexibility is required to create an efficient and stringent
molecular switch.

Introduction
Within the superfamily of small GTP-binding
proteins, Ras appears to be the “master regulator”
of such central processes as cell cycle progression,
cell division, and apoptosis.1,2 Ras cycles between
an active, GTP-bound state (RasGTP) and an inactive,
GDP-bound state (RasGDP). The inactive, GDP￾bound Ras is activated by the GDP/GTP nucleotide
exchange that is catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide
exchange factors. The conversion to the inactive Ras

GTPase-activating proteins.3,4 The GTP-bound Ras
triggers a variety of signaling cascades through
interactions with its multiple effectors, including Raf
protein kinase,5,6 RalGDS,7 PI3K8–10 and Nore.11,12
All known Ras effectors share a common domain,
the Ras-binding domain (RBD), which interacts with
Ras in a nucleotide-dependent manner. In the GTP￾bound state, Ras can bind to various RBDs13,14 with
dissociation constants (Kd) in the range 0.1–3 μM. In
the GDP-bound state, the affinity of Ras to RBDs is
~1000-fold reduced with the Kd values in the upper
micromolar range.15
Several structures of various RBDs in complex
with Ras and its homologues in the GTP-bound
state have been solved, providing a detailed view of
the RasGTP–effector interaction. Despite the very
low level of sequence identity, all RBDs share a
common ubiquitin fold16 and bind to the same
epitope on Ras. Moreover, all Ras–RBD complexes
are formed through an intermolecular antiparallel
β-sheet between β1 and β2 of the RBD and β2 and
β3 of Ras (Fig. 1a and b).14,17–19 All structurally
characterized RBDs exhibit high charge comple￾mentarity to Ras, suggesting that electrostatic
interactions are very important for binding.16,20
While the Ras binding interface is mainly negatively
charged, the binding interface of the RBDs is
positively charged with charge-complementary
residues positioned in the β1, β2 and α1 secondary
structure elements.14,16–19,21,22
Comparison of high-resolution structures of RasGTP
(alone and in complex with effectors) and RasGDP
reveals a high level of structural similarity
between the two nucleotide-dependent states of
Ras.14,17–19,21–24 The relatively small differences
between RasGTP and RasGDP are confined to two
regions of about 10 amino acids each: a loop that
contacts the effector proteins directly (switch I) and
a loop and a helix that are close to the effector
binding site (switch II).23,24 Both of these regions
show indications of increased mobility in the X-ray
and NMR structures of the unbound RasGDP
compared to that of RasGTP.

What Makes Ras an Efficient Molecular Switch? 423conformation of switch I and switch II in the GTP￾bound state could be explained by the “loaded spring
mechanism”.
26 According to this mechanism, the γ￾phosphate oxygens of GTP form two hydrogen
bonds to the main chain NH groups of the invariant
Thr35 and Gly60 on Ras. Upon release of the
phosphate these hydrogen bonds are broken and
the two switch regions relax into the GDP-specific
conformation. Although the loaded spring mecha￾nism was proposed some time ago, it is largely
unclear how the observed small conformational
changes in Ras are translated into very significant
changes in protein binding affinity to Ras effectors
upon GTP hydrolysis. To address this question, we
chose to study the interaction between Ras and the
RBD of its effector Raf kinase (Raf) that in nature
regulates the Ras/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In
this work, we attempted to diminish the naturally
manifold preference of Ras effectors for RasGTP by
designing Raf mutants with improved binding
affinity to RasGDP and a shift of specificity in favor
of this Ras state.
Raf mutants were generated using computational
protein design, a technique that has been repeatedly
applied to design of protein–protein interactions in
recent years. In such an approach, the amino acid
sequence of one or both interacting proteins is
redesigned to stabilize the protein–protein complex.28
Typically, the backbone conformation of the protein–
protein complex is kept fixed, while the amino acid
side chains in one or both proteins are repacked using
an atomic-level energy function.29 Using the compu￾tational design approach it has been possible to
substantially modify protein binding specificity,30-36
to convert a homodimer into a heterodimer37 and to
construct chimeric proteins with novel DNA-binding
properties.38 More importantly for this study, it has
been demonstrated that ligand binding affinity can be
increased by computationally stabilizing the interact￾ing protein in the ligand-bound conformation.39,40 In
this work, we computationally redesigned the bind￾ing interface on Raf to optimize its interactions with
the inactive Ras state, RasGDP.
Results
Computational design of the Raf RBD with
increased affinity to RasGDP
To design a Ras effector with increased affinity
and, as an ultimate goal, specificity for RasGDP, a
starting structure of the RasGDP·effector complex is
required. However, no high-resolution structure of
RasGDP or any homologue bound to an effector
protein was available when we initiated this study.
Hence, we generated a model for such a structure
using the available structures of RasGDP alone,23 and
of the complex between the effector Raf and the Ras
homologue Rap1A bound to GppNHp, termed here
the RapsGTP·Raf complex.19 The composition of this
complex needs some explanation: Rap1A is a close
relative of Ras (57% sequence identity) and harbors
almost the same effector binding interface as Ras.
The two residues in Rap1A that are different were
mutated to the corresponding Ras residues, i.e.
E30D/K31E, and therefore this Rap double mutant
is termed Raps. It is indistinguishable from Ras in
the binding interface region and has been demon￾strated to exhibit very similar binding affinities to
several Ras effectors.19 Further, the complex con￾tains the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GppNHp,
which we refer to as GTP’ here for the sake of
convenience. Finally, Raf in this complex is not the
full-length protein but rather the Ras binding
domain (RBD), which comprises 81 amino acids
and has been used frequently in biochemical and
structural studies of the Ras–Raf interaction.
Starting from the RapsGTP’
·Raf complex, we
replaced RapsGTP’ with the structure of RasGDP
using the structural superposition capabilities of the
Chimera program.41 The structure of the RasGDP·Raf
complex was subsequently minimized to remove
steric clashes resulting from the simple structural
superposition. This model was used as an input for
our design calculations in attempt to generate a Raf
mutant with increased affinity for RasGDP. In these
calculations, the binding interface residues on Raf
were optimized using all amino acids except Pro,
Cys and Gly as possible candidates. At the same
time, the binding interface residues on RasGDP were
allowed to change their side chain conformation in
order to accommodate the introduced mutations.
The resulting Raf mutant optimized for binding to
RasGDP contained six mutations in the Raf binding
interface: F61W, R67L, V69E, N71R, K84R and V88I
(Fig. 1c and d). Among these mutations, four single
mutations were predicted to improve the intermo￾lecular interactions between Raf and RasGDP: R67L,
N71R, K84R and V88I, with the N71R mutation
resulting in the largest improvement (Table 1). The

The energies are reported relative to corresponding values
calculated for WT Raf. a ΔΔEintra is the sum of differences in intramolecular energy
within the Raf and the Ras(Raps) molecules due to a mutation in
Raf. These values are different for the GDP and the GTP’ form of
Ras due to differences in side chain conformations predicted for
each nucleotide-dependent state. b These mutations were predicted to shift specificity towards
the RapsGTP' state according to improvement in ΔΔEinter for
RasGDP relative to RapsGTP'.

The red line corresponds to no shift in specificity.
What Makes Ras an Efficient Molecular Switch? 425other two mutations, F61W and V69E, were
predicted to stabilize Raf-RBD on its own. In our
computational procedure we did not directly con￾sider Raf interactions with RasGTP’
. However, from
our previous studies, we expected that Raf opti￾mized for binding to RasGDP would exhibit de￾creased affinity to RasGTP’ because these two
nucleotide-dependent Ras states are structurally
distinguishable.34–36 Indeed, all the designed muta￾tions, except V69E, were predicted to shift the
binding specificity in favor of RasGDP (Table 1).
Measurement of binding between designed Raf
mutants and RasGDP and RasGTP’
We experimentally constructed the designed
mutant Raf F61W/R67L/V69E/N71R/K84R/V88I
containing all six mutations (termed Raf 6x) as well
as several mutants with a subset of the designed
mutations. We used the guanine nucleotide dissoci￾ation inhibitor (GDI) assay to determine dissociation
constants (Kd values) of these mutants for RasGDP
and RasGTP’
.
15 This assay takes advantage of the fact
that effector binding inhibits the intrinsic nucleotide
dissociation from Ras in a concentration-dependent
manner,15,42 and allows us to measure conveniently
Kd values that in the present study span almost four
orders of magnitude. The time course of the
dissociation of the fluorescent analogues of non￾hydrolyzable GTP’ and GDP (mantGppNHp and
mantGDP) from Ras was monitored in the presence
of various concentrations of Raf. The observed rate
constants were used to obtain the Kd values of Raf
interactions with RasGTP’ and RasGDP as described
(Fig. 2a and b).42,43 The effect of the designed
mutations on Raf binding to RasGTP’ and RasGDP
was analyzed by computing the difference between
the free energy of binding for the particular Raf
variant to either RasGTP’ or RasGDP (ΔΔGGTP’ and
ΔΔGGDP, respectively). Among the single mutants
of Raf tested, F61W and V88I exhibited decreased
affinities to both RasGTP’
and RasGDP corresponding
to + 0.9 and + 3.5 kJ/mol increase in ΔΔGGDP and
+ 2.6 and + 2.4 kJ/mol increase in ΔΔGGTP’
, respec￾tively (Fig. 2c; Table 2). The third single mutant
tested, N71R, exhibited a substantial increase in
affinity to RasGDP (ΔΔGGDP=–5.2 kJ/mol) and a
smaller increase in affinity to RasGTP’ (ΔΔGGTP’
=
–2.8 kJ/mol). Not surprisingly, the combination of
these mutations led to smaller changes relative to
N71R: The behavior of the double mutant Raf N71R/
F61W was similar to that of N71R, exhibiting
enhanced binding to both RasGDP and RasGTP’
(ΔΔGGDP=–3.2 kJ/mol; ΔΔGGTP’
=–1.4 kJ/mol).
The triple and quadruple mutants F61W/N71R/
V88I and F61W/R67L/N71R/V88I demonstrated a
virtually unchanged affinity to RasGDP and reduced
affinity to RasGTP’ (ΔΔGGTP’=+ 1.6 and + 2.6 kJ/mol,
respectively). Another quadruple mutant, F61W/
V69E/N71R/V88I, exhibited a considerable weak￾ening in binding to both RasGTP’ and RasGDP
(ΔΔGGDP=+ 8.8 kJ/mol; ΔΔGGTP’
=+ 7.9 kJ/mol).
The designed Raf mutant with all six predicted
mutations (Raf 6x) exhibited substantial destabiliza￾tion for both RasGTP’ and RasGDP complexes with a
more pronounced destabilizing effect for the RasGTP’
complex (ΔΔGGDP= + 9.8 kJ/mol; ΔΔGGTP’
= + 15.7
kJ/mol). While the affinity of several of the designed
Raf mutants towards Ras was decreased, this effect
was less pronounced for RasGDP in six out of eight
mutants tested, meaning binding specificity was
shifted in favor of RasGDP (Fig. 2d). The largest
change of specificity (10-fold) was observed for Raf
6x. However, this came at the cost of a loss in binding
affinity to both of the Ras states. The single Raf
mutant N71R demonstrated the best (seven-fold)
improvement in binding affinity to RasGDP with a
modest (~2.5-fold) change in binding specificity.
Construction of the RasGDP superbinder
To obtain a Raf mutant with higher than natural
affinity to RasGDP and with a substantial shift of
binding specificity towards this Ras state, we
combined our best designed mutation, N71R, with
mutation A85K, which was first shown by Fridman
and colleagues to increase Raf affinity to RasGTP’
.
44,45
More recently, Raf A85K was demonstrated to
enhance Raf affinity to RasGDP to an even larger extent
(ΔΔGGDP=–8.5 kJ/mol; ΔΔGGTP’
=–4.8 kJ/mol)

426 What Makes Ras an Efficient Molecular Switch?(Fig. 2 c; Table 2).46 Hence, if the two selected
mutations act in an additive manner, they should
markedly increase Raf binding affinity for RasGDP.
Indeed, simultaneous introduction of the N71R and
the A85K mutations into Raf (Raf N71R/A85K)
resulted in a strongly enhanced binding free energy
for RasGDP (ΔΔGGDP=–12 kJ/mol) corresponding to
a Kd value of 0.4 μM (Table 2). This value is almost as
low as that for the interaction between wild type
(WT) Raf and RasGTP’
.
13 At the same time, Raf N71R/
A85K stabilized the RasGTP’
·Raf complex by –5.6 kJ/
mol with a Kd value of 0.015 μM (Fig. 2c; Table 2).
Thus, we obtained a double mutant of Raf with a
~100-fold increased affinity for the natively inactive
Ras state, RasGDP, and a ~12-fold shift of binding
specificity towards this state compared to the native
Ras–Raf interaction (Fig. 2d).
Structural characterization of the Raf–RasGDP
interactions
To better understand the improved interaction
and the changes in relative affinities (RasGDP versus
RasGTP’
) of Raf mutants at the molecular level, we
solved the structures of Raf A85K bound to RasGDP
and of Raf N71R/A85K bound to RapsGDP at 2.2 Å
and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively (Table 3). Both
structures were solved using the molecular replace￾ment procedure with the structure of the RapsGTP’
·Raf
complex (PDB 1gua) as a starting point. The RasGDP·Raf
A85K and the RapsGDP·Raf N71R/A85K complexes
exhibit the same overall structure observed for
RapsGTP·Raf with an overall Cα rmsd of 0.93 Å for
the RapsGDP·Raf N71R/A85K complex and 1.02 Å
for the RasGDP·Raf A85K complex, respectively
(Fig. 3a and b). The individual domains display even
lower rmsd values with respect to the RapsGTP’
·Raf
complex corresponding to 0.84 Å (167 Cα atoms
of Raps) and 0.44 Å (78 Cα atoms of Raf) for the
RapsGDP·Raf N71R/A85K complex and 0.82 Å (165
Cα atoms of Ras) and 0.44 Å (78 Cα atoms of Raf)
for the RasGDP·Raf A85K complex, respectively. A
slight shift in the relative orientation of the Raf binding
domain relative to the Raps domain is observed
for the complexes reported here compared to the
RapsGTP’
·Raf complex (Fig. 3a).
Surprisingly, the switch I region of Raps/RasGDP in
complex with the two Raf mutants exhibit conforma￾tions very similar to that of the RapsGTP’
·Raf
complex rather than to that observed for the
unbound RasGDP 23 (Fig. 3c). As expected, the switch
II region of Ras/Raps, which is not involved in Raf
binding, differs the most among the three structures.
Previous NMR and X-ray investigations revealed
considerable flexibility of switch I and switch II
regions of Ras in the GDP-bound state.25,26 Hence,
we investigated the flexibility of the switch I region
by comparing the B-factors exhibited by the back￾bone atoms in the switch I region of Ras (residues
24–46) in the X-ray structures of three complexes:
RapsGTP’
·Raf, RapsGDP·Raf N71R/A85K, and
RasGDP·Raf A85K (Fig. 3d–f). The absolute values
for the B-factors increase in the order: GTP-structure,
double mutant complex, single mutant complex,
corresponding to the decreasing overall packing
order of the crystals. This results in the decreasing

428 What Makes Ras an Efficient Molecular Switch?quality of the diffraction data and indicates a higher
mobility of the two domains relative to each other in
the GDP forms. An analysis of the relative B-factors
of the switch I region relative to the remainder of
the Raps/Ras domain shows the same trend: In
RapsGTP’
·Raf, residues 30–40 have even lower
temperature factors than the other residues, consis￾tent with the hypothesis that a fixation of the effector
loop leads to a high affinity to Raf that is bound via
this loop (Fig. 3d and h). In contrast, the switch I
region of the double mutant complex shows slightly
higher B-factors than the remainder of the Raps
domain (Fig. 3e and h), and in the RasGDP·Raf A85K
complex, this effect is even more pronounced, similar
to unbound RasGDP (Fig. 3f and h). Correspondingly,
the RasGDP·Raf A85K complex has the lowest affinity
among the three complexes.
The main difference in intermolecular interactions
between complexes of RapsGTP’
·Raf and RasGDP·Raf
A85K is the formation of two additional ionic
contacts between Lys85 on Raf and Asp38 and
Asp33 on RasGDP in the latter complex (Fig. 4a). The
distances between Lys85 and Asp38 and Asp33 are
3.61 Å and 4.20 Å, respectively, somewhat larger
than those expected for H-bond interactions or salt
bridges. However, the charge–charge interaction is
most likely to contribute to the increased affinity of
Raf to RasGDP. In the RapsGDP·Raf N71R/A85K
mutant, Arg71 forms an additional intermolecular
salt bridge with Asp33 with a distance of 2.24 Å
(Fig. 4b). In addition, the side chain of Arg 71
increases the buried surface area by about 10%,
which might also contribute to the increased affinity
compared to the single mutant Raf A85K. A second
contribution might be the optimized position of
Lys85 due to a slight movement of the Raf domain
relative to the Ras domain: the distances from this
residue to Asp38 and Asp33 on Raps are now
reduced to 2.93 Å and 3.49 Å, respectively. In
summary, the increased number of interactions
between the Raf N71R/A85K and Raps appear to
stabilize the switch I region even more than in the
single mutant.
Binding specificity of the Raf mutants to Ras
mutants
To investigate further whether the flexibility of the
switch I region is responsible for the low affinity of
Raf to Ras,GDP we utilized two previously studied
Ras mutants: Ras T35A and Ras Y32C/C118S (1-166).
The T35A mutant has been demonstrated to induce
the highly flexible conformation of the Ras switch I
region even in the GTP’-bound state.47 Ras Y32C/
C118S (1-166)16 was chosen because Tyr32 under￾goes a substantial conformational change upon GTP
hydrolysis, assuming a conformation that might
prevent effector binding to RasGDP (Fig. 3c). Hence,
its mutation to the smaller Cys could further improve
binding between the Raf mutants and RasGDP. These
two Ras mutants were investigated for their ability to
bind to Raf WT, Raf N71R, Raf A85K, and the double
mutant Raf N71R/A85K.
We first compared the Raf binding specificity
towards RasGDP (relative to RasGTP’
) by computing
the ratio between the dissociation constants of a Raf
mutant for RasGDP and for RasGTP’
(Fig. 5a; Table 4).
This specificity is about 350 for the native Raf–Ras
interaction. This value is decreased to 26 for the
interaction of Ras T35A with Raf WT, meaning that
the binding affinity gap for the two Ras nucleotide￾dependent states is now considerably reduced. The
specificity is further decreased to a value of ~5 for
Ras T35A interactions with the mutants Raf N71R,
Raf A85K and Raf N71R/A85K. The binding
specificity of Raf WT for Ras Y32C/C118S (1-166)
is 500, slightly higher than that measured for the
native Ras–Raf interactions, indicating that intro￾duction of Y32C mutations into Ras increases the
gap in the effector preference for the GTP’-bound
form of Ras, in contrast to our expectation. The
binding specificity of the Raf N71R, Raf A85K and

What Makes Ras an Efficient Molecular Switch? 429Raf N71R/A85K towards Ras Y32C/C118S (1-166)
was changed to values varying from 200 to 400,
similar to those of the native Ras–Raf interaction. In
contrast to our previous results, where introduction
of each single mutation into Raf brought a progres￾sive change in binding specificity to RasGDP, no such
additive effects were seen here for Raf N71R/A85K
(Fig. 5b; Table 4).
Discussion
Binding affinity and specificity of the
computationally designed Raf mutants
Accurate prediction of single affinity-enhancing
mutations remains a demanding task for protein
design and the prediction of multiple mutations at
the binding interface presents an even harder
challenge.48,49 The difficulty in our case is augment￾ed by the absence of the X-ray structure for the
RasGDP·Raf WT complex; our model for such a
structure is bound to introduce additional uncer￾tainties into the design procedure. We expected that
some of our designed mutations would result in
reduced binding of Raf to RasGDP in contrary to our
predictions. However, thorough comparison of our
predictions and experimental changes in binding
free energies revealed that while we made some
mistakes in particular cases, we captured the
general trend of changes in free energy of binding
(compare ΔΔEinter for RasGDP/GTP’ in Table 1 and
ΔΔGGDP/GTP’ in Table 2). The single mutant Raf
N71R that is predicted by us to improve intermo￾lecular energy to the highest extent indeed exhibits
the largest enhancement in binding affinity to
RasGDP. The mutation V69E that is predicted by us
to exhibit large unfavorable intermolecular energy
results in a considerable decrease in affinity to
RasGDP (compare ΔΔEinter for RasGDP in Table 1 and
the difference in ΔΔGGDP for Raf F61W/V69E/
N71R/V88I and Raf F61W/N71R/V88I in Table 2).
In fact, while we tend to over-predict stabilizing
effects, correlation between experimental free
energies of binding and the predicted changes
in the intermolecular energy is very high (Sup￾plementary Data Fig. S1). In addition, we
correctly predict the change in binding specificity
for five out of six designed mutations (Tables 1
and 2).
Interestingly, the binding specificity shift for most
of the designed Raf mutants comes mostly through
destabilization of the unwanted complex with
RasGTP’
, rather than stabilization of the desired
complex with RasGDP. Our present results show a
similar trend to that observed in our earlier work for
other systems in which calmodulin–effector interac￾tions were redesigned.34–36 The highest shift in
binding specificity among the designed Raf mutants
in the present work is demonstrated by Raf 6x, the
mutant with the largest number of mutations,
consistent with an incremental change of specificity
with each mutation. The specificity shift for Raf 6x is
much smaller compared to that observed in our
earlier work for other systems.35,36 The relatively

430 What Makes Ras an Efficient Molecular Switch?modest change in binding specificity observed here
could be explained by very similar structures of
RasGTP’
and RasGDP that convey analogous intermo￾lecular interactions to Raf. The similarity is even
larger than we expected when constructing our
model for the RasGDP·Raf complex, considering
that the conformation of the switch I region in
RapsGDP·Raf N71R/A85K is identical with that of
RasGTP’
in the structure of the RapsGTP’
·Raf complex.
Thus, it is difficult to obtain Raf mutants with
increased affinity to only one nucleotide-dependent
Ras state because the intermolecular interactions of
the desired state (RasGDP·Raf) and the undesired
states (RasGTP’
·Raf) are quite similar. Nevertheless,
future designs of Raf mutants with enhanced
specificity towards RasGDP would be greatly facili￾tated by using the newly solved structure of the
RasGDP·Raf N71R/A85K complex as a starting point.
The consequences of high affinity binding of Raf
to RasGDP
The computational design approach helped us to
identify a single Raf mutant (Raf N71R) with
substantially increased binding affinity to RasGDP.
Another mutant, Raf A85K, with similar properties
was identified earlier. Introduction of the single
mutation A85K and two mutations N71R/A85K
into Raf increased its affinity to RasGDP from 46 μM
to 1.7 μM and 0.44 μM, respectively. The Kd of the
Raf N71R/A85K is now similar to that observed for
the native interaction between Raf and RasGTP’
. The
preference of this mutant for the RasGTP’ over the
RasGDP state is now only 29, and not 350 as for the
native Ras–Raf interactions.
The substantial increase in affinity for this protein–
protein complex enabled us to initiate structural
studies of the RasGDP–Raf interactions and to
obtain the first structure of RasGDP interacting with
its effector. Such studies were not possible for the
RasGDP·Raf WT complex. Interestingly, the two
reported crystal structures of RaspsGDP/RasGDP·Raf
mutant complexes suggest that Raf (and possibly
other Ras effectors) could bind to the natively inactive
Ras state, RasGDP, only if Ras assumes a conformation
similar to that of RasGTP. These findings are in line
with previous observations where the 31P-NMR
titration experiments suggested stabilization of the
GTP-like conformation upon binding of Raf A85K to
RasGDP.
46 The present finding also helps to explain our
earlier results that show activation of the Ras/MEK/
ERK signaling cascade in vivo through the RasGDP·Raf
A85K interaction.46 This observation shows that
activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK signaling cascade is
defined by the affinity between Ras and Raf and not by
the type of nucleotide bound. Interestingly, the two
mutations identified by us to increase Raf binding to
RasGDP substitute neutral residues by positively
charged residues, optimizing the electrostatic interac￾tions between the two proteins. Nature seems to
disregard such positively charged residues from these
positions on Raf as seen by the evolutionary profile of
Raf (Supplementary Data Fig. S2).50,51 Avoidance of
such residues in Raf is needed to ensure the proper
molecular switching of the Ras/MEK/ERK signaling
cascade. The shift of Raf specificity in favor of RasGDP
would destroy the natural switch function of Ras in
this signaling pathway.
Flexibility of the switch I in RasGDP is responsible
for decreased affinity to effectors
Discovery of Raf mutants with high affinity to
RasGDP allowed us to investigate coupling between
subtle conformational changes in Ras upon GTP
hydrolysis and changes in Ras binding affinities to
its effectors. Careful analysis of the structures of
RasGDP·Raf A85K and RapsGDP·Raf N71R/A85K
complexes revealed that the flexibility of the switch I
region of Raps/Ras is significantly increased in the
GDP-bound state compared to GTP’-bound state.
This was more pronounced in the complex of RasGDP
and Raf A85K, for which the measured binding
affinity was relatively weak. Thus, the results suggest
that the mutation A85K in the RafRBD can surmount
the mobility of the switch I region in the GDP-bound
form to allow formation of a complex stable enough
for crystallization, but with a less rigidly attached Raf
domain. The double mutation N71R/A85K stabilizes
the interaction further, so that the inherent flexibility
of the effector loop is reduced considerably in the Raf
N71R/A85K complex in comparison to the RasGDP–
Raf A85K complex. Those results strongly support
the notion that the flexibility of the switch I region in
the GDP-bound form of the Ras domain causes the
weakening of binding to Raf. This finding is further
supported by our biochemical analysis of the Ras
T35A mutant, which exhibits a highly dynamic
switch I region even in the GTP’-bound state. This
highly dynamic nature of the switch I region is
responsible for the fact that the affinity of Raf to Ras
T35A in the two nucleotide-dependent states were
very similar: preference of Raf WT for RasGTP’
T35A
over RasGDP T35A is already strongly reduced and
even more for the Raf mutants that further increase
the flexibility of the switch I region on Ras (Raf A85K
and Raf N71R/A85K).
In conclusion, flexibility of the switch I region is
the crucial factor for determining the Raf specificity
for RasGTP’
/RasGDP. In fact, it appears to be crucial
for the proper functioning of Ras considering the
number of effectors and regulating proteins such as
guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase
activating proteins binding to the same epitope on
the switch I region. In particular, the interaction of
Ras with its guanine nucleotide exchange factor,
Sos, induces a large movement of the switch I
region away from the nucleotide-binding pocket.52
Thus, the ability of Ras to function as an efficient
molecular switch requires it to mediate the high￾affinity, nucleotide-dependent interaction with its
effectors on one hand, and interaction with
regulatory proteins through conformational
changes in the switch I region, on the other hand.
These binding requirements could be accomplished
by Ras only if its switch I region is highly flexible,
What Makes Ras an Efficient Molecular Switch? 431moving from the conformation of the GDP-bound
state where it cannot interact tightly with Ras
effector to a GTP-bound conformation favorable for
effector interactions.
Materials and Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis
The introduction of single mutations into the Raf gene
was performed using Quick Change™ site-directed
mutagenesis (Stratagene) with the pGEX-2T vector har￾boring the insert coding for Raf (51-131) as the template. To
produce vectors for multiple Raf mutants, we introduced
each single mutation one after another. Introduction of all
mutations was verified by sequencing the genes.
Protein expression and purification
Ras, Raps, and Raf RBD variants were synthesized in
Escherichia coli and purified as described.18,19,53 The
nucleotide exchange with mantGppNHp (Jena Biosci￾ence), a non-hydrolyzable fluorescent analogue of GTP,
was done as described.42 The loading of Ras with the
fluorescent GDP analogue mantGDP (Jena Bioscicence)
was done using a fivefold molar excess of the nucleotide in
the presence of 10 mM EDTA. Both reactions were
performed at 4 °C overnight. After the reaction, the
nucleotide excess was removed using Zeba Spin Desalting
Columns™ (Pierce) equilibrated with buffer A containing
50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM
DTT. The nucleotide exchange was analyzed using
reverse-phase (RP) HPLC using a Merck Chromolith
C-18ec 4.6 mm × 10 cm column (Merck, Darmstadt) and
a mobile phase containing 10 mM tetrabutylammonium
bromide, 100 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 6.5, 1.25 % (v/v)
acetonitrile. The protein concentration was determined by
the Bradford method.54
Interaction measurements of Raf and RasGTP’
and RasGDP
Interaction measurements between RasGDP or RasGTP’
and Raf were performed with Ras proteins bound to
fluorescent nucleotide analogues of GDP and GTP’
(mantGDP and mantGppNHp) using the GDI assay in
buffer A as described.15,42,43,55 Briefly, 0.05 μM Ras loaded
with either mantGDP or mantGppNHp in the presence of
different concentrations of WT Raf and mutants was used,
respectively. The intrinsic nucleotide dissociation was
initiated by the addition of a 1000-fold molar excess of
GDP. The time-dependent fluorescence decrease, due to
mant–nucleotide dissociation was fit using a single
exponential decay and the observed rate constants were
plotted against the corresponding concentration of Raf.
Dissociation constants for the Raf interaction with RasGTP’
and RasGDP were extracted by fitting the curve to a
quadratic equation as described.42
Specificity analysis
The absolute specificity of Raf variants towards the two
nucleotide-dependent Ras states was calculated as the
ratio between the Raf dissociation constant for RasGDP
(Kd
Ras-GDP) and the Raf dissociation constant for RasGTP’

Crystallization and structure determination of Ras and
Rap1A-GDP with Raf
For preparation of the RasGDP·RafRBD A85K complex,
40 mg of Ras (1-166)GDP was incubated with 20 mg of
RafRBD A85K for 30 min on ice to allow complex
formation. The complex was purified on a Sephadex 75
column in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM
dithioerythritol and concentrated to 35 mg/ml. Crystals
were grown against a reservoir containing 1.3 M sodium
malonate pH 6.0, 0.1 M Mes pH 6.1, 4% (v/v) Betaine, 2%
(v/v) Sarcosine and 2% (w/v) N,N-dimethlyglycine.
Crystals were cryoprotected in 2.4 M sodium malonate
pH 6.9. Data were collected at beamline ID29 of ESRF at a
wavelength of 0.97935 Å and processed with XDS.56 The
spacegroup was H32 with one molecule in the asymmetric
unit (for details see Table 3) and the structure was solved to
2.15 Å resolution by molecular replacement using
PHASER57 with the Raps·RafRBD complex (PDB 1gua)
as search model. Refinement with REFMAC converged to
a final Rwork of 22.6% and an Rfree of 26.9% with good
geometries.57 The Ramachandran plot shows 88.2% of the
residues in the most favorable regions, 8.9% in the allowed
regions, and 3.0% in outlier regions. TLS refinement helped
to improve the electron density, but several regions are still
not well defined, especially the complete RafRBD domain
shows elevated B-factors and thus quite bad electron
density.
Preparation of the RapsGDP·RafRBD N71R/A85K complex
Before the complexation reaction of 20 mg of Rap1A
(1-167) E30D, K31E (Raps) GDP with 10 mg Raf N71R/
A85K, the Raps protein was incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with a 100-fold molar excess of GDP in the
presence of 10 mM EDTA to ensure that Raps was bound
to GDP. Raf N71R/A85K was added and the complex was
further purified by size-exclusion chromatography
(Superdex S75 26/60 column GE Healthcare). The
concentration of the complex was determined by the
Bradford method. A 1 μL portion of protein solution at a
concentration of 17 g/L was mixed with 1 μL of reservoir
solution containing 20% or 25% PEG 8000, Tris pH 7.2–7.6
or Hepes pH 7.5, with 10, 100 or 200 mM calcium acetate
and/or 100 mM ammonium sulfate. Crystals were
cryoprotected by adding PEG 400 to the mother liquor
to a final concentration of 20% (v/v) before flash-freezing
in liquid nitrogen.
Data were collected at beamline PX-II of the Swiss Light
Source (Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen Switzerland) at a
wavelength of 1.00472 Å and processed with XDS.56 The
spacegroup was determined as P212121 with one molecule
in the asymmetric unit (for details, see Table 3). The
432 What Makes Ras an Efficient Molecular Switch?structure was solved to 1.92 Å resolution by molecular
replacement using MOLREP57 with the Raps·RafRBD
complex (PDB 1gua) as search model. TLS refinement with
REFMAC57 converged to a final Rwork of 17.8% and an
Rfree of 21.7% with excellent geometries. The Ramachan￾dran plot showed 97.1% of the residues in most-favorable
regions, 2.9% in allowed regions, and none in outlier
regions.
Computational design
Starting from the structure of the RapsGTP’
·Raf complex
(PDB 1gua) we replaced RapsGTP’ with RasGDP from the
crystal structure (PDB 4q21) while Raf remained fixed. For
the superposition we used the Matchmaker model of the
Chimera program.41 The structure of RasGDP·Raf was then
subjected to minimization using the conjugate gradient
descent. The binding interface between RasGDP and Raf
was defined by selecting all the residues on both proteins
that are within 4 Å of the other binding partner. In
addition, the shell residues were defined as those within
4 Å of the interface residues. The binding interface on Raf
(positions 61, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 84 and 88) was redesigned
using all amino acids except Pro, Cys and Gly as possible
candidates. During the design calculations, the binding
interface positions on RasGDP and all shell residues were
allowed to change their conformations. Optimization of
the RasGDP·Raf complex and the design of the Raf mutants
were performed using the ORBIT software.58 The rotamer
library used for design was based on the backbone￾dependent library of Dunbrack and Karplus.59 A potential
energy function included terms for van der Waals,
electrostatic, hydrogen bonding interactions, and surface
area-based salvation was used to calculate side chain/side
chain and side chain/main chain pairwise interactions as
described.34–36 Calculated energies served as input for a
side chain selection procedure that used the Dead-End
Elimination theorem.60,61
We calculated the changes in energies due to each of the
designed mutation for the RapsGTP’ and RapsGDP interac￾tions using the PDB file 1GUA and our model of the
RapsGDP·Raf complex created as described above. The
reported intermolecular and intramolecular energies for
each of the mutation were calculated using the EANAL
module of ORBIT and are reported relative to the same
values for the WT Raf–Ras complex.
