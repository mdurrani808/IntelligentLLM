ABSTRACT: The Ras proteins play roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Aberrant signaling through
Ras-mediated pathways in tumor cells occurs as a result of several types of mutational damage, which most frequently
affects the amino acids G12, G13, and Q61. Recently, KRpep-2d was identified as a K-Ras(G12D) selective inhibitory 
peptide against the G12D mutant of K-Ras, which is a key member of the Ras protein family and an attractive cancer 
therapeutic target. In this study, the crystal structure of the human K-Ras(G12D) mutant was determined in complex 
with GDP and KRpep-2d at 1.25 Å resolution. This structure revealed that the peptide binds near Switch II and alloster￾ically blocks protein–protein interactions with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor. This discovery of a unique bind￾ing pocket provides valuable information that will facilitate the design of direct Ras inhibitors.
The Ras (rat sarcoma) proteins are small guanine nu￾cleotide-binding proteins that act as molecular switches
in signaling pathways associated with the regulation of
cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The Ras 
family includes three main members, H-Ras, N-Ras, and 
K-Ras, all of which have been found to drive cancer de￾velopment and progression.1 Specifically, Ras mutations 
are found in approximately 30% of human cancers.
2 Of 
these, K-Ras is the most frequently mutated isoform, and 
it has been associated with the highest incidence of acti￾vating mutations in various carcinomas.
3 K-Ras muta￾tions have also been associated with increased tumor￾igenicity and poor prognosis.4 Common mutations in K￾Ras include G12D, G12V, and G12C, which abolish GTP 
hydrolysis through the steric hindrance of GTPase￾activating proteins (GAPs).
5 These mutations therefore 
render Ras constitutively GTP-bound and active, leading
to the constant activation of downstream effector path￾ways. Accordingly, K-Ras is considered an attractive 
target in several exceptionally important cancers.
In recent decades, reports have described direct small￾molecule K-Ras inhibitors with various mechanisms of 
action.6–10 One mechanism involves guanine nucleotide￾exchange inhibition or the block of protein–protein in￾teractions (PPIs) with guanine nucleotide exchange fac￾tors (GEFs), such as the son of sevenless homolog (SOS). 
GEF catalysis-mediated conversion from an inactive 
GDP-bound state to an active GTP-bound state activates
Ras and initiates downstream signaling cascades. For 
instance, small-molecule inhibitors that bind directly to 
the K-Ras(G12D) mutant and interfere with downstream 
signaling pathways were discovered via fragment-based 
screening.
11,12 Synthetic peptide inhibitors with micromo￾lar binding affinity, based on an α-helix from SOS, were 
developed using a peptidomimetic approach,
13,14 and
artificial cyclic peptide inhibitors with submicromolar 
affinity were identified from a random peptide￾displayed bead library.15,16 Nevertheless, K-Ras remains 
a substantially challenging target, and it has been con￾sidered an "undruggable" target because of its smooth 
surface, which lacks deep binding pockets.
Previously, we successfully discovered a 19-mer cyclic 
inhibitory peptide formed via disulfide bonding be￾tween two Cys residues, KRpep-2d (Ac￾RRRRCPLYISYDPVCRRRR-NH2), using T7 phage dis￾play technology and subsequent sequence optimization 
(Chart 1).17 This peptide exhibits potent non-covalent K￾Ras(G12D) inhibitory activity, with selectivity against 
wild-type (WT) K-Ras and the K-Ras(G12C) mutant, in 
both cell-free enzyme (IC50 = 1.6 nM) and cell-based as￾says.17,18 For further characterization, we investigated the 
binding affinity of KRpep-2d for K-Ras proteins using 
the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. Then,
we performed structural determination of K-Ras(G12D)

60in complex with GDP and KRpep-2d, which allowed an 
investigation of the protein binding site and peptide 
binding conformation. This structural analysis indicated
a unique binding site for small molecules, and it might
therefore provide a valuable basis for the future design
of K-Ras inhibitors.
Chart 1. Chemical Structure of KRpep-2d
SPR measurements revealed that KRpep-2d binds to 
K-Ras(G12D) with a KD of 8.9 nM and approximately 6-
fold selectivity over WT K-Ras, leading to an extended 
dissociation half-life (Table 1). The crystal structure of K￾Ras in complex with GDP and KRpep-2d was deter￾mined at 1.25 Å resolution. The crystallographic pro￾cessing and refinement statistics are summarized in Ta￾ble S1. One molecule was included per asymmetric unit. 
Except for two N-terminal residues derived from the 
expression tag, the K-Ras(G12D) polypeptide chain is
sufficiently well-ordered to allow structural feature in￾terpretation. The crystal structure revealed that KRpep￾2d binds near Switch II and the α3 helix in an extended 
and shallow cleft composed of two α-helices (Figure 1). 
The main-chain atoms of KRpep-2d were well-ordered 
in crystal packing, although the electron densities of the 
side-chain atoms of N- and C-terminal arginine residues 
(Arg1–Arg4 and Arg16–Arg19) were relatively ambigu￾ous (Figure S1). Four arginine residues at each terminus 
were exposed to solvent, and therefore, they did not in￾teract specifically with K-Ras, except for crystal-packing 
interactions (Figure S2). Notably, the inhibitory activity 
(IC50) and binding affinity (KD) of KRpep-2d were ap￾proximately 5-fold stronger than those of KRpep-2 (Ac￾RRCPLYISYDPVCRR-NH2), a lead peptide of KRpep-2d
(Ref. 17 and Table S2). It was suggested that these argi￾nine residues at both termini participate in indirect
KRpep-2 interactions. The crystal structure showed that 
KRpep-2d has an intramolecular hydrogen bond be￾tween the acetyl oxygen of the N-terminus and the 
main-chain nitrogen of Arg19 of the C-terminus (Figure 
S3). Along with the intramolecular disulfide bond, the 
hydrogen bond between terminal residues might con￾tribute to stabilizing the overall peptide conformation to 
adopt favorable direct interactions with K-Ras.

The loop conformation of KRpep-2d results from the 
formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between 
Cys5 and Cys15. Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic in￾teractions were observed at the binding interface be￾tween KRpep-2d and K-Ras(G12D) (Figures 2 and S3). 
The main-chain nitrogen and oxygen of Leu7 form hy￾drogen bonds with the side-chain oxygen and nitrogen
of Gln99 in the α3 helix, respectively. The main-chain 
nitrogen and oxygen of Tyr8 form hydrogen bonds with 
the main-chain oxygen of Gln61 and the side-chain ni￾trogen of Arg68 in the α2 helix. The main-chain nitrogen 
and side-chain oxygen of Ser10 interact via hydrogen 
bonding with the side-chain oxygens of Asp69 in the α2
helix. The side chain of Pro6 interacts hydrophobically 
with the side chain of Tyr96 in the α3 helix. The side 
chain of Leu7 occupies a small hydrophobic pocket in￾volving Val9, Thr58, Arg68, Met72, and Tyr96. The side 
chain of Ile9 interacts hydrophobically with the side 
chain of Met72 in the α2 helix. The side chain of Tyr11 
forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the main￾chain oxygen of Val103 in the α3 helix. The side chain of 
Asp12 forms hydrogen bonds with the side-chain nitro￾gens of Gln99 and Arg102 in the α3 helix. The side chain 
of Val14 interacts via van der Waals stacking with the 
side chain of Arg102. Together, these results indicate 
that the conformation of KRpep-2d, when anchored by 
the intramolecular disulfide bond, is optimal for interac￾tion with the shallow and extended cleft of K-Ras. Ala￾nine scanning of KRpep-2d prior to the structural analy￾sis revealed that Leu7, Ile9, and Asp12 are especially 
critical for the inhibition of K-Ras(G12D).
18 SPR binding 
analysis also demonstrated that replacement of Leu7, 
Ile9, and Asp12 with alanine significantly attenuated the 
peptide binding affinity for K-Ras (Table S2). The struc￾tural information regarding the binding interaction is 
highly consistent with the structure-and-activity rela￾tionships.
To evaluate structural rearrangement of K-Ras, the K￾Ras(G12D)–GDP–KRpep-2d complex structure was 
compared with the active GTP-bound and inactive GDP￾bound K-Ras(G12D) structures, as guanine nucleotide 
exchange was reported to induce large conformational 
changes in the Switch I and Switch II regions. The struc￾tural comparison revealed that the Switch II region re￾sembles the GDP-bound state (Figure S4A). In the K￾Ras(G12D)–GDP and K-Ras(G12D)–GDP–KRpep-2d 
complexes, the side chain of Asp12 formed a direct or 
water-mediated hydrogen bond with Gln61 of Switch II, 
whereas in the K-Ras(G12D)–GMPPCP and K￾Ras(G12D)–GMPPNP complexes, the side chain of Gln61 
was exposed to solvent, resulting in a loss of interaction 
with the side chain of Asp12 (Figures S4B and S4C). In 
the K-Ras(G12D)–GTP analog complexes, the α2 helix of 
Switch II overlapped with the KRpep-2d binding site.
Although the Switch II conformation significantly differs
between the GDP- and GTP-bound states, the binding 
affinity of KRpep-2d for both states is approximately 
equivalent (Table 1). The increased structural flexibility 
of Switch II in the GTP-bound state may be tolerable to
KRpep-2d binding.
Intriguingly, KRpep-2d exhibits inhibitory selectivity
against K-Ras(G12D) compared with the G12C mutant 
and WT for both states. To understand the specificity, 
our ternary K-Ras(G12D) complex was compared with 
the K-Ras(G12C)–GDP and K-Ras(WT)–GDP complexes.
The Switch II conformation in the K-Ras(WT)–GDP 
complex is similar to that of K-Ras(G12D) in the GDP 
state (Figure S5A), whereas the Switch II conformation 
in the K-Ras(G12C)–GDP complex is similar to that of K￾Ras(G12D) in the GTP state (Figure S5B). Despite of the 
structural differences of Switch II between K-Ras(WT) 
and K-Ras(G12C), the binding affinity of KRpep-2d for 
both K-Ras proteins is relatively weak in comparison 
with that for K-Ras(G12D) to the same extent. Structural
comparison indicated that a hydrogen-bonding interac￾tion between Asp12 and Gln61 likely stabilizes the 
Switch II conformation for peptide binding. As a result, 
the stabilized conformation of Switch II may facilitate 
the binding capability of KRpep-2d.

To explore the inhibitory mechanism of KRpep-2d, our 
structure was compared with the Ras–GEF complex. 
GEFs such as SOS catalyze the release of GDP and per￾mit the binding of GTP. Therefore, Ras–GEF inhibition 
could feasibly decrease the proportion of GTP-bound 
Ras. An SPR binding competition assay demonstrated 
that KRpep-2 competes for binding to SOS, and indicat￾ed that KRpep-2 and SOS could share binding sites on K￾Ras(G12D).17 The αH helix within the helical hairpin 
motif of SOS is known to play an important role in the 
nucleotide-exchange mechanism.
19 Structural compari￾son with the H-Ras1–SOS complex showed that the 
binding site of KRpep-2d is distal to the binding region 
of the αH helix of SOS, which displaces Switch I and 
Switch II to mediate GDP release (Figure 3A). KRpep-2d 
binding stabilized the Switch II conformation and 
caused steric hindrances with the SOS αH helix, suggest￾ing that KRpep-2d is likely a non-orthosteric inhibitor of 
the nucleotide-exchange reaction that interferes allosteri￾cally with nucleotide binding or release. Although the 
helical hairpin of SOS is critical for its function, other 
regions of the catalytic cdc25 domain of SOS also interact

60with Ras.20,21 As the binding site of KRpep-2d is adjacent 
to the αB, αD, and αK helices of the cdc25 domain, the 
inhibitory mechanism of KRpep-2d remains controver￾sial (Fig. S7).
To characterize the KRpep-2d binding site, the struc￾ture of our ternary complex was compared with other 
structures complexed with small-molecule inhibitors. 
Several small-molecule inhibitors were identified via 
NMR-based fragment-based ligand discovery.
11,12 One 
representative fragment, compound 13 (Figure S6), was 
selected for comparison because all fragments are 
known to bind to the same hydrophobic cavity via dis￾tinct manners. A structural comparison with this frag￾ment revealed that the fragment occupied the same side 
of Switch II as the SOS helix, which was shifted by frag￾ment binding (Figure 3B), and are considered orthosteric 
inhibitors. Several K-Ras(G12C) mutant-specific irre￾versible inhibitors have also been reported (Figure 
S6).22,23 Disulfide 6 and ARS-853 are covalently attached
to Cys12 and extend into a hydrophobic pocket in the 
vicinity of Switch II (Figure 4). The pocket was referred 
to as the Switch II pocket, and it is composed of the cen￾tral β-sheet, the α2 and α3 helices.22 Relative to known
structures of Switch II–bound irreversible inhibitors,
KRpep-2d induces structural rearrangements of the α2 
helix to accommodate the ligand in a distinct hydropho￾bic pocket. This hydrophobic pocket is occupied by the
side chain of Leu7 of KRpep-2d. Interestingly, the Switch 
II conformation of the K-Ras complex with published 
small-molecule inhibitors was relatively similar to that 
of the active GTP-bound state. Although the KRpep-2d 
binding interface adjacent to Switch II overlaps that of 
irreversible inhibitors, the binding interface contains the 
unique structural feature of KRpep-2d recognition, sug￾gesting that Switch II is significantly mobile and has 
wide conformational variability in the inactive GDP￾bound state.6,10 Structural analysis revealed a unique
potential binding region for inhibitors of the allosteric 
Ras–GEF interaction. Taken together, our results provide 
valuable insights into the molecular basis of the K-Ras 
protein, and they could provide direct guidance for the 
design of small-molecule K-Ras inhibitors for cancer 
therapy.
The PPIs between Ras–GTP and its effectors, which in￾itiate various downstream signaling cascades, are also 
challenging targets. Structural information may facilitate 
a detailed understanding of the binding capabilities of
inhibitors. KRpep-2d also binds to the GTP-bound state
of K-Ras with comparable affinity (KD = 11 nM; Table 1). 
It remains to be determined whether KRpep-2d inhibits 
Ras–effector interactions. One orthosteric inhibitor of 
Ras–effector interactions, Kobe2061,24
is known to bind 
to a similar site adjacent to Switch II as compound 13
(Figure S8A), indicating the importance of the Switch II
conformation for Ras-effector binding.25 According to 
one plausible hypothesis, KRpep-2d could prevent 
Switch I and Switch II from adopting the correct con￾formations for Raf-RBD binding (Figure S8B). However, 
preliminary analysis of K-Ras(G12D) binding with Raf￾RBD is still under investigation. Further investigation 
may facilitate an understanding of the mechanism of 
action of KRpep-2d.
