Abstract
The energetics of association of the murine anti-hen egg lysozyme antibody HyHEL-5 with bobwhite quail lysozyme,
California quail lysozyme, and the Arg45™Lys mutant of hen egg lysozyme was characterized by isothermal titration
calorimetry. The association of each lysozyme with HyHEL-5 is enthalpically driven in the temperature range 108C to 378C.
The calorimetric results indicate that the salt-links between Arg45 and Arg68 of hen egg lysozyme and GluH50 on the
HyHEL-5 paratope are energetically important in HyHEL-5rHEL association. In contrast to previous studies, the results
suggest that the three characteristic ‘quail’ mutations affect the energetics of antibodyrantigen association, even though
they are buried and not in direct contact with the antibody. q 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction
Recently several crystal structures of antibodyr
avian variant or mutant lysozyme complexes re- Ž
viewed in Ref. 1 have become available. This has w x.
made the anti-lysozyme antibodies an ideal model
system to understand the structural and the thermody￾namic basis of antibodyrprotein antigen interactions.

Fab fragment of the IgG1 k antibody HyHEL-5 with

bobwhite quail lysozyme BWQL which has the Ž .
R68K substitution and three other mutations 4 have w x
been determined Fig. 1 . The central feature of the Ž .
HyHEL-5rHEL complex is the presence of two salt￾links between Arg45 and Arg68, which form a ridge
on the HEL surface, with GluH50 and GluH35, which
lie in a crevice on the HyHEL-5 paratope 5 . The w x
R68K mutation in the HyHEL-5 epitope lowers the
affinity of the HyHEL-5rlysozyme complex by over
1000-fold 6,7 . In a semi-quantitative estimation of w x
the Gibbs free energy contribution of each lysozyme
residue to the HyHEL-5rHEL association, the
arginines at positions 45 and 68 were found to make
the most significant contributions to HyHEL-5 affin￾ity 8 . w x
In addition to the R68K substitution, BWQL also
contains substitutions of three residues which are
buried and not part of the HyHEL-5 structural epi￾tope T40S, I55V, and S91T . These three substitu- Ž .
tions are common to all North American quails in￾cluding BWQL and California quail lysozyme CQL Ž .
w x 9 . The affinity of HyHEL-5 for CQL is similar to
that for HEL Table 1 . In addition, CQL has a Ž .
mutation at position 121, which is not expected to
affect its association with HyHEL-5.
We have focused on understanding the energetic

contributions of the two salt-links to the association
of HEL with HyHEL-5 by isothermal titration
calorimetry. Studying the thermodynamics of Hy￾HEL-5 binding to BWQL and CQL included as a Ž
control for the ‘quail’ mutations can help delineate .
the role of Arg68 and the importance of the salt-link
it forms in the antibodyrantigen complex. The inclu￾sion of CQL in this study as a control gave the
unexpected result that the ‘quail’ mutations con￾tributed significantly to the observed thermodynam￾ics, especially the change in heat capacity. The ener￾getics of the salt-link formed by Arg45 using the
lysozyme mutant R45K-HEL has also been studied.
The results support the energetic importance of the
HyHEL-5 epitope residues Arg45 and Arg68 in the
association of HyHEL-5 with HEL.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. HyHEL-5 cell culture and purification
The hybridoma cell line producing the HyHEL-5
antibody was cultivated in a hollow fiber reactor at
the National Cell Culture Center Minneapolis, MN . Ž .
HyHEL-5 was purified as described previously 10 . w x
2.2. Lysozyme purification and assays
The R45K-HEL mutant was expressed and puri￾fied as described previously 11 and was shown to w x
be homogeneous by silver-stained SDS-PAGE.
Purified BWQL and CQL, the generous gift of Dr.
E. Prager at the University of California at Berkeley
w x 12 , appeared as single bands on silver-stained SDS￾PAGE, and were used as received. Additionally, bob￾white quail eggs were purchased from Stevenson
Game Bird Farm Riverside, TX and California quail Ž .
eggs were purchased from Dallas and Linda Bowles
Farm Fort Morgan, CO . Upon receipt, the egg Ž .
white was separated from the yolk and stored at
y808C. The purification was done essentially as
described by Arnheim et al. 12 , with updated chro- w x
matographic matrices. Briefly, the egg white was
thawed and homogenized in a Waring blender ca. Ž
30–45 s . It was filtered through cheesecloth and .
then through tissue paper, and diluted six-fold with
15 mM ammonium acetate, pH 9.2. Batch adsorption
was done overnight at 48C using CM Sephadex
Ž . Pharmacia , in the ratio of 1 g of adsorbentr60 ml
of diluted egg white. After adsorption, the super￾natant was repeatedly replaced with fresh buffer at
2-h intervals, until the liquid was clear ca. three Ž
times . Proteins were eluted with 500 mM ammo- .
nium acetate pH 9.2 . The material was concentrated Ž .
by ultrafiltration Amicon 8200 and fractionated by Ž .
size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-100
HR Pharmacia column, using 15 mM ammonium Ž .
acetate pH 9.2 . Final purification was done on a Ž .
CM Sepharose Pharmacia column; the protein was Ž .
eluted with a gradient of ammonium acetate pH 9.2 Ž .
from 15 mM to 500 mM. Purified lysozyme was
characterized using silver-stained SDS-PAGE and
stored at 48C in the presence of 0.05% sodium azide.
Because BWQL from Stevenson Game Bird Farm
had not been used in previous immunochemical ex￾periments, it was further verified that the purified
protein bore the characteristic BWQL mutations us￾ing electrospray ionization mass spectrometry per- Ž
formed by Gregory Rahn, Oneida Research Services,
Whitesboro, NY . The mass of HEL was found to be .
14302.7"0.9 the mass calculated based on the Ž
mRNA sequence is 14305.1 13 and that of BWQL w x.
to be 14261.3"1.0 the calculated mass is 14263.1 . Ž .
Importantly, the experimental and calculated mass
differences between HEL and BWQL were 41.4 and
42.0 respectively, which are in agreement within the
experimental error.
2.3. Isothermal titration calorimetry
An OMEGA isothermal titration calorimeter Mi- Ž
croCal, Northampton, MA was used for all experi- .
ments. The design and operation of the instrument
w x 14 and sample preparation and experimental
methodology have been described previously 10 . w x
Origin, the data analysis software provided with the
calorimeter, was used to analyze all results. To obtain
the reported enthalpies, the apparent binding enthalpy
values were corrected for the lysozyme enthalpy of
dilution, determined by averaging the integrated areas
obtained for injections after saturation. For analysis
of ‘tight’ associations HyHEL-5 with HEL, CQL Ž
and R45K-HEL , the integrated areas for injections .
prior to saturation typically varied by less than about
4% and were averaged to obtain the apparent binding208 K.A. Shick et al.rBiochimica et Biophysica Acta 1340 1997 205–214 ( )
enthalpy. For associations of ‘intermediate’ affinity
Ž . HyHEL-5 with BWQL , the Origin software was
used to fit the data using a ‘single set of identical
sites’ model after correcting for lysozyme dilution Ž .
in order to obtain the stoichiometric equivalence ratio
n, association constant K , and enthalpy of associa- a
tion DH.
In the ITC experiments the experimentally deter￾mined equivalence ratio based on the number of
antibody binding sites is typically 15–20% less than
the expected value of 1.0. Potential sources of this
discrepancy include approximately 5–10% error in
the calculated value of the extinction coefficient for
HyHEL-5 used to determine the antibody concentra￾tion 10 , the presence of traces of inactive protein or w x
residual contaminants in the purified preparations
Žcontrol experiments using excess BSA have showed
that the presence of BSA does not affect the accuracy
of the experimentally determined thermodynamic
quantities 10 . The deviation in the equivalence w x.
ratio does not affect the accuracy of the determined
enthalpy change of association because each experi￾ment was done with an accurately known amount of
lysozyme and excess antibody was present during
initial injections. The equilibrium binding constant
determined for the association of BWQL with Hy￾HEL-5 was in good agreement with the binding
constant determined by fluorescence spectroscopy
w x 15 , further supporting the accuracy of the values
reported here.

of integrated energies versus molar ratio was decon￾voluted using non-linear regression of a ‘single set of

Origin. The favorable combination of binding en￾thalpy and affinity allows the association constant,
the association enthalpy, and the stoichiometry to be
determined from a single experiment Table 2 . The Ž .
BWQL received from Dr. E. Prager stored Ž
lyophilized at y208C since 1970, designated ‘EP’.
and used in previous work on HyHEL-5rBWQL
association 6,7 , gave results indistinguishable from w x
those obtained with freshly-prepared material. Con￾trol experiments for proton liberation or uptake upon
binding were performed by measuring the enthalpy of
association in Tris buffer enthalpy of ionization, Ž
y1 11.51 kcal mol at 258C 16 and sodium phosphate w x.
Ž y1 buffer enthalpy of ionization, 1.22 kcal mol at
258C 16 . The slight difference in w x. DH indicates that
there may be uptake of a fraction of a proton per mol
Ž . 0.25 upon binding of the two proteins. The enthalpy
of association depends strongly on temperature, de￾clining linearly from y15.5 kcal moly1 at 138C to
y25.6 kcal moly1 at 378C. The slope of this line y1 y1 yields a DC of y430"20 cal mol K Table Ž p

4. Discussion
Characterizing the thermodynamic driving forces
responsible for association in antibodyrprotein anti￾gen complexes of known three-dimensional structure
can advance understanding of the structural and ener￾getic determinants of affinity and specificity. The
association of BWQL, CQL and R45K-HEL with
HyHEL-5 is enthalpically-driven at all temperatures
studied, as was found for HyHEL-5rHEL binding
w x 10 and for most high affinity antibodyrprotein anti￾gen associations 17–25 . For all the lysozymes, w x DH8
is a linear function of TDS8 suggesting the existence
of enthalpy-entropy compensation in the binding pro￾cess Table 6 . Ž .
In all four systems the entropic contributions to
association are unfavorable. The lysozyme loops
around residues 45 and 70 lie within the HyHEL-5
epitope and are among the most mobile residues in
uncomplexed lysozyme 4 ; the unfavorable entropy w x
of association may arise in part from loss of mobility
of these residues on complex formation, as in the
native HyHEL-5rHEL complex 2 . Large backbone w x
differences were observed for these loops on compar￾ing free and HyHEL-5 complexed BWQL 4 . It has w x
been estimated by experiments using osmolytes that
about 6–12 water molecules are taken up on forma￾tion of the HyHEL-5rBWQL complex 15 , which w x

may also contribute to the unfavorable entropy change
and provide a favorable enthalpic contribution by
forming bridging hydrogen bonds between residues
of the epitope and the paratope. Some of the favor￾able enthalpic contribution may be due to the forma￾tion of hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals’ interac￾tions 26 . Comparing R45K-HEL with HEL and w x
BWQL with CQL Table 7 , it is observed that in the Ž .
temperature range studied the salt-links formed by
arginine residues at positions 45 and 68 contribute
favorably to the enthalpy of association.
The results for the association of BWQL with
HyHEL-5 at 258C in the presence of Tris and phos￾phate buffers Table 2 , suggests the existence of Ž .
slight proton linkage in this system. The corrected
DH8 of association obtained by accounting for the
enthalpy of ionization of the buffers is y20.4 kcal
moly1 at 258C. As no proton linkage was observed
for the association of HEL, CQL and R45K-HEL
with HyHEL-5, it is likely that the loss of the salt-link
between Arg68 and GluH50 may be associated with a
fractional proton absorption event. This issue is the
subject of further investigation using directed muta￾genesis.
Both BWQL and CQL bear the characteristic
‘quail’ mutations at positions 40, 55 and 91 Table Ž
1 . Additionally, BWQL has an Arg68 . ™Lys and
CQL has a Gln121™His mutation. Since residue
121 is away from the HyHEL-5 epitope and in all
functional assays done to date the interaction of CQL
with HyHEL-5 is equivalent to that with HEL, the
thermodynamic differences between BWQL and CQL
are most likely due to the difference in residue 68
Ž . Arg™Lys . The loss of the salt-link formed by
residue 68 3,4 has a large effect on the affinity w x
Ž . y1 Table 5 . At 258C, DDG8s5.1"0.2 kcal mol , of

of DDH8 and DŽ . TDS8 are within experimental error
Ž . Table 7 . The Arg68™Lys mutation produces an
unfavorable change in the entropic contribution to
association Table 7 . Interestingly, in both HyHEL- Ž .
5rBWQL and HyHEL-5rR68K-HEL complexes a
water molecule is bound in place of the terminal
nitrogens of HEL Arg68 3,4 . Also, comparison of w x
the HyHEL-5rHEL structure with HyHEL-5rBWQL
and HyHEL-5rR68K-HEL structures shows the loss
of at least one hydrogen bond, which could account
for some of the observed unfavorable change in the
enthalpic contribution to association for the HyHEL￾5rBWQL system. At present, however, the structural
data do not provide a complete explanation for the
observed differences in the energetics of association.
The structure of the HyHEL-5rHEL complex
shows a salt-link between Arg45 of HEL and GluH50
of HyHEL-5 2,5 . Molecular modeling suggests that w x
a Lys in position 45 could also form that salt-link
w x 27 , in contrast to the Arg68™Lys mutation where

different Table 7 . The Ž . DDG8s at 258C of the muta￾tions are q2.0"0.2 kcal moly1 and q5.1"0.2
kcal moly1 respectively. Both the mutations are asso￾ciated with an increased DH8 and TDS8, but each
effect is more pronounced at lower temperatures for
the R45K mutation.
All three variant lysozymes studied have similar
DC for association with HyHEL-5 p Žy420 to y450
cal moly1 Ky1
; these values are indistinguishable
within experimental error , which is quite different .
from the DC for HyHEL-5 p rHEL association
Ž y1 y1 y340"40 cal mol K Table 5 . Comparing .Ž .
DDC for the association of HyHEL-5 with HEL and p
CQL, the effect of the ‘quail’ mutations on DC is p
Ž y1 y1 large 110 cal mol K . There was good agree- .
ment between the DC calculated by the method of p
Murphy and Freire 28 and the experimentally deter- w x
mined DC 10 for the HyHEL-5 w x rHEL system. p
However, methods for calculating DC from surface p
area buried on association 28,29 cannot account for w x
the observed change in DC due to the buried ‘quail’ p
mutations. Although the ‘quail’ mutations in CQL are
all buried and are not part of the HyHEL-5 structural
epitope residue 40 is at the edge of the epitope , the Ž .
calorimetric results suggest that these residues affect
the interaction of the HyHEL-5 epitope with the
antibody. There is no evidence to date that the differ￾ence in residue 121 significantly affects HyHEL-5
association; however, a definitive test must await the
results of ongoing experiments. In contrast, studies of
the putative evolutionary intermediates separating hen
from quail lysozymes showed significant variation in
thermostability, which was correlated with the com￾bined volume of the amino acid side groups occupy￾ing positions 40, 55 and 91 30,31 . There is a w x
likelihood of the quail mutations affecting the bind￾ing of CQL and possibly also BWQL due to the
linkage between folding and binding, but further
experiments are necessary to draw any definitive
conclusions. There is some evidence that BWQL and
the site-directed mutant, R68K-HEL which does not Ž
have the ‘quail’ mutations , do not associate equiva- .
lently with HyHEL-5 7 and in the present study we w x
were unable to obtain good calorimetric data with
R68K-HEL. Also, HyHEL-5 association perturbs
amide exchange kinetics of residues distant from the
epitope 32 , suggesting that mutations away from the w x
structural epitope could affect the association energet￾ics.
For comparison, we note that trypsin binds equally
well to substrates with either arginine or lysine in the
P site of the trypsin inhibitor 33,34 . In the w x 1
trypsinrBPTI complex, an aspartic acid residue of
trypsin forms a salt-link with arginine or a water
molecule mediates the interaction with lysine, similar
to the interaction of HyHEL-5 with HEL and with
R68K-HEL or BWQL 3 . Comparison of the Hy- w x
HEL-5rHEL and HyHEL-5rR68K-HEL complexes
with trypsin complexed with wild-type BPTI 35 and w x
Lys15™Arg BPTI mutant 36 show that the local w x
environment is important in determining the effect of
even a conservative mutation 4 . w x
The sensitivity of antibodyrprotein antigen associ￾ation thermodynamics to seemingly minor structural
perturbations has been illustrated by several previous
examples. A few residues at the center of the contact
interface of the anti-HEL antibody D1.3 were shown
to be primarily responsible for the binding affinity to
lysozyme, but non-contact residues could modulate
the binding interaction 37 . Interestingly, a study of w x
substitutions of closely related amino acids at the
contact surface in the D1.3rHEL system showed that
changes in entropy compensate for changes in en￾thalpy produced by mutation 38,39 . The affinity of w x
the humanized version of the anti-lysozyme antibody
D1.3 was improved by substitutions in framework
positions adjacent to the CDRs, but not in direct
contact with the antigen 40 . Structures of several w x
variants of influenza virus neuraminidase with single
amino acid changes in the epitope recognized by
antibody NC41 41,42 have demonstrated that very w x
subtle changes in the antigen can dramatically reduce
antibody binding, while seemingly drastic substitu￾tions may be accommodated with only a slight de￾crease in affinity. Heteroclitic binding of D11.15 with
avian lysozymes was shown to be due to a stereo￾chemically permissive environment for residues that
varied in the epitope region 43 . w x
In agreement with previous studies, we have shown
that the salt-links formed between the arginines of the
HyHEL-5 epitope and the glutamic acids on the HELK.A. Shick et al.rBiochimica et Biophysica Acta 1340 1997 205–214 ( ) 213
paratope contribute significantly to the energetics of
HyHEL-5rHEL association. However, the thermody￾namic effects of the two salt-links are different.
Surprisingly, the antibodyrantigen interaction is af￾fected by conservative substitutions of buried residues
which are not part of the HyHEL-5 structural epitope.
This study has also demonstrated the usefulness of
isothermal titration calorimetry as a technique for
delineating very subtle changes in protein structure,
that are not apparent from the comparison of the
three-dimensional structures of the individual pro￾teins and protein–protein complexes.
