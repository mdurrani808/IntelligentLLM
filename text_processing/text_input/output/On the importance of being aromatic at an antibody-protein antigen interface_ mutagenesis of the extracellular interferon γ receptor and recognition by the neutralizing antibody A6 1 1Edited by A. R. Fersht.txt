A complex formed between the extracellular human interferon gamma
receptor a-chain (hIFNgR) and the Fab fragment of the neutralizing anti￾body A6 has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Five complementar￾ity determining regions of the A6 antibody interact primarily with the CC0
surface loop of the receptor, from Lys47 to Trp56, although contact is also
made with residues in the neighbouring F strand, in particular with Trp82.
The relative contribution that individual side-chains make to complex stabil￾ization was assessed with 21 receptors mutants, whose af®nity for A6 was
monitored using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor, as well as by sol￾ution-phase competition ELISA. The results reveal two lysine side-chains
(Lys47 and Lys52), an asparagine side-chain (Asn53), and two aromatic
side-chains (Tyr49 and Trp82) in the receptor that are important for recog￾nition by A6. The role of aromatic side-chains in antibody-antigen recog￾nition is of particular interest, not least in this case because 13 aromatic
groups (six Tyr, six Trp and one His) are present at the interface (four in VL,
six in VH and three in the receptor), and several are proximal to the charged
and polar side-chains of Lys47, Lys52 and Asn53 in the receptor. The results
highlight the possibility for aromatic rings to participate in networks of co￾operative interactions with not only hydrophobic, but also charged and
hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups, properties that are well suited
for creating binding sites for protein epitopes, regardless of the distribution
of polar and non-polar surface residues. These ®ndings may contribute,
therefore, to an understanding of how surface groups on proteins are cap￾tured by the often aromatic-rich hypervariable loops of antibodies, and may
be of value for the design of molecules with novel recognition properties.

Introduction
The mechanisms that antibodies use to bind pro￾tein antigens are of fundamental interest for an
understanding of macromolecular recognition
in vivo, as well as for the design of molecules with
novel recognition properties. In vivo antibodies are
selected and then evolve in a relatively short time￾period to bind, amongst others, surface epitopes of
proteins with high af®nity (e.g. KD in the range
10ÿ6 to 10ÿ9 M). The resulting antibody-antigen
complexes display extensive binding interfaces,
with highly complementary surfaces extending

Poljak, 1995; Davies & Cohen, 1996). The bound
antigen surface, which may comprise polar and
non-polar residues, typically makes multiple con￾tacts with several of the antibody hypervariable
loops. The relative importance of salt bridges,
hydrogen bonds, as well as the hydrophobic and
other effects in stabilizing the antibody-antigen
complex remain, however, a matter of debate
(Braden & Poljak, 1995, 1997; Davies & Cohen,
1996; Jones & Thornton, 1996; Wilson & Stan®eld,
1994; Xu et al., 1997).
Here, we have studied by mutagenesis a com￾plex formed between the extracellular human inter￾feron g receptor a-chain (hIFNgR) and the Fab
fragment of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody
(mAb) A6. The hIFNgR is a type-II cytokine recep￾tor (Silvennoinen & Ihle, 1996) whose extracellular
portion folds into two Ig-like domains (Figure 1;
Williams et al., 1995). Each domain has a FBN-III
(®bronectin type-III) fold comprising two antiparal￾lel b-sheets formed by strands A, B, E and G, F, C
and C0
. A crystal structure of a recombinant extra￾cellular hIFNgR in a 2:1 receptor:ligand complex
with IFNg revealed how two receptor chains bind
the homodimeric ligand at the cell surface (Walter
et al., 1995). Residues in the CC0 and EF loops as
well as the F and G b-strands of the ®rst receptor
domain, the helical interdomain linker, and the BC
and FG loops from domain 2, together provide an
extensive surface (total ca. 960 AÊ 2
) that is buried
by IFNg in the complex.
The epitope bound by the mAb A6 was revealed
in a crystal structure of hIFNgR domain 1 (residues
1-108 with a Cys105Ser mutation{) complexed to
the Fab fragment at 2.8 AÊ (Figure 2; Sogabe et al.,
1997). Five complementarity determining regions
(CDRs) of A6 interact primarily with the CC0 sur￾face loop of the receptor, from Lys47 to Trp56,
although contact is also made with residues in the
neighbouring F strand, in particular with Trp82

806 Interferon  Receptor Recognition by A6(Figure 3). The antibody epitope on the receptor
overlaps to a large extent with the site occupied by
IFNg in the ligand-receptor complex, thereby
explaining the inhibitory activity of A6 (Bridges
et al., 1996). However, the CC0 loop has quite a
different backbone conformation in the two com￾plexes, with the tip of the loop displaced over
8 AÊ , which allows the receptor to provide steric
and electrostatic complementarity to two quite dif￾ferently shaped ligands. No (3D) structural infor￾mation is available for the free hIFNR, nor for the
free A6 mAb.
We describe here mutagenesis studies of resi￾dues in the CC0 loop and ¯anking F strand in the
hIFNgR, designed to examine their role in recog￾nition by A6. Site-directed receptor mutants have
been prepared and their af®nities for A6 have been
monitored using a SPR (surface plasma resonance)
biosensor (BIAcore instrument, Pharmacia) and a
solution-phase competition ELISA. The results
point to the importance of, in particular, two lysine
side-chains (Lys47 and Lys52), an asparagine side￾chain (Asn53), and two aromatic side-chains
(Tyr49 and Trp82) in the receptor for recognition
by A6. The role of aromatic side-chains in anti￾body-antigen recognition is of particular interest,
not least in this case, because 13 aromatic groups
(six Tyr, six Trp and one His) are present at the
interface (four in VL, six in VH and three in the
receptor), and several are proximal to the charged
and polar side-chains of Lys47, Lys52 and Asn53
in the receptor. The results highlight the potential
importance not only of the hydrophobic effect,
but also of p-cation interactions and NH-aromatic
hydrogen bonds, all mediated by aromatic
groups, in stabilizing the complex. Our ®ndings
may, therefore, have a wider signi®cance for
understanding how polar and non-polar surface
groups on proteins are captured by the often aro￾matic-rich (Davies & Cohen, 1996; Mian et al.,
1991; Padlan, 1990) hypervariable loops of
antibodies.

gR38 (Garotta et al., 1990) has been investigated,
whose epitope overlaps that recognized by A6
(Sogabe et al., 1997; Williams et al., 1995). However,
no crystal structure is available for the gR38-
hIFNgR complex. Binding assays with receptor
mutants have identi®ed residues in the CC0 loop
that are also important for recognition by this
mAb.
Results
Production and CD spectra of mutants
The yields of most mutant receptors were similar
to that of wt (wild-type) except for Y49A and
W82A (two- to threefold higher), and W56F, W56Y
and R84A (two- to threefold lower). No full-length
W56A mutant could be isolated. Also, the R84A
mutant was less stable than wt, being especially
prone to proteolytic cleavage.
The CD spectra of all mutants in the far-UV
were similar in shape to that of the wt receptor,
with a large negative peak at 198 nm and a small
positive maximum at 230-235 nm, although for
some mutants (N48A, G50A, K52A, W56F) peak
intensities were reduced by 10-20 %. In the near￾UV CD, all mutants gave spectra similar to wt,
with a negative peak at 284 nm; however, for
N48A, G50A and E55A this peak was slightly less
intense, and for W56Y and all W82 mutants
slightly more intense. The data support the con￾clusion that all mutants have the same overall fold
as the wt receptor, but do not rule out changes in
preferred loop conformations (vide infra).
SPR measurements
For af®nity measurements using a BIAcore
instrument (Pharmacia) the intact mAbs were
immobilized on the sensor surface by random
amine coupling. The soluble wt or mutant recep￾tors in the ¯ow buffer contain a single antibody
binding site. The validity of ®tting binding curves
to a 1:1 interaction model was assessed using glo￾bal data analysis, as described in method 1 (see
Materials and Methods). For comparison, attempts
were also made to ®t binding curves to alternative
binding models that describe reactions in which
the immobilized ligand is heterogeneous, or the
receptor is heterogeneous, or that assume a two￾step binding reaction. In all cases where this meth￾od was applied, the assumption of a simple 1:1
interaction model ®tted the experimental data at
least as well as more complex models, or was the
only acceptable model. Incorporation of a term for
mass transfer had little effect on the closeness of
the ®t. Studies using different immobilization
levels and ¯ow rates indicated little in¯uence of
mass-transport limitation under the measurement
conditions used. Representative binding curves are
shown in Figure 4, and the apparent binding con￾Table 2. Results of binding assays with IFNgR mutants

808 Interferon  Receptor Recognition by A6      stants for each mutant are shown for mAbs A6
and gR38 in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
For mutants with dissociation rates increased
more than fourfold method 2 was employed
(see Figure 4). Mutants that were analysed with
method 2 showed association phases that ®tted
well a 1:1 interaction model. Also, analysis of the
wt and several mutants by method 1 and method
2 gave essentially the same af®nity constants.
Binding interactions with a very high koff reach
steady state almost immediately, and so give rise
to rectangular-shaped binding curves, from which
it is impossible to extract kinetic data. The inter￾actions of mutants K47A and Y49A with A6, and
N53A, S54A, W56F and W82A with gR38 fell into
this category. For these mutants the only extracta￾ble parameter was KA, which was determined as
described in method 3 (Tables 1 and 2).
Several interactions could not be analysed by the
above methods, either because they exhibited
clearly biphasic binding patterns, or because the
af®nity of the interaction was too low. For
example, mutant G50A showed biphasic associ￾ation and dissociation responses. The major com￾ponent in the response to K47M, K52M and W82A
showed a fast off-rate, and a gradual increase in
response during the association phase (Figure 4).
Injections of increasing receptor concentrations
indicated that in no case was saturation reached.
The ®ts of these binding curves to the 1:1, and to
more complex binding models were poor. The
apparent KD values for these mutants (Table 1)
were, therefore, estimated by method 4 (see
Materials and Methods).
Competition ELISA
The apparent KD values for mutants binding to
the mAb A6 (where a crystal structure of the anti￾body-antigen complex is available) were also deter￾mined in solution by competition ELISA. The
results shown in Table 3 indicate a good agreement
with the af®nities determined using the BIAcore
instrument (Table 1). In particular, mutants with
signi®cantly poorer af®nities (e.g. >10-fold higher
KD values) are correctly identi®ed by both
methods.
Discussion
The mutagenesis experiments described above
provide binding data that correlate well with the
structure of the A6-receptor complex determined
by crystallography. The A6 Fab fragment contacts
mainly residues in the CC0 surface loop of the
receptor (Lys47 to Trp56) in the A6-hIFNgR com￾plex. In addition to this loop, the residue Trp82 in
the neighbouring F-strand makes edge-on-face con￾tact with the side-chain of TrpL92 of the mAb.
These two tryptophan residues, along with Trp56
and Try49, comprise a group of four aromatic resi￾dues that lie nearby the side-chain of Lys47
(Figure 3). The indole ring of TrpL92 is positioned
above the side-chain of the (presumably)
ammonium N-atom of Lys47. The NZ atom of
Lys47 is 3.9 AÊ from the centre of the six-membered
ring of TrpL92, which together with the main￾chain carbonyl O-atoms of TrpL92 and Asn48,
offer an almost optimal hydrogen-bonding geome￾try for an ammonium group (Figure 5(a)). Trunca￾tion of the side-chain in the mutant K47A leads
to a large loss in af®nity to the antibody. More￾over, this af®nity loss is not recouped in the
K47M mutant, highlighting the signi®cant ener￾getic contribution made by the polar side-chain
of Lys47.
The mutagenesis data also show that the side￾chains of Tyr49 and Trp82 are important for high
af®nity binding to A6. Whether the same is true
for Trp56 is less clear, since the W56A mutant
could not be isolated. The indole of Trp56 packs
against the aliphatic methylene groups (CB, CG
and CD) in the side-chain of Lys47, but can be
replaced by a benzene (W56F) or phenol (W56Y)
ring without loss of af®nity (Tables 1 and 3). The
W82A mutant is of special interest. The indole ring
of Trp82 does not directly contact Lys47. Rather,
the centroids of the ®ve-membered ring of Trp82
and the six-membered ring of TrpL92 are 5.1 AÊ
apart, in an edge-to-face stacking geometry
(Figure 5(a)). The signi®cance of this T-stacked
arrangement is discussed in more detail below.
The energetically important side-chains of Tyr49
and Asn53 (Tables 1 and 3) lie adjacent on one face
of the CC0 loop and constitute the central part of
the epitope that reaches deepest into the binding
cavity on A6. From the crystal structure, it appears
that one NH bond from the Nd2 atom of Asn53 is

Interferon  Receptor Recognition by A6 809directed towards the backbone carbonyl O-atom of
TyrL91, while the other points to the centre of the
benzenoid ring of TrpL96 located at the bottom of
the antigen binding site (2.8 AÊ from the H-atom to
the ring centre), suggestive of an NH-aromatic
hydrogen bond (Levitt & Perutz, 1988; Figure 5(b)).
It is also intriguing that the side-chain carbonyl
O-atom of Asn53 points directly at the s-plane of
TrpH52. The dipole interaction of the carbonyl-CO
group and the aromatic C-H bond would suggest
that this arrangement might also have a stabilizing
in¯uence. This conclusion is supported by earlier
theoretical and structural database studies, which
revealed a preferred edge-on orientation of carbo￾nyl CO groups with respect to aromatic rings in
densely packed protein interiors (Thomas et al.,
1982).
In the case of Tyr49, the side-chain is buried in a
pocket with its phenolic O-atom in hydrogen-bond￾ing distance (ca. 3.1 AÊ ) of an imidazole N-atom in
HisH100B. Both BIAcore assays and ELISA show a
reduced receptor af®nity for the Y49F mutant of
about 0.8-1.0 kcal/mol. More detailed crystallo￾graphic and thermodynamic studies of the ener￾getic importance of hydrogen bonds involving Tyr
OH groups have been reported at the D1.3-lyso￾zyme antibody-antigen interface, where effects of
Tyr to Phe mutations up to 2.6 kcal/mol were
reported (Fields et al., 1996). Truncation of the Tyr
side-chain to alanine in this work, as in the Y49A
mutant, leads to a more dramatic loss in af®nity to
the antibody (Tables 1 and 3).
Another cluster of critical residues are those at
the tip of the loop, from Gly50 to Lys52. The f/
c angles of Gly50 (132  and ÿ94 , resp.) lie in
a region of f/c-space that is unfavourable for a
non-glycine residue. Introducing Ala at this pos￾ition (G50A mutant) should force a change in the
preferred conformation of the CC0 loop, thereby
explaining the lower af®nity of the G50A mutant.
The biphasic behaviour of the association-phase
binding curves from BIAcore measurements
clearly suggest that more than one process is
occurring, which conceivably may correspond
with binding reactions involving conformational
changes within the CC0 loop. The Val51 side￾chain makes hydrophobic contacts with several
surrounding residues, the loss of which would
account for the reduced af®nity observed in the
V51A mutant.
The side-chain of Lys52, at the tip of the CC0
loop, appears to be involved in a network of inter￾actions, including several with aromatic side￾chains donated by the antibody. The ammonium
N-atom is positioned ca. 2.8 AÊ from carboxylate
O-atoms in the side-chains of both AspH56 and
AspH54 (Figure 5(c)). In addition, the four methyl￾ene groups in Lys52 run parallel and across the
indole ring of TrpH52 (Cd and Ce 4.5 AÊ from the
centroids of the six and ®ve membered rings,
respectively) on one side, and close to the indole
ring of TrpH53 on the other. Meanwhile, the indole
of TrpH52 makes edge-on-face contact through its
indole NH with the phenol ring of TyrH58, while
the other face (not in contact with Lys52) makes
edge-on-face contact with the side-chain imidazole
of HisH50. The other face of the benzenoid ring of
TrpH53 is also only 3.4 AÊ from the backbone
N-atom of GlyH33, in a H-bonding geometry
(Figure 5(c)). This network of interactions seem to
have formed around a cavity occupied by the
Lys52 side-chain. Truncating or removing the
ammonium group from the Lys52 side-chain leads
to a large loss of af®nity for the K52A and K52M
mutants (Tables 1 and 3).
The polar-charged side-chains of Arg84, Lys98
and Glu55, on the other hand, are located on the
periphery of the interface (Figure 3), and appear
from analysis of mutants to be energetically less
important than the buried side-chains of Lys47 and

810 Interferon  Receptor Recognition by A6Lys52. The E55A mutant is the only one to show a
small increase in af®nity compared with wt, for
reasons that are not clear, in both the BIAcore
assay and by ELISA. The side-chains of Asn79,
Ser54, and Asn48 are situated under the CC0 loop,
and do not make direct contact with the antibody.
The N48A, S54A and N79A mutations had minor
effects on af®nity, suggesting that they have little
in¯uence on the bound conformation of the CC0
loop (Sogabe et al., 1997).
As far as the structural epitope bound by gR38 is
concerned, the mutagenesis data in Tables 1 and 2
reveal similarities and differences in the relative
importance of side-chains in and around the CC0
loop for binding these two antibodies. The K47A,
Y49A, G50A and W82A mutations have large
effects on binding both antibodies, whereas, in par￾ticular, the K52A mutation produces a large effect
only on binding to A6. Unfortunately, it has not
proven possible so far to crystallize the IFNgR in a
complex with either the Fab or single chain Fv
fragment of gR38 (Bridges et al., 1996).
It would also be of interest to investigate how
the receptor mutants are recognized by the natural
ligand IFNg. IFNg, however, is a homodimer with
two apparently equivalent binding sites, each com￾posed of residues from both polypeptide chains
(Walter et al., 1995). There are also reports that the
homodimer dissociates at sub-micromolar concen￾trations to inactive monomeric chains (Boteva et al.,
1996). These properties considerably complicate
analyses of ligand-receptor binding in terms of a
simple 1:1 interaction model, by BIAcore and com￾petition ELISA, and have so far prevented determi￾nation of reliable binding constants using these
methods. The recent report of a designed, mono￾meric, single chain IFNg that forms a 1:1 complex
with the receptor (Randal & Kossiakoff, 1998) may,
however, provide a starting point to overcome
these problems.
In several other protein-protein complexes, only
a subset of the many side-chains buried at the
interface appear to be crucial for high af®nity rec￾ognition. These key side-chains may be distributed
over the interface as found, for example, in the
D1.3-E5.2 complex (Covell & Wallqvist, 1997;
Dall'Acqua et al., 1996; Goldman et al., 1997) and
the 5G9 Fab bound to TF (Huang et al., 1998), or
localized to one (usually central) region, as found
in the D1.3-lysozyme (Dall'Acqua et al., 1996;
England et al., 1997; Fields et al., 1996; Hawkins
et al., 1993), the NC41-neuraminidase (Nuss et al.,
1993), barstar-barnase (Serrano et al., 1991), and
hGH-hGHR (Clackson & Wells, 1995) complexes.
From the perspective of the antigen, the A6-
hIFNgR complex ®ts the former pattern, in that
only ®ve from about a dozen side-chain modi®-
cations produced the largest changes in af®nity,
these being distributed throughout the binding
interface.
Detailed studies of the D1.3-E5.2 (Goldman et al.,
1997) as well as hGH-hGHR (Clackson & Wells,
1995) complexes revealed that the ``hot'' residues
on one side of the interface generally match
those on the other, both with respect to position,
and polarity/hydrophobicity. The hot spot at the
hGH-hGHR interface appears to comprise central,
well-packed hydrophobic contacts, dominated on
the receptor side by two tryptophan residues
(W104 and W169), and surrounded towards the
periphery of the interface by apparently less criti￾cal hydrophilic residues (Pearce et al., 1996). The
importance of hydrophobic aromatic groups in
ligand binding to another cytokine receptor has
also been noted (Johnson et al., 1998). In the
D1.3-E5.2 system, on the other hand, both hydro￾philic and hydrophobic contacts play important
roles in stabilizing the complex. This may re¯ect
a more general requirement that antibodies be
able to bind diverse antigenic surfaces compris￾ing polar as well as non-polar residues (Goldman
et al., 1997). In this respect, the statistical over￾representation of aromatic residues, especially
Tyr and Trp (discussed by Davies & Cohen,
1996), in antibody combining sites may be of
special interest.
Thus aromatic residues may participate favour￾ably not only in hydrophobic contacts with non￾polar groups in the antigen but, where necessary,
also in polar interactions through the quadrupole
and dipole moments of the aromatic ring. For
example, the interactions of the p-system of a ben￾zene ring with cations (Dougherty, 1996) and with
amide NH hydrogen bond donors (Burley &
Petsko, 1986; Levitt & Perutz, 1988; Worth &
Wade, 1995) are well recognized, as are so-called
``p-p`` interactions between aromatic rings, in
model systems such as the benzene and toluene
dimers, and in proteins. Analyses of crystal struc￾tures (Burley & Petsko, 1985; Hunter et al., 1991)
indicated a preference for T-shaped (edge-on-face)
conformations for interacting aromatic rings in pro￾teins, and mutagenesis data has suggested inter￾action energies of ÿ1.3 kcal/mol for aromatic pairs
in a T-geometry in barnase (Serrano et al., 1991).
Recent quantum mechanical calculations (Chipot
et al., 1996) have indicated that the T-geometry of
the benzene dimer is preferred over the stacked
geometry in water by ÿ1.47 kcal/mol, although
this preference changes for the toluene dimer
which favours the stacked geometry by 1.12 kcal/
mol. As noted by Chipot et al., (1996), however, the
T-geometry may be advantageous within folded
proteins and, by analogy, also at protein-protein
interfaces, since not only the ``s-p`` contact may
occur, but also additional stabilizing interactions,
possibly in co-operative networks, through the
remaining three exposed p-faces.
The importance of aromatic-aromatic and
ammonium-aromatic interactions at antibody-pro￾tein antigen interfaces has been addressed already
in studies of HyHEL10 Fab complexed to HEL
(Tsumoto et al., 1995). Both types of interaction are
implicated in the A6-IFNgR complex, for example,
by the T-stacking of Trp82 indole with the indole
of TrpL92 which, in turn, appears to participate in
Interferon  Receptor Recognition by A6 811a p-cation interaction with the side-chain of Lys47.
The Trp82 indole, meanwhile, also participates in
hydrophobic contacts through its lower face with
the methylene groups in Glu101 (Figure 5A). The
ability of aromatic groups to participate in favour￾able and possibly co-operative interactions with
hydrophobic, aromatic, as well as charged and
hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups, would
appear to make them well suited for binding sites
that must respond to surface features of proteins,
regardless of the distribution of polar and non￾polar groups. Of course, the phenolic O-atom in
Tyr is itself a valuable additional source of hydro￾gen-bonding interactions. This interpretation of the
chemistry of the aromatic amino acids, if correct,
might go some way to explaining their frequent
occurrence in antibody CDRs, and potentially also
be of importance in designing sites with novel
binding capabilities. The energetic contribution
that each type of interaction makes will no doubt
depend on the detailed geometry, dielectric and
extent of solvation of the immediate environment.
A study of the A6 antibody combining site using
site-directed mutagenesis is currently underway,
which may shed more light on the relative import￾ance of these interactions in this system.
Materials and Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis
The wt hIFNgR from residues 1-229 (hIFNgR1-229), and
all mutants, were produced by a secretion expression
system in Escherichia coli HB2151, and puri®ed by immu￾noaf®nity chromatography using a mAb (9E10) against a
C-terminal c-myc tag (Evan et al., 1985), and subsequent
ion-exchange chromatography on Mono-Q (Pharmacia),
as described (Sogabe et al., 1997). Site-directed mutations
were introduced by PCR-based methods using the wt
hIFNgR cDNA as template, as described (Sogabe et al.,
1997). Each mutant cDNA was sequenced in the
expression vector pHEN1 (Hoogenboom et al., 1991)
throughout the entire open reading frame, on both DNA
strands, using dye terminator chemistry (Perkin Elmer)
to con®rm that only the desired nt changes had been
introduced. The yield of protein was typically 0.2-
0.5 mg/l of culture. The puri®ed wt hIFNgR1-229 and
mutants were >95 % homogeneous on SDS-PAGE, and
gave electrospray mass spectra consistent with the
expected mass.
CD spectra
CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropo￾larimeter at 25 C at 10-20 mM protein concentration in
20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 30 mM
NaCl for measurements in the range 180-280 nm. For
spectra in the near-UV (250-330 nm), 50 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 150 mM NaCl was used.
BIAcore measurements
The mAbs A6 and gR38 were immobilized on CM5
sensor surfaces (Pharmacia) by random amine coupling,
using methods described (Sogabe et al., 1997). The wt
and mutant receptor proteins were eluted over the sen￾sor surface in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2;
BIAcore buffer) with 150 mM NaCl) and 0.005 % (v/v)
Surfactant p20 (Pharmacia) at 25 C. For determination
of kon and koff the immobilization levels corresponded to
400-900 RU, whereas for steady-state measurements
the levels were 1200-5000 RU. These immobilization
levels gave rise to Rmax values on receptor binding of
100-200 RU, and 200-900 RU, respectively. Around
10,000 RUs of mAb gR99 (which binds an epitope in the
second FBN-III domain of the receptor, unrelated to that
bound by A6 and gR38; Sogabe et al., 1997) were
immobilised and used for determination of active free
receptor concentrations from initial binding rates (mass
transport limited conditions; Karlsson et al., 1993). Pro￾tein concentrations in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.2) with 150 mM NaCl were determined from A280
measurements after calibration by quantitative amino
acid analysis (1 mg/ml corresponds with A280  1.7 for
IFNgR1-229), and from mass transport limited initial bind￾ing rates to the gR99 surface. The agreement between
these methods was good.
Freshly prepared wt receptor was analysed with
each batch of mutants. All measurements were com￾pleted at least in duplicate. Repeat runs on one surface
with duplicates of the same sample gave maximum
standard deviations of 3 % for kon and koff, and 5 %
for KD. The standard deviation was greater between
batches of protein analysed on mAb surfaces immobi￾lised at different times; kon varied up to 25 %, koff up to
15 % and KD up to 25 %. A6 mAb surfaces were regen￾erated by injection of 10 ml of 10 M ethanolamine
(pH 10). For gR38 surfaces, suf®cient time between
sample injections was given to allow the response to
return to the pre-injection level.
BIAcore data analysis
The mutant receptor proteins showed a broad range
of binding characteristics. As such, no one method of
quantifying af®nities was applicable.
Method 1: determination of kon and koff by
global analysis
A 1:1 interaction model was ®tted to the data using
BIAevaluation Software (v 3.0) (Karlsson & Faelt, 1997).
In this method, the association and dissociation phases
of all binding curves in a dilution series are ®tted simul￾taneously (global analysis). This ®tting method was suit￾able for analysis of the binding curves of receptor
mutants N48A, N48Q, K52A, N53A, S54A, E55A, W56F,
W56Y, N79A, R84A and K98A interacting with A6, and
mutants N48A, G50A, V51A, K52A, K52 M, E55A,
W56Y and K98A interacting with gR38.
Method 2: determination of kon from the association
phase and KA from steady state analysis
Mutants Y49F, V51A, W82F and W82Y binding to A6
and mutants N48Q, Y49F, N79A, W82F, W82Y and R84A
binding to gR38, gave binding curves with a high appar￾ent koff, but with association phases suitable for kinetic
analysis. These mutants were measured on low density
surfaces to collect data for association phase analysis, and
on higher density surfaces for determination of steady￾812 Interferon  Receptor Recognition by A6state binding levels. Association phase data were ®tted to
the equation (O'Shannessy et al., 1993):
R  Req1 ÿ ekobs tÿto
 1
where Req is steady state response level; kobs  konC  koff,
where C is the molar concentration of the injected analyte;
and to is start time for ®tting association data. KA was
determined by a ®tting a plot of Req against C (Karlsson
et al., 1991):
Req  KACRmax=KAC  1 2
Method 3: determination of KA from steady
state analysis
Mutants K47A and Y49A interacting with A6 and
mutants N53A, S54A, W56F and W82A interacting with
gR38 gave rectangular binding curves. In these cases KA
only was determined by steady state measurements (see
Method-2).
Method 4: approximation of affinity from
comparison of binding curves
An approximation of the af®nity was obtained from
the concentration of mutant required to give half the sat￾uration response (Rmax/2) of the A6 surface, Rmax being
determined using 1 mM wt IFNgR1-229. These cases are
discussed individually in Results.
Competition ELISA
Competition ELISA was performed as described
(Friguet et al., 1985, 1989). Conditions were chosen so
that only a small percentage of the free antibody mol￾ecules bind to the coated antigen (<10 %), and the absor￾bance measured in the ELISA is proportional to the mAb
concentration, as described (Friguet et al., 1989). The
coating of wells was performed with IFNgR1-229 receptor
(0.2 mg/ml) in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6).
Receptor and A6 were incubated in BIAcore buffer, then
free A6 was detected by ELISA using goat anti-mouse
IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. If the equili￾brium concentration of free antigenic sites is a, that of
free antibody sites is i, and that of the antigenic sites
occupied by mAb is x, then KA  x/(a/i). Also x  io ÿ i
and a  ao ÿ x, where io and ao are the total antibody site
and antigenic site concentrations, respectively. The frac￾tion of bound antibody sites is then f  x/io, which was
measured using the method described by Stevens (1987)
to account for the bivalency of the mAb. The experimen￾tal data gave linear plots of f/a against f, from which KD
was calculated according to the Scatchard equation:
f =a  1=KD  1 ÿ f 3
All measurements were completed at least in triplicate
and the mean standard deviation was maximally 20%
