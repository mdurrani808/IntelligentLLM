A Mutational Analysis of the Binding of Two Different Proteins to the Same  Antibody  William DallAcqua, Ellen R. Goldman, Edward Eisenstein,, and Roy A. Mariuzza*,  Center for AdVanced Research in Biotechnology, UniVersity of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, 9600 Gudelsky DriVe,  RockVille, Maryland 20850, and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, UniVersity of Maryland Baltimore County,  Baltimore, Maryland 21228  ReceiVed April 5, 1996X  ABSTRACT: The crystal structures of the complexes between the anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL)  antibody D1.3 and HEL and between D1.3 and the anti-D1.3 antibody E5.2 have shown that D1.3 contacts  these two proteins through essentially the same set of combining site residues [Fields, B. A., Goldbaum,  F. A., Ysern, X., Poljak, R. J., & Mariuzza, R. A. (1995) Nature 374, 739-742].
To probe the relative  contribution of individual residues to complex stabilization, single alanine substitutions were introduced  in the combining site of D1.3, and their effects on affinity for HEL and for E5.2 were measured using  surface plasmon resonance detection, fluorescence quench titration, or sedimentation equilibrium.
The  energetics of the binding to HEL are dominated by only 3 of the 13 contact residues tested (Gmutant -  Gwild type > 2.5 kcal/mol): VLW92, VHD100, and VHY101.
These form a patch at the center of the  interface and are surrounded by residues whose apparent contributions are much less pronounced (<1.5  kcal/mol).
This contrasts with the interaction of D1.3 with E5.2 in which most the contact residues (11  of 15) were found to play a significant role in ligand binding (>1.5 kcal/mol).
Furthermore, even though  D1.3 contacts HEL and E5.2 in very similar ways, the functionally important residues of D1.3 are different  for the two interactions, with only substitutions at D1.3 positions VH100 and VH101 greatly affecting  binding to both ligands.
Thus, the same protein may recognize different ligands in ways that are structurally  similar yet energetically distinct.
  The three-dimensional structures of a number of antigenantibody complexes have been determined in recent years  (Davies et al., 1990; Mariuzza & Poljak, 1993; Webster et  al., 1994; Braden & Poljak, 1995).
These studies have  permitted a detailed description of antigenic determinants  and of antibody combining sites.
They have also provided  important information on the general characteristics of  protein-protein complexes, such as the size and chemical  nature of the interfaces and the magnitude of conformational  changes associated with complex formation (Janin & Chothia,  1990; Wilson & Stanfield, 1993; Davies & Cohen, 1996).
  However, the relative contributions of hydrophobicity,  surface complementarity, and hydrogen bonding to the  energetics of binding, the role of bound water molecules in  complex stabilization (Kornblatt et al., 1993; Bhat et al.,  1994; Goldbaum et al., 1996), and the mechanisms by which  amino acid changes in the interface are accommodated (Tulip  et al., 1992; Ysern et al., 1994) remain to be clarified.
  Another important issue is whether productive binding is  mediated by a small subset of interface residues (Novotny  et al., 1989; Cunningham & Wells, 1993; Kelley & OConnell,  1993; Tulip et al., 1994) or whether complex cooperative  interactions involving most of the contacting residues are  responsible for the observed affinities.
Clackson and Wells  (1995) addressed this question in the case of the interaction  of human growth hormone with its receptor.
These authors  replaced contact residues in the receptor and showed that  binding to growth hormone is generated through a few strong  interactions.
This so-called functional epitope forms a  central hydrophobic region, dominated by two tryptophan  residues, that seems to account for most of the binding free  energy.
The same trend was found by Cunningham and  Wells (1993), who analyzed the hormone side of the interface  and found that only 8 out of 31 side chains appeared to  contribute significantly to productive binding.
However, the  extent to which these results are general ones remains to be  established.
  To address this issue, we have studied the binding of the  monoclonal antibody D1.3 to two structurally distinct  ligands: its cognate antigen, hen egg white lysozyme (HEL),1  and the anti-idiotypic antibody E5.2.
The crystal structure  of the complex formed by the Fv fragment (a heterodimer  consisting of only the light and heavy chain variable domains,  VL and VH) of D1.3 with HEL has been determined to a  nominal resolution of 1.8  (Bhat et al., 1994).
In addition,  the structure of the complex between the Fv fragments of  D1.3 and the anti-D1.3 antibody E5.2 is known to 1.9   resolution (Fields et al., 1995).
Surprisingly, it was found  that D1.3 contacts HEL and E5.2 through essentially the   same set of combining site residues (and most of the same This work was supported by NIH Grants GM52801 (R.A.M.) and  RR08937 (E.E.).

In addition, the positions of the atoms of E5.2 that  contact D1.3 are close to those of HEL that contact D1.3,  and 6 of the 12 interface hydrogen bonds in the D1.3-E5.2  complex are structurally equivalent to hydrogen bonds in  the D1.3-HEL interface.
Thus, E5.2 mimics HEL in its  binding interactions with D1.3.
Confirming these observations, E5.2 induces an anti-HEL response when used as an  immunogen (Fields et al., 1995).
Because D1.3 recognizes  HEL and E5.2 through structurally similar interactions, this  constitutes an excellent model for determining whether the  same antibody combining site binds two different ligands in  energetically similar ways.
  The apparent contribution of individual residues of the Fv  fragment of D1.3 to binding HEL and FvE5.2 was determined by comparing the binding of wild-type protein with  that of mutants in which the side chains were truncated by  site-directed mutagenesis (Fersht, 1988).
Alanine-scanning  mutagenesis (Wells, 1991) was carried out on all residues  of D1.3 in contact with HEL and/or E5.2.
Alanine was  chosen because it eliminates the side chain without altering  the main-chain conformation and does not impose extreme  steric or electrostatic effects.
Affinities were measured using  three independent techniques (surface plasmon resonance  detection, fluorescence quench titration, and sedimentation  equilibrium) in order to assure the accuracy of our results.
  We show that the functionally important residues of D1.3  are different for binding HEL and E5.2.
We also find that  while the D1.3-HEL interaction is dominated by a small  subset of contact residues, as described for the binding of  growth hormone to its receptor (Cunningham & Wells, 1993;  Clackson & Wells, 1995), a much larger subset contributes  to the D1.3-E5.2 reaction.
Thus, the notion that proteinprotein recognition is mediated by only a few strong  interactions (Novotny et al., 1989; Cunningham & Wells,  1993; Kelley & OConnell, 1993; Tulip et al., 1994;  Clackson & Wells, 1995) may not be a general one.
In  certain cases, the free energy of binding may arise from the  accumulation of many interactions of varying strength over  the entire protein-protein interface.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Reagents.
All chemicals were of analytical grade.
Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA).
  Radiolabeled [35S]dATP was obtained from Amersham Corp.  Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 380B DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
  Production of FV Fragments.
The monoclonal anti-HEL  antibody D1.3 is derived from a Balb/c mouse hyperimmunized with this antigen (Mariuzza et al., 1984).
The single  chain version of FvD1.3 (scFvD1.3; McCafferty et al., 1990)  and of the mutants was prepared from the culture supernatant  of recombinant Escherichia coli BMH 71-18 cells (Ruther  et al., 1981) transformed with the pUC19-based dicistronic  expression vector pSW1 (Ward et al., 1989).
The single  chain linker, (Gly4Ser)3, is identical to that used previously  for immunoglobulin scFvs by Huston et al. (1988).
For  protein production, recombinant clones were resuspended in  10 mL of 4YT medium (double strength 2YT) containing  100 g/mL ampicillin and 1% (w/v) glucose.
The presence  of glucose is necessary for normal growth of recombinant  E. coli cells; it represses scFvD1.3 gene expression, whose  production is toxic to the cells.
The cultures were incubated  at 37 C under agitation to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm.
  The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice  with 4YT, and resuspended in 500 mL of 4YT containing  100 g/mL ampicillin and 0.1% (w/v) glucose.
This glucose  concentration is high enough for cells to grow normally, yet  low enough to permit efficient induction following its  depletion from the medium as a result of metabolism by E.  coli.
The cultures were grown at 30 C to an absorbance of  1.0, and isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside (IPTG; Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) was added to a final concentration  of 0.2 mM. After further incubation at 30 C for 18 h, the  bacteria were pelleted, and scFvD1.3 was affinity purified  from the supernatant using monoclonal antibody E5.2-  (Goldbaum et al., 1994) or HEL- (Ysern et al., 1994)  Sepharose columns.
Columns were washed with 10 volumes  of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and eluted with  50 mM diethylamine, pH 12.
Fractions were immediately  neutralized with 1.0 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0.
  The VL and VH genes of monoclonal antibody E5.2 were  cloned from the corresponding hybridoma cell line as  described (Goldbaum et al., 1994).
The amplified genes  were then inserted into the pUC19-based dicistronic expression vector pSW1 (Ward et al., 1989) as an EcoRI/HindIII  fragment, such that each gene is fused in-frame with the  signal sequence of pectate lyase in order to direct secretion  of the V domains into the periplasmic space of E. coli.
A  His6 tail was grafted onto the 3 end of the VL gene of FvE5.2  by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to permit  affinity purification using a nickel chelate adsorbent (Hochuli  et al., 1988).
The amplification mixture included 100 ng of  pSW1-E5.2 DNA, 50 pmol of each of the primers 5-  AGTGCCAAGCTTGCATGCAAA-3 (HindIII site underlined) and 5-GATTACGAATTCGAGCTGGATCCTTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGGTGACCGGTTTGATCTCCAG-3 (EcoRI site underlined), 200 M each dNTP,  100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2,  0.01% (w/v) gelatin, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq polymerase  (Perkin Elmer).
The sample was overlaid with paraffin oil,  heated to 94 C for 5 min, and subjected to a further 25  rounds of temperature cycling (94 C for 1 min, 50 C for  1 min, and 72 C for 1 min) using an Eppendorf MicroCycler  E programmable heating block.
The amplified DNA was  digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into the pSW1  expression vector restricted with the same enzymes.
  For production of FvE5.2, recombinant BMH 71-18 E.  coli cells were grown at 37 C in 10 mL of 4YT containing  100 g/mL ampicillin and 1% glucose (w/v) to an absorbance  at 600 nm of 1.0.
Three milliliters of this preculture was  used to inoculate 500 mL of 4YT containing 100 g/mL  ampicillin and 0.1% glucose (w/v).
After growth at 30 C  to an absorbance of 1.0, the bacteria were induced with 0.1  mM IPTG and incubated an additional 5 h at this temperature.
The recombinant protein was located in the periplasm  and could be isolated by osmotically shocking the cells as  described (Ward, 1992).
The osmotic shock fraction (75 mL  for 1 L of culture) was extensively dialyzed against PBS  and applied to a 1 mL nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA)  affinity column (QIAGEN).
The column was washed with  20 volumes of 500 mM NaCl and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH  8.0.
The Fv fragment was eluted in 5 mL of 300 mM  imidazole, pH 7.5.
The protein was then dialyzed against  PBS containing 1 mM EDTA.
  9668 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 30, 1996 DallAcqua et al.  + +  + +Further purification of both scFvD1.3 and FvE5.2 was  carried out by size exclusion chromatography on a ZORBAX  GF-250 column (Dupont) in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer,  pH 7.4, where they eluted as single peaks of approximately  25 kDa.
Final yields were typically 0.5-1.0 mg/L of culture.
  Site-Directed Mutagenesis.
Mutagenesis of scFvD13  (McCafferty et al., 1990) was carried out after subcloning  of the gene as an HindIII/EcoRI fragment into M13mp18 as  described (Kunkel et al., 1987) with a Muta-Gene M13 in  Vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA).
The  mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to replace the  wild-type codons with that for alanine (GCT).
Prior to  expression, all mutations were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing method (Sanger, 1977) using a Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (USB, Cleveland, OH).
  BIAcore Analysis of HEL-scFVD1.3 and FVE5.2-  scFVD1.3 Interactions.
The interaction of soluble scFvD1.3  with immobilized HEL was monitored by surface plasmon  resonance detection using a BIAcore instrument (Pharmacia  Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden).
All proteins were purified by  gel filtration prior to use as described above in order to  eliminate aggregated material which could interfere with  affinity measurements (van der Merwe et al., 1993, 1994).
  Protein concentrations were calculated using 1% extinction  coefficients at 280 nm of 1.50 for both scFvD1.3 and FvE5.2  and 2.62 for HEL.
The latter was coupled to the dextran  matrix of a CM5 sensor chip (Pharmacia Biosensor) using  an Amine Coupling Kit as described (Johnsson et al., 1991).
  Lysozyme, whose isoelectric point is above 10, was dialyzed  against 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0.
The protein  concentration ranged from 25 to 100 g/mL. The activation  and immobilization periods were both set to between 3 and  7 min at a flow rate of 5 L/min.
Excess reactive esters  were quenched by injection of 35 L of 1.0 M ethanolamine  hydrochloride, pH 8.5.
Typically, between 200 and 1500  resonance units (RU) of HEL was immobilized under these  conditions.
Single chain FvD1.3 and the mutants were  dialyzed against Hepes-buffered saline (HBS) containing 150  mM NaCl, 0.005% Surfactant P-20 (Pharmacia), and 10 mM  Hepes, pH 7.5; dilutions were made in the same buffer.
All  binding experiments were performed at 25 C.
Pulses of  10 mM HCl were used to regenerate the surfaces.
  Runs were analyzed using the software BIAevaluation 2.1  (Pharmacia).
Association constants (KAs) were determined  from Scatchard analysis by measuring the concentration of  free reactants and complex at equilibrium.
In equilibrium  binding BIAcore experiments (Karlsson et al., 1991; van der  Merwe et al., 1993, 1994; Raghavan et al., 1994; Malchiodi  et al., 1995), the concentration of the complex can be  assessed directly as the steady-state response.
The concentration of free analyte (scFvD1.3 or FvE5.2) is equal to the  bulk analyte concentration since analyte is constantly replenished during sample injection.
The concentration of free  ligand on the surface of the sensor chip can be derived from  the concentration of the complex and from the total binding  capacity of the surface as  KA ) Req/C(Rmax - Req)  where C is the free analyte concentration, Req is the steadystate response, and Rmax is the total surface binding capacity.
  Rearranging, we obtain  Req/C ) KARmax - KAReq  A plot of Req/C versus Req at different analyte concentrations  thus gives a straight line from which KA can be calculated;  Rmax is derived from the intercept on the x-axis.
Standard  deviations for two or more independent determinations were  <30%.
  Measurements of the binding of FvE5.2 to scFvD1.3 were  carried out essentially as described above except that  streptavidin was immobilized to capture biotinylated scFvD1.3.
  Briefly, streptavidin (Sigma) at 200 g/mL in 10 mM sodium  acetate, pH 4.5, was coupled to the sensor chip under the  same conditions as described above for HEL.
Biotinylation  of scFvD1.3 was performed using an Immunoprobe biotinylation kiet (Sigma).
Binding of biotinylated scFvD1.3 to  immobilized streptavidin was carried out at pH 7.2 at  concentrations ranging from 50 to 100 g/mL in PBS at a  flow rate of 5 L/min; this typically resulted in the  immobilization of between 200 and 500 RU.
Association  constants for the binding of FvE5.2 to scFvD1.3 were  determined by Scatchard analysis as for the binding of  scFvD1.3 to HEL.
  Fluorescence Measurements.
Fluorescence emission spectra showed quenching of tryptophan fluorescence on formation of a complex of scFvD1.3 (wild type or mutant) with  FvE5.2.
Measurements were performed at 25 C in HBS  containing 0.005% Surfactant P-20 on a SPEX FloroMAX  spectrofluorometer (SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ) run by  SPEX DM3000 software and equipped with a temperature  controller and magnetic stirrer.
Affinity constants were  determined by titrating D1.3 with E5.2 and monitoring the  fluorescence at a single wavelength (Ward, 1985; Foote &  Winter, 1992).
An excitation wavelength of 290 nm (1 nm  slit) was used; fluorescence emission was recorded at 390  nm (5 nm slit).
This wavelength was chosen as opposed to  the fluorescence maximum of the D1.3 emission spectra, or  the fluorescence difference spectra, as the fractional quench  at 390 nm was at least 15% for all the mutants tested.
  Fluorescence emission was measured for a 3 mL sample  of antibody (20-100 nM).
In a typical titration, aliquots of  concentrated FvE5.2 stock were added to final concentrations  of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 nM. Data were collected  over 2 min, and 10 min was allowed between the addition  of FvE5.2 and fluorescence measurement.
The fluorescence  emission for a blank titration of FvE5.2 to the same final  concentrations was also collected.
The E5.2 titration gave  a linear increase in fluorescence over the whole concentration  range, while the D1.3 titrations with E5.2 showed an initial  decrease in fluorescence before a linear rise.
The surfactant  in HBS prevented the loss of fluorescence due to adsorption  to the glass.
  The data were processed on a Macintosh running KaleidaGraph.
For each concentration of E5.2, a value F was  calculated according to  F ) (fluorescence measured -  fluorescence of D1.3 alone) - fluorescence of E5.2  and a plot of F versus concentration of E5.2 was constructed.

  Sedimentation Equilibrium.
Equilibrium sedimentation  experiments were performed on a Beckman XL-A Optima  analytical ultracentrifuge using a four-hole An-55 rotor at  25 C and a rotor speed of 28 000 rpm.
Data were acquired  as an average of 25 measurements of absorbance at each  radial position, with a nominal spacing of 0.001 cm between  radial positions.
Samples were prepared in PBS.
A molar  extinction coefficient of 36 000 M-1 cm-1 was used for both  scFvD1.3 and FvE5.2.
Partial specific volumes were assumed to be 0.73 mL/mg, and solvent densities were  determined pychnometrically.
Equilibrium sedimentation  data on the individual scFvD1.3 and FvE5.2 species obtained  at either two different rotor speeds or two initial protein  concentrations were analyzed for average molecular weights  in terms of a single, homogeneous species according to  cr ) B + cm exp[M (1 - F)  2  (r  2 - rm  2  )/2RT]  where cr is the concentration of the protein at a given radial  position, cm is the concentration of the protein at some  reference position (e.g., the meniscus), M is the molecular  weight,  is the partial specific volume, F is the solvent  density,  is the angular velocity, r is the radial position in  centimeters from the center of rotation, rm is the distance in  centimeters from the center of rotation to the meniscus, R is  the gas constant, T is the absolute (Kelvin) temperature, and  B is a correction term for a nonzero baseline.
  Equilibrium constants for the association of FvE5.2 and  the scFvD1.3 VHW52A mutant were calculated from the data  obtained at sedimentation equilibrium according to  cr ) B + cm,D exp[MD(1 - r)  2  (r  2 - rm  2  )/2RT] +  (cm,E) exp[ME(1 - r)  2  (r  2 - rm  2  )/2RT] +  (cm,D)(cm,E)/(1/KA) exp[MC(1 - F)  2  (r  2 - rm  2  )/2RT]  where cm,D is the concentration of scFvD1.3 at the reference  position, cm,E is the concentration of FvE5.2 at the reference  position, MD and ME are the molecular weights of the  scFvD1.3 and FvE5.2 as determined in separate sedimentation equilibrium experiments, MC is the molecular weight  of the complex, and KA is the association constant for the  scFvD1.3-FvE5.2 interaction.
Parameters were evaluated  using nonlinear least-squares analysis (Johnson et al., 1981)  or by using a modified version of IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake  Oswego, OR) running on a Macintosh computer (Brooks et  al., 1993, 1994).
Data for two different concentrations or  two rotor speeds were analyzed simultaneously as a test for  homogeneity and reversibility (Roark, 1976) and to constrain  confidence intervals for the parameter values (Johnson &  Fraser, 1985).
Errors on KAs were about 20% of parameter  values.
  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Determination of Equilibrium Constants for the Binding  of scFVD1.3 to HEL and FVE5.2 by Surface Plasmon  Resonance Detection.
For all BIAcore experiments, FvE5.2,  scFvD1.3, and mutants of scFvD1.3 were purified to >90%  homogeneity, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1); scFvD1.3  migrated as a single species of about 30 kDa, while FvE5.2  migrated as two closely spaced bands of approximately 15  kDa, corresponding to the VH and VL polypeptide chains.
In  order to analyze the interaction of mutants of scFvD1.3 with  HEL, the latter was coupled directly to the dextran matrix  through primary amine groups of the protein.
Injection of  different concentrations of scFvD1.3 over the immobilized  ligand gave concentration-dependent binding.
Typical surface plasmon resonance profiles for equilibrium binding of  wild-type scFvD1.3 and the mutant VLH30A to HEL are  shown in Figure 2 (panels A and B).
To estimate apparent  KAs, concentrations of scFvD1.3 ranging from 5 nM to 20  M were used, depending on the affinity of the particular  mutant: higher concentrations of scFvD1.3 were required  to approach saturation for low-affinity mutants.
In all cases,  equilibrium binding levels were reached within 7 min.
To  estimate the increase in RU resulting from the nonspecific  effect of protein on the bulk refractive index, binding of  scFvD1.3 to a control surface with no immobilized ligand  was also measured (data not shown).
Typically, this  nonspecific signal was not significant for analyte concentrations up to 1 M. The Scatchard plots for the binding of  wild-type scFvD1.3 and the VLH30A mutant, after correction  for nonspecific binding, are shown in Figure 2 (panels C  and D).
The plots were linear, and apparent KAs were  calculated as the slopes of the straight lines.
Following the  last injection of scFvD1.3, the analyte was reinjected at one  of the initial concentrations to determine whether HEL on  the dextran matrix had undergone significant denaturation  as the result of repeated regenerations of the surface with  10 mM HCl.
Very similar signals were obtained even  following 15 regenerations, indicating that the immobilized  ligand effectively retained its original binding activity.
The  predicted maximum specific binding, calculated from the  x-intercept assuming a linear relationship between the mass  of bound protein and the measured RU (Granzow et al.,  1992), indicated that at least 85% of the HEL molecules on  the chip were available for binding.
  Efforts to examine binding in the reverse orientation (i.e.,  with scFvD1.3 on the sensor surface and HEL in solution)  were not successful.
Although specific binding was detected,  the weak and nonreproducible response upon injection of  HEL precluded quantitative analysis.
Similar difficulties  FIGURE 1: SDS-PAGE profile of purified wild-type scFvD1.3 and  FvE5.2.
Samples were run in PhastGel Homogeneous 20 gels.

This prompted us to confirm our BIAcore  measurements by sedimentation equilibrium and fluorescence  quench titration (see below), techniques which do not require  ligand immobilization.
  The interaction of scFvD1.3 with FvE5.2 was analyzed  after biotinylation of scFvD1.3 and capture of this species  on a sensor chip derivatized with streptavidin.
Direct  immobilization of scFvD1.3 resulted in sensograms which  indicated that less than 30% of the immobilized scFvD1.3  molecules were available for binding (data not shown),  implying that coupling of this ligand through its amine groups  led to partial inactivation.
The biotinylation step greatly  improved the quality of sensorgrams, with nearly 70% of  the immobilized scFvD1.3 molecules now active.
This result  is most easily explained by the ability of the spacer arm of  the biotinylation reagent (biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester) to prevent steric hindrance to binding  resulting from direct immobilization of the ligand.
Depending on the affinities of the mutants tested, FvE5.2 concentrations in equilibrium titrations ranged from 5 nM to 40 M.  As before, significant nonspecific effects on bulk refractive  index were observed only for high FvE5.2 concentrations.
  Typical binding profiles and corresponding Scatchard plots  are shown in Figure 3.
Controls to establish that the integrity  of the streptavidin-biotin interaction and the binding activity  of scFvD1.3 were not appreciably affected by repeated  washes with HCl were carried out as described above by  reinjecting FvE5.2 at several previously tested concentrations.
  We stress the importance of using a single chain Fv fragment  for immobilization since the relatively stringent regeneration  conditions could potentially result in the dissociation of VH  and VL domains, leading to artifactually weak signals.
  The KA for the interaction of wild-type scFvD1.3 with  HEL (5.0  107 M-1  ) agrees well with the value determined  by fluorescence quenching (6.7  107 M-1  ; Hawkins et al.,  1992).
Association constants for the interaction of HEL with  the mutants VHT30A, VHW52A, VHD54A, VHR99A, and VHY101F (Table 1) are also in reasonable agreement with the  values determined by fluorescence quench titration for the  dimeric version of the same mutants (Hawkins et al.,  1994): 5.5  107 M-1 versus 2.3  108 M-1, 2.7  107  M-1 versus 3.3  107 M-1, 1.7  107 M-1 versus 1.0  107  M-1  , 5.9  107 M-1 versus 1.2  108 M-1, and 1.0  107  M-1 versus 4.9  106 M-1, respectively.

  Fluorescence quench titration and sedimentation equilibrium  measurements were carried out on the scFvD1.3-FvE5.2  reaction as described below to obtain independent checks  on the KA values obtained from BIAcore.
  Measurement of D1.3-E5.2 Binding Affinities by Fluorescence Quenching and Sedimentation Equilibrium.
While  the BIAcore method for determining affinities is rapid and  convenient, it requires immobilization of one of the interacting species, a potential source of artifacts.
A major  advantage of sedimentation equilibrium and fluorescence  quench titration is that, in these methods, both interacting  species are in solution.
Figure 4 shows fluorescence  quenching curves for the binding of wild-type scFvD1.3 and  a mutant, VHD58A, to FvE5.2.
As shown in Table 1, the  calculated KAs (2.7  108 M-1 and 1.7  107 M-1,  respectively) agree to within a factor of 3 with the BIAcore  values (9.3  107 M-1 and 6.2  106 M-1, respectively).
  These differences could be due to subtle effects on scFvD1.3  conformation and/or accessibility arising from the immobilization procedure.
The KA value for the VHW52A  mutant obtained by sedimentation equilibrium (9.1  104  M-1  ; Figure 5) is in good agreement with that from BIAcore  (8.6  104 M-1).
We therefore conclude that the BIAcore  method is appropriate for affinity measurements in the  scFvD1.3-FvE5.2 system over a KA range of 104  -108 M-1  .
  Comparison of the Recognition of HEL and E5.2 by D1.3.
  Crystallographic studies have shown that, of the 18 D1.3  residues that contact E5.2 and the 17 that contact HEL, 13  are in contact with both E5.2 and HEL (Fields et al., 1995;  Bhat et al., 1994).
To evaluate the relative contribution to  binding of D1.3 residues in contact with E5.2 and/or HEL  in the crystal structures, a total of 16 single alanine mutants  of D1.3 were produced and characterized.
The binding  FIGURE 3: (A) Binding of FvE5.2 to the immobilized scFv D1.3  VLY32A mutant.
FvE5.2 was injected at 13 different concentrations  ranging from 70 nM to 0.9 M over a surface on which 500 RU of  VLY32A had been captured on a streptavidin-derivatized chip as  described under Materials and Methods.

Because the VHY101A  mutant could not be purified on either HEL or E5.2 affinity  columns due to its poor affinity for both species, a more  conservative mutant, VHY101F, was constructed.
The KA  of the VHY101A mutant for both HEL and E5.2 may be  estimated at <8.6  104 M-1, the affinity of the VHW52A  mutant for E5.2, since this latter mutant can be purified by  E5.2 chromatography.
  Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of D1.3 residues in contact  with HEL in the crystal structure of the FvD1.3-HEL  complex (Bhat et al., 1994) reveals that residues in complementarity-determining region 1 of VL (VLCDR1) and VHCDR3 contribute more to binding than residues in VLCDR2,  VLCDR3, VHCDR1, and VHCDR2 (Table 1).
By far the  greatest reductions in affinity (Gmutant - Gwild type > 2.5  kcal/mol) occurred on substituting three residues: VLW92,  VHD100, and VHY101.
Significant effects (1.0-2.0 kcal/  mol) were also seen for substitutions at positions VLY32 and  VHE98, even though the latter is not involved in direct  contacts with HEL.
Mutations at nine other contact positions  (VLH30, VLY49, VLY50, VLS93, VHY32, VHW52, VHD54,  VHD58, and VHR99) had little or no effect (<1.0 kcal/mol).
  Therefore, the binding of HEL by D1.3 appears to be largely  mediated by only 5 of the 14 residues tested.
This is similar  to findings in the case of human growth hormone binding  to its receptor (Cunningham & Wells, 1993; Clackson &  Wells, 1995).
  For the interaction of D1.3 with E5.2, affinity measurements show that VHCDR2, VHCDR3, and VLCDR1 of D1.3  are more important for binding E5.2 than VHCDR1, VLCDR2, and VLCDR3 (Table 1).
Overall, D1.3 VH residues  appear to contribute more to the free energy of binding than  VL residues, since the most destabilizing alanine substitutions  (>2.5 kcal/mol) are located in VHCDR2 (W52A and D54A)  and VHCDR3 (E98A, D100A, and Y101A).
Significant  effects (1.0-2.0 kcal/mol) were also observed for the  following contact residues: H30 and Y32 in VLCDR1, Y49  in VLCDR2, Y32 in VHCDR1, N56 and D58 in VHCDR2,  and R99 in VHCDR3.
Mutations at positions VLY50, VLW92, and VHT30 had little or no effect (<1.0 kcal/mol).
  Thus, of the 15 contact residues tested, 12 make significant  contributions to binding E5.2.
  It has been proposed that the formation of specific  protein-protein complexes is mediated by only a few  productive interactions which dominate the energetics of  association (Novotny et al., 1989; Clackson & Wells, 1995;  Nuss et al., 1993).
In agreement with this notion, our  analysis of the scFvD1.3-HEL interaction reveals that only  a small subset of the total combining site residues of D1.3  appears to account for a large proportion of the binding  energy; most residues (9 of 14) make little or no apparent  net contribution (<1.0 kcal/mol).
This contrasts with the  interaction of D1.3 with E5.2 in which nearly all the  contacting residues play a demonstrable role in binding ligand  (>1.0 kcal/mol), even though a number of hot spots (G  > 2.5 kcal/mol) are clearly present.
Therefore, stabilization  of the D1.3-E5.2 complex is achieved by the accumulation  of many productive interactions of varying strengths over  the entire interface between the two proteins.
  Relationship between Structural and Functional Epitopes.
  Figure 6 shows the functional epitopes of D1.3 involved in  binding HEL and E5.2 mapped onto its three-dimensional  structure.
With the exception of VLW92, which lies at the  periphery, the residues of D1.3 most important for binding  FIGURE 5: Sedimentation equilibrium of an equimolar mixture of  the VHW52A mutant with FvE5.2.

Residues are color-coded according to the loss  of binding free energy upon alanine substitution: red, >4 kcal/  mol; yellow, 2-4 kcal/mol; green, 1-2 kcal/mol; blue, <1 kcal/  mol.
  Binding of Different Proteins to the Same Antibody Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 30, 1996 9673  + +  + +HEL (VHY101, VHD100, VLY32, and VHE98) are located  in a contiguous patch at the center of the combining site  (Figure 6).
Residues at the periphery make only minor  contributions to the binding energy.
A similar pattern is  observed for the FvD1.3-FvE5.2 complex, with the most  important residues (VLY32, VHW52, VHD54, VHE98, VHD100, and VHY101) forming a central band of key contacts.
  For the most part, however, the hot spots for the two  interactions do not overlap.
For instance, alanine substitution  at position VLW92 of D1.3 produces a 100-fold decrease in  affinity for HEL but does not appreciably affect binding to  E5.2 (Table 1).
Conversely, the VHW52A substitution  decreases affinity for E5.2 1000-fold but has virtually no  effect on binding to HEL.
Only substitutions VHD100A and  VHY101A greatly affect the binding to both HEL and E5.2.
  Residue VHY101 contacts HEL and E5.2 mainly through its  aromatic side chain while VHD100 forms an internal salt  bridge with VHR102, which may be important for maintaining the conformation of the VHCDR3 loop of D1.3 (Bhat et  al., 1994; Fields et al., 1995).
  In both complexes, hot spots include hydrophobic (VLW92, VHW52, and VHY101) as well as polar residues (VHD54, VHE98, and VHD100).
The data do not show any  particular relation between the hydrophobicity of the substituted residue and impact on the binding constant.
Both  polar and nonpolar residues were also found to play a  prominent role in the interaction of human growth hormone  with a monoclonal antibody directed against it (Jin et al.,  1992).
These results contrast with those on the binding of  growth hormone to its receptor showing that substantial  reductions in affinity are only associated with substitution  of hydrophonbic residues (Clackson & Wells, 1995).
Moreover, the effects of conversion of a number of hydrophobic  side chains of D1.3 to alanine are weaker than would be  expected if one considers that each buried methylene group  contributes -1.0 to -1.5 kcal/mol (Shortle, 1992).
For  example, substitution of D1.3 residues VLY50 and VLW92,  whose side chains make a number of van der Waals contacts  with residues of E5.2, causes losses in binding energy of  only 0.7 and 0.3 kcal/mol, respectively.
Similar results are  found for mutants VHY32A and VHW52A in the case of the  D1.3-HEL interaction.
  Chothia and Janin (1975) found that a change in buried  surface area generally correlated with the free energy of  association between two proteins.
In Figure 7 we show the  apparent contribution of every substituted residue of D1.3  FIGURE 7: (A) Differences in binding free energy changes (G) between alanine mutants in the VL domain of scFvD1.3 and the wildtype protein for the interaction with HEL and FvE5.2. (B) Same as (A) for substitutions in the VH domain.
A negative value at position  VH58 indicates a slight increase in apparent affinity for HEL upon alanine substitution.
The G values for VHY101 are for the mutant  VHY101F, since the affinity of the corresponding alanine mutant for both HEL and E5.2 was too low to permit purification (see Results  and Discussion).

It is  clear that buried surface area does not correlate well with  the energetic importance of individual residues.
In a few  cases, this is likely due to secondary effects of the substitution  on the conformation of key contact residues.
For example,  replacement of D1.3 residue VHE98 greatly reduces affinity  for FvE5.2 (4.2 kcal/mol).
This residue is mostly buried in  the free D1.3 combining site and becomes only slightly more  buried when E5.2 binds (Figure 7).
Thus, the observed effect  on affinity may result from structural perturbations propagated from the alanine mutation to neighboring residues in  the functional epitope (VHY101, VHW52, and VHD54).
In  the majority of cases, however, the results are not so readily  explained.
Thus, VHW52 makes a similar number of  contacts, over a comparable area, with HEL as it does with  E5.2 (Bhat et al., 1994; Fields et al., 1995), yet the  corresponding alanine mutant binds the former 1000-fold  more strongly than the latter.
A poor correlation between  buried surface area and relative contribution to binding was  also noted by Cunningham and Wells (1993), who suggested  that the role of individual contacts, because of microscopic  heterogeneity, could not be predicted from the buried surface  area.
It may be that, for some residues showing a large  buried surface area, the energetic cost of desolvation is  comparable to, or exceeds, the energy gained through  intermolecular interactions upon formation of the complex,  in agreement with the view that burial of hydrophobic  residues and release of water molecules are not necessarily  the major contributor to the stabilization of protein-protein  complexes (Ross & Subramanian, 1981; Bhat et al., 1994).
  Another possibility is that functionally neutral side chains  are disordered in the free D1.3 molecule so that a large part  of the binding energy is used to freeze them in the  complex.
However, these side chains are well ordered in  the 1.8  resolution crystal structure of free FvD1.3 (Bhat  et al., 1990) and, furthermore, do not undergo major  conformation changes upon complex formation with HEL  or E5.2.
  We have shown that a single set of contact residues on  D1.3 binds HEL and FvE5.2 in energetically different ways.
  Thus, although D1.3 recognizes these two proteins in ways  that are structurally very similar, this similarity extends only  partially to the functional epitopes.
This is in agreement  with the work of Tulip et al. (1994), who found that the  anti-neuraminidase antibodies NC10 and NC41 recognize the  same protein surface through different key residues.
We  have also shown that, while the binding of D1.3 to HEL is  dominated by only a few residues, the majority of contact  residues contribute significantly to binding E5.2.
Two broad  categories of functional epitopes may be therefore defined:  (i) ones in which ligand binding is mediated by a small subset  of contact residues and (ii) ones in which the free energy of  binding arises from many productive interactions distributed  over the entire protein-protein interface.
