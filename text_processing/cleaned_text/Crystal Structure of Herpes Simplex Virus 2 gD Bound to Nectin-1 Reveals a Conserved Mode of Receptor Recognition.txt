All Rights Reserved.2  28 Abstract  29 Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are among the most   30 prevalent human pathogens.
Both viruses can recognize, via the surface envelope   31 glycoprotein D (gD), human nectin-1 as a functional receptor.
Previous studies have   32 successfully elucidated the molecular basis of the binding between HSV-1 gD and   33 nectin-1 by co-crystallography.
Despite a high sequence identity between HSV-1 and   34 -2 gDs, the atomic inter-molecule details for HSV-2-gD/nectin-1 interaction remain   35 elusive.
Here, we reported the crystal structures of both the unbound and the   36 nectin-1-bound HSV-2 gD. The free gD structure expectedly comprises an IgV-like   37 core and the surface-exposed terminal extensions as observed in its HSV-1   38 counterpart, but lacks traceable electron densities for a large portion of the terminal   39 elements.
These terminal residues were clearly traced in the complex structure as a   40 definitive loop in the N-terminus and an helix in the C-terminus, thereby showing a   41 conserved nectin-1-binding mode as reported for HSV-1 gD. The interface residues in   42 nectin-1 were further mutated and tested for the gD-interaction by surface plasmon   43 resonance.
The resultant binding patterns were similar between HSV-1 and -2 gDs,   44 further supporting a homologous receptor-binding basis by the two viruses for   45 nectin-1.
These data, together with a cell-based fusion assay showing a   46 cross-inhibition of the gD/nectin-1 mediated cell-cell fusion by soluble HSV-1 and -2   47 gDs, provided solid structural and functional evidence that HSV-1/-2 recognizes   48 nectin-1 via the same binding mode.
Finally, we also demonstrated that nectin-1 I80 is   49 an important residue involved in gD interaction.
  50   51 Key words: herpes simplex virus type 2; glycoprotein D; free- and nectin-1-bound   52 structures; structural basis; conserved binding mode   53 3  54 Importance   55 Despite intensified studies, a detailed picture of the molecular features in the   56 HSV-2-gD/nectin-1 interaction remains unavailable.
Previous work focused on HSV-1   57 gD, which folds into an IgV-like core with large terminal extensions and utilizes the   58 extension elements to engage nectin-1.
Here, we reported the crystal structures of   59 HSV-2 gD in both the free and the nectin-1-bound forms.
The atomic inter-molecule   60 details for HSV-2-gD/nectin-1 interaction were clearly presented.
The observed   61 binding mode is identical to that reported for its HSV-1 counterpart.
This structural   62 observation was further supported by our comparative functional assays showing that   63 nectin-1 mutations similarly affect the ligand/receptor interaction of both virus gDs.
  64 Taken together, we provided comprehensive structural and functional data   65 demonstrating a conserved receptor-binding mode between HSV-1 and -2 for nectin-1.
  66 Our results also indicate that the tropism-difference between the two viruses likely   67 arises from other aspects rather than the gD/nectin-1 binding-features.
  68 4  69 Introduction   70 Herpes simplex virus (HSV) belongs to the alphaherpesvirus subfamily in the   71 herpesviridae family (1).
Two HSV types have been identified thus far, including   72 HSV-1 and HSV-2, both of which can infect human.
The two viruses can infect   73 neurons and thereby cause neurological diseases. They could also establish latency in   74 sensory neurons and result in the infected patients being a life-long virus carrier (2).
  75 Although HSV infections are usually asymptomatic, intermittent reactivation of the   76 latent viruses can lead to severe diseases and sometimes be life-threatening in   77 immuno-compromized individuals (1).
The asymptomatic nature of HSV infection is   78 also considered to facilitate the virus spread in the population (3).
HSV-1 primarily   79 causes oral and ocular lesions, and is also related to the genital infections though less   80 frequently (4-5).
HSV-2 mainly causes genital tissue damages (5-6).
  81 HSV infection starts with the virus entry into susceptible host cells (1, 7).
This   82 entry process is a complicated multi-event that involves orchestrated interplays   83 between the glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope and the host surface   84 molecules and receptors (7-9).
The current thesis indicates the involvement of at least   85 5 (out of 11) virus envelope glycoproteins in HSV entry, including glycoproteins B, C,   86 D, H and L (gB, gC, gD, gH and gL) (7-9).
The initial attachment of the virus   87 particles on cell surface could be mediated by gB or gC, which can recognize sugar   88 moieties like heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) (10-11).
This is normally   89 followed by a specific interaction between gD and its canonical receptors (12-13).
The   90 final entry step of membrane fusion, then, occurs at either the plasma (14) or the 5  91 endosome (15) membrane mediated by an activated core fusion machinery composed   92 of gB and gH/gL (16-19).
In this cascade of events, the gD/receptor interaction is   93 suggested as a key factor for successful virus entry.
In addition to tethering virus   94 particles onto cells expressing specific gD receptors, it is also believed that gD   95 binding to receptor would displace its C-terminal profusogenic domain (PFD),   96 thereby activating the gB/gH/gL fusion executor (20-22).
Furthermore, gD is also an   97 important contributing factor to a broad cell-type tropism of HSV by engaging   98 diversified cellular receptors (23).
Thus far, a series of host molecules have been   99 reported to be recognized by HSV gD. These include herpes virus entry mediator   100 (HVEM) (24), nectin-1 (25), nectin-2 (26) and 3-O-sulfonated-heparan sulfate   101 (3-O-S-HS) (27), of which nectin-1 plays an indispensable role in the infection and   102 pathogenesis of both HSV-1 and -2 (28-30).
  Nectin-1 belongs to the Ca2+ 103 -independent cell adhesion molecule family and   104 functions via homo- or hetero-dimerization in the formation of adheren junctions (31).
  105 The molecule also serves as a functional receptor for both HSV-1 and -2 (12), and is   106 shown to play a more determinant role than other gD receptors (eg.
HVEM) in HSV-2   107 infection (28-29).
With a truncated gD molecule (spanning residues 1-285) that   108 according to previous reports (32-34) shows a much higher affinity for receptors than   109 the longer gD form (spanning residues 1-306), the molecular basis of the binding   110 between HSV-1 gD and nectin-1 has been successfully elucidated via co-structures   111 (35-36).
It was revealed that the gD molecule contains a V-set immunoglobulin-like   112 (IgV-like) core that is wrapped by large terminal extensions, and utilizes the extensive 6  113 N- and C-terminal extension elements to engage nectin-1 (35-36).
This forms a   114 striking contrast to the binding mode of HSV-1 gD with HVEM, which shows the   115 utilization of an N-terminal hairpin in gD for receptor binding (37).
Nevertheless,   116 either way of receptor engagement by HVEM or nectin-1 should displace a   117 pre-located C-terminal loop in gD as observed in a previous dimeric structure (38).
  118 This characteristic structure is consistent with earlier functional analyses showing that   119 the exposure of the gD PFD is a key step in triggering fusion (20-21).
The current   120 structural investigations, however, are almost exclusively based on the HSV-1 gD   121 protein.
Inspired by the high sequence identity (~85%) between HSV-1 and -2 gDs,   122 there has been functional evidence showing that the two viral proteins exhibit similar   123 affinities for nectin-1 (39) and are inter-changeable in virus infection (40) and entry   124 inhibition (41).
In addition, a recent study reported a complex structure between   125 HSV-2 gD and a human monocolonal antibody E317, which reveals quite similar   126 structures between HSV-1 and -2 gD proteins (42).
These results point to a   127 homologous nectin-1 binding mode of the two viruses.
Nevertheless, the molecular   128 basis on the HSV-2 gD recognition by nectin-1 remains elusive, despite an   129 indispensable role of nectin-1 in HSV-2 infection.
  130 In this study, we presented the atomic inter-molecule details for HSV-2-gD/nectin-1   131 interaction via the crystal structures of HSV-2 gD in both the free and the   132 receptor-bound forms.
We further conducted a thorough mutational analysis   133 characterizing the binding properties of nectin-1 with both HSV-1 and -2 gDs.
A   134 conserved receptor binding mode between the two viruses for nectin-1 was solidly 7  135 confirmed.
In addition, we also demonstrated that nectin-1 I80 acts as an important   136 interface residue for gD interaction, in addition to previously identified key amino   137 acids including N77, M85 and F129 (36, 43-44).
  138   139 Materials and Methods:   140 Preparation of the proteins   141 The soluble proteins of HSV-1 gD and nectin-1 were prepared as previously   142 described (35), and HSV-2 gD (the gene of HSV-2 gD was a kind gift from Dr. Peng   143 Tao at Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of   144 Sciences) was prepared similarly as HSV-1 gD. In brief, the HSV-1 (strain KOS) and   145 -2 (strain 333) gD-ectodomain proteins (residues 1-285) were expressed in Hi5 cells   146 using recombinant baculoviruses.
The GP67 signal sequence was engineered to the   147 N-terminus of gD to facilitate protein secretion, and a C-terminal hexa-his tag was   148 used for affinity chromatography purification.
The pooled gD proteins from the   Ni-NTA column were further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 149 200 (GE)   150 column.
  151 The nectin-1 ectodomain protein (residues 30-335) was obtained by refolding of the   152 E. coli expressed inclusion bodies which were first added into a buffer consisting of   153 100 mM Tris, pH9.0, 400 mM L-arginine, 2 mM EDTA, 4 M urea, 5 mM reduced   154 glutathione and 1 mM oxidized glutathione and then sequentially dialysed against   155 water and a buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 9.0, 10 mM NaCl.
The refolded protein   was then concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 156 200 column for further 8  157 purification.
  158 Comparative mutagenesis study by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)  159 A QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was used to obtain the nectin-1   160 expressing plasmids with the indicated mutations.
The mutant proteins were prepared   161 using the same refolding and purification procedure as described for the WT nectin-1.
  162 All the purified proteins were then exchanged to a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES   163 (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% Tween-20, concentrated to   164 approximately 4 mg/ml, and stored at 4 C for further use.
   The binding assay was carried out with a BIAcore 165 3000 system (GE Healthcare).
  166 The gD protein (HSV-1 or -2) was immobilized on CM5 chips at ~750 response units   167 using a standard amine coupling method, and was then tested for the binding by 1 M   168 of the individual nectin-1 proteins (WT or mutant) at room temperature.
The bound   169 protein in response unit was recorded for comparison.
  170 Kinetic study   The kinetic analysis was performed by SPR using the BIAcore 171 3000 system.
  172 Gradient concentrations of HSV-1 or -2 gD protein was flowed at 30 l/min over   173 nectin-1 (WT or mutant) immobilized at ~750 response units, and tested for the   174 binding at 25 C.
The running buffer is composed of 10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 150   175 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% Tween-20.
In each run, 10 mM NaOH was used   176 to regenerate the chip.
The binding data were fitted using the 1:1 Langmuir binding   177 model or the steady state affinity model for dissociation constant (KD) calculations.
  178 The calculated kinetic parameters were summarized in Table 1.
9  179 Crystallization, data collection and processing   180 The crystallization and diffraction data collection for free HSV-2 gD have been   181 described previously (45).
To obtain HSV-2-gD/nectin-1 complex crystals, the gD and   182 nectin-1 proteins were mixed at a 3:1 molar ratio and then used to screen the Hampton   183 Research kits via the vapor diffusion sitting drop method.
The conditions were then   184 optimized.
Diffractable crystals were finally obtained by mixing 1 l of the protein   185 preparation (3 mg/ml) with 1 l reservoir solution consisting of 0.2 M sodium   186 chloride, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH6.0 and 8% w/v PEG 8000, followed by   187 incubation at 18 C for about two weeks.
  188 The diffraction data of the complex crystal were collected at beamline BL17U of   189 Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using the synchrotron radiation   190 (wavelength, 1.0000 ) at 100 K. The cryoprotectant solution is composed of 15%   191 v/v glycerol and 85% v/v reservoir solution.
Data were then processed with HKL2000   192 (46) for indexing, integration and scaling.
  193 Structure determination   194 Via molecular replacement using the PHASER (47) program in the CCP4 suite (48),   195 the free HSV-2 gD and the nectin-1 bound complex structures were solved with a free   196 HSV-1 gD structure (PDB code: 1L2G, Chain A) and a HSV-1-gD/nectin-1 complex   197 structure (PDB code: 3U82) as the search models, respectively.
The built structure   198 models were further refined using REFMAC (49) and Phenix (50) and manually   199 adjusted in coot (51) for several cycles.
In each cycle, the stereochemistry of the   200 model was monitored by PROCHECK (52).
The final data-processing and 10  201 structure-refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2.
The coordinates and the   202 related structural factors have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank with the   203 PDB codes of 4MYV for the free HSV-2 gD structure and 4MYW for the   204 HSV-2-gD/nectin-1 complex structure.
  205 Cell fusion blocking assay   206 The fusion mediated by HSV gB/gD/gH/gL and the receptors have been validated   207 in various cell types (21, 53).
In this study, we set up a cell-based fusion system using   208 the CHO-K1 cells as previously reported (53).
In brief, the genes of HSV-1 gB, gD,   209 gH, gL, HSV-2 gD and human nectin-1 were cloned into the pCDNA4.0-myc-his   210 vector to yield the respective plasmids for protein expression in mammalian cells.
The   211 T7-polymerase and T7-luciferase expression plasmids were constructed previously in   212 our lab.
The expressing plasmids for HSV-1 gB, gH, gL, HSV-1 or -2 gD and the   213 T7-luciferase and the plasmids for nectin-1 and the T7-polymerase were separately   co-transfected into CHO-K1 cells using lipo2000 214 (Invitrogen) according to the   215 manufacturers instructions.
Twelve hours post transfection, the nectin-1 expressing   216 cells were first incubated for 2 hours with gradient concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 2.5   217 M) of soluble gD proteins of HSV-1 or -2 or hNUDT16 (an irrelevant-protein that   218 was prepared as previously described (54)), and then mixed with the cells expressing   219 gB/gD/gH/gL and further incubated for 6 hours for cell fusion.
The luciferase activity   220 was tested using a Luciferase Assay System kit bought from Promega.
  221 The virus entry and entry-inhibition assays   222 A genetically modified HSV-1 virus with a luciferase gene has been described 11  223 previously (55).
For the virus entry assay, the WT nectin-1 construct (as used in the   224 cell fusion assay) and the mutant constructs with the indicated mutations (obtained by   site-directed mutagenesis) were used to transfect CHO-K1 cells using lipo2000 225 .
The   226 transfection efficiency was characterized by flowcytometry.
The cells in a 48-well   plate were then incubated with 100 l of virus solution (1106 227 pfu) for 2 hours.
After   228 washing and a 4-hour incubation in fresh medium, the cells were harvested, lysed and   229 tested for the luciferase activity.
The entry-inhibition assay follows the same   230 procedure as described for the entry assay except that the virus was incubated with the   231 WT or mutant nectin-1 proteins (final concentration of 100 g/ml) for 1 hour before it   232 is inoculated into the nectin-1-expressing cells.
  233   234 Results   235 The structure of free HSV-2 gD   236 We previously managed to collect a 1.8- resolution dataset from HSV-2 gD   237 crystals (45).
The solved structure, with an Rwork of 0.189 and an Rfree of 0.220 (Table   238 2), includes two gD molecules per asymmetric unit.
For each molecule, clear electron   239 densities could be traced for residues V37-R184 and L195-R222.
These amino acids   240 are arranged into a nine-stranded (A', B, C, C', C'', D, E, F and G) IgV-like core in the   241 center and several surface components of -helices (1, 1', 2) and loops wrapping   242 the center-core on the exterior (Fig. 1A).
Overall, this observed structure is very   243 similar to the previously reported gD structures.
For example, when superimposed,   244 the free gD structure obtained in this study shows a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) 12  245 of ~0.78  over 158 equivalent C atoms to a free HSV-1 gD structure (PDB code:   246 1L2G), an rmsd of ~0.85  over 160 C atoms to an HSV-1 gD structure binding with   247 HVEM (PDB code: 1JMA), an rmsd of ~0.77  over 156 C atoms to an HSV-1 gD   248 structure binding with nectin-1 (PDB code: 3U82), and an rmsd of ~0.71  over 155   249 C atoms to the recently reported HSV-2 gD structure in the antibody-binding form   250 (PDB code: 3W9E).
  251 Despite a conserved fold as revealed by the low rmsd values, our HSV-2 gD   252 structure exhibits an unexpected feature in the external extension region relative to the   253 afore-mentioned gD structures.
A large portion of the external elements, including   254 those covering residues P23-R36, A185-P194 and F223-A239, lacks traceable   255 electron densities in our structure.
The equivalent amino acids, however, are   256 consistently shown in the reference structures to form a long loop and a short strand   257 (str2) in the N-terminus, an intervening G-2 loop, and a long helix (3) in the   258 C-terminus, respectively (Fig. 1B).
Further conformational difference was observed in   259 the IgV-like core for the loops connecting strands C'' and D (the C''-D interloop) and   260 strands E and F (the E-F interloop) (Fig. 1C).
It is interesting that this E-F interloop   261 also exhibits different conformations between the two molecules in the HSV-2 gD   262 asymmetric unit, with one protomer (chain A) aligning similarly to but the other   263 protomer (chain B) orienting distantly from the reference gD structures (Fig. 1C).
  264 The complex structure of HSV-2 gD bound to nectin-1   265 To elucidate the molecular basis of the nectin-1 recognition by HSV-2 gD, complex   266 crystals were prepared and the structure was successfully solved at 3.2  resolution.
13  267 The constructed model, with an Rwork of 0.196 and an Rfree of 0.247 (Table 2),   268 contains two 1:1 binding complexes of the HSV-2 gD to nectin-1 in the asymmetric   269 unit.
For each complex, gD residues P23-P254 and nectin-1 amino acids V33-E335   270 are successfully traced in the electron density map.
On the whole, the gD molecule   271 shows a typical structure of an IgV-core wrapped by extensive terminal extensions,   272 and nectin-1 folds into an overall rod-like structure with tandem arranged V-C-C   273 Ig-like domains.
As expected, HSV-2 gD binds to the membrane-distal IgV-like   274 domain of nectin-1 (Fig. 2A).
In comparison to the free HSV-2 gD structure, many of   275 the untraceable terminal residues are unambiguously observed in the complex   276 structure, presenting as an extended loop in the N-terminus and an -helix (3) in the   277 C-terminus to engage the receptor (Fig. 2B).
  278 The overall binding mode between HSV-2 gD and nectin-1 is very similar to that   279 observed in a previously reported HSV-1-gD/nectin-1 complex structure (Fig. 2A).
  280 The binding relies on the surface components in the terminal extensions of HSV-2 gD   281 engaging the rear (CC'C''FG) sheet of the nectin-1 IgV domain (Fig. 2A).
A high   282 complementarity in both the shape and the hydrophobicity character is observed   283 between the two molecules at this interface, bearing extended surface areas of about   938.4 2   and 946.7 2 284 in gD and nectin-1, respectively.
We further detailed the   285 interface amino acids with a 4.5- resolution cut-off to characterize the   286 receptor/ligand footprints in these two interacting molecules.
A total of 24 residues are   287 revealed in HSV-2 gD and are observed to sterically congregate into two main surface   288 patches (patches 1 and 2), as reported for HSV-1 gD (35).
The patch1 residues, 14  289 including P23, L25-Q27, F223, N227, V231 and Y234, locate in the distal N-terminal   290 loop and the 3 helix.
While the remaining interface residues of R36-H39, Q132,   291 R134, P198 and V214-R222 form the much more extended surface patch2 (Fig. 2C).
  292 As expected, essentially the same patches of amino acids are also shown to be   293 responsible for the HSV-1-gD/nectin-1 interaction (Table 3).
  294 As to the receptor, the identified gD footprint in nectin-1 is composed of 26 amino   295 acids including S59, K61, T63, Q64, T66, Q68, G73-N77, I80-N82, M85-S88, L90,   296 E125, A127-T131 and N133.
Five residues (S59, K61 and F129-T131) are observed   297 to locate in the B-C and F-G loops, constituting a bottom loop region to contact   298 mainly patch1 of HSV-2 gD. While an upper sheet (the CC'C''FG sheet) region, with   299 the remaining interface residues, interacts in a much more extended manner with   300 HSV-2 gD patch2 (Fig. 2C).
This observed amino acid interaction pattern is the same   301 between the two HSV-2-gD/nectin-1 complexes of the asymmetric unit, and is also   302 very similar to that observed in the HSV-1-gD/nectin-1 complex structure (35).
  303 A comparative mutagenesis study on nectin-1 binding between HSV-1 and -2 gDs   304 Based on the complex structures, HSV-1 and -2 gDs contact essentially the same   305 series of rear-sheet residues in nectin-1 for recognition.
We, therefore, further sought   306 for functional evidence of a conserved nectin-1 binding mode between the two viral   307 gD proteins.
With an alanine-scanning mutagenesis in nectin-1, its interaction with   308 both HSV-1 and -2 gDs were characterized and compared by surface plasmon   309 resonance (SPR).
A total of 13 amino acids were selected (based on the complex   310 structure solved in this study and our previously solved HSV-1-gD/nectin-1 structure) 15  311 and mutated either individually or simultaneously.
The mutant proteins were then   312 prepared and purified as described for the wild type (WT) protein, and were further   313 tested for the binding to gD (HSV-1 and -2) proteins immobilized at ~750 response   314 units.
The binding capacity was thereby characterized as the amount of nectin-1 (WT   315 or mutant) in response unit that is capable of binding to gD when 1 M of the   316 individual nectin-1 proteins flow through the chip.
  317 Overall, the resultant binding patterns are very similar between HSV-1 and -2 gDs   318 (Fig. 3A).
A series of residues, including K61, T63, Q64, Q76, N82, L90, E125, P130   319 and N133, do not significantly affect the gD/nectin-1 interaction.
Nonetheless,   320 dramatically decreased gD binding is observed for nectin-1 mutants with substitutions   321 for residues N77, I80, M85 and F129, which exhibit about half (or less) of the binding   322 response units of the WT nectin-1.
This result is also consistent with previous studies   323 reporting the functional indispensability of nectin-1 N77, M85 and F129 in the   324 receptor recognition by HSV-1 gD (36, 43-44).
It is also noteworthy that the   325 tetra-mutant (simultaneously substituting T63, Q64, E125 and N133 with alanine)   326 nectin-1, which should be disrupted for the receptor homodimerization based on a   327 previous report (56), shows an increased binding capacity to both gD proteins (Fig.   328 3A).
  329 We further mapped the nectin-1 residues N77, I80, M85 and F129 onto the binding   330 interface in our complex structure.
F129, which locates in the F-G loop, inserts its   331 side-chain into a highly hydrophobic pocket formed by F223, V231 and the apolar   332 carbon atoms of Q227 in HSV-2 gD (Fig. 3B).
In the upper sheet region where the 16  333 remaining three amino acids reside, I80 and M85 are shown to extensively contact   334 HSV-2 gD Y38, Q131 and P221 via strong hydrophobic interactions, while N77 could   335 contribute to the ligand binding by providing H-bond interactions via both the   336 side-chain and main-chain nitrogens with gD D215 and M219 (Fig. 3C).
For the other   337 interface residues, their role in gD-recognition seems to be restricted to a limited   338 number of van-der-Waals contacts, explaining their individual dispensability.
  339 Corss-inhibition of the gD/nectin-1 mediated cell fusion by soluble HSV-1 and -2   340 gDs   341 The conserved nectin-1 binding mode between HSV-1 and -2 gDs was further   342 confirmed by a cell-fusion based mutual inhibition assay.
The gD (HSV-1 or -2)   343 protein along with the virus fusion executor of gB/gH/gL and the nectin-1 receptor are   344 separately expressed in CHO-K1 cells.
Consistent with previous studies (53),   345 remarkable cell fusion was observed when the nectin-1-expressing cells were mixed   346 with the cells expressing virus gB, gH, gL of HSV-1 and gD of either HSV-1 or -2.
In   347 each case, the fusion is specifically inhibited by the soluble gD protein of its original   348 virus type in a dose dependent manner.
In addition, similar fusion inhibition patterns   349 to those observed in the self-inhibiting tests were recorded when the heterogeneous   350 gD proteins were added to the system (Fig. 4).
These observations are consistent with   351 previous reports (41, 57-58), and demonstrate a very similar mode of action of HSV-1   352 and -2 gDs in nectin-1 mediated cell-cell fusion.
  353 Nectin-1 I80 is an important gD-interaction residue   354 Based on our comparative mutagenesis study, nectin-1 I80 is a newly identified 17  355 residue that affects the gD binding, in addition to the previously reported amino acids   356 N77, M85 and F129 (36, 43-44).
We therefore further quantitatively analyzed the   357 contribution of this amino acid to the receptor/ligand engagement.
The dissociation   358 constants (KDs) of nectin-1/I80A bound to HSV-1 and -2 gDs are determined to be 1   359 M and 1.47 M, respectively.
These values are about two orders of magnitude lower   360 than those observed for the WT nectin-1 protein (12.5 nM for HSV-1 gD and 19.1 nM   361 for HSV-2 gD), demonstrating that residue I80 indeed plays an important role in the   362 nectin-1 engagement of gD. We also included the tetra-TQEN mutant protein in the   363 kinetic assay, because these four residues could disrupt nectin-1 homodimerization   364 (56) but did not interfere with the gD/nectin-1 interaction individually (Fig. 3A).
The   365 calculated binding affinities, with KDs of 2.27 nM for HSV-1 gD and 7.81 nM for   366 HSV-2 gD, increased by approximately 2-5 folds in comparison to WT nectin-1 (Fig.   367 5, Table 1).
  368 We further investigated the role of nectin-1 I80 in the virus cell entry with an   369 infection assay using a genetically modified HSV-1 virus containing a luciferase gene   370 (55).
CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with the nectin-1 (WT or mutant)   371 expressing plasmids.
With similar expression levels (Fig. 6A), mutations of N77A,   372 M85A and F129A were shown to dramatically impair the cell entry efficiencies of   373 HSV-1 (Fig. 6B), which is consistent with the previous studies (36, 43-44).
An   374 approximate 2.5-fold decrease in the viral invasion was observed for the I80A mutant   375 in comparison to that of the WT protein, demonstrating its functional importance in   376 nectin-1 mediated virus entry.
The tetra-TQEN mutant, however, is as capable of 18  377 mediating virus entry as WT nectin-1 (Fig. 6B).
Reciprocally, we further tested in an   378 infection blocking assay the capability of nectin-1/I80A to inhibit HSV-1 entry into   379 cells by competing with the cell surface nectin-1.
Consistent with the result of the   380 infection assay, nectin-1/I80A mutant exhibits compromised blocking activity against   381 the viral invasion of HSV-1 (Fig. 6C).
These results demonstrate that nectin-1 I80 is   382 an important interface residue involved in the gD binding.
  383   384 Discussion   385 As with other enveloped viruses, the initiation of virus infection by HSV requires,   386 as a prerequisite, the specific interactions between viral surface glycoproteins and the   387 host cellular receptors (7-9).
Although multiple virus envelope proteins other than gD   388 have been shown to be capable of recognizing host molecules (eg. both gB and gC   389 can engage HSPG (10-11), and gB also recognizes PILR (59) and NMHC-IIA (60)),   390 the gD/receptor interaction is considered as a key step bridging the attachment and the   391 fusion processes.
Of the identified gD receptors, nectin-1 seems to play a more   392 important role in mediating the virus infection by HSV-2, at least in in vivo murine   393 models (28-29).
In comparison to that in the WT or the HVEM knock-out mice, an   394 attenuated disease caused by HSV-2 and diminished virus spread were observed in the   395 nectin-1 knock-out mice (28).
In addition, it was demonstrated that nectin-1, but not   396 HVEM, plays an indispensable role in the HSV-2 infection of the central nervous   397 system by direct cranial inoculation (29).
It is, therefore, an interesting issue to   398 elucidate the molecular basis of the binding between HSV-2 gD and nectin-1.
A 19  399 previous study reported the structure of HSV-2 gD with a neutralizing antibody E317   400 (42).
The antibody was shown to exert the neutralization activity by disrupting the   401 gD/receptor interactions.
The gD/E317 complex structure, therefore, provided the first   402 structural glimpse on the HSV-2-gD/nectin-1 binding basis.
In this study, we reported   403 a free HSV-2 gD structure and a complex structure of HSV-2 gD bound with nectin-1.
  404 By comparing with the previously reported HSV-1-gD/nectin-1 structures (35-36), we   405 demonstrated at the atomic level that gDs of the two virus species engage essentially   406 the same patch of nectin-1 residues for receptor recognition.
This homologous binding   407 mode was further supported by our comparative mutagenesis study showing that the   408 individual mutation of the interface residues in nectin-1 affects the ligand/receptor   409 interaction similarly between HSV-1 and -2 gDs and by our fusion inhibition assay   410 showing that soluble gD proteins of the two viruses could mutually inhibit the   411 gD/nectin-1 mediated cell fusion.
These comprehensive structural and functional data,   412 together with the previously reported functional evidence (39-41, 57-58), demonstrate   413 a conserved receptor-binding mode between HSV-1 and -2 for nectin-1, and imply   414 that the tropism-difference between the two viruses likely arises from other aspects   415 rather than the gD/nectin-1 binding-features.
  416 Compared to the HSV-1 gD (free or bound) (35-37) or the bound HSV-2 gD   417 structures (42), the unbound HSV-2 gD structure lacks traceable electron densities for   418 a large portion of the terminal extensions at both the N- and C-termini.
This could be   419 either a result of cleavage-remove of the terminal extensions by   420 accidentally-contaminated proteases during crystallization or an indicative clue of the 20  421 terminal flexibility.
It should be noted that in the thus-far available complex structures   422 of gD with a receptor or an antibody (35-37, 42), the bound molecules invariably bind   423 to the gD-patches that map to these terminal extension elements.
In the free HSV-1   424 gD structure (37), two gD protomers are packed against each other in the crystal via   425 an interface covering the same extension patch.
This raises the possibility that a bound   426 partner (a receptor or an antibody or another gD molecule) stabilizes the otherwise   427 flexible terminal extension residues of gD into definitive structures.
Accordingly, the   428 portion of the terminal extensions were solvent exposed and invisible in the free   429 HSV-2 gD structure rather than being buried with fixed folds as observed in the   430 aforementioned gD structures.
Our structure, therefore, further supports the notion   431 that the moveable character of gD N- and C-terminal segments would suffice for   432 receptor binding, as documented for HSV-1 gD (61).
Supportingly, several studies   433 also reported the substitutability of the gD N-terminal loop by uPA, IL13 and the   434 HER2 antibody, the chimeric gDs derived from which are functionally active in   435 mediating virus entry into cells expressing their respective cognate receptors (62-64).
  436 We also conducted a thorough mutational analysis for those structurally-defined   437 interface residues in nectin-1.
In consistence with previous studies (36, 43-44),   438 individual substitution of N77, M85 and F129 by alanine dramatically impairs the   439 interaction between gD (HSV-1 or -2) and nectin-1.
In addition, nectin-1/I80 also   440 plays an important role in the gD/nectin-1 engagement, which was further   441 demonstrated by our kinetic analysis and the virus entry assay.
These four amino acids   442 interact extensively with gD and thereby contribute dramatically to the binding via 21  443 strong H-bond and/or hydrophobic interactions.
The remaining interface residues, in   444 contrast, do not have a significant role individually.
Accordingly, a majority of these   445 amino acids are indeed observed to provide only limited van-der-Waals contacts in the   446 complex structures, thereby are likely functioning to modulate gD-recognition in   447 combination.
This is, to our knowledge, a first comprehensive alanine-scanning   448 mutagenesis study on nectin-1 for its interaction properties with gD, which represents   449 a useful supplement to the current structural observations.
It is also noteworthy that   450 the I80A mutation leads the kinetic profile of nectin-1 binding to gD to a   451 fast-on/fast-off mode, forming contrast to the kinetic pattern between WT nectin-1   452 and gD that is slow-on/slow-off.
We believe the residue substitution and its resultant   453 change of hydrophobic van-der-Waals contacts caused the kinetic shift.
Similar   454 phenomena of altered Kon and/or Koff rates resulting from mutations of interface   455 residues have also been reported in other protein-protein interactions (65-66).
  456 Nectin-1 can form homo-dimers in solution (35, 56).
Based on the solved structures,   457 gD binds to the dimer interface of nectin-1 and would compete against its   458 dimerization (35).
In this study, we found that simultaneous mutation of T63, Q64,   459 E125 and N133 to alanine leads to an increased binding affinity between nectin-1 and   460 gD. Although these four residues contact HSV gD, we showed that the individual   461 residues contribute little to the gD/nectin-1 interaction (Fig. 3A).
In contrast, they   462 have important roles in nectin-1 homo-binding by providing H-bond and salt-bridge   463 contacts (56).
The increased affinity should therefore be a result of residue   464 substitutions which impaired nectin-1 homodimerization but hardly affected its 22  465 interaction with gD. This is a functional evidence for a competitive relationship   466 between gD/nectin-1 hetero-complex formation and the nectin-1 dimerization.
The   467 result also reminds us of a variant residue usage between gD and the other nectin-1   468 molecule to engage the same nectin-1 receptor.
This would facilitate nectin-1 mimic   469 anti-viral drug design which can bind to the viral gD protein with high affinity but   470 show low or no specificity for nectin-1.
These are interesting issues that are worth   471 pursuing in the future.

  662   663   664 28  665 Figure legends:   666 FIG. 1. Structure of the unbound HSV-2 gD. (A) A ribbon representation of the   667 overall structure.
The two molecules (Chains A and B) present in the asymmetric unit   668 are shown.
The IgV-like core is colored green, while the N- and C-terminal extensions   669 are highlighted in blue and orange, respectively.
The secondary elements are labeled   670 as in HSV-1 gD (37).
The loop linking residues A185 and L194 is invisible, and is   671 therefore indicated as a dotted curve.
The terminal residues are marked.
(B-C)   672 Comparison of the free HSV-2 gD structure (green for Chain A and blue for Chain B)   673 with previously reported gD structures including those of free HSV-1 gD (red),   674 HSV-1 gD with HVEM (cyan), HSV-1 gD with nectin-1 (orange) and HSV-2 gD with   675 an antibody (magenta).
The colored arrows mark, in the individual structures, the   676 positions of the structure termini and the conformations of the loops referred to in the   677 text.
Those elements that are invisible in our structure but are clearly traced in the   678 reference structures are encircled and labeled.
(B) Superimposition of the structures   679 highlighting the external extension region (shown in ribbon).
(C) Superimposition of   680 the structures highlighting the IgV-like core.
  681   682 FIG. 2.
Structure of the HSV-2-gD/nectin-1 complex.
(A) A ribbon representation of   683 the overall structure.
The gD molecule (green for the IgV-like core, blue for the   684 N-terminal extension and orange for the C-terminal extension) binds to the first   685 IgV-like domain of nectin-1 (colored cyan, orange and magenta for the first, second   686 and third Ig-like domains, respectively).
The binding interface involves the nectin-1 29  687 CC'C''FG rear sheet and the gD terminal extensions, which are encircled and labeled.
  688 A superimposition comparison of a previously reported complex structure between   689 HSV-1-gD (orange) and nectin-1 (magenta) with the bound structure of HSV-2-gD   690 (green) with nectin-1 (cyan) is highlighted in the black box.
(B) A structural   691 comparison of the HSV-2 gD structures in the free (cyan) and the nectin-1 bound   692 (green) forms.
The fixed conformations of the terminal elements (highlighting in blue   693 for the N-terminus and in orange for the C-terminus) in the bound structure are   694 labeled.
(C) A detailed view of the binding interface between HSV-2 gD (shown in   695 surface) and nectin-1 (shown in cartoon).
The interface residues of gD can be roughly   696 categorized to congregate into surface patches 1 (yellow) and 2 (cyan), which contact   697 mainly the B-C/F-G loop region (orange) and the upper sheet region (green) in   698 nectin-1, respectively.
The amino acids involved are shown in sticks and labeled.
  699   700 FIG. 3. Homologous receptor binding between HSV-1 and -2 gDs to nectin-1.
(A) A   701 comparative mutagenesis study characterizing the gD/nectin-1 interaction.
The gD   702 proteins of HSV-1 (upper panel) and -2 (lower panel) were immobilized on CM5   703 chips at ~750 response units, and were then tested for the binding by 1 M of the   704 indicated nectin-1 (WT or mutant) proteins.
The bound protein in response unit was   705 recorded and presented as the percentage relative to that of the WT nectin-1 using   706 histograms.
Clearly shown is that the interface residue mutations in nectin-1 affect the   707 gD binding similarly between HSV-1 and -2. (B-C) Structural delineation of the role   708 that N77, I80, M85 and F129 play in the gD-recognition.
The binding interface 30  709 between HSV-2 gD (green) and nectin-1 (cyan) is highlighted for the inter-molecule   710 contacts contributed by these four residues.
The 2|Fo| - |Fc| electron density map was   711 contoured at 1.0 .
Dashed lines indicate H-bonds.
(B) A magnified view of the   712 interface highlighting nectin-1 F129.
(C) A view of the interface highlighting nectin-1   713 N77, I80 and M85.
  714   715 FIG. 4.
A similar action mode between HSV-1 and -2 gDs in the nectin-1 mediated   716 cell-cell fusion.
By comparing the luciferase activities, the cell fusion in the presence   717 of gradient concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 M) of either HSV-1 or -2 gD or an   718 irrelevant hNUDT16 protein was plotted as the percentage relative to that without   719 soluble gDs or hNUDT16.
The dotted profiles were shown.
Left panel:   720 HSV-1-gD-mediated cell fusion.
Right panel: HSV-2-gD-mediated cell fusion.
All the   721 results are expressed as meansSD of three independent experiments.
  722   723 FIG. 5.
An SPR assay characterizing the binding kinetics of gD (HSV-1 and -2) to the   724 indicated nectin-1 proteins (WT or mutant).
The profiles of gD at gradient   725 concentrations flowing through individual nectin-1 proteins immobilized at ~750   726 response units (RUs) are recorded and shown.
The calculated dissociation constants   727 (KDs) are labeled.
  728   729 FIG. 6.
Effects of nectin-1 mutations on HSV-1 entry.
(A) A flow-cytometric assay   730 characterizing the expression level of each nectin-1 (WT or mutant) protein.
The 31  731 percentage of the positive transfectants (out of 10, 000 CHO-K1 cells) is shown.
(B)   732 An assay characterizing the cell-entry efficiency of HSV-1 via WT or mutant nectin-1.
  733 CHO-K1 cells expressing the individual nectin-1 proteins are infected with HSV-1   734 viruses as specified in the Materials and Methods.
The histogram shows the virus   735 entry efficiencies of HSV-1 using the indicated nectin-1 mutants in comparison to that   736 using WT nectin-1.
(C) Quantification of HSV-1 entry into CHO-K1 cells expressing   737 WT nectin-1 in the presence of soluble nectin-1 proteins of WT and mutant forms.
  738 The virus entry with BSA as an irrelevant-protein control is presented as 100%, and   739 those with the indicated nectin-1 proteins are shown as the percentage relative to that   740 of BSA.
All the results are expressed as meansSD of three independent experiments.
  741 Clearly shown is that nectin-1 mutants (N77A, I80A, M85A and F129A) with   742 compromised gD-binding capabilities exhibit decreased capacities in inhibiting   743 HSV-1 entry.

The kinetic statistics of the SPR assay   747   748   749   750 The slow-on/slow-off kinetic data were analyzed by the 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
  751 The values of association-rate (Kon), dissociation-rate (Koff) and the subsequent   752 dissociation constant (KD) were calculated and listed.
With the fast-on/fast-off kinetics   753 for which the Kons and Koffs can not be calculated, the steady state model was used for   754 the KD determination.
The well-fit between the experimental data and the calculated   model was characterized by the Chi2 755 value which is less than 1/10 of the maximum   756 response unit (RUmax).
