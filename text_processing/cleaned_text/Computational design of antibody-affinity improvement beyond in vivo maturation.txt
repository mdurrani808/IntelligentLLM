Computational design of antibody-affinity improvement  beyond in vivo maturation  Shaun M Lippow1,4, K Dane Wittrup1,2 & Bruce Tidor2,3  Antibodies are used extensively in diagnostics and as  therapeutic agents.
Achieving high-affinity binding is  important for expanding detection limits, extending  dissociation half-times, decreasing drug dosages and  increasing drug efficacy.
However, antibody-affinity maturation  in vivo often fails to produce antibody drugs of the targeted  potency1, making further affinity maturation in vitro by  directed evolution or computational design necessary.
Here  we present an iterative computational design procedure that  focuses on electrostatic binding contributions and single  mutants.
By combining multiple designed mutations,  a tenfold affinity improvement to 52 pM was engineered into  the antiepidermal growth factor receptor drug cetuximab  (Erbitux), and a 140-fold improvement in affinity to 30 pM  was obtained for the anti-lysozyme model antibody D44.1.
  The generality of the methods was further demonstrated  through identification of known affinity-enhancing mutations in  the therapeutic antibody bevacizumab (Avastin) and the model  anti-fluorescein antibody 4-4-20.
These results demonstrate  computational capabilities for enhancing and accelerating the  development of protein reagents and therapeutics.
  Computational design depends critically on two capabilities: accurate  energetic evaluation and thorough conformational search.
Previous  work has addressed many problems related to the design of improved  protein-protein binding affinity, such as the design of stable protein  folds24, binding pockets for peptides and small molecules57, altered  protein-protein specificity812 and altered enzymatic activity1315.
The  design of improved binding affinity has met with limited success,  however1619.
Challenges for protein-protein affinity design include  conformational change upon binding, interfacial trapped water molecules, polar and charged side chains and the trade-off of proteinsolvent with protein-protein interactions from the unbound to bound  state.
Fine free-energy discrimination for redesign from nanomolar to  picomolar affinities is a particular challenge.
  A robust design strategy should both produce a considerable  fraction of designs that are successful when tested experimentally  and yield substantial improvements across multiple systems.
Although  there are potentially many mutations that confer improved binding  affinity for a particular interaction, calculations need identify only a  subset to be successful.
Our approach uses thorough optimization  techniques that exhaustively rank-order the best solutions in a  discretized search space.
Although some of these solutions are  expected to be improved designs, others will be unsuccessful but  may be useful in learning about deficiencies in the energy functions,  search procedures or other methodology.
  First we attempted to redesign the model antibody D1.3 for  improved binding to its antigen, hen egg-white lysozyme.
Single  mutations at each of 60 complementarity-determining region (CDR)  positions to the 20 common side chains, excluding proline and  cysteine, were designed using a physics-based energy function and a  hierarchical search procedure.
(Physics-based refers to an energy  function constructed from and parameterized by theoretical and  experimental models of the underlying physical interactions; by contrast, knowledge-based refers to potentials statistically derived from  observational data, which often take the form of structure databases.)  A striking feature was that predictions for improved binding were  dominated by mutations to large amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 1  online), many of which exhibited improved van der Waals packing  interactions that outweighed disfavored net Poisson-Boltzmann continuum electrostatic solvation and interaction.
Our confidence in these  designs was low because many had unsatisfied hydrogen bonding or a  predicted packing improvement of a magnitude uncharacteristically  large for a single amino-acid substitution.
Nevertheless, 17 single  mutations, most with calculated improved total binding free energy,  were selected for experimental binding-affinity measurement.
Only  three mutations improved affinity (Supplementary Table 1 online),  with 2.4-fold improvement for the best single mutant (Supplementary  Fig. 2 online).
We found that the calculated electrostatic term for  binding was a better predictor for improvement than the total  calculated binding free energy, that improvements from mutations  to larger amino acids were mostly not realized and that avoiding  potentially destabilizing mutations was important.
This led us to ask:  (i) Could electrostatics-based predictions alone be used to design  binding-affinity improvements? (ii) Is there a physics-based explanation for the seemingly inaccurate calculated packing improvements?  In our second attempt, we used only the electrostatic term of the  computed binding free energy to predict improvements in affinity but  kept the original design procedure and full energy function for sidechain conformational search.

  NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 25 NUMBER 10 OCTOBER 2007 1171  LETTERS   2007 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnologyopportunities for improving D1.3 based on  electrostatics, new antibodies were chosen to  explore both this method and the possibility  that D1.3 is anomalous.
  Our second target for redesign was the  antibody D44.1.
It binds lysozyme, facilitating  experiments, but its epitope is different from  that of D1.3.
In addition, D44.1 has low  nanomolar affinity, maintaining the challenge  of nanomolar-to-picomolar affinity maturation.
Single mutations were designed at all  D44.1 CDR positions, and then mutations  were ranked by the electrostatic binding  free-energy term.
In contrast to the D1.3  design, there were many computed opportunities for electrostatic improvement.
We measured experimental binding affinity for the  nine largest-magnitude predictions, choosing  no more than two mutations per position.
Six  of the nine mutants bound tighter than wild  type, and the best mutation, L92 Asn-to-Ala,  exhibited an eightfold improvement (Table 1a  and Fig. 1a).
In addition, following the original design procedure, two mutations predicted to increase packing interactions were  tested; as expected, neither mutation led to an  improvement in affinity (Table 1a).
  The successful D44.1 single mutations were  combined and tested experimentally.
The six  favorable mutations span five positions, where  L32 and L92 are the only positions in direct  contact with each other in the wild-type  crystal structure.
Contrary to prediction, this  double mutant is not as improved as the L92  single mutant alone.
The mutations at the  other three positions are additive with L92,  yielding a quadruple mutant with 43-pM  affinity, 100-fold improved over wild type  (Table 1a and Fig. 1a).
Figure 1bd displays  the designed interactions.
Measurements of  dissociation and association rate-constants for  D44.1 and the high-affinity quadruple mutant  revealed that both kinetic steps were  improved, including a 23-fold slower off-rate  (Table 1b).
Each ratio of koff to kon is in  agreement with the independently measured  Kd.
Increasing ionic strength from 167 mM to  1.67 M screens the designed quadruplemutant interaction by approximately fourfold,  in agreement with calculation (+0.9 kcal/mol),  whereas the affinity of the wild-type antibody  is marginally improved at high salt, in contrast  to calculation (+0.3 kcal/mol; Table 1b).
  Two sets of calculations were made in an  attempt to further improve the high-affinity  D44.1 quadruple mutant.
First, single mutations were designed based on the predicted  structure of the quadruple mutant.
These  calculations reiterated many predictions seen  in the original D44.1 design that had been  ranked lower and not tested experimentally, as  Table 1 Predicted and experimental antibody mutations  (a) Predicted and experimental binding affinities in D44.1  Position Mutation Kd  WT/Kd  mutant DDGexpa DDGcalc, totalb DDGcalc, elecc  D44.1 (Kd  WT  4.4  0.5 nM)  Single mutations, selected based on electrostatic energy  L32 Asn Gly 4.2  0.5 0.86  0.07 +0.99 1.03  L92 Asn Ala 8.3  1.3 1.25  0.10 0.02 0.86  H28 Thr Asp 1.29  0.06 0.15  0.03 0.30 0.26  H31 Thr Ala 0.47  0.07 +0.45  0.09 +0.31 0.97  H31 Thr Val 0.41  0.09 +0.53  0.13 2.06 0.36  H57 Ser Ala 1.9  0.5 0.37  0.16 0.59 1.44  H57 Ser Val 2.3  0.4 0.49  0.12 2.29 1.34  H58 Thr Asp 2.58  0.16 0.56  0.04 0.59 0.53  H65 Lys Asp 0.97  0.12 +0.02  0.07 0.38 0.42  Single mutations, selected based on total energy  L32 Asn Tyr 1.0  0.2 +0.00  0.13 0.29 +2.59  H31 Thr Trp 0.8  0.3 +0.13  0.2 3.75 +1.56  Combinations of single mutations  (L32)G, (L92)A 3.2  0.3 0.69  0.05 +1.23 1.68  (H57)V, (H58)D 5.3  0.4 0.99  0.04 2.88 1.87  (L32)G, (L92)A, (H57)V, (H58)D 18.7  1.9 1.74  0.06 1.65 3.55  (L92)A, (H57)V, (H58)D 57  5 2.40  0.05 2.90 2.73  (L92)A, (H28)D, (H57)V, (H58)Dd 102  3 2.74  0.02 3.18 2.96  (b) Characterization of D44.1 quadruple mutant  koff (103 s1) kon (106 M1s1) koff/kon (nM) Kd (nM) High-salt Kd (nM)  D44.1 10.7  1.0 2.52  0.13 4.3  0.5 4.4  0.5 3.0  0.8  Quadd 0.466  0.014 8.4  1.7 0.055  0.012 0.0430  0.0013 0.18  0.08  (c) Double mutant cycle added to D44.1 quadruple mutant  Position(s) Mutation(s) Kd  WT/Kd  mutant DDGexpa  Quadd 102  3 2.74  0.02  H35 Glu Ser o 0.04 4 +2  H99 Gly Asp 1.41  0.17 0.20  0.07  H35 Glu + H99 Glye Ser + Asp 145  17 2.95  0.07  (d) Predicted and experimental binding affinities in cetuximab (Erbitux)  Position Mutation Kd  WT/Kd  mutant DDGexpa DDGcalc, totalb DDGcalc, elecc  cetuximab (Kd  WT  0.49  0.06 nM)  L26 Ser Asp 1.4  0.7 0.2  0.3 0.40 0.38  L31 Thr Glu 2.4  0.8 0.53  0.19 0.50 0.48  L93 Asn Ala 3.5  1.4 0.7  0.2 +1.06 0.75  H56 Asn Ala 1.1  0.4 0.04  0.2 +2.25 0.27  H61 Thr Glu 1.1  0.3 0.07  0.17 0.77 0.77  Combinations of single mutations  (L31)E, (L93)A 4  2 0.8  0.3 +0.51 1.28  (L26)D, (L31)E, (L93)A 9.5  0.3 1.33  0.02 +0.13 1.64  (L26)D, (L31)E, (L93)A,  (H56)A, (H61)E  3  3 0.7  0.5 +1.69 2.61  Experimental error is the s.d.

Second, double mutations were  designed at all 93 pairs of contacting positions, and triple mutations  were designed at positions H32, H98 and H100, based on cooperative  packing at these positions.
The double- and triple-mutant designs were  filtered for favorable, cooperative predictions, requiring the energy of  the double or triple mutation to exceed the energy of each of its  component single mutations and the sum of the single mutation  energies.
Four single mutations, three double mutations and one triple  mutation were selected for experimental testing in the quadruplemutant context (Supplementary Table 2 online).
Only the H35+H99  double mutant (hextuple mutant from wild type) was improved  relative to the quadruple mutant, at 30-nM affinity, 140-fold improved  over wild type (Table 1c and Fig. 1a).
Measurement of the individual  H35 and H99 mutations revealed high cooperativity (Table 1c),  consistent with the predicted salt-bridge and hydrogen-bond rearrangements (Fig. 1e,f).
The diminished success rate of this subsequent  design round may be due to smaller-magnitude predictions, antibody  destabilization or design in a modeled rather than an experimentally  determined structure.
  Next, we applied our electrostatics-based methods to the anticancer therapeutic antibody cetuximab (Erbitux), which binds epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to block ligand binding20.
  Calculations revealed nine positions with opportunities for affinityenhancing single mutations based on improved electrostatics.
The five  mutations of largest magnitude of predicted affinity improvement  were selected for experimental testing in the single-chain antibody  format, with one mutation per position, and no two positions in close  proximity.
The EGFR extracellular domain (EGFR-ECD) mutant used  in the assays contains a point mutation that likely interferes with the  H56 mutation.
Three of the other four mutants bind EGFR tighter  than does cetuximab; these three mutations were combined to  produce a triple mutant with tenfold overall improvement, from  490 pM to 52 pM (Table 1d and Fig. 2).
  The transferability and utility of these electrostatics-based methods  were further demonstrated by designs for which published data  validate the predictions.
One of our test cases was the antibody 4-4-  20, which binds its small-molecule hapten, fluorescein, with 1.2-nM  affinity, and was previously engineered using directed evolution to  yield the antibody 4M5.3, with over 1,000-fold affinity improvement  and 14 mutations21.
Our designed single mutations in 4-4-20 revealed  opportunities for improvement based on computed electrostatics at  nine positions.
Two of the predicted mutations, H31 Asp-to-His and  H101 Ser-to-Ala, have already been shown to improve binding affinity  as single mutations in 4M5.3 (ref. 22).

Another test case was bevacizumab (Avastin), a therapeutic  antibody that binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)23,  where we found five positions suitable for electrostatics-based  improvement.
The mutation H28 Thr-to-Asp and mutations at H31  and H101 are found in a published high-affinity variant of bevacizumab24.
Our other electrostatics-based predictions in both test systems  remain to be tested.
  The single mutations designed and experimentally validated in this  work lead to enhanced binding affinity through one of two electrostatic mechanisms.
In one mechanism, a poorly satisfied polar group  (a polar residue calculated to lose more free energy from desolvation  than is recovered by interaction) is mutated to a hydrophobic residue.
  These mutations account for the majority of improved energetics.
In a  second mechanismthe addition of a charged residuenet charge is  changed to increase electrostatic interaction, often at the periphery of  the antibody-antigen interface where desolvation is minimal.
Unlike  previous work using electrostatics to guide design25,26, our methods  explicitly model the mutation, calculate a binding free energy relative  to wild type, include positions that are partially or fully buried upon  binding and avoid opportunities where the mutation is predicted to  destabilize the mutant protein.
  The modeled structures result from optimization with the full  energy function, yet the van der Waals and nonpolar solvation  energies are then discarded to predict improvement based on only  the net electrostatic term.
A potential problem is that different or  wrong van der Waals parameters would produce altered equilibrium  distances and hence altered electrostatic energies, particularly for  short-range interactions.
The specific mutations predicted and tested  here may be less susceptible to this potential problem because they  involve the calculation of solvation and medium-range electrostatic  energies, which are not especially sensitive to precise atom locations.
  The energy for substitution of an unsatisfied polar group is dominated  by its desolvation penalty, and the addition of a charged group at the  interface periphery is not sensitive to precise side-chain placement.
  However, designs involving the introduction of a new short-range  electrostatic contact, such as a new hydrogen bond, could be susceptible to this potential problem.
Further work is necessary, but it could  be that the energetic terms are actually appropriate for identifying  low-energy structures for any sequence, but not for comparing  energetics between sequences.
Indeed, we think that the packing and  nonpolar interactions are not balanced in some situations for accurate  comparison of one amino acid to another, as described next.
  We investigated the underlying physical model to address the  seemingly inaccurate calculated packing interactions.
The majority  of problematic designs were at the binding-site periphery, where  mutation to a larger amino acid was predicted to be favorable due  to increased intermolecular van der Waals interactions.
In some cases,  hydrogen-bonding groups were buried, but the unfavorable electrostatic term was outweighed by improved packing.
In principle, a larger  amino acid at the interface periphery will exhibit increased proteinprotein interactions in the bound state, counteracted by increased  protein-water interactions in the unbound state.
However, these  offsetting energetics are calculated asymmetrically, with an atomistic  0  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  1  [EGFR-ECD variant] (nM)  Fraction bound  0 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100  Figure 2 Designed high-affinity cetuximab mutant.

The protein-water nonpolar interaction should be  a function of the detailed geometry, including volume effects, as well  as the particular protein atom types present.
We implemented and  parameterized an atomically detailed nonpolar term based on work by  Levy and coworkers (Supplementary Fig. 3 online)27, and found that  it reduced the magnitude of favorable prediction for many of the  counterintuitive designs to larger side chains (Supplementary Fig. 4  online).
In addition, unbound-state conformational search attenuated predictions for larger side chains by introducing an energetic cost  to adopt the binding conformation (data not shown).
Nevertheless,  some incorrect predictions remain, and future work should address  this issue.
  This work presents a computational alternative to directed  evolution for affinity maturation.
Directed evolution is adept at  accumulating successive, additive mutations, but (with the exception  of large-scale shuffling) is less well suited for selecting variants whose  encoding DNA is further from wild type.
Experimental libraries  generated using error-prone PCR generally do not cover all single  amino-acid mutations, let alone all pairs or greater combinations of  mutations, as 13 of the 19 possible single mutations require more than  one base-pair change, on average.
Some classes of mutation require  two base-pair changesfor example, mutation to either negatively  charged residue from any codon of 10 of the 18 non-negativelycharged side chains.
Of the 12 single mutations found to improve  D1.3, D44.1 or cetuximab, ten required two base-pair changes and  would therefore have been substantially more difficult to identify by a  method that relies on error-prone PCR.
Also, the H35+H99 cooperative double mutation required concerted amino-acid mutation and  three total base-pair changes.
Computation has the capability to  search a vastly larger space than that accessible to either in vivo  maturation or experimental selection techniques, potentially discovering larger and more beneficial evolutionary steps.
  Our results present several design lessons.
We find that computed  electrostatics alone is a better predictor for improved binding than is  computed total free energy.
Electrostatics-based predictions yielded  fewer false positives, more true positives and a 460% success rate for  single mutations from wild type (Fig. 3).
Predictions based on  improved total free energy were dominated by mutations to larger  amino acids that did not experimentally improve affinity;
incorporation of improved nonpolar hydration models may improve accuracy  of predicted packing changes2830.
We find that designing single and  double mutations allows for in-depth conformational search and  avoids having any particular design flaw spoiling all results.
In  addition, avoiding destabilizing mutations based on calculated folding  stability was important.
Crystal structure resolution did not have a  substantial effect, as the D44.1 and cetuximab structures are of  2.5- and 2.8-A resolution, respectively, whereas the D1.3 structure is  of 1.8-A resolution.
Calculations in D1.3 showed few opportunities for  electrostatics-based improvement, and accumulated evidence indicates  that D1.3 is the anomaly, possibly because of the combination of the  many large side chains and buried water molecules at the antibodyantigen interface.
  Our results demonstrate capabilities for improving protein binding  affinity using computational design.
Maturation of the model system  D44.1 by 140-fold to 30 pM, maturation of the therapeutic antibody  cetuximab by tenfold to 52 pM and identification of known mutations  in 4-4-20 and bevacizumab together indicate that our method should  be effective for other antibodies and protein interactions.
Computational design holds the promise of far greater exploration of sequence  space than is possible experimentally, enabling rapid and inexpensive  protein improvement.
  METHODS  Computational design.
The design approach used a two-stage hierarchical  procedure.
First, conformational search was simplified by assuming a rigid  protein backbone and allowing only discrete side-chain rotamers.
The physicsbased energy function is pairwise-decomposable, permitting application of  dead-end elimination and A* search algorithms.
For each protein sequence, we  found its global minimum energy conformation (GMEC), and, if this energy  was within a cut-off of the wild-type GMEC energy, then a continued list of  lowest-energy structures was found.
Second, we reevaluated the lowest-energy  structures of each sequence using more accurate, yet more computationally  demanding models, including Poisson-Boltzmann continuum electrostatics,  continuum solvent van der Waals, unbound-state side-chain conformation  search and minimization.
Structures were ranked again based on these latter  calculations.
Binding energy was initially predicted from the bound-state  conformation and a rigid binding model.
The unbound state search, when  applied, approximated flexible binding and estimated a deformation penalty  that offset binding.
Changes to protein-fold stability were approximated from  the energetic difference between the folded state and isolated model compounds.
