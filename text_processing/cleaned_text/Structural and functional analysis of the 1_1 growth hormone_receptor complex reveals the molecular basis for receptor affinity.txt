Structural and Functional Analysis of the 1:1 Growth  Hormone:Receptor Complex Reveals the Molecular  Basis for Receptor Affinity  Tim Clackson, Mark H. Ultsch, James A. Wells* and  Abraham M. de Vos*  Department of Protein  Engineering, Genentech, Inc.  460 Point San Bruno Blvd.  South San Francisco, CA 94080  USA  The designed G120R mutant of human growth hormone (hGH) is an  antagonist and can bind only one molecule of the growth hormone receptor.
We have determined the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex between  this mutant and the receptor extracellular domain (hGHbp) at 2.6 A resolution, and used it to guide a detailed survey of the structural and functional basis for hormone-receptor recognition.
The overall structure of the  complex is very similar to the equivalent portion of the 1:2 complex,  showing that formation of the active complex does not involve major  conformational changes.
However, a segment involved in receptor  receptor interactions in the 1:2 complex is disordered in this structure,  suggesting that its productive conformation is stabilized by receptor  dimerization.
  The hormone binding site of the receptor comprises a central hydrophobic patch dominated by Trp104 and Trp169, surrounded by a hydrophilic periphery containing several well-ordered water molecules.
  Previous alanine scanning showed that the hydrophobic ``hot spot'' confers most of the binding energy.
The new structural data, coupled with  binding and kinetic analysis of further mutants, indicate that the hot spot  is assembled cooperatively and that many residues contribute indirectly  to binding.
Several hydrophobic residues serve to orient the key tryptophan residues; kinetic analysis suggests that Pro106 locks the Trp104  main-chain into a required conformation.
The electrostatic contacts of  Arg43 to hGH are less important than the intramolecular packing of its  alkyl chain with Trp169.
The true functional epitope that directly contributes binding energy may therefore comprise as few as six side-chains,  participating mostly in alkyl-aromatic stacking interactions.
Outside the  functional epitope, multiple mutation of residues to alanine resulted in  non-additive increases in afnity: up to tenfold for a hepta-alanine  mutant.
Contacts in the epitope periphery can therefore attenuate the af-  nity of the central hot spot, perhaps reecting a role in conferring speci-  city to the interaction.

  We have been studying the interaction of human  growth hormone (hGH) with its receptor using a  combination of X-ray crystallography and structure-guided mutagenesis (reviewed by Wells & De  Vos, 1996).
Receptor signaling is initiated by high  afnity binding of the hormone through site 1 to  form an intermediate 1:1 complex, which then  recruits a second receptor to form the active signaling complex.
The 2.8 A resolution crystal structure  of the complex between hGH and two copies of  the receptor extracellular domain (hGHbp) shows  that the interface between hGH site 1 and the  hGHbp buries about 1350 A 2 of surface area,  encompassing about 30 residues, on each protein  (De Vos et al., 1992; De Vos & Kossiakoff, 1992).
  Most of the contacts are made by side-chains.
  To probe the contribution of individual sidechains to overall binding energy in this initial interaction, both the hGH and hGHbp sides of the  interface have been subjected to complete alanine  scans (Cunningham & Wells, 1993; Clackson &  Wells, 1995).
In each case only a subset of sidechains, termed the ``functional epitope'' or binding  energy ``hot spot'', was found to make a signicant  contribution.
The segregation of binding energy  was most dramatic on the receptor side, where a  central patch of 11 residues accounted for more  than three quarters of the binding free energy.
The  major contributions were from hydrophobic sidechains, with two tryptophan side-chains each  accounting for >4.5 kcal/mol.
Individual mutation  of interface residues outside this functional epitope, which are generally more polar and  hydrated, had little impact on binding afnity.
The  regions of high and low binding energy contribution on each protein were complementary.
  Although these data quantify the importance of  individual side-chains, further analysis is required  to distinguish direct binding energy contributions  from indirect effects mediated through other residues.
The existence of hot spots also raises the  question of whether the peripheral ``afnity-inert''  contacts play any other role in binding.
These  issues are of practical importance, because small  functional epitopes represent good starting points  for the design of small molecule mimics of large  molecular interfaces (Clackson & Wells, 1995).
For  such design efforts to succeed, it will be essential  to dene precisely those contacts that contribute  directly to binding, and to determine to what  extent those contacts can function independently of  the rest of the binding site.
  Here we address these questions using a combined structural and functional approach.
To  obtain higher resolution structural information, we  have exploited a variant of hGH with a designed  mutation in site 2 (G120R) which prevents receptor  dimerization by sterically blocking this site (Fuh  et al., 1992), allowing the 1:1 pre-signaling complex  to be puried and crystallized (Ultsch & De Vos,  1993).
The crystal structure of this complex is here  described at 2.6 A resolution.
Overall, the structure  is identical to the 1:1 structure solved at 2.9 A by  Sundstrom et al. (1996), but the better resolution  allows for signicantly enhanced detail, for  example some clusters of ordered water molecules  in the hormone  receptor interface.
Comparison  with the 1:2 complex shows that the intermediate  is a ``productive'' template to which the second  receptor can dock without major conformational  changes.
We use the higher resolution structural  data, coupled with further mutagenesis, to systematically analyze the role of each side-chain in the  hGHbp functional epitope, and nd that the energetic hot spot is even more focused than previously thought (Clackson & Wells, 1995).
We also  nd that mutating clusters of peripheral residues  to alanine can substantially increase afnity.
  Although these residues attenuate maximal binding afnity, they are probably important for speci-  city or/and solubility.
  Results  Crystallography  The tetragonal crystals used in this study diffracted to about 2.2 A (Ultsch & De Vos, 1993), but  the combination of the long c-axis (228 A ) and the  relatively small size of the FAST area detector surface (64 mm  48 mm) limited the resolution of the  data that were collected to about 2.6 A .
Structure  solution by molecular replacement was straightforward, using a model based on the structure of the  1:2 complex (De Vos et al., 1992).
Crystallographic  renement was almost complete when free R-value  monitoring (Bru nger, 1992) became available, and  we decided against repeating the renement to  obtain a free R-value.
Nevertheless, the nal structure is of excellent quality, as can be judged by the  low R-value (18.7% for all measured data between  7 and 2.6 A ), the good stereochemistry (the rootmean-square (rms) differences in bond lengths,  bond angles and B-factors of bonded atoms are  0.011 A , 1.6 and 2.4 A 2  , respectively), and the fact  that no residues other than glycine occupy ``generously allowed'' or ``disallowed'' (Laskowski et al.,  1993) regions of the Ramachandran plot.
The overall structure is essentially identical to the 2.9 A  structure determined by Sundstrom et al. (1996),  with an rms difference of 0.50 A for 322 Ca  s. However, due to the higher resolution of the present  structure, more detail is visible; for example, 69  well-ordered water molecules are included in the  nal model.
  Structure of the hormone  The overall structure of the G120R hormone seen  in the 1:1 complex is very similar to that of wildtype hGH in the 1:2 complex (De Vos et al., 1992)  and the hGH-prolactin receptor 1:1 complex  1112 1:1 hGH:Receptor Complex(Somers et al., 1994; see Figures. 1 and 2).
The  core of the molecule is a four-helix bundle, with  the ``up-up-down-down'' topology (Abdel-Meguid  et al., 1987) characteristic of the ligands in the  hematopoietic superfamily (Bazan, 1990), but punctuated by three short ``minihelices'' in the connecting loops.
The N-terminal ve residues point away  from the four-helix bundle core but are wellordered, presumably because they are stabilized by  crystal packing interactions, as described by  Sundstrom et al. (1996).
The seven C-terminal residues are poorly ordered, as they are in all hGH  structures determined to date.
  At the site of mutation in helix 3, the G120R substitution has not disturbed the main-chain conformation.
The arginine side-chain largely lls a  cavity in the site 2 surface of the wild-type hormone, eliminating the binding pocket for the sidechain of Trp169 of the receptor and thus sterically  preventing formation of a 1:2 complex.
The arginine side-chain forms hydrogen bonds to Asp116  and, in a crystal packing interaction, to the carbonyl oxygen of Asn114 of the receptor (2.6 A ).
  Structure of the hGHbp  The extracellular part of the receptor consists of  two compact domains connected by a short segment with helical conformation (Figures 1 and 2).
  Again, the general features are similar to those  seen in the structures of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes  (De Vos et al., 1992; Sundstrom et al., 1996).
Loop  73 to 78, which could not be modeled in the 1:2  complex, is part of the current model, although  some of the residues have poor electron density; its  conformation is presumably stabilized by crystal  packing interactions with the N terminus of a  neighboring hGH molecule (Sundstrom et al.,  1996).
  Each domain contains seven b-strands, organized in a b-sandwich consisting of sheets ABE  and CC0  FG with bronectin type III (FNIII) topology (Leahy et al., 1992).
The C-terminal domain  is a standard FNIII module (Muller et al., 1996),  but the N-terminal domain differs slightly in that  strand C0 crosses from one sheet to the other, residue 81 making hydrogen bonds to strand C and  residue 85 to E. The possible reason for this is the  presence of the sequence Cys83-Pro84, the cysteine  forming a disulde bridge to Cys94 in strand E.  This disulde bridge is conserved in class 1 of the  hematopoietic superfamily (Bazan, 1990), and similar cross-overs have been observed in the structures of the prolactin and erythropoietin receptors  (Somers et al., 1994; Livnah et al., 1996).
  An extended segment in polyproline conformation preceding strand G of the C-terminal  domain contains the residues equivalent to the socalled ``WSXWS box'', YGEFS (residues 222 to 226)  in the hGHbp.
The canonical main-chain conformation of the WSXWS box is characterized by  hydrogen bonds between the side-chains of the serine residues in the motif to neighboring main-chain  atoms (Kossiakoff et al., 1994; Muller et al., 1996;  Livnah et al., 1996).
This conformation is conserved  in the hGHbp, despite the absence of the rst serine of the motif; a water molecule is located at the  position where its Og would be.
Three well-ordered  water molecules are also present at the limited  interface between the N and C-terminal domains,  which otherwise contains no clear hydrophobic  core and few interdomain hydrogen bonds (Arg39  forms a salt bridge to Asp132 (2.9 A ); the NZ of  Arg43 hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl of Glu169  (3.4 A )).
  Structure of the hormone receptor interface  The structure of the 1:1 complex superimposes  well with that of the equivalent part of the 1:2  complex, showing that binding of the second  receptor does not induce any major conformational  changes in the 1:1 complex.
The hormone  receptor  interface is essentially the same as that previously  observed in the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes (De Vos  et al., 1992; De Vos & Kossiakoff, 1992; Sundstrom  et al., 1996), but the higher resolution and better  quality of the present structure make for improved  detail and allow identication of well-ordered  water molecules.
  Mapped on the surface of hGH, the hormone   receptor interface covers a contiguous area of  about 1350 A 2 on the side of the molecule dened  by the central part of helix 1, most of helix 4, and  the beginning (minihelix 1) and end of the rst  crossover connection.
This surface is in contact  with a region on the receptor that is centered on  the interface between the two FNIII modules.
The  orientation of the receptor in the complex is such  that the rst domain points to the hormone with  its C-terminal end, and the second with its N-terminal end.
Therefore, even though ligand-binding  determinants are contributed by both domains,  these are not on topologically equivalent segments  of the structure.
The rst domain contacts the hormone with loops AB, CC0  , EF and the linker;  additional contacts are made with some of the  exposed residues on strands G. The C-terminal  domain interacts with the hormone via residues on  loops BC and FG (Figure 1).
  The interface contains a central hydrophobic  area involving two tryptophan residues on the  receptor which are in close spatial proximity  (4.4 A ), Trp104 near the end of loop EFN (residues  97 to 106) and Trp169 near the end of loop BCC  (residues 159 to 170).
Together, these tryptophan  residues contribute about 20% of the total buried  surface area.
The side-chain of Trp104 is buried  between hGH residues Asp171, Lys172, Thr175  and Lys168 on helix 4; in addition, it is covered by  segment 60 to 63 of hGH (Figure 3(a)).
Two intermolecular hydrogen bonds are found between  receptor loop 101 to 107 and hGH: between the  amide of Ile103 and the carbonyl oxygen of Ser62,  and between the carbonyl oxygen of Trp104 and  the Nz of Lys168.
Loop EFN itself appears to be  1:1 hGH:Receptor Complex 1113stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the OZ of  Tyr107 and the main-chain of Thr101 and Ser102  (Figure 3(a)); in addition, the main-chain amide of  Trp104 is hydrogen-bonded to Od1 of Asp126 in  the domain-domain linker.
Van der Waals contacts  with Ile103 support the side-chain of Trp104  (3.7 A ); Ile103 is also very close to the side chain of  Trp169 of the receptor (4.0 A ).
Trp169 is part of an  intricate network of interactions involving receptor  loops BCC (residues 164 to 170) and ABN (residues  40 to 45), and helix 4 and the second minihelix of  hGH (Figure 3(b)).
The side-chain of Trp169 is  sandwiched between two arginine residues, Arg43  of the receptor and Arg64 of hGH; it also contacts  Thr175 and Ile179 on helix 4.
Apart from supporting Trp169, Arg43 makes hydrogen bonds with  hGH Asp171 and Thr175; conversely, hGH Arg64  interacts with Asp164 and Glu44 of the receptor.
  Additional intermolecular hydrogen bonds are  found between the carbonyl oxygen of Lys167 and  Ne2 of hGH Asn68, and between Od2 of Asp164  and Ne2 of hGH Gln63.
Receptor loops ABN and  BCC themselves interact via main-chain to sidechain hydrogen bonds between Trp169 and Arg43  (Figure 3(b)).
Within loop 40 to 45 of the receptor,  Glu42 appears to play an important role because  its side-chain interacts with no less than three  main-chain amides.
  The remaining receptor segments interacting  with the hormone are part of a more hydrophilic  periphery surrounding the hydrophobic tryptophan patch.
Arg71 and Trp76 on loop CC0  N  together with some exposed residues on strand GN  are in contact with the N-terminal part of the rst  crossover connection of hGH (residues 41 to 56).
  Arg71 forms a salt bridge to hGH Glu56, while the  Ne of Trp76 hydrogen-bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of hGH Leu45 (Figure 3(c)).
The rst minihelix  of hGH (residues 42 to 47) lies on top of the fourstranded sheet of the N-terminal domain of the  receptor.
Contacts in this region include the disul-  de bridge Cys108 Cys122 (to hGH Tyr42 and  Gln46), as well as a hydrogen bond between the  Oe2 of Glu120 and the Ne2 of hGH Gln46  (Figure 3(c)); in addition, Glu127 of the receptor  domain linker forms a salt bridge to Lys41 of hGH  (3.0 A ).
Receptor loop FGC is in contact with residues on helix 1 of hGH.
This site contains many  hydrophilic side-chains: receptor residues Arg217  and Asn218 cluster with hGH His18, His21 and  Glu174 (Figure 3(d)).
However, here no intermolecular hydrogen bonds are found.
  Of the 69 water molecules that were placed, 19  are within 4 A of both the receptor and the hormone, but only six form intermolecular hydrogen  bonds.
The central region of the interface is tightly  packed, and does not contain any water molecules.
  In contrast, three distinct clusters of ve or six  water molecules each penetrate inward from the  edges.
One cluster is located between receptor residues 98 to 101 and the N-terminal end of the  second hGH minihelix (see Figure 3(b)).
In this  cluster, one water molecule bridges between the  carbonyl oxygen of Arg43 and the main-chain  Figure 1.

Stereo views of comparisons between the 1:1 and 1:2  hGH:receptor complexes.
(a) Stereo  view of the superimposed C  a  atoms of the 1:1 complex (hGH in  red, receptor in green) and the  equivalent part of the 1:2 complex  (in gray).
The largest differences in  the hormone are in the N-terminal  segment and in the poorly ordered  and only partially visible connection between helices 3 and 4.
The  largest differences in the receptor  are in loops CC  0N and FG  N, which  are involved in crystal packing  interactions in the 1:1 complex and  not in the 1:2 complex, and in the  dipeptide Ser219-Gly220.
Excluding  these atoms from the calculation  yields an rms difference of 0.66 A  (323 C  a atoms), which is comparable to the difference of 0.81 A (368 Ca  s) between the 1:2 and 1:1 complexes published by Sundstrom et al. (1996).
This is very similar to  the rms differences obtained when  the hormones or receptors are  superimposed individually (0.52 A  for 157 C  a  s and 0.68 A for 166 C  a  s,  respectively), showing that there  are no conformational changes  upon formation of the 1:2 complex.
  (b) Stereo view of the C  a atoms of  hGH taken from the 1:1 complex  (red) superimposed on those of  hGH taken from the 1:2 complex  (in gray).
The four-helix bundle  core consists of residues 7 to 34  (helix 1), 72 to 92 (helix 2), 107 to  128 (helix 3) and 155 to 184 (helix  4).
Additional segments of helix are  found at residues 38 to 47 (minihelix 1), 64 to 70 (minihelix 2) and 94  to 100 (minihelix 3).
Residues 130  to 135 and 149 to 153 of the second  crossover connection between  helices 3 and 4 are not visible in  the electron density map and were  not modeled.
(c) Stereo view of the Ca atoms of the receptor taken  from the 1:1 complex (in green)  superimposed on the same receptor  taken from the 1:2 complex (in  gray).
Strands A to G of the  N-terminal domain consist of residues 35 to 40, 45 to 51, 65 to 70, 81  to 83, 92 to 96, 107 to 113, and 116  to 123, respectively.
Strands A to G  of the C-terminal domain consist of  135 to 142, 151 to 158, 171 to 180,  187 to 192, 195 to 202, 207 to 215,  and 229 to 231, respectively.
As  was the case in the 1:2 complex, no  density is present for residues 1 to  32 and 52 to 60 in the N-terminal  domain; in addition, residues 144  to 147 and residue 238 in the  C-terminal domain are also  disordered.

The second cluster is  near the receptor domain linker and the N-terminal  end of helix 4 of hGH; one water hydrogen bonds  to the side-chains of Glu127 and hGH Tyr164.
The  third cluster is located where the receptor domain  linker and loop FGC approach helix 1 of hGH (see  Figure 3(d)).
Here, a water molecules bridges  between the side-chains of Ser219 and hGH His21.
  Alanine scanning of the hGHbp  structural epitope  We used the rened 1:1 complex coordinates to  update our previous alanine scan, which was  based on a preliminary data set (Clackson and  Wells, 1995).
The recalculated structural epitope,  the set of residues whose side-chains lose solvent  accessibility upon hGH binding, excludes two residues (Asn72 and Thr194) and encompasses three  new ones (Arg70, Arg71 and Ser219).
Arg71 buries  80 A 2 of surface area upon binding, the fourthlargest burial for any contact side-chain.
The three  newly identied residues were individually  mutated to alanine, and the hGH binding afnity  was determined by radioimmunoassay as  described previously (Clackson & Wells, 1995).
  The complete alanine scan, presented in Table 1,  examines all residues in the recalculated structural  epitope excluding Gly168 and the Cys108 Cys122  disulde.
Of the newly analyzed mutants, S219A  has essentially unchanged afnity compared to the  wild-type protein, whereas both R70A and R71A  have afnities reduced two to threefold, corresponding to apparent binding energy contributions  of around 0.5 kcal/mol each.
Overall, these new  data are consistent with our previous conclusion  (Clackson & Wells, 1995) that nearly all the binding energy is accounted for by a central functional  epitope comprising 11 side-chains (Figure 4).
The  side-chains of Trp104 and Trp169 each contribute  the most, at least 4.5 kcal/mol.
The hydrophobic  side-chains of Ile103, Ile105, Pro106 and Ile165 also  make large apparent contributions (1.5 to 3.5 kcal/  mol) and combine with the tryptophan residues to  form a near-contiguous hydrophobic patch.
Lesser  contributions (1 to 2.2 kcal/mol) are made by the  ve charged residues Arg43, Glu44, Asp126,  Glu127 and Asp164.
Of the remaining 20 sidechains within the structural epitope, four (the  newly identied contacts Arg70 and Arg71, plus  Trp76 and Gln216) provide 0.5 to 0.9 kcal/mol  each and the rest impart little or no binding  energy.
  We also tested a number of alanine mutants of  residues just outside the structural epitope that  had been engineered for other purposes (Clackson  & Wells, 1995; Bass et al., 1991).
Mutations at  Glu42, Asn72, Thr77 or Thr194 had negligible  effects on afnity, as expected.
However, the  mutation K215A reduced binding fourfold, and  T101A by a factor of 20.
The T101A mutant has  substantially reduced binding afnity for a number  of monoclonal antibodies so is likely to be misfolded (Bass et al., 1991).
Thus some residues outside the structural epitope can inuence
binding  afnity indirectly, underscoring the need for caution when interpreting mutagenesis data in the  absence of structural information.
  Substitution of Phe96, which is located outside  the structural epitope, to serine is associated with  Laron-type dwarsm (Amselem et al., 1989).
F96S  was previously shown to retain wild-type binding  afnity for hGH using a dimerization-sensitive  assay (Bass et al., 1991), and we validated this nding here using the strict 1:1 binding assay (Table 1).
  We also conrmed that removal of residues 7  through 28, which mimics the naturally occurring  exon 3-deleted variant of the human hGH receptor  (Leung et al., 1987), does not affect binding (Bass  et al., 1991).
These residues are not visible in any  X-ray structure, and indeed we found that residues  1 through 28 could be deleted with no effect, as  could the C terminus as far in as residue 233.
Interestingly, the N-terminal deletions led to an  approximately vefold increase in protein  expression levels in Escherichia coli (data not  shown), and we took advantage of this by engineering subsequent mutations in the 1-28 background.
  Dissecting side-chain interactions in the  hGHbp functional epitope  Close examination of the functional epitope  (Figures 3 and 5) reveals a tightly-packed surface  with extensive intramolecular contacts between  Figure 3.
Stereo views of selected receptor-hGH interactions.
In these panels, the receptor is colored green and hGH  in red, water molecules are shown as red spheres, and broken lines represent hydrogen bonds.
Alanine mutagenesis  studies reveal that the pockets shown in (a) and (b) contain side-chains that are critical for high-afnity binding,  whereas side-chain interactions shown in (c) and (d) have little effect on binding.
(a) The binding pocket for Trp104.
  Loop EFN (residues 101 to 106) of the receptor interacts with residues on helix 4 (168 to 176) and 60 to 63 of hGH.
  A well-ordered water molecule (B  24 A 2  ) bridges between the carbonyl atoms of residues Ser102 and Pro106 and  the amide of Ile105.
(b) The binding pocket for Trp169.
Trp169 of loop BCC and Arg43 of loop ABN interact with residues 171 to 179 of helix 4 of hGH, as well as with the second minihelix (residues 64 to 68).
Several water molecules  are found near the periphery of the pocket (with B-factors varying between 19 and 49 A 2  ).
(c) Interactions between  the rst minihelix of hGH (residues 41 to 48) and the solvent-exposed face of the CC0  FG sheet of the N-terminal  domain of the receptor.
(d) Interactions between residues on helix 1 of hGH and loop FGC of the receptor.
No intermolecular hydrogen bonds are found; Glu174 of the hormone interacts with histidine residues 18 and 21.
  1:1 hGH:Receptor Complex 1117side-chains.
In particular, the two central tryptophan side-chains are entirely supported by the  side-chains of other residues, some of which (e.g.  Ile103) are largely buried beneath them.
This  strongly suggests that these supporting side-chains  contribute indirectly to binding, by inuencing  Trp104 and Trp169.
  For some of these residues, mutagenesis strategies can be devised to directly probe indirect contributions to binding.
For example, the most  important polar residue in the functional epitope is  Arg43, which contributes over 2.1 kcal/mol.
Arg43  makes a salt bridge to hGH residue Asp171 and a  hydrogen bond to Thr175 (Figures 3(b) and 6); in  addition, the alkyl portion of the side-chain underpins the indole ring of Trp169 through multiple  van der Waals interactions, and also contacts  Ile103 and Trp104 (Figure 6).
We reasoned that  substituting Arg43 for a residue with a long-chain  aliphatic side-chain would decouple these contributions, removing the intermolecular polar interactions while maintaining the intramolecular  packing.
We therefore engineered and analyzed  the mutants R43L and R43M, which provide nearly  isosteric replacements for the alkyl portion of  Arg43 but delete the guanidinium head group  Table 1.

  1118 1:1 hGH:Receptor Complex(Table 2).
Surprisingly, we found that the R43L  mutation destabilizes the complex by only  0.5 kcal/mol (1 kcal/mol for R43M).
This implies  that most of the energetic contribution reported by  the alanine substitution can be accounted for by  the intramolecular interactions of the alkyl portion  of Arg43, and that the electrostatic interactions  with hGH are relatively unimportant for afnity.
  To gain more insight into the roles of individual  side-chains, we used surface plasmon resonance in  the BIAcore biosensor (Pharmacia) to examine the  association kinetics of binding of selected hGHbp  mutants from the alanine scan.
Previously, kinetic  analysis of hGH residues in the functional epitope  showed that mutations typically do not have substantial effects on association kinetics; most residues function to stabilize the complex once formed  (Cunningham & Wells, 1993).
Here, we analyzed  the association kinetics of 24 alanine mutants of  Figure 4.

  1:1 hGH:Receptor Complex 1119hGHbp, a set encompassing all residues in the  functional epitope except for Trp104 and Trp169.
  For attachment to the BIAcore chip we used an  hGH mutant (T123C) that has an engineered  cysteine residue in site 2 (Cunningham et al., 1991),  allowing site-specic attachment and sterically  ensuring that only 1:1 complexes can form via  binding at site 1.
  Most mutants showed minimal changes in  association rate compared to wild-type hGHbp  (Table 1, nal column).
However, for P106A the  on-rate was reduced by a factor of 26.
This  is by far the largest reduction in association  rate observed for an alanine mutation at this,  or several other protein-protein interfaces  (Cunningham & Wells, 1993; Kelley &  O'Connell, 1993; Kelley, 1994).
Since the P106A  mutation presumably does not alter the electrostatics of association, we interpret these observations as reecting a key conformational role  for P106 (see Discussion).
  Affinity-inert and hindrance interactions at the  interface periphery  To evaluate in more detail the role of afnityinert contact residues that are peripheral to the  functional epitope, we mutated them to alanine in  clusters of two to six residues (Figure 7), a procedure termed alanine-shaving (Jin & Wells, 1994).
  Remarkably, these alanine shaves were no more  disruptive to afnity than any of the component  single mutants (Table 3).
In fact, most of the clustered mutants actually showed improvements in  binding afnity: up to fourfold for triple mutant D  (Q166A/K167A/V171A).
These improvements  were somewhat greater than predicted assuming  simple additivity (Wells, 1990) of the effects of  individual alanine substitutions (compare G  and Gadd in Table 3).
This indicates that within  each cluster the side-chains do not inuence af-  nity independently, but instead interact with each  other to form multi-residue ``hindrance determinants'' that reduce afnity for hGH.
  We found that afnity could be improved  further by combining the clusters of alanine  mutants.
When mutants B, C and D were combined in a step-wise manner to yield a variant with  seven alanine mutations, afnity was improved  about tenfold (Table 3).
In contrast to mutations  within each cluster, these combinations were largely additive.
This indicates that the hindrance  Table 2.

  Discussion  Activation of the growth hormone receptor  Now that the structures of the intermediate, 1:1  complex and the active, 1:2 complex are known,  the extent of any conformational changes occurring  upon receptor activation can be assessed.
Analyses  of the changes between free and complexed hGH  have been described both for wild-type hGH  (Chantalat et al., 1995) and for an increased-afnity  variant with 15 mutations (Ultsch et al., 1994).
  Within the hormone four segments differ signi-  cantly between the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes: the  N-terminal ve residues, the segment linking  helices 3 and 4, Val102-Tyr103, and Gln49-Thr50  (Figure 2(b)).
The last three segments are not  involved in receptor interactions and poorly  ordered in all hGH structures thus far determined;  these segments apparently also adapt to different  crystal packing environments.
The N-terminal ve  residues, which adapt to the crystal packing  environment in the 1:1 complex and in the free  hGH variant, are likely to be exible in solution for  both these species.
In the 1:2 complex, this segment  interacts with the second receptor (see Figure 1).
  Therefore, the conformation observed in the 1:2  complex is likely selected and/or stabilized upon  binding of the second receptor.
  Superposition of the receptor taken from the 1:1  complex on the equivalent receptor from the 1:2  complex shows that their structures are very similar (Figure 2(c)).
The only regions where signicant  differences are observed are in residues at the edge  of disordered segments, in loop 71 to 78, only part  of which was ordered in the 1:2 complex, in  Ser219-Gly220, which have moved by 1.5 to 3 A ,  and in loop 144 to 148.
The relevance of the shift in  219-220 is unclear, but the disorder in loop 144 to  148 is potentially of biological relevance.
In the 1:2  complex, these residues are well-ordered and take  part in the contact surface between the two receptors.
Therefore, it appears that binding of the  second receptor stabilizes this loop in the conformation observed in the 1:2 complex.
Superposition  of the 1:1 complex on the equivalent part of the 1:2  complex reveals that the orientation of the rst  receptor with respect to the hormone is the same  (Figure 2(a)).
Thus, ligand binding by the rst  receptor is sufcient to orient the C-terminal  domain properly for the interaction with the  second receptor.
  In conclusion, consistent with the observations  by Sundstrom et al. (1996), the only relevant differences we observe are a reduction in mobility of the  N-terminal chain segment in hGH and a loop in  the receptor.
The inherent mobility of receptor loop  144 to 148 may have biological importance.
In the  1:1 complex, disorder in this loop may decrease the  inherent afnity of free receptors for each other,  disfavoring dimerization in the absence of ligand.
  Aside from reduced exibility, conformational  changes in ligand or receptor do not appear to  play a role in the transition from the 1:1 to the 1:2  complex.
Therefore, the 1:1 complex is a productive template ready to accept the second receptor (Kossiakoff et al., 1994), supporting the  conclusion reached from a modeling experiment  using the 1:1 hGH:prolactin receptor complex  (Somers et al., 1994).
  Many functional residues contribute indirectly  to binding affinity  We have used a scanning mutagenesis strategy  to dissect the contributions of hGHbp side-chains  to binding energy.
Such approaches typically  assume that no structural disturbances are caused  by the mutations, so that the energetic consequences are entirely attributable to the deletion of  contacts (Wells, 1990).
Here, we explicitly  attempted to identify mutations that might affect  neighboring residues, to reveal indirect contriTable 3.

  1:1 hGH:Receptor Complex 1121butions in binding, while still assuming there were  no global structural alterations.
These assumptions  can be made with much greater condence when,  as in this study, structural data are available to  guide mutant design and data interpretation.
In  the absence of direct structural data for each individual mutant complex, we cannot be certain that  our interpretation is correct; however, the observation that only a small subset of alanine substitutions signicantly disrupts binding suggests that  large structural disruptions did not occur.
  The revised alanine scan (Table 1) shows that  only 11 residues contribute substantially to hGH  binding afnity (Arg43, Glu44, Ile103, Trp104,  Ile105, Pro106, Asp126, Glu127, Asp164, Ile165 and  Trp169).
However, close inspection of the 1:1 complex structure suggests that many of these play  indirect structural roles, by supporting and positioning Trp104 and Trp169 for binding.
For  example, mutation of Asp126 to alanine reduces  binding by 1 kcal/mol (Table 1).
However, its only  interactions across the interface to hGH are via  multiple water-mediated hydrogen bonds through  Od2  .
In contrast Asp126 makes intramolecular van  der Waals contact with the Trp104 indole ring (Cg  to Cd1  ) and also makes a good hydrogen bond to  the Trp104 main-chain (Asp126 Od1 to Trp104 NH,  2.8 A ; Figure 3(a)); both are likely to be critical to  appropriate presentation of the Trp104 side-chain.
  Alanine mutations at three isoleucine residues that  are near the critical tryptophan residues, Ile103,  Ile105 and Ile165, reduce the binding energy by  between 1.6 and 2.1 kcal/mol.
But only about 10%  of the surface area of Ile103 is exposed at the  hGHbp surface, where it makes a single van der  Waals contact to the main-chain oxygen of Ser62 in  hGH.
In contrast, Ile103 makes numerous intramolecular contacts with other functionally important  residues in the hGHbp, notably Trp104 and Arg43  (Figure 6).
Similarly, the Ile105 side-chain makes  van der Waals contact with Ile103 (Figures. 2(b)  and 6), as well as to the side-chains of Ser102 and  Arg70; the closest residue in hGH is the Ser62 sidechain about 5 A away from Ile105 (Figure 3(a)),  and the S62A mutation in hGH has no effect on  binding afnity anyway (Cunningham & Wells,  1993).
Finally, the Ile165 side-chain makes van der  Waals contact with the Met170 main-chain as part  of a turn that includes the Trp169 side-chain; the  only intermolecular contact is to the main-chain of  Ser189 of hGH.
  We demonstrated indirect roles for other residues by detailed mutagenesis experiments.
Aliphatic substitutions at Arg43 (Table 2) suggest that  its major function is to support Trp169 and/or  Trp104.
Although the guanido group of Arg43  makes two electrostatic interactions with hGH, the  fact that the R43L mutant binds only twofold less  tightly than wild-type hGHbp indicates the aliphatic portion that contacts Trp104 and Trp169  accounts for most of the 2.1 kcal/mol apparent  contribution of the Arg43 side-chain.
  Similarly, kinetic analysis (Table 1) suggests that  about 2 of the 3.3 kcal/mol apparent contribution  of Pro106 is attributable to its indirect role in maintaining a binding-competent conformation for the  loop that supports Trp104.
Pro106 is in van der  Waals contact with Leu45 on hGH (Figure 6).
  Although these are the only intermolecular contacts made by either side-chain, the L45A mutation  reduced hGH binding afnity only eightfold  (Cunningham & Wells, 1993) whereas P106A  reduces hGHbp afnity 265-fold (Table 1).
The discrepancy is approximately equal to the reduction  in association rate of P106A.
In the 1:1 complex  with hGH, the loop supporting Trp104 and Pro106  is in a strained conformation, and assumes substantially different conformations when binding  site 1 compared to site 2 (De Vos et al., 1992;  Sundstrom et al., 1996).
Our data are therefore consistent with a dual function for Pro106, rst locking  the 100's loop in a conformation appropriate for  productive site 1 binding, thus increasing the rate  of association, and then making energetic contacts  with hGH Leu45, slowing dissociation.
Analogous  conformation-sensitive effects on association kinetics have been observed previously for the binding of antibodies to constrained and free peptides  (Zeder-Lutz et al., 1993).
  A small functional epitope  Together, these observations indicate that the  hot spot on the hGHbp is even more focused than  previously appreciated.
The revised functional epitope, reecting only major direct contributions to  binding energy, probably encompasses only the  hydrophobic Trp104 and Trp169 side-chains, each  contributing 5 4.5 kcal/mol; the direct interaction  of Pro106 with hGH Leu45 (about 1.3 kcal/mol);  plus Glu44 (1.7 kcal/mol), Glu127 (1.0 kcal/mol)  and Asp164 (1.5 kcal/mol).
  It is striking that most of the key side-chains in  the hGH and hGHbp functional epitopes participate in aliphatic-aromatic stacking interactions.
For  example, the alkyl portion of Lys172 of hGH packs  tightly on top of Trp104 of the hGHbp, and the  g-methyl of Thr175 from hGH also contacts Trp104  (see Figures 2(a) and 6).
Alanine mutations at  either Lys172 or Thr175 reduce afnity by 1.5 to  2.5 kcal/mol (Cunningham & Wells, 1993).
Similarly, Arg64 is one of the most important functional determinants from hGH (Cunningham &  Wells, 1993), and the aliphatic portion of its sidechain packs directly against Trp169, while its guanido group interacts with Asp164 and Glu44 on  the hGHbp (Figures 2(b) and 8); the other face of  Trp169 packs againts Arg43 of the hGHbp  (Figures 2(b) and 8).
The complex between human  interferon-g and the soluble a-subunit of its receptor is also characterized by stacking between aromatic and charged side-chains (Walter et al., 1995).
  Lysine and especially arginine residues may have  particular advantages for the assembly of compact  functional epitopes, because they can contribute  1122 1:1 hGH:Receptor Complexsubstantial binding energy through aliphatic-aromatic stacking as well as their charged interactions,  knitting together disparate parts of the epitope by  virtue of their large size (Figures 6 and 8).
  ``Hard'' and ``soft'' functional epitopes  Now that both sides of the interface have been  exhaustively analyzed by alanine scanning, it is  possible to compare the energetics on each side.
  Additivity analysis is useful to dissect the functional independence of side-chains (Carter et al.,  1984; for a review see Wells, 1990).
Summation of  the disruptive effects of the alanine mutations in  hGHbp (G) produces a value in excess of  28 kcal/mol (Table 1).
The actual G value  may be larger because we have not been able to  measure an afnity for the W104A or W169A  mutants.
By comparison, the G for alanine  mutations on the hGH side is only 16 kcal/mol  (Cunningham & Wells, 1993).
This difference in  G values is not due to hGH using more mainchain interactions than the hGHbp because for  each protein more than 90 percent of the contacts  are with side-chain atoms beyond the b-carbon.
  Both G values also exceed the total binding free energy of complex formation  (G  12.3 kcal/mol for an interaction with  Kd  0.3 nM).
  The substantially greater G value for  hGHbp is consistent with our ndings that many  side-chains contribute indirectly to binding by supporting Trp104 and Trp169.
By contrast, the  important side-chains in hGH appear to act in a  more independent fashion.
Indeed when single  and multiple mutations are combined in hGH  (Cunningham et al., 1991; Lowman & Wells, 1993),  or its close homolog human placental lactogen  (Lowman et al., 1991), the energetic consequences  are quite additive.
Overall, the G values give  the impression that the binding surface on the  hGHbp is ``softer'' than that on hGH.
In part this  probably reects the rigidity of secondary structural scaffolds on which the epitopes are presented,  and their relative discontinuity: the major binding  determinants from hGH are on helices whereas  those of the hGHbp are displayed from loops.
  A possible role for peripheral residues  in specificity  Alanine-shaving of 16 afnity-inert contact sidechains (Figure 7) further supports the notion that  these residues do not contribute signicant binding  energy.
Several side-chains actually hinder binding, and simultaneously mutating them to alanine  can improve afnity up to tenfold (Table 3).
We  have found similar effects when mutating hGH  (Cunningham & Wells, 1989), and have produced  an octa-alanine mutant of hGH that binds the  hGHbp 50-fold more tightly than the wild-type  hGH (B. Cunningham & J.W., unpublished results).
  Not all peripheral side-chains act as hindrance  determinants: additional groups of hGH residues  have been identied that can be simultaneously  mutated to alanine with no change in afnity for  hGHbp (Pearce et al., 1996) or a monoclonal antibody (Jin & Wells, 1994).
Nevertheless, on both  sides of the interface numerous contact side-chains  that are peripheral to the functional epitope actually impede binding, and large improvements in  afnity can be made simply by deleting them.
  Because these simple mutations have not been  selected during evolution, the observed wild-type  hormone-receptor afnity is presumably optimized  for the overall physiological role of hGH.
Possibly,  tighter binding would lead to aberrant signaling or  receptor recycling properties.
However, there may  be other roles for the peripheral contact residues  which limit their ability to change (Cunningham &  Wells, 1993; Somers et al., 1994; Clackson & Wells,  1995).
Most of these side-chains are polar or  charged, and thus may be important for solubility  of the protein when unbound (Jones & Thornton,  1996).
We have observed a rough correlation that  as the number of alanine mutations at these sites  increases, expression levels in E. coli go down  (T.C. & J.W., unpublished results), suggesting that  the mutant proteins are either relatively unstable  or insoluble and prone to aggregation.
Some peripheral residues may also be involved in other  specic interactions.
For example, in the active 1:2  complex two molecules of hGHbp interact with  hGH sites 1 and 2 using the same contact residues  Figure 8.
An example of the importance of both intramolecular and intermolecular alkyl-aromatic stacking  interactions in the hGH:hGHbp interface.
The side-chain  of Trp169 is sandwiched between Arg43 of the receptor  and Arg64 of hGH.
Both arginine residues are oriented  by intermolecular charge-mediated hydrogen bonds.
  1:1 hGH:Receptor Complex 1123(De Vos et al., 1992; De Vos & Kossiakoff, 1992);  some of the side-chains that contribute no binding  energy to the interaction at site 1 may do so when  binding site 2, and the overall composition of the  interface probably reects a compromise between  these roles.
Furthermore, some hGH residues that  contribute no binding afnity to hGHbp are critical  for binding to the human prolactin receptor  (Cunningham & Wells, 1991; Somers et al., 1994).
  Taken together, our data suggest a key role for  the afnity-inert region in conferring specicity to  the functional epitope, dened broadly as the selective prevention of interaction with inappropriate  targets (of which aggregation is an extreme  example).
Hydrophobic contacts can contribute  substantial binding energy but are fairly non-directional and non-specic (Tsai et al., 1996).
Framing  the functional epitope within an extended polar  context is likely to preclude the binding of non-target molecules, through a combination of steric and  electrostatic repulsion, while still permit the binding of ``correct'' alternative partners.
In this model,  the hindrance determinants that reduce afnity for  hGH would have far more drastic effects on af-  nity for non-target proteins.
Similarly, the charged  side-chains within the functional epitope (Arg43,  Glu44, Glu127 and Asp164) would also be  expected to contribute to specicity.
Indeed, the  R43L mutation has been reported to allow the  hGH receptor to cross-react with bovine GH,  whereas the wild-type receptor does not bind  (Goodman et al., 1996).
  Although the specicity of an interaction is more  difcult to dene and quantify than its afnity, it  is a critical feature of biological activity, particularly for transient interactions between proteins  (such as hGH and its receptor) that spend most of  their time unbound and in the presence of high  concentrations of non-target molecules.
Imparting  specicity to functional epitopes may be a general  function of peripheral interface residues in proteinprotein complexes.
  Conclusions and implications  Hot spots of binding energy have been found or  predicted at numerous other protein-protein interfaces (Novotny et al., 1989; Jin et al., 1992; Kelley &  O'Connell, 1993; Nuss et al., 1993; Jin & Wells,  1994; Tulip et al., 1994; Dall'Acqua et al., 1996).
  Although one example of an antibody-antibody  complex has been described in which binding  energy is distributed diffusely across an interface  (Dall'Acqua et al., 1996), hot spots appear to be the  rule rather than the exception.
Our data suggest  that, especially for soft epitopes that are presented  from loops, the true functional epitopes may be  even more focused than those indicated by alanine  scanning.
  The existence of hot spots suggests that it may  be possible to build small molecules that mimic  them.
Several recent studies have demonstrated  the transfer of protein binding determinants to  smaller scaffolds (Li et al., 1995; Wrighton et al.,  1996; Braisted & Wells, 1996; reviewed by  Cunningham & Wells, 1997).
These experiments  strongly encourage efforts to use hot spots as starting points for rational and combinatorial design of  small molecule mimics.
For the hGHbp functional  epitope, our data suggest that attention should  focus on precise presentation of elements mimicking the indole rings of W104 and W169.
However,  they also highlight the problem of equipping  mimics of largely hydrophobic hot spots with the  specicity determinants likely to be required for  biological activity.
  Materials and Methods  Data collection  A slightly truncated form (residues 1 to 238) of the  extracellular domain of the growth hormone receptor  was expressed in E. coli and puried as described  (Ultsch et al., 1991; Ultsch & De Vos, 1993).
The 1:1 complex was formed with the G120R hGH mutant, and crystallized in space group P41212 or P43212, with cell  parameters a  67.7 A , c  228 A (Ultsch & De Vos,  1993).
(These crystals are very similar to those described  by Sundstrom et al., 1996.) Diffraction data were collected at room temperature using an Enraf-Nonius FAST  area detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200 X-ray generator operated at 45 kV, 90 mA, using graphite-monochromated CuKa radiation and a 0.3 mm collimator.
Data  collection was controlled by MADNES (Messerschmidt  & Pugrath, 1987) and data were further processed with  PROCOR (Kabsch, 1988).
A data set to 2.6 A resolution  was collected from six crystals.
For each crystal two  detector settings were used to collect about 70 degrees of  rotation in increments of 0.1. For three crystals, the distance was 130 mm and the swing angle 10 or 24, for  the other three crystals the detector was at 175 mm and  14 or 27. A total of 51,354 observations (14,489 unique  reections) were merged with Rmerge  6.3%.
The overall  completeness of the resulting data set was 85%, with a  completeness and Rmerge of 78% and 11.6%, respectively,  in the resolution shell between 2.7 and 2.6 A (Table 4).
  Molecular replacement and refinement  Structure solution was achieved with X-plor (Bru nger,  1990a), using a model appropriately adjusted from the  1:2 complex (De Vos et al., 1992) and data between 8 and  4 A resolution.
The correct rotation solution was the  highest peak in the list, albeit by less than 0.5 sigma over  the highest noise peak.
After Patterson correlation renement (Bru nger, 1990b), the correlation coefcient for the  correct solution was 0.111, with the highest incorrect  peak at 0.036.
A translation search was performed in  both P41212 and P43212.
The highest correlation coef-  cient in P43212 was 0.46, which compared to 0.27 for the  highest value in P41212, demonstrating the former to be  the correct space group.
All renement was carried out  using X-plor (Bru nger, 1990a); in the nal rounds the  Engh and Huber parameter set was used (Engh &  Huber, 1991).
Rigid-body renement of the model  resulted in a crystallographic R-value of 0.39 (data  between 8 and 3 A resolution), and a difference electron  density map showed clear evidence for the side-chain of  Arg120.
Cycles of rebuilding using FRODO (Jones, 1978)  1124 1:1 hGH:Receptor Complexand simulated annealing renement, alternated with  renement of tightly restrained individual temperature  factors, brought the R-value down to 0.227 (all data  between 10 and 2.6 A resolution).
Inclusion of water  molecules in combination with positional renement and  manual adjustments to the model resulted in a nal  R-value of 0.187 (7 to 2.6 A , all 13,831 measured reections with F > 0 (86% completeness)).
The nal model  consists of residues 1 to 129, 136 to 148 and 154 to 191 of  hGH, and 33 to 51, 61 to 143 and 148 to 237 of the receptor, together with 69 water molecules, all with temperature factors lower than 60 A 2 (29 have temperature  factors between 12 A 2 and 30 A 2  ).
Following the de-  nitions used in PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), 88%  of the residues have main-chain torsion angles within  the most favored regions, with all remaining non-glycine  residues within the additionally-allowed regions.
The  stereochemistry of the protein molecules is characterized  by rms deviations from ideality of 0.011 A and 1.6 in  bond lengths and angles, respectively.
The average B-factor for all 3113 non-hydrogen atoms in the nal model is  30.8 A 2 (33.1 A 2 for hGH and 28.5 A 2 for the receptor);  the rms B-factor difference between bonded atoms is  2.4 A 2  .
The coordinates and structure factors have been  deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (entry  codes 1a22 and r1a22sf respectively).
  Engineering and expression of hGHbp mutants  Variants of hGHbp were prepared using the plasmid  phGHbp(1-238) (Fuh et al., 1990), which encodes residues  1 to 238 under the control of the alkaline phosphatase  promoter and downstream of the stII leader sequence to  direct periplasmic secretion.
Those mutants not available  from previous work (Clackson & Wells, 1995; Bass et al.,  1991) were constructed essentially as described (Carter,  1991) but using a uracil-containing template (Kunkel  et al., 1991).
Yields of mutant clones were increased to  >95% by template purication on Qiagen Q-100 columns  before use, using the conditions recommended by the  manufacturer.
Positive clones were identied by dideoxy  sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977) of single-stranded templates prepared by a shortened procedure (Meeker et al.,  1993), using Sequenase 2.0 (USB).
  For expression, plasmids were transferred to E. coli  KS330 (Strauch & Beckwith, 1988).
Proteins were prepared from 400 ml cultures grown in shake asks, using  a modication of a described procedure (Fuh et al.,  1990).
Briey, periplasmic proteins were recovered from  cells by a freeze-thaw cycle and extraction into hypotonic  buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA and  1 mM PMSF: hereafter buffer A).
The extract was  adjusted to 300 mM NaCl, and passed rst over DEAEcellulose (Pharmacia) and then an afnity matrix comprising hGH coupled randomly through primary amine  groups to controlled-pore glass (Sigma).
After washing  with buffer A adjusted to 1 M NaCl, mutant hGHbps  were eluted with buffer A containing 2 M KSCN,  immediately desalted into PBS plus 0.02% (w/v) sodium  azide, and concentrated.
The resulting proteins were  >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE, and the nal yield  was 1.5 mg per liter of culture for the wild-type protein.
  Five single mutants (E44A, E120A, E127A, D164A and  K167A) and most of the multiple alanine mutants  (Table 3) expressed poorly, and were therefore prepared  from 10 liter fermentation cultures (Fuh et al., 1990)  using the same procedure.
hGHbp mutants W104A,  P106A and W169A were puried to 90% homogeneity  from fermentation cultures by periplasmic extraction,  ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and  hydrophobic interaction chromatography (column  PH/M) on a BioCAD workstation (Perseptive Biosystems).
Wild-type hGHbp was quantied by absorbance  (e280 0.1%  2.35).
hGHbp mutants were quantied by  laser scanning densitometry of Coomassie blue-stained  SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the wild-type protein as  a standard, with an accuracy estimated at  15%.
hGH  mutant T123C was puried to >95% homogeneity as  described (Cunningham & Wells, 1989) and quantied  by absorbance (e 277 0.1%  0.92).
  Radio-immunoassays  The afnity of each mutant was determined by competitive displacement of hGH from a xed concentration  of hGHbp, using 125I-labeled hGH as a tracer, as  described (Spencer et al., 1988).
In order to assay only the  1:1 interaction and avoid receptor dimerization, our  assay used a monoclonal anti-hGHbp antibody (Mab 5)  that sterically prevents binding of the second receptor  (Cunningham et al., 1991; Duquesnoy et al., 1994).
Binding reactions were allowed to equilibrate overnight at  room temperature in the presence of a 500-fold molar  excess of Mab 5 (Barnard et al., 1984).
Mab 5 was supplied by Agen Biomedical (Parsippany, NJ).
hGH was  iodinated by the chloramine-T method.
Displacement  curves were reformulated as Scatchard plots for calculation of dissociation constants (Kd).
  Kinetic analysis by surface plasmon resonance  hGH T123C was immobilized within ow cells on a  biosensor chip CM-5 docked into the BIAcoreTM (Pharmacia), essentially as described (Cunningham & Wells,  1993; Kelley, 1994).

  1:1 hGH:Receptor Complex 1125matrix was activated with N-ethyl-N0  -(3-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide  (NHS).
For coupling through random amine groups, aliquots of protein (at 50 to 100 mg/ml in 25 mM sodium  acetate, pH 5.0) were injected until approximately 1200  RU (resonance units) were attached, after which remaining unreacted NHS-ester groups were blocked with ethanolamine.
For coupling through an engineered cysteine  residue, proteins were gently reduced with 50 mM  cysteine for two hours at 4C immediately prior to coupling (and then exhaustively desalted), to deblock the  thiol group.
The activated matrix was reacted with  80 mM 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)-ethaneamine (PDEA) in  0.1 mM sodium borate (pH 8.5) and then with the  deblocked protein (at 50-100 mg/ml in 25 mM sodium  acetate, pH 5.0) until approximately 800 RU were bound.
  Unreacted NHS groups were blocked by addition of  ethanolamine.
  All binding reactions were carried out at room temperature in PBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 at a  ow rate of 20 ml/min.
The matrix was regenerated by  injecting 15 ml of 10 mM HCl.
This treatment completely  destroyed the binding activity of hGHbp, but the hGH  T123C matrix itself could be re-used more than 100 times  without any change in binding kinetics and with little  baseline drift.
Six twofold serial dilutions of the hGHbp  mutants were prepared starting at 500 nM (2 mM for  P106A).
Association rates were calculated from the concentration dependence of the observed pseudo-rst  order rate constants (Kelley, 1994) using BIAevaluation  2.1 software from Pharmacia.
  To eliminate variation between different ow cells  and chips caused by slightly different coupled protein  densities, all rate constant values were normalized to  those of the wild-type protein determined on the same  matrix.
Determinations of association rate constants were  repeated at least twice for each mutant.
