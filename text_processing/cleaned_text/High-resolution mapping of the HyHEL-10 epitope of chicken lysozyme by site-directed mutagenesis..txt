Davies, December 30, 1992 (received for review September 1, 1992)  ABSTRACT The complex formed between hen egg white  lysozyme (HEL) and the monoclonal antibody HyHEL-10 Fab  fragment has an interface composed of van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and a single ion pair.
The antibody  overlaps part of the active site cleft.
Putative critical residues  within the epitope region of HEL, identified from the x-ray  crystallographic structure of the complex, were replaced by  site-directed mutagenesis to probe their relative importance in  determining affinity of the antibody for HEL.
Twenty single  mutations of HEL at three contact residues (Arg-21HEL, Asp101HEL, and Gly-102HEL) and at a partially buried residue  (Asn-19HEL) in the epitope were made, and the effects on the  free energies of dissociation were measured.
A correlation  between increased amino acid side-chain volume and reduced  affinity for HELs with mutations at position 101 was observed.
  The D101GHEL mutant is bound to HyHEL-10 as tightly as  wild-type enzyme, but the AAGdi. is increased by about 2.2  kcal (9.2 kJ)/mol for the larger residues in this position.
HEL  variants with lysine or histidine replacements for arginine at  position 21 are bound 1.4-2.7 times more tightly than those  with neutral or negatively charged amino acids in this position.
  These exhibit 1/40 the affinity for HyHEL-10 Fab compared  with wild type.
There is no side-chain volume correlation with  AAGdbwc at position 21.
Although Gly-102HEL and Asn-19HmL  are in the epitope, replacements at these positions have no effect  on the affinity of HEL for the antibody.
  A major goal of immunochemistry has been to provide a  quantitative understanding of the specificity of immune receptors for antigens.
Such knowledge requires the elucidation of both the structural and the functional bases of complementarity.
We have focused on monoclonal antibodies  (mAbs) specific for hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) as a  model for understanding protein-protein interactions in general.
The detailed topography of the interaction between a  mAb and a macromolecular antigen became clear when  high-resolution x-ray structures for three HEL-mAb complexes were published (1-3).
The three antibodies, D1.3,  HyHEL-5, and HyHEL-10, recognize different sites  (epitopes) on the HEL molecule.
There is a small overlap of  the D1.3 and HyHEL-10 epitopes.
All three sites are discontinuous, comprising between 14 and 17 lysozyme amino acids  in contact with 17-19 antibody residues.
There are numerous  van der Waals interactions (up to 111), 12-14 hydrogen  bonds, and 0-3 salt bridges.
The contact areas of the three  epitopes range from 690 to 774 A2 (4).
The recently refined  x-ray structure of D1.3 complexed with its anti-idiotype  revealed a similar picture (5).
Although x-ray structures have  given us detailed information about the structural contacts in  the interface, the quantitative contributions ofeach residue to  specificity and affinity have not yet been defined.
  Before the advent of site-directed mutagenesis technology,  epitopes were broadly defined by examining the crossreactivity of mAbs raised against defined proteins with naturally occurring variants of those proteins (reviewed in ref.
  6), but the residues which could be evaluated were limited by  availability of sequenced naturally occurring variants.
Previous investigations with chicken and Japanese quail  lysozymes identified residues 19, 21, 102, and/or 103 as  critical residues for HyHEL-10 binding but failed to implicate  Asp-101HEL (7).
Other experimental approaches to epitope  mapping have included chemical modification ofamino acids,  protein footprinting, studies with peptide binding, and rates  of solvent exchange of individual protons within the epitope  determined by two-dimensional NMR (reviewed in ref.
8).
  These techniques allow identification of potential contact  residues, but they do not evaluate individual contributions to  the free energy ofassociation.
Replacement of specific amino  acids in proteins by site-directed mutagenesis allows for a  rationally designed, systematic, and quantitative analysis of  the interaction between antibodies and protein antigens.
  Several mAb-protein complexes have been partially studied  by this technique (9-14), but high-resolution x-ray structures  are not yet available for these complexes to allow structural  interpretation.
  HEL has been heterologously expressed in the laboratory  of J.F.K. (15).
We report here an investigation of the thermodynamic contributions of specific antigen residues within  the crystallographically defined epitope by site-directed mutagenesis.
The results on the HEL-HyHEL-10 complex together with those discussed on the HEL-HyHEL-5 complex  (16) allow us to estimate the quantitative contribution of  specific antigenic residues to antibody-protein recognition.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 (1993) 3959  Mutant Lysozyme Preparation.
Site-directed mutagenesis  and expression of chicken lysozyme mutants in yeast were  performed as described by Malcolm et al. (15) with the  following modifications: A single transformed yeast colony  was inoculated into 5 ml of minimal medium and shaken at  30C for 36-48 hr.
This seed culture was used to inoculate 50  ml of minimal medium in a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask, which  was shaken for 48 hr.
The flask was used to inoculate 500 ml  of 1% yeast extract/2% bactopeptone/8% glucose medium in  a 2.8-liter Fernbach flask.
The cells were grown for 7-9 days.
  They were harvested in a Beckman model J2-21 centrifuge  (JA-10 rotor at 5000 rpm, 15 min), washed twice with 60 ml  of 0.5 M NaCl, and collected by centrifugation.
The supernatants were pooled, diluted 5-fold with deionized H20, and  loaded onto a 20-ml column of CM-Sepharose Fast Flow  (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 0.1 M potassium phosphate,  pH 6.24.
The column was washed with 200 ml of 0.1 M  potassium phosphate, pH 6.24, and lysozyme was eluted with  50 ml of 0.5 M NaCl/0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.24.
  Fractions were assayed by activity (decrease in OD450 of M.  lysodeikticus cell wall suspensions).
Those containing lysozyme were concentrated in Centricon-10 (Amicon) filter  units, washed with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH  6.24, and stored at 4C.
Protein concentration was determined from Al% = 26.4 (17).
  Competitive Inhibition Assays.
All natural variants and  site-directed mutants of lysozyme used in this study exhibited  at least 50% of wild-type activity.
The values of the lysozyme-HyHEL-10 dissociation constants were determined by  taking advantage of the fact that the antibody (Ab) occludes  the enzyme (E) active site (3).
As a result, the HyHEL10HEL complex is essentially catalytically inactive (6) (see  the scheme below, in which S = substrate and P = product).
  E + S - ES - E + P  Ab 4  E-Ab (inactive)  This was demonstrated in all cases tested by the nearly total  loss of enzyme activity upon addition of excess antibody.
The  level of residual catalytic activity can therefore be used to  estimate the concentration of free (uncomplexed) enzyme.
  The lysozyme species were preequilibrated with various  concentrations of antibody in the presence of added bovine  serum albumin as described in ref.
18 (1 hr in 66 mM  potassium phosphate, pH 6.24, at 25C).
Catalytic activity  was measured by following a modified procedure of Shugar  (19).
Dissociation constants, Kd, were calculated by nonlinear regression to the model described in Eq. 1, using the SAS  program (20):  V= Vo- (VO- V1) X  (Kd + 2[Ab] + [Lz]) - V(Kd + 2[Ab] + [Lz])2 - 8[Ab][Lz]  2[Lz]  [1]  where [Ab] = concentration of total antibody, [Lz] = concentration oftotal lysozyme, Vis the remaining activity in the  solution, and V0 and V1 are the activities of lysozyme in the  absence of added antibody and the presence of excess  antibody, respectively.
The dissociation constants listed in  Tables 1 and 3 were calculated as weighted averages of  several determinations for each lysozyme mutant.
  The free energies of dissociation of the lysozyme-antibody  complexes were calculated from Eq. 2:  AAG = AGWT - AGMut = -RTln(Kwr/KMu), [2]  where WT = wild type, Mut = mutant, R is the gas constant,  and T is absolute temperature.
The errors in AAG (WT -  Mut) were calculated from the errors in the measured Kd  values from Eqs. 3 and 4:  or(KMut/KwT)  = V(orKMut/KWT)2 + [KMut/(KWT)2]2(Y,KWT)2  cr(AAG) = RTr(KMut/KT)/(KMut/KT).
  [31  [4]  Particle Concentration Fluorescence Immunoassays (PCFIAs).
Antigen inhibition PCFIAs were performed with an  automated immunoassay system (Screen Machine; Idexx  Laboratories, Westbrook, ME) as described in detail elsewhere (18).
The percent bound was calculated relative to a  control containing trace amounts of lysozyme and a background reading with diluent in the place of antibody.
Binding  data were corrected for monovalent/bivalent binding to the  solid phase according to Stevens (21).
The concentration of  antigen (B50) required to give a bound-to-free ratio = 0.5  maximum was calculated for each antigen by regression  analysis on log-logit transformed data.
KMUt was approximated from the PCFIA B50 values by the relationship of Eq.  5 (22):  B50WT KWT log = log  BsOMut KMUt [5]  where BSOWT and B50MUt represent the B50 values of wild type  lysozyme and mutant lysozyme, respectively.
Wild-type  (naturally derived) HEL was used as a standard with Kwr =  2.22 x 10-11 M as determined previously by PCFIA according to the method of Friguet et al. (23) under conditions  described by Lavoie et al. (24).
Calculated values of KWT and  KMUt were used to determine the AAGdir,0c as described  above.
  RESULTS  Contributions of the ASp-101HEL Side Chain to the Free  Energy of Association.
Asp-101HEL is of particular interest  because it contributes to the free energy of association of  substrate ligands with the enzyme (25, 26), and both sidechain and backbone atoms of this residue form contacts with  HyHEL-10 in the HEL HyHEL-10 complex (3).
Nine single  mutations were made at position 101 of HEL to test the  importance of both the size and charge of the side chain.
  Generally, similar results were found whether measured by  catalytic activity or by antigen inhibition (PCFIA) (Table 1).
  Although the quantitative effects of some replacements differed slightly between the two assays (Table 1), all mutants  with the exception of DlOlGHEL have a Kd significantly  greater than that of the wild-type enzyme as determined by  both methods.
  Role of Arg-21HEL in Determining the AAGdk.
There are  three hydrogen bonds between Arg-21HEL and three antibody  residues, Asn-92vL, Tyr-5OvH, and Tyr-96vL (main-chain N  hydrogen bonds to Asn-92vL 0 and side-chain NH1 hydrogen  bonds to the OH groups of Tyr-96vL and Tyr-50vH; VL and  VH indicate variable regions of the light and heavy chains,  respectively) (3).
The seven mutations at position 21 were  also designed to investigate the importance of side-chain  charge and volume.
Mutations R21QHEL and R21WHEL were  made because two natural variants, JQEL and MQEL, have  glutamine and tryptophan, respectively, at position 21 (Table  2).
These quail homologues each show an affinity approximately 1/30 to 1/45 of that for the antibody compared with  HEL (Table 3).
All mutations of Arg-21HEL to neutral side  chain amino acids result in an increase of -2.2 kcal/mol in  Biochemistry: Kam-Morgan et al.3960 Biochemistry: Kam-Morgan et al.  Table 1.

There may be  a small positive charge effect, since mutant lysozymes containing lysine or histidine replacements bind 0.6 and 0.2  kcal/mol, respectively, more tightly; but a glutamic acid  replacement yields a protein which binds about as well as  lysozymes with neutral side chains at position 21.
Thus, the  R21WHEL replacement alone accounts for the lowered affinity of MQEL for HyHEL-10, since position 21 is the only  difference from HEL in the epitope.
It also appears that the  lower affinity of JQEL to the antibody can be attributed to  position 21, although additional replacements at positions 19  and 102 are present in its epitope (Table 2) (see below).
  Asn-l9HEL and Gly-102HEL.
Table 2 shows the amino acids  within the HyHEL-10 epitope of four natural variant  lysozymes.
Asn-19HEL is of particular interest because the  crystal structure shows that it is a partially buried residue in  the epitope (3), and JQEL has a lysine at this position (28),  which may possibly bury a positive charge.
To test the  importance of Asn-l9HEL in the association reaction, three  single mutations were constructed.
The data show that all  three mutant proteins bind nearly as tightly as wild-type HEL  to HyHEL-10 (Table 3), indicating that the amino acid side  chain at this position is not a significant immunodeterminant.
  Gly-102HEL, which forms a main chain hydrogen bond with  the antibody in the complex, is replaced by valine in JQEL.
  This mutation made directly on HEL has no discernible effect  on AAGdi.c (Table 3), indicating the absence of any positive  or negative contributions from the increased bulk of the  valine side chain.

  The conclusion from these experiments is that the total free  energy differences distinguishing the association of HyHEL-10 with HEL, MQEL, and JQEL are accounted for by  the amino acid at position 21.
  DISCUSSION  ASp-101HEL.
The effect of each replacement on AGdi.jj  was examined by calculating the AAGg11s5o for each mutant  lysozyme in comparison with wild-type HEL (Tables 1 and  3).
An estimate of the specific electrostatic and hydrogen  bond contributions to the AGdj,,c of the ASp-101HEL side  chain might be obtained from a comparison of the near  isosteres aspartic acid and asparagine.
The 9.6-fold increase  in Kd occasioned by the mutation yields a AAGdi5S value of  1.34 kcal/mol (Table 1).
If charge is the dominant contributor  to the stabilization energy effected by AsP-101HEL, which  makes a hydrogen bond to Tyr-53vH, the placement is  Table 3.

  A plot of AAGdi,,.c versus the side-chain volumes of the  amino acids replacing aspartate at position 101 demonstrates  that this latter parameter is the overwhelming determinant of  complex stability (Fig. 1).
An unexpected finding is that  D101GHEL binds the antibody about as well as wild-type HEL  (Table 1).
It appears that the deletion of the aspartic acid side  chain allows for the substitution of compensating favorable  protein-protein contacts.
Novotny (32) has recently calculated the total contribution of Asp-101HEL to the free energy  of formation of the HyHEL-10 HEL complex as -1.8 kcal/  mol.
The figure is the sum of hydrophobic (-2.3 kcal/mol),  entropic (+ 1.3 kcal/mol), and electrostatic and hydrogen  bonding (-0.8 kcal/mol) terms.
The observation that the  D101GHEL mutant binds as tightly to HyHEL-10 as does wild  type might seem to be at variance with the calculations.
  However, most of the free energy contributed by Asp-101HEL  to the HEL HyHEL-10 complex is contributed by the backbone atoms, and the Asp-101HEL side chain actually has a  calculated entropic penalty of 1.3 kcal/mol.
Replacement of  the Asp-101HEL side chain with a glycine would give a  predicted AAGdissoc of significantly less than 1 kcal/mol (J.  Novotny, personal communication).
  TEL, which has a glycine at position 101 and has 1/5 to 1/6  the affinity for chitotriose compared with HEL between pH  4.5 and pH 6.0 (26), exhibits a similarly reduced (1/9.4)  affinity for HyHEL-10 (Table 1).
Of the six additional amino  acid replacements between HEL and TEL, Leu-15TEL and  Lys-73TEL are contact residues in the HyHEL-10 epitope  (Table 2), and they presumably account for the difference in  affinities for the antibody observed between TEL (Gly101TEL) and mutant D101GHEL.
This hypothesis has not yet  been tested experimentally.
  There is a correlation between side-chain volume and  AAGdimsoc of all of the position 101 mutants of lysozyme (Fig.  1).
This correlation could reflect steric interference of bulky  side chains with favorable contacts made by other residues.
  Nearby hydrogen bonds between HyHEL-10 and the backbone of lysozyme residues flanking position 101 include  Ser-100HEL main-chain &.* Tyr-50vH OH, Gly-102HEL mainchain N .
Tyr-58vH OH, and Gly-102HEL main-chain  N- * Tyr-58vH OH (3).
  The observed effects of substitutions at position 101HEL on  binding of lysozyme to HyHEL-10 likely reflect a combination of direct effects related to the contribution of the  4.0 r  Arg{  3.0 V  Lys i  2.0 1  1.0  Asp-101HEL side chain to AGdino5, as well as the indirect ones  of steric interference with backbone contacts at this position  and possible interactions of adjacent residues.
The combination of direct and indirect effects, such as those associated  with Asp-101HEL, can lead to apparent ambiguities in assignment of a given amino acid as a contact residue in epitope  mapping experiments.
For example, in the original characterization of the HyHEL-10 epitope (6), ASp-101HEL was  neither assigned nor excluded as a contact residue.
In binding  experiments, one is limited to investigating the role of sidechain atoms (13), and a combination of effects may produce  seemingly contradictory results even with an x-ray structure  available for interpretation.
Site-directed mutagenesis of  cloned antibody genes has allowed evaluation of the contribution of individual antibody residues to complementarity  (24, 33, 34).
Thus, mutagenesis of complementary contact  residues in HyHEL-10 might clarify the precise contribution  of Asp-101HEL to the complex.
A caveat which must be  appreciated, however, is the fact that the observed AAGdi55oc  is composed of two effects, the decrease in the stability of the  mutant lysozyme'HyHEL-10 complex and any change in free  energy of interaction of the uncomplexed mutant relative to  uncomplexed wild-type enzyme with solvent.
  Arg-21HEL.
Contrasting with the near linear correlation of  AAGdi,,Oc values with side-chain volume observed for position lOlHEL mutations is the nearly uniform increase of -2.2  kcal/mol obtained by mutation of Arg-21HEL to any neutral  amino acid (Fig. 2).
Novotny (32) has calculated that the free  energy contribution of Arg-21HEL to the stability of the  complex is -4.0 kcal/mol, but he does not address the  expected effects of site-directed replacements.
The guanidino moiety of Arg-21HEL makes two hydrogen bonds with  the OH groups of Tyr-96vL and Tyr-50vH (3).
The 2.2  kcal/mol decrease in affinity in this instance can be unambiguously attributed to the hydrogen bonds.
Although the  hydrogen bond acceptor on the antibody is neutral, the  positive charge of Arg-21HEL may have some influence on the  AAGdi5O5, as the R21KHEL mutant is bound only 1.6 kcal/mol  worse than wild-type HEL to HyHEL-10 (Fig. 2).
  Other Variants of the HyHEL-10 Epitope.
The mutations at  residues 19, 21, and 102 were designed to probe the contribution of these residues to the reduced affinity of JQEL and  MQEL to HyHEL-10.
The data suggest that the R21WHEL  replacement can by itself account for the lowered affinity of  MQEL for HyHEL-10, since the AGdi5oc of the R21WHEL  mutant is equivalent to that of the MQEL, which has no other  3.0 r  0  Ha  1-I  Glu{  0.0 V * HEL (Asp)  2.5  2.0  1.5  1.0  0.5  0.0  -0.5  T G1 IGlulfJQEL I  .

Importance of HEL position 21 in determining the free  energies of dissociation of mAb HyHEL-10-lysozyme complexes.
  Wild-type HEL has Arg at position 21.
The single amino acid  replacements were made at this position.
JQEL has Gln in position  21 as well as the other changes in the HyHEL-10 epitope shown in  Table 2.
The HyHEL-10 epitope for MQEL differs from that of the  chicken enzyme in having Trp at position 21.
  Biochemistry: Kam-Morgan et al.3962 Biochemistry: Kam-Morgan et al.  substitutions in the HyHEL-10 epitope other than Trp21MQEL (Table 2).
Similarly, the observed AGdiSsoz of the  R21QHEL mutant is equivalent to that of JQEL, suggesting  that the amino acid change at position 21 is sufficient to  account for the lowered reactivity of JQEL for HyHEL-10.
  Preliminary results with the antigen inhibition assay, however, show that the B50 values of the R21QHEL and R21NHEL  mutants were significantly lower than those of JQEL and the  R21WHEL mutant (data not shown).
The apparent discrepancy between catalytic activity and antigen inhibition results  could be due either to an effect of pH or to the kinetics of the  assays themselves.
As noted above, the affinity measurements in the present experiments were done under conditions  which were optimal for enzymatic activity, at pH 6.24, and in  conditions of constant total antigen with varying concentration of antibody, while the antigen inhibition assays were  done under conditions optimal for antibody binding, at neutral pH, with constant total antibody and varied antigen  concentration.
Under the latter conditions, we have obtained  a slightly higher affinity of HyHEL-10 for HEL, and somewhat lower affinity for JQEL than in the present experiments  (24).
Since Arg-21HEL forms hydrogen bonds with tyrosine  residues from HyHEL-10, and our results clearly indicate a  contribution of charge to the position 21HEL interactions, it is  likely that the apparent discrepancies between the affinity  and antigen inhibition data are at least in part attributable to  pH effects.
  Conclusions.
This report demonstrates that site-directed  mutagenesis can be employed to probe the detailed chemistry  of immunocomplex formation with greater precision than was  afforded by the natural variant epitope mapping method (6).
  The well-characterized HEL has proven ideal for this study.
  The specific amino acid replacements of the present investigation were guided by data obtained from these earlier  studies and by the high-resolution x-ray structures of the  HyHEL-10:HEL complex (3).
We have shown that mutations in two sites provoke qualitatively different responses in  AAGdj,soc.
The size of the introduced side chain at position  101 is directly related to the increase in the difference in free  energy of the interaction, while steric bulk is not a factor in  the position 21 mutants.
Side-chain charge reversal at position 101 (e.g., aspartate to arginine or lysine) does not  contribute additionally, while a slight preference for a positive charge is exhibited at position 21.
The present results  emphasize the importance of introducing a variety of amino  acids at the probed position to resolve the complexities due  to charge, polarity, and size in determining the overall effect  on AAGdjssoc.
  The surviving authors dedicate this work to the memory of our  friend and colleague, Allan C. Wilson.
We thank Dr. Jiri Novotny for  help with interpretation of the energetics calculations.
