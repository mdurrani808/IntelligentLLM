Using site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, and titration calorimetry, we have  examined the structural and thermodynamic consequences of removing specific hydrogen bonds in an  antigen-antibody interface.
Crystal structures of three antibody FvD1.3 mutants, VLTyr50Ser (VLY50S),  VHTyr32Ala (VHY32A), and VHTyr101Phe (VHY101F), bound to hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) have  been determined at resolutions ranging from 1.85 to 2.10 . In the wild-type (WT) FvD1.3-HEL complex,  the hydroxyl groups of VLTyr50, VHTyr32, and VHTyr101 each form at least one hydrogen bond with the  lysozyme antigen.
Thermodynamic parameters for antibody-antigen association have been measured  using isothermal titration calorimetry, giving equilibrium binding constants Kb (M-1) of 2.6  107 (VLY50S),  7.0  107 (VHY32A), and 4.0  106 (VHY101F).
For the WT complex, Kb is 2.7  108 M-1; thus, the  affinities of the mutant Fv fragments for HEL are 10-, 4-, and 70-fold lower than that of the original  antibody, respectively.
In all three cases entropy compensation results in an affinity loss that would  otherwise be larger.
Comparison of the three mutant crystal structures with the WT structure demonstrates  that the removal of direct antigen-antibody hydrogen bonds results in minimal shifts in the positions of  the remaining protein atoms.
These observations show that this complex is considerably tolerant, both  structurally and thermodynamically, to the truncation of antibody side chains that form hydrogen bonds  with the antigen.
Alterations in interface solvent structure for two of the mutant complexes (VLY50S  and VHY32A) appear to compensate for the unfavorable enthalpy changes when protein-protein interactions  are removed.
These changes in solvent structure, along with the increased mobility of side chains near  the mutation site, probably contribute to the observed entropy compensation.
For the VHY101F complex,  the nature of the large entropy compensation is not evident from a structural comparison of the WT and  mutant complexes.
Differences in the local structure and dynamics of the uncomplexed Fv molecules  may account for the entropic discrepancy in this case.
  Protein-protein recognition is essential to many biochemical processes.
Factors that contribute to the structure and  energetics of protein-protein interactions include hydrogen  bonds, salt bridges (Chacko et al., 1995), van der Waals  contacts (Ysern et al., 1994; Clackson & Wells, 1995;  Chilkoti et al., 1995; Schreiber & Fersht, 1995), interface  solvent networks (McPhalen & James, 1988; Bhat et al.,  1994), solvent exclusion (the hydrophobic effect), and  conformational changes associated with the binding reaction  (Colman et al., 1987; Bhat et al., 1990, 1994).
In addition  to their intrinsic interest, antigen-antibody complexes  represent excellent model systems for studying the structure  and thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions in  general.
Crystallographic structures of several complexes  of antibodies, or antibody fragments, bound to protein  antigens are available, and the kinetic and thermodynamic  binding parameters have been determined for some of these  complexes.
The crystal structure of the anti-hen egg white  lysozyme (HEL)1 antibody, FabD1.3, bound to HEL, shows  that 700 2 of surface area is buried on both the antibody  and antigen upon complex formation.
As well as van der  Waals contacts, hydrogen bonds that bridge antibody and  antigen contribute to the binding energy and structural  specificity of the complex (Amit et al., 1986; Fischman et  al., 1991).
Similar observations have been made for other  antibody-antigen complexes including those with the fol-   This work was supported by NIH Grant GM52801 (R.A.M.) and  the Human Frontiers Science Program (R.J.P.).

Since both  the number and the local environment of antigen-antibody  hydrogen bonds vary from complex to complex, the contribution of individual hydrogen bonds to antigen-antibody  complex formation is a matter of great interest.
It is still  not clear how the strength of hydrogen bonds in a proteinprotein interface varies with the relative geometry of the  interacting groups, the local chemical environment, and how  these hydrogen bonds can influence the dynamic behavior  of neighboring groups.
  With the aim of increasing our structural understanding  of antigen-antibody energetics, we have determined the  crystal structures of three mutants of the Fv fragment (a  heterodimer consisting of only the light and heavy chain  variable domains, VL and VH) of D1.3 bound to its protein  antigen HEL.
These mutants were designed to disrupt  hydrogen bonds between the antigen and antibody.
The  structure of the WT FvD1.3-HEL complex is shown in  Figure 1.
In the present study, we have mutated three  FvD1.3 tyrosine residues that form hydrogen bonds with  HEL.
These hydrogen bonds are shown in Figure 2.
The  WT FvD1.3 fragment binds HEL with an affinity (Kb ) 2.7   108 M-1  ) equal to that of the Fab and the intact  immunoglobulin (Bhat et al., 1994).
This reaction has been  shown to be enthalpically driven (H ) -90 kJmol-1  ) with  an opposing entropic term (TS ) -42 kJmol-1  ).
The  crystal structure of FvD1.3 bound to HEL, determined at  1.8  resolution (Bhat et al., 1994), reveals a large number  of water molecules in the Fv-HEL interface that probably  contribute significantly to the enthalpy of complex formation  (Figure 1).
Calorimetric measurements of FvD1.3-HEL  binding at reduced water concentration support this hypothesis (Goldbaum et al., 1996).
These experiments involved  addition of cosolutes such as glycerol, ethanol, dioxane, and  methanol in order to reduce the effective water activity.
In  accord with the concept that the interface water molecules  are important for complex stability, it was found that the  enthalpies of reaction as well as the association constants  decreased with decreasing water activity.
The fact that many  water molecules reside in the protein-protein interface also  aids rationalization of the opposing entropic term.
Interface  water molecules that are not ejected into the bulk solvent  upon binding cannot contribute to the hydrophobic effect.
  Moreover, interface water molecules that are recruited from  the bulk solvent during the binding reaction provide a  negative contribution to the hydrophobic effect.
Thus, in  addition to protein-protein hydrogen bonds, we were also  interested in observing how this network of interface water  molecules responds to the substitution of interface amino  acids.
The thermodynamic consequences of the mutations  were analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry which  enabled determination of Kb, H, and TS. We will  address how alterations in the following factors induced by  site-directed mutagenesis affect the structure and energetics  of protein-protein complex formation in this system: (i)  hydrogen bonding, (ii) van der Waals contacts, (iii) conformation of antigen and antibody, (iv) mobility of antigen and  antibody, and (v) solvent structure.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Reagents.
All chemicals were of analytical grade.
Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA).
  Radiolabeled [35S]dATP was obtained from Amersham Corp.  Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 380B DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
  Site-Directed Mutagenesis.
For mutagenesis of the D1.3  VL region, a 441 bp EcoRI fragment was transferred from  the pUC19-based bacterial expression vector pSW1-VHD1.3-  FIGURE 1: Space-filling model of the FvD1.3-HEL complex.

For  mutagenesis of the VH region, a 477 bp HindIII fragment  from pSW1-VHD1.3-VKD1.3 was subcloned in M13mp19.
  Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was carried out  as described (Kunkel et al., 1987) with a MutaGene M13 in  vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) to introduce  the VLY50S, VHY32A, and VHY101F mutations.
All mutations were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing  method (Sanger et al., 1977) using a Sequenase version 2.0  kit (USB, Cleveland, OH).
For religation into the FvD1.3  expression vector, the mutated VL gene was restricted with  EcoRI and the VH gene with HindIII.
  Expression and Purification of FV fragments.
All three  mutants were prepared from the culture supernatants of  transformed Escherichia coli BMH 71-18 cells as described  (Ward et al., 1989; Ysern et al., 1994).
Briefly, recombinant  clones were resuspended in 10 mL of Terrific broth (Tartof  & Hobbs, 1987) containing 100 gmL-1 ampicillin and 1%  (w/v) glucose to repress FvD1.3 expression.
The cultures  were incubated at 37 C under agitation to an absorbance of  1.0 at 600 nm.
The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with medium, and resuspended in 500  mL of Terrific broth containing 100 gmL-1 ampicillin and  0.1% (w/v) glucose.
This glucose concentration is high  enough for cells to grow normally, yet low enough to permit  efficient induction following its depletion from the medium  as a result of bacterial metabolism.
The cultures were grown  at 37 C to an absorbance of 1.0, and isopropyl -thiogalactoside (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) was added  to a final concentration of 1.0 mM. After further incubation  at 37 C for 4 h, the bacteria were pelleted and the FvD1.3  mutants were affinity purified from the supernatants using  the anti-D1.3 monoclonal antibody E5.2 (Ysern et al., 1994;  Fields et al., 1995) coupled to Sepharose 4B (about 7.5 mL/L  of culture).
Columns were washed with 100 volumes of  phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and eluted with  50 mM diethylamine, pH 12.
Fractions were immediately  neutralized with 1.0 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and concentrated  using Centricon 3000 spin columns (Amicon, Beverly, MA).
  Further purification of FvD1.3 mutants was carried out by  size exclusion chromatography on a ZORBAX GF-250  column (DuPont) in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4  (Boulot et al., 1990).
Final yields were typically 0.5-1.0  mg/L of culture.
  Crystallography.
A small molar excess of HEL (Boehringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) was added to purified  FvD1.3 mutants, and the complexes were crystallized in  hanging drops by vapor diffusion.
Crystallization conditions  were similar to those used for the WT Fv-HEL complex  (Boulot et al., 1990): 15-18% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol)  8000 (Sigma) and 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.0-6.5.  Macroseeding (Thaller et al., 1981) in hanging drops was  used to obtain crystals with dimensions up to 0.4 mm  0.2  mm  0.1 mm.
X-ray diffraction data were recorded on a  Siemens area detector mounted on either a Siemens or a  Rigaku rotating-anode X-ray generator.
Data were indexed,  integrated, and reduced using XENGEN version 2.0 (Howard  et al., 1987).
All complexes crystallized isomorphously with  the WT complex in space group C2.
Unit cell dimensions  are shown in Table 1.
Each structure was refined using  X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) starting from the WT complex  (PDB accession code 1VFB) with all water molecules  deleted.
The first step in each refinement consisted of rigidbody refinement, treating each of the three polypeptide chains  as an independent rigid unit.
Next, an Fo(mutant) - Fc(WT)  difference electron density map was calculated and inspected  in order to confirm the mutation.
Refinement then consisted  of (i) modeling the mutation into the electron density, (ii)  an additional stage of rigid-body refinement, (iii) one stage  of simulated annealing starting at a temperature of 3000 K,  and (iv) iterative cycles of positional refinement, temperature  factor refinement, and inspection of electron density maps  (with coefficients 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc) including location  of ordered solvent molecules.
An electron density difference  peak was modeled as a water molecule if it was higher than  3.5, made contact with at least one potential hydrogen bond  donor or acceptor in the range 2.4-3.4 , and remained in  electron density (1, 2Fo - Fc) after subsequent refinement.
  The solvent structure in the WT FvD1.3-HEL structure was  not used to assist location of water molecules in the mutant  complexes.
  Titration Calorimetry.
Affinity-purified FvD1.3 mutants  were dialyzed against PBS prior to calorimetry.
A phosphate  buffer was used to minimize effects due to any exchange of  protons upon binding to HEL.
In a typical experiment, 5  L aliquots of a 1.00 mM HEL solution were titrated into a  0.05 mM Fv solution at 25 C, and the evolved heats were  measured with a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter as  described (Wiseman et al., 1989; Schwarz et al., 1993, 1995;  Bhat et al., 1994).
The titrations were continued beyond  saturation of the antibody-combining sites to determine any  heat contributions from dilution of the HEL solution upon  its addition to the antibody solution.
The heats below the  saturation point were accordingly corrected for any heat of  dilution of the HEL solution.
Protein concentrations were  calculated using 1% extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 1.50  Table 1: Crystallographic Data Processing and Refinement  Statistics for FvD1.3-HEL Complexes  VLY50S VHY32A VHY101F  data processing  cell parameters  a () 129.2 129.2 129.8  b () 60.5 60.4 60.4  c () 56.8 56.6 56.8   (deg) 119.0 119.1 119.1  observations 47313 49442 84404  unique reflections 21066 20023 33574  redundancy 2.2 2.5 2.5  Rmergea 0.082 0.086 0.083  refinement  data range () 7.0-2.00 7.0-2.10 6.0-1.85  reflections 16783 15354 23568  completeness (%)b 66, 41 70, 30 74, 37  no. of waters 142 116 166  rmsd bond lengths () 0.016 0.015 0.016  rmsd bond angles (deg) 1.91 1.93 1.86  mean B-factorsc (2)  VL 24 19 19  VH 27 23 24  HEL 33 31 30  water 35 33 37  R-factord 0.167 0.162 0.181  a Rmerge ) |I(k) - I|/I(k), where I(k) and I are the kth individual  and mean values of the intensity of a reflection, respectively.

Values for Hb and  Kb were determined from a fit of the heat exchanged per  injection as a function of the amount of injecting titrant  utilizing the software program Origin (Microcal Inc.).

Control titrations performed in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01  M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, gave the same binding enthalpies, within  experimental error, indicating the absence of significant  proton exchange in the Fv-HEL reactions.
  RESULTS  Crystallographic data for the mutant complexes are shown  in Table 1.
The maximum resolution of the X-ray data used  in the refinements ranges from 1.85 to 2.10 , and the  R-factors of the refined structures range from 0.162 to 0.181.
  As shown in Figure 3 and Table 2, the positions of CR atoms  in the mutant structures are very similar to those of the WT  complex, indicating that the substitutions in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) do not significantly affect  the conformations of these loops or the relative orientations  of VL, VH, and HEL in the complex.
This observation is  consistent with previous crystallographic studies of antibodyantigen complexes with interface mutations (Tulip et al.,  1992b; Ysern et al., 1994; Chacko et al., 1995).
Electron  density difference maps calculated at the start of refinement  are consistent with the amino acid substitutions in each  mutant complex (Figure 4).
The calorimetric data for the  mutant complexes are shown in Table 3.
Binding constants  for FvD1.3-HEL association (Kb) range from 4.0  106 to  7.0  107 M-1  .
  Structure and Calorimetry of the VLY50S Complex.
The  binding constant of VLY50S-HEL is 2.6  107 M-1, which  is 10-fold less than that of the WT complex.
This affinity  loss corresponds to a Gb of 6.1 kJmol-1 in which an  unfavorable H of 8.8 kJmol-1 is partially compensated  by a favorable (TS) of 2.7 kJmol-1 (Table 3).
Tyr50 of  the antibody VL domain makes one direct hydrogen bond to  an Asp side chain of the lysozyme antigen (FvD1.3 Tyr50  OO2 Asp18HEL, 2.7 ) and also participates in the  interface water network.
When VLTyr50 is mutated to Ser,  this direct hydrogen bond is replaced by solvent-mediated  interactions to the HEL side chain (VLSer50 OH2O  H2OO1 Asp18HEL).
These two bridging water molecules  occupy some of the volume that was taken up by the  VLTyr50 side chain in the WT structure (Figure 5A).
Several  neighboring water molecules are in positions that correspond  closely to those of the WT structure while others are not  observed in the crystal structure probably because of the  lower resolution of this structure compared to the WT crystal  structure.
Conformational changes in the vicinity of the  mutation are largest at HEL side chains Asp18 and Asn19sthe  residues that are in closest contact to VLTyr50 of FvD1.3 in  the WT structure (Figure 5A).
The largest difference in  atomic positions (1.1 ) occurs at Asp18 O2.
In addition,  the temperature factors of these side chains increase when  VLTyr50 is replaced with Ser (Table 4).
As well as losing  a direct hydrogen bond to the lysozyme antigen, several van  der Waals contacts are also lost, which should contribute to  the observed unfavorable enthalpy change (Table 5).
  Structure and Calorimetry of the VHY32A Complex.
The  side chain of VHTyr32 makes a long potential hydrogen bond  (3.5 ) with the side chain of lysozyme residue Lys116 and,  like VLTyr50, is involved in a solvent network that bridges  antigen and antibody.
Mutation to Ala disrupts the solvent  network but does not affect the conformation or temperature  factors of Lys116HEL (Figure 5B, Table 4).
The VHY32A  mutant binds lysozyme with only about 4-fold lower affinity  than that of the WT Fv.
In this case the large H (17.9  kJmol-1) is almost fully compensated by the entropic term  resulting in the small decrease in affinity (Table 3).
As for  FIGURE 3: Superposition of four FvD1.3-HEL structures: WT, VLTyr50Ser, VHTyr32Ala, and VHTyr101Phe.
CR atoms plus the side  chains of the relevant interacting residues are shown in stereo.
Note the large variation in the position of the HEL C-terminus which has  high temperature factors and weak electron density.

However, in contrast with VLY50S, only  one van der Waals contact is lost along with the long  hydrogen bond (Table 5).
There are two side chains in the  vicinity of the mutation whose mobilities are affected by the  VHY32A mutation.
When VHTyr32 is truncated to Ala,  VHArg99 loses stabilizing contacts with VHTyr32 and  becomes more mobile, as indicated by an increase in the  mean temperature factor of side chain atoms from 28 to 40  2 (Table 4).
A conformational change in VHArg99,  resulting in a maximum atomic displacement of 1.1  from  the WT structure, accompanies the temperature factor  increase.
In contrast, the mean temperature factor of a  neighboring side chain, VHPhe27, decreases (from 16 to 9  2) while the shifts in atomic positions for this side chain  are smaller (<0.5 ).
  Structure and Calorimetry of the VHY101F Complex.
  Tyr101 of D1.3 VH is situated near the center of the FvHEL interface and makes two hydrogen bonds with HEL:  VHTyr101 OO1 Asp119HEL (2.7 ) and VHTyr101 ON  Gln121HEL (3.0 ).
The effective substitution of the Tyr  hydroxyl group by a hydrogen atom to give the Phe mutant  results in small local atomic shifts.
The largest atomic  displacement (0.5 ) in the interface compared to WT occurs  at Asp119HEL O1  san atom involved in one of the aboveFIGURE 4: Stereo electron density difference maps calculated at the start of refinement superposed on the final refined structures: (A)  VLTyr50Ser, (B) VHTyr32Ala, and (C) VHTyr101Phe.

In contrast to the other mutants,  there are no increases in temperature factors for atoms in  the vicinity of the mutation (Table 4).
The calorimetric data  indicate that the unfavorable enthalpy change resulting from  the loss of two interface hydrogen bonds is strongly  compensated by a favorable entropy change (Table 3).
This  complex exhibits the largest H, 31 kJmol-1  , and the  largest (TS), 20 kJmol-1  , of the three mutant complexes.
  It is important to note that there is no space for a water  molecule to insert into the interface when the OH group of  Tyr101 is replaced by H. Significantly, the structure shows  that the side chain of Asp119HEL is not left with its hydrogenbonding potential unsatisfied in the mutant.
Instead,  Asp119HEL forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with  Gln121HEL N (3.2 ).
In the WT structure, the corresponding  distance is 3.8 , which is too long to be a hydrogen bond.
  DISCUSSION  The FvD1.3 system is particularly suitable for the study  of protein-protein complex energetics and structure.
Highresolution (1.8 ) crystal structures are known for FvD1.3  both in the free state and bound to its specific antigen HEL  (Bhat et al., 1994).
Also, the thermodynamics of the FvHEL association reaction have been analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry (Bhat et al., 1994).
The availability  of high-resolution crystal structures of mutant Fv-HEL  complexes enables the quantitation of small, as well as large,  structural changes induced by the mutation.
An analysis of  the precision of the crystal structures, as presented below,  sets limits for significance levels pertaining to changes in  atomic positions.
  Precision of Crystal Structures.
Luzzati plots (Luzzati,  1952) for each of the refinements (data not shown) give mean  FIGURE 5: Stereo diagrams of the mutant structures (thick bonds, large atoms, continuous hydrogen bonds) superposed on the WT structure  (thin bonds, small atoms, dashed hydrogen bonds): (A) VLTyr50Ser, (B) VHTyr32Ala, and (C) VHTyr101Phe.
  Hydrogen Bonds in an Antigen-Antibody Interface Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 48, 1996 15499  + +  + +errors in atomic positions of 0.25  (VLY50S and VHY32A)  and 0.22  (VHY101F).
These values agree closely with  the rms deviations in CR positions after superposition of the  mutant and WT complexes (Table 2).
Global estimates of  precision, such as the Luzzati analysis, do not provide  information about the precision of specific interactions.
  Individual errors may differ greatly from the overall estimate  depending on, for example, the local order and dynamics,  as indicated by temperature factors.
In this study, the  availability of refined crystal structures of several singlesite mutants permits an analysis of the precision of specific  interactions.
Ignoring localized structural differences due  to the effects of the mutations, we will assume, for statistical  purposes, that each mutant structure represents an independent determination of the WT structure.
It is then possible,  for example, to calculate standard deviations of individual  hydrogen bond lengths and van der Waals contact distances  in the antibody-antigen interface and thus evaluate whether  a particular structural change is significant.
The seven  structures used to obtain the values for the 14 interface  hydrogen bonds shown in Table 6 are the WT complex (Bhat  et al., 1994), the VLTrp92Asp complex (Ysern et al., 1994),  the three complexes presented here, and two unpublished  mutant complexes (VLPhe91Leu, 1.85  resolution, R )  0.17, and VHAsn56Ala, 1.83  resolution, R ) 0.16).
Nine  of these hydrogen bonds have standard deviations e0.10   (Table 6).
The smallest standard deviation for an interface  hydrogen bond length, 0.05 , occurs at residues with belowaverage temperature factors, namely, VHAsp100 (Bmean ) 12  2) and Ser24HEL (Bmean ) 14 2).
In striking contrast, an  interaction with the C-terminus of HEL that was defined as  a hydrogen bond in the WT structure, VLHis30 N1OT  Leu129HEL, varies dramatically in the refined mutant structures.
It is evident from the high temperature factors of  Leu129HEL (Bmean ) 55 2  ), its poor electron density in all  structures, and its variability in conformation (see Figure 3)  that any stabilizing interaction with D1.3 is transient at best.
  With regard to the variation of hydrogen bond lengths in  the interface, this analysis indicates that the VHTyr32 ON  Lys116HEL interaction is relatively long while the VHTyr101  OO1 Asp119HEL interaction is relatively short (Table 6).
  In view of the standard deviations and ranges shown in Table  6, analogous statements for the remaining intermediate  hydrogen bonds cannot be made with confidence.

  15500 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 48, 1996 Fields et al.  + +  + +that solvent associated with the protein-protein interface  contributes to the stability of the complex (Bhat et al., 1994;  Goldbaum et al., 1996).
The high-resolution crystal structure  of FvD1.3-HEL shows a large number of water molecules  in the interface that provide bridging hydrogen bonds and  occupy what could otherwise be destabilizing voids in the  interface (Figure 1).
The plasticity of part of this network  was illustrated in the crystal structure of an FvD1.3-HEL  complex with VLTrp92 substituted for Asp (Ysern et al.,  1994).
In that study, truncation of the VLTrp92 side chain  left space which was filled by two water molecules.
Other  water molecules in the vicinity of the mutation adjusted  positions slightly, presumably to optimize hydrogen bonds  and van der Waals contacts with the void-filling water  molecules.
  Two of the structures presented here, VLY50S and  VHY32A, bound to HEL, also exhibit alterations in local  solvent structure compared to WT.
In both cases the solvent  rearrangements are localized, and their effects do not extend  far beyond the vicinity of the mutation.
In VLY50S, the  direct hydrogen bond to HEL in the WT structure is lost  and replaced by solvent-mediated interactions (Figure 5A).
  A bridging water molecule substituting for a direct hydrogen  bond was observed in an antibody-trisaccharide system  (Bundle et al., 1994; Zdanov et al., 1994).
Based on  geometry criteria, namely, the hydrogen bond donoracceptor distance and the relative orientation of the interacting groups, the VLY50S hydrogen bond with HEL would  be classified as strong.
However, H for VLY50S  compared to WT is only 9 kJmol-1  .
Furthermore, as shown  in Table 5, several van der Waals contacts are lost along  with the hydrogen bond when VLTyr50 is substituted for  Ser.
Based on our analysis of the contribution of van der  Waals contacts by VLTrp92 (Ysern et al., 1994), the lost  contacts of Tyr50 could provide an additional 8 kJmol-1.
  As noted previously, Tyr50 is also involved in hydrogenbonding interactions with the interface water network.
Thus,  Tyr50 interacts with HEL through a direct hydrogen bond,  several van der Waals contacts, and a solvent network and  would therefore appear to be energetically important.
There  are several ways to explain the apparently small difference  in enthalpy between WT and VLY50S: (i) the new bridging  solvent in the Y50S complex provides most of the stabilizing  enthalpy, (ii) the Tyr50 hydrogen bond and/or van der Waals  contacts contribute much less to the enthalpy of the WT  complex than estimated, (iii) the energetics of the unbound  Fv molecules differ substantially, or (iv) a combination of  these.
The following discussion of the VHY32A and  VHY101F complexes supports the view that localized bridging solvent can make a significant enthalpic contribution.
  The VHTyr32 ON Lys116HEL separation of 3.5   would classify this interaction as a relatively weaker  hydrogen bond compared to the above-mentioned VLTyr50  interaction (Table 6).
In contrast to the situation for VLY50S,  the H for VHY32A compared to WT is large (18  kJmol-1  )sa value which may be expected to correspond  to a strong hydrogen bond.
In this case, however, Tyr32 is  also involved in a bridging solvent network which is  completely lost when Tyr is replaced by Ala and is not  compensated by new bridging water interactions.
A new  water molecule that occupies some of the space taken up by  the Tyr ring in the WT structure is too distant from HEL to  act as a bridge.
Thus, a possible explanation for the large  H despite the apparently weak hydrogen bond is that the  existing solvent network in the WT complex makes a sizable  contribution to H. This hypothesis could be tested by  substitution of a residue other than Ala in place of Tyr which  might preserve certain elements of the WT solvent network.
  Compared to the previous two mutants, an analysis of  VHY101F appears straightforward since there is no solvent  network directly associated with the hydroxyl group of  VHTyr101 in the complex interface.
Truncation to Phe  results in an unfavorable H of 31 kJmol-1  .
In this case  it is clear that two hydrogen bonds are lost, other structural  differences compared to WT are small, and Asp119HEL is  not left with its hydrogen-bonding potential unsatisfied (see  below and Figure 5C).
Thus, it is probably valid to assume  that most of the H component arises from the loss of the  two hydrogen bonds.
The resulting estimate of the contribution of each hydrogen bond is therefore 16 kJmol-1  .
Since  hydrogen bonds are essentially electrostatic interactions  between atoms of opposite partial charge, the strength of a  hydrogen bond depends most critically on the hydrogen bond  donor-acceptor distance, the magnitudes of the partial  charges on the donor and acceptor atoms, and the local  dielectric constant.
With regard to the dielectric constant,  it is pertinent that the hydrogen bonds between VHTyr101  and HEL are buried in the interface of the complex while  those from VLTyr50 and VHTyr32 are on the periphery  (Figure 1).
Thus, it is possible that the hydrogen bonds from  VHTyr101 are elevated in strength compared to those from  VLTyr50 and VHTyr32 due to a lower dielectric constant in  the protein-protein interface compared to the periphery.
  However, such an effect is likely to be small since the  FvD1.3-HEL interface is predominantly made up of polar  residues, is highly solvated, and, therefore, should have a  dielectric constant much closer to that of the solvent-exposed  surface.
It is unlikely that this protein-protein interface has  electrostatic properties similar to that of a hydrophobic  interior of a folded globular protein where the low dielectric  constant would magnify the strength of hydrogen bonds.
  It has been noted that the discrepancy between the apparent  contribution to G of an interaction (Gapp) and the intrinsic  Gsthe actual energetic contribution of a particular interaction (Gint)smay be large when a mutation leaves a charged  hydrogen bond donor or acceptor with its hydrogen-bonding  potential unsatisfied (Fersht, 1988).
This point may be  relevant here since three of the hydrogen bonds analyzed in  this study involve one charged residue from HEL.
As such,  it is possible that mutation of the corresponding D1.3 partner  in the hydrogen-bonding interaction could have an anomalously large destabilizing effect.
Examining each mutant  structure with this possibility in mind, it is apparent that in  no case is the hydrogen-bonding potential of the charged  HEL side chains left unsatisfied.
For the VLY50S-HEL  complex, both carboxylate O atoms of Asp18HEL are  hydrogen bonded to interface solvent molecules (Figure 5A).
  Likewise, Lys116HEL in the VHY32A complex is within  hydrogen-bonding distance of two water molecules (Figure  5B).
Finally, as stated before, Asp119HEL in the VHY101F  complex is involved in an intramolecular hydrogen bond with  the backbone nitrogen of Gln121HEL (Figure 5C).
Therefore,  in all three cases Gapp and Gint should be similar in  magnitude.
The validity of this reasoning could be tested  by double mutant cycles (Serrano et al., 1990, 1991;  Schreiber & Fersht, 1995).
  Hydrogen Bonds in an Antigen-Antibody Interface Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 48, 1996 15501  + +  + +The importance of hydrogen bonds in contributing to the  affinity and specificity of protein-ligand complex formation  has been investigated in several systems.
For example,  truncation of a side chain in a tRNA synthetase-substrate  complex to leave an uncharged, unpaired hydrogen bond  donor or acceptor weakened binding by 2-6 kJmol-1  (Fersht et al., 1985).
Truncation of a side chain to leave an  unpaired and charged donor or acceptor weakened binding  by an additional 12 kJmol-1 (Fersht et al., 1985).
In  another study, comparison of two thermolysin-inhibitor  complexes that were essentially identical except for the  presence or absence of a specific hydrogen bond differed in  binding energy by 17 kJmol-1 (Tronrud et al., 1987).
  Entropy compensation effects cannot be addressed in these  studies since only changes in G were measured.
However,  the decrease in binding affinity (17 kJmol-1  ) observed in  the thermolysin-inhibitor system is in close agreement with  the estimate of the contribution of a hydrogen bond (31.3/2   16 kJmol-1  ) obtained from the analysis of the VHY101FHEL complex.
  A recent study, comparing the crystal structure of an  antibody-HEL mutant complex with the WT structure,  concluded that the HEL mutation Arg68Lys results in the  net loss of about one interface hydrogen bond (Chacko et  al., 1995).
The hydrogen-bonding analysis was complicated  by the fact that Lys68 in the mutant complex appears to exist  in two conformations.
This antibody, HyHEL-5, forms a  complex with HEL with a Kb of 1011 M-1 (Padlan et al.,  1989).
The Arg68Lys lysozyme mutant binds with an  1000-fold lower affinity, which corresponds to a G of  17 kJmol-1 (Lavoie et al., 1990).
Once again, only values  for G were obtained in these experiments; however, if the  entropy compensation is small, then the resulting enthalpic  contribution of a hydrogen bond is similar to the value we  obtained in the VHY101F system.
  The crystal structure of FvD1.3 complexed with turkey  egg white lysozyme (TEL) has also been elucidated and  shows the same mode of binding as HEL (Braden et al.,  1996).
However, HEL and TEL differ by one amino acid  in the interface (Gln121HEL f His121TEL), and Kb for the  FvD1.3-TEL reaction is 7.0  105 M-1  , that is, about 400-  fold lower than the FvD1.3-HEL reaction.
Differences in  G, H, and TS, compared to FvD1.3-HEL are 16  kJmol-1  , 36 kJmol-1  , and 22 kJmol-1, respectively.
The  large H is not surprising since, in the FvD1.3-HEL  complex, the side chain of Gln121HEL forms two hydrogen  bonds to the backbone of FvD1.3 plus one hydrogen bond  to the aromatic ring of VLTyr32.
Moreover, Gln121 shows  good shape complementarity to a pocket formed by the  aromatic side chains of VLTyr32, VLTrp92, and VHTyr101  and makes van der Waals contacts with these residues.
  When Gln121 is effectively substituted by His in the  FvD1.3-TEL complex, a conformational change in D1.3  takes place in order to accommodate the His side chain.
This  conformational changesa peptide flip at VL residues 92 and  93senables His121 to form one hydrogen bond with D1.3.
  Thus, a total of two interface hydrogen bonds are lost.
  However, the contribution of the hydrogen bond from Gln121  to the aromatic ring of VLTyr32 in the WT complex is  difficult to estimate (Levitt & Perutz, 1988; Jamison et al.,  1995).
  Entropy Compensation.
The previous section was limited  to a discussion of interactions that may affect the enthalpy  of the system, namely, electrostatic (hydrogen bonds in this  case) and van der Waals interactions.
As noted before, the  loss in affinity for all three mutant Fv molecules is smaller  than would be expected on the basis of enthalpy considerations alone; that is, entropy compensation is in effect.
  Entropy compensation is a phenomenon that has been  observed in many systems including the D1.3-HEL (Ito et  al., 1993) and HyHEL10-HEL binding reactions (Tsumoto  et al., 1994).
Since all of the crystal structures presented  here are isomorphous to the wild-type crystal structure, local  B-factor differences are attributed to the effects of the  interface mutations and not to any differences in crystal  packing.
Of the mutants investigated in this study, entropy  compensation is greatest for VHY101F.
Increases in solvent  and protein motion, as indicated by the crystallographic  B-factors (Table 4), must contribute to the entropy compensation observed for the other two mutants.
However, for  the VHY101F complex there are no changes in solvent  structure or B-factors.
Here, the most plausible explanation  lies in the differing entropy of the unbound WT and  VHY101F Fv molecules.
Of relevance to this point is the  observation that the mean B-factor of VHTyr101 in the  unbound WT Fv is 80% larger than in the complex.
As  argued by Bhat et al. (1994), this quenching of side chain  mobility upon complex formation is entropically unfavorable  for binding.
Using similar reasoning, an explanation for the  observed entropy compensation for the VHY101F-HEL  reaction is that the mobility of VHPhe101 in the unbound  Fv is much closer to its mobility in the complex.
This  hypothesis may be tested by determining the crystal structure  of the unbound mutant Fv.
An alternative explanation is  that the solvent structure around VHTyr101 in the unbound  state differs substantially from that in the Phe mutant, giving  rise to a perturbed hydrophobic effect.
This is a reasonable  possibility considering the contrasting hydrophobicity and  hydrogen-bonding potential of tyrosine and phenylalanine.
  In the unbound WT Fv structure, the VHTyr101 side chain  is hydrogen bonded to one water molecule with a high  temperature factor (B ) 45 2  ).
However, VHTyr101 also  makes contacts with a neighboring FvD1.3 molecule in the  crystal, thus complicating any analysis of its structure and  energetics in the unbound state.
  The above arguments emphasize the potential importance  of the unbound structures when attempting to understand the  thermodynamic consequences of interface mutations.
Although B-factor increases and small conformational changes  may contribute to entropy compensation in the VLY50S and  VHY32A systems, exactly the same arguments regarding the  structure and energetics of the unbound state also apply in  those cases.
  Conclusions.
Several conclusions may be drawn from this  study.
The calorimetric and structural data provide strong  support for the concept that solvent interactions can make  large contributions to the enthalpy of binding and, therefore,  to the affinity of protein-protein complexes.
Although  solvent rearrangements are localized and their effects do not  extend beyond the vicinity of the mutation, they are important  in two ways.
First, water molecules may act as adaptors  to correct imperfections introduced into the interface by the  mutation.
Indeed, losses of complementarity in solventaccessible regions of the interface tend to be compensated  by the stable inclusion of additional water molecules rather  than by adjustments in protein structure although we do  15502 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 48, 1996 Fields et al.  + +  + +observe small but significant adjustments in all three  structures analyzed here.
In another antigen-antibody  system, crystallographically defined structural adjustments  were suggested as a means of compensating for the effects  of mutations (Tulip et al., 1992b).
Small structural adjustments predominantly result when mutations are introduced  into protein cores (Buckle et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1993;  Matthews, 1995), although incorporation of solvent has also  been observed (Buckle et al., 1996).
Second, the disruption  of ordered solvent networks bridging antigen and antibody  may contribute significantly to entropy compensation.
Increases in the mobility of side chains of residues in proximity  to the mutation provide a supplementary mechanism for  entropy compensation.
Finally, the potential importance of  knowing the high-resolution crystal structures of unbound  mutants, in addition to crystal structures of the mutants in  complexed form, should not be overlooked when attempting  to understand the thermodynamic consequences of interface  mutations in structural terms.
