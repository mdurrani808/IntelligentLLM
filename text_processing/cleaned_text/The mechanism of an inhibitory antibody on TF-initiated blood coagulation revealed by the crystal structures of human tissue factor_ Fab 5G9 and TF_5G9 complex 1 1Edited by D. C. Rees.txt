Torrey Pines Road  La Jolla, CA 92027, USA  The tissue factor (TF)-initiated blood coagulation protease cascade can be  greatly inhibited in vivo by a potent anti-human-TF monoclonal antibody,  5G9.
This antibody binds the carboxyl module of the extracellular  domain of TF with a nanomolar binding constant and inhibits the formation of the TFVIIaX ternary initiation complex.
We have determined  the crystal structures of the extra-cellular modules of human TF, Fab  5G9, and their complex (TF5G9) to 2.4 A , 2.5 A , and 3.0 A , respectively,  and measured the apparent inhibition constants of 5G9 on a panel of TF  mutants.
In our unliganded TF structure, a 7 change in the relative  orientation between the D1 and D2 modules was observed when compared with other published TF structures.
Comparison of the free and  bound Fab 5G9 indicates that small segmental and side-chain variation of  the antibody complementarity determining regions occurred on complexation with TF.
The antibody-antigen recognition involves 18 TF antigen residues and 19 Fab residues from six CDRs with one of the largest  buried surface areas seen to date.
A combination of structural and mutagenesis data indicate that Tyr156, Lys169, Arg200, and Lys201 play the  major role in the antibody recognition.
The TF5G9 structure provides  insights into the mechanism by which the antibody 5G9 inhibits formation of the TFVIIaX ternary complex.

The  coagulation cascade is initiated by the cell surface  transmembrane receptor tissue factor (TF) which  binds serine protease factor VIIa and activates the  VIIa protease domain for full catalytic function.
  The complex then proteolytically activates the  macromolecular zymogen substrates, factors IX  and X, and generates the two key intermediate  enzymes for thrombin generation and cell signalling.
Because of its central role in initiating the  thrombogenic responses, an understanding of the  molecular mechanisms by which coagulation function can be attenuated is of wide interest and of  potential therapeutic benet (Levi et al., 1994) in  several life-threatening diseases, including thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation  (DIC; Edgington et al., 1992).

  J. Mol. Biol. (1998) 275, 873894  00222836/98/05087322 $25.00/0/mb971512 # 1998 Academic Press LimitedThe structure-function relationships of TF have  been advanced through systematic mutagenesis of  TF (Ruf et al., 1994; Kelley et al., 1995) and of VIIa  (Dickinson et al., 1996).
These data can now be  interpreted within the context of the three-dimensional structures of TF (Harlos et al., 1994; Muller  et al., 1994, 1996; also reviewed by Martin et al.,  1995) and the TFVIIa binary complex (Banner  et al., 1996).
The TF extracellular domain folds into  two bronectin-type III modules, D1 and D2, that  are also presented in members of the cytokine  receptor family (Bazan, 1990).
An extended hydrophobic intermodule interface results in a relatively  rigid orientation of the two modules (Harlos et al.,  1994; Muller et al., 1994, 1996).
The mutagenesis  experiments demonstrated that both modules contribute to an extended binding site for the protease  VIIa.
The functionally derived ligand interface is in  excellent agreement with the interface determined  from the three-dimensional structure of the  TFVIIa complex (Banner et al., 1996).
TF binds the  protease through contacts that involve each of the  various structural components of VIIa: (1) the gcarboxy glutamic acid-rich (Gla) module interacts  with a hydrophobic patch containing the solventexposed disulde bridge of the D2 module of TF;  (2) the rst epidermal growth factor-like module  (EGF-1) packs into a groove formed by the interface between the D1 and D2 modules of TF; and  (3) EGF-2 and the protease module have a continuous interface with the D1 module of TF.
The interfaces of VII/VIIa EGF-1 and Gla modules with TF  are formed predominantly by hydrophobic interactions, suggesting that these two light chain modules provide a tether for the protease.
The protease  module interacts with a cluster of residues of TF  (Banner et al., 1996) that have functional implications (Dickinson et al., 1996) on the ability of TF  to confer allosteric changes to the VIIa protease  module in order to enable its full catalytic activity.
  The interactions which support the assembly of  the macromolecular substrates, factors X and IX,  with TFVIIa are still not well understood.
Factor  X is preferentially hydrolyzed when bound to a  phospholipid membrane, probably through its  amino-terminal Gla-module (Krishnaswamy et al.,  1992; Ruf et al., 1991c).
Macromolecular substrate  activation also involves the Gla-module of VIIa  (Ruf et al., 1991a), which is oriented toward the  membrane, as deduced from the TFVIIa complex  (Banner et al., 1996).
It is, therefore, reasonable to  assume that interaction of the Gla-modules of both  enzyme and substrate may play a signicant role  in the association of TFVIIa with macromolecular  substrate to form the transient ternary complex.
  Furthermore, residues Lys165 and Lys166 in the  D2 domain of TF are localized adjacent to the Gladomain in the TF-VIIa interface, and these two  basic residues are important for activation of  macromolecular substrate (Ruf et al., 1992a).
  Epitope mapping of inhibitory antibodies of TF  has also provided evidence consistent with this  model.
Whereas most inhibitory antibodies are  found to compete with VIIa binding to TF, monoclonal antibody 5G9 rapidly binds the preformed  TFVIIa and inhibits association of macromolecular  substrate (Ruf & Edgington, 1991).
Antibody 5G9  displays these potent anti-thrombotic effects in vivo  and is currently being tested as a therapeutic to  interrupt TF-initiated coagulation (Edgington et al.,  1992).
Antibody 5G9 is directed against the D2  module of TF (Ruf et al., 1991b) and is a competitive inhibitor for macromolecular substrate factor X  activation, as dened by kinetic analysis (Ruf &  Edgington, 1991).
The crystallization of TF in complex with a Fab fragment of this antibody (Ruf  et al., 1992b) now provides an opportunity to  investigate the structural basis of this inhibition  and of macromolecular substrate recognition by  the TFVIIa complex.
  Antibody-protein complex structures have  become a paradigm for understanding protein-protein interactions (Jones & Thornton, 1996).
The  interactions in the antibody-antigen interface are  often weaker than the corresponding subunit interfaces of multimeric proteins or of small molecule  inhibitor-protease complexes (Sheriff, 1993; Jones &  Thornton, 1996).
Of the 59 antibody-antigen structures that have had their coordinates deposited in  the PDB database (Bernstein et al., 1978) up to February 1997, 20 complexes have proteins as their  antigens (for reviews, see Davies et al., 1990;  Sheriff, 1993; Wilson & Staneld, 1993, 1994;  Padlan, 1994; Webster et al., 1994; Braden & Poljak,  1995; Sheriff, 1997; Cohen et al., 1996).
The antibody-protein structures are restricted mainly to  lysozyme (Amit et al., 1986; Sheriff et al., 1987;  Padlan et al., 1989; Fischmann et al., 1991; Chitarra  et al., 1993; Bhat et al., 1994; Lescar et al., 1994;  Braden et al., 1994; Chacko et al., 1995; Cohen et al.,  1996), neuraminidase (Tulip et al., 1992a,b; Malby  et al., 1994), and anti-idiotope antibodies (Ban et al.,  1994; Fields et al., 1995; Braden et al., 1996).
Other  protein antigens include histidine-containing protein (HPr; Prasad et al., 1993), inuenza virus  hemagglutinin HA1 monomer (Bizebard et al.,  1995), and N10-staphylococcal nuclease (BossartWhitaker et al., 1995).
  Extensive conformational changes in an antibody  upon binding small molecular mass antigens have  been illustrated, for example, in anti-peptide Fab  17/9 (Rini et al., 1992), anti-DNA Fab BV04  (Herron et al., 1991) and anti-HIV-1 Fab 50.1  (Staneld et al., 1993).
These structures provided  clear evidence for induced t as a mechanism for  antibody-antigen recognition (Rini et al., 1992;  Staneld et al., 1993).
It now appears that there is a  wide range of variation in the extent of conformational changes induced by a ligand in different  antibody systems.
For protein antigens, the antigen-induced antibody conformational changes  have so far been of lesser magnitude than those  seen with some hapten or peptide ligands.
In this  study, the crystal structures of TF and Fab 5G9  have been determined in both free and liganded  forms.
Evaluation of any antibody conformational  874 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complexchanges following antigen binding can then be  made, as well as assessment of the relative contributions of polar and hydrophobic interactions to  the stability of the antibody-antigen complex.
  Results and Discussion  Crystal structure of Fab 5G9  The current Fab 5G9 (isotype IgG1, k) model  consists of residues 1 to 214 from both the light  chain and the heavy chain.
The Fab 5G9 structure  was rened to an R-value of 21.1% and an Rfree  value (Bru nger, 1992a) of 30.4% for data between  8 A and 2.5 A (Table 1).
The 5G9 model has an  excellent overall t to 2Fo  Fc maps with an average real space correlation coefcient (Jones et al.,  1991) of 0.87 for main-chain atoms.
Residues that  have relatively low real space correlation coef
-  cients are all in solvent-exposed regions with higher-than-average thermal parameters.
Most of the  residues are clustered in energetically favorable  (89.3%) or allowed (98.1%) regions of the Ramachandran plot.
AlaL51 of the light chain is located  as usual in a less favorable region that corresponds  to position (i  1) of a classic g turn (Milner-White  et al., 1988), as found in other Fab structures  (Staneld et al., 1990; Rini et al., 1992;
Tulip et al.,  1992a; Arevalo et al., 1993; Braden et al., 1994;  Malby et al., 1994).
  Fab 5G9 is like a typical anti-protein antibody  with a concave and undulating surface (Wilson &  Staneld, 1994).
The elbow angle in Fab 5G9 is  133.0. The conformations of CDR loops L1, L2, L3,  H1, and H2 are consistent with their sequence-predicted canonical structure types (Chothia et al.,  1989), which are type 2, 1, 1, 1, and 2, respectively.  Crystal structure of tissue factor  The TF crystal has two molecules (I and II) in  the crystal asymmetric unit.
The current TF model  contains residues 5 to 83, and 89 to 211 for molecule I, and residues 5 to 83, 89 to 115, 121 to 134,  138 to 157, 164 to 182 and 186 to 210 for molecule  II.
The missing TF residues include the N-terminal  residues (1 to 4) for molecule I, a loop in the D1  module of TFs that connects strands F and G (residues 84 to 88), which is also poorly dened in  other TF structures (Harlos et al., 1994; Muller et al.,  1994, 1996), and some shorter loops (116 to 120,  135 to 136, 158 to 163, 183 to 185) in the membrane  proximal D2 module of molecule II.
The two TF  molecules have been rened to an R-value of  21.7% and an Rfree value of 29.7% between 8 and  2.4 A .
Most of the residues (86.1%) have energetically favorable conformations and no residues  have disallowed conformations.
  The two TF molecules in the asymmetric unit are  related by a 90.5 rotation about the crystallographic axes [0.0, 0.95, 0.30] and a translation of  101.9 A , 0.7 A , 12.5 A , which corresponds to a  very small peak (1s) in the self-rotation function.
  The r.m.s.d.
between the two TF molecules for 177  Ca atoms is 0.38 A . Ramachandran plots of the two  TF molecules are similar with r.m.s.
differences on  phi and psi of 9.7 and 10.7, respectively (as calculated by LSQMAN; Kleywegt & Jones, 1994a).

  Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex 875pattern of B-values of the two TF molecules is similar with a correlation coefcient of 0.71.
However,  molecule I has a lower overall B-value (40 A 2  ) than  molecule II (62 A 2  ) due to more contacts with symmetry-related molecules (>140 for distances less  than 5.0 A ) than for molecule II (ten contacts).
Molecule I is thus used in the subsequent analyses.
  Crystal structure of TF5G9 complex  The TF5G9 molecule is ``L'' shaped with  molecular dimensions of 77 A  78 A  101 A  (Figure 1).
The TF5G9 complex crystals contain  two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal.
Each of the two TF5G9 models consists of residues 1 to 214 for both Fab light and heavy chains  and residues 4 to 82, and 91 to 211 for TF.
As in  the unliganded TF structure, some residues (83 to  90) in TF D1 module could not be located in the  electron density maps and were omitted from the  nal model.
The current model has an R-value of  20.6% and an Rfree value of 27.6% for reections  between 7.0 A and 3.0 A (Table 1).
  The two molecules in the crystal are related by a  75 rotation around the crystallographic b-axis  with a translation component of 71.4 A , 59.6 A ,  57.2 A , which corresponds to the strongest noncrystallographic peak (9s) in the self-rotation funcFigure 1.

The r.m.s. deviations between the two  complexes are 0.24 A for all Ca atoms and the  r.m.s.
differences of main-chain torsional angles  phi and psi are 9.1 and 8.9, respectively, which  illustrates that the two complexes are highly similar.
However, the average B-value of the second  complex B (42 A 2  ) is slightly higher than that of  the rst complex A (33 A 2  ) and corresponds to a  lower real space correlation coefcient (0.77 versus  0.81).
Hence, molecule A is used in the following  analyses unless otherwise stated.
  Fewer residues (74%) are clustered in the most  favorable region of the Ramachandran plot compared to the unliganded TF and 5G9 as expected  from the lower resolution (3 A versus 2.4 to 2.5 A ).
  All residues are within allowed regions except for  AlaL51 and SerH97 in both molecules.
As in the  uncomplexed 5G9 antibody, AlaL51 is in a classic  g turn (Milner-White et al., 1988).
In the unliganded  5G9 antibody, SerH97 of CDR H3 is in the (i  1)  position of a type IV loop, as identied by program NAOMI (Brocklehurst & Perham, 1993), in  which it has an allowed left-handed helix conformation with phi, psi values of 92.0 and 27.1,  respectively.
In the TF5G9 complex, the mainchain carbonyl oxygen of SerH97 binds to TF  Lys169 Nz through a hydrogen bond, which results  in a less favorable conformation for SerH97 (phi,  psi angles of 96.3 and 50.0, respectively).
  TF5G9 is the second reported protein structure  that crystallizes in space group P2 as found from a  survey of the February 1997 release of the PDB  database (Bernstein et al., 1978).
The only other  macromolecule entry in a P2 space group is for  pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PDB code 1dik,  Herzberg et al., 1996).
As pointed out by Wukovitz  & Yeates (1995) in their discussion of the crystal  packing of monomeric proteins, P2 is an unfavored  space group for protein crystals.
The TF5G9  crystal has some very large solvent channels with  cross sections of 22 A  56 A , 22 A  22 A , and  26 A  31 A along the crystallographic a, b and  c-axes, respectively (Figure 2).
The intermolecular  packing interactions are dominated by b-strand bstrand interactions between two neighboring molecules.
This unusual packing and peculiar L-shape  of the complex (Figure 1) might account for the  adoption of a P2 lattice, and explain the fragility  and the weak diffraction of the crystals (I/sI of 7.2  to 3 A ).
  D1 and D2 module association in TF structures  Two human TF structures have been previously  determined at 2.2 A (Harlos et al., 1994, PDB code  1boy) and at 2.4 A (Muller et al., 1994, PDB code  1hft), followed by a 1.7 A structure (Muller et al.,  1996, PDB code 2hft).
Both human TFs crystallized  in the same space group, P41212, with the same cell  parameters and one molecule in the asymmetric  unit.
The two structures are highly similar with a  r.m.s.d of 0.44 A for 194 Ca atoms.
The overall  structure of TF in the TFVIIa complex is also very  similar to that of the uncomplexed TFs with a  r.m.s.d. of 0.53 A for 170 Ca atoms (Banner et al.,  1996).
The only signicant difference was a small  shift in the loop containing Leu133 and Phe144.
  The TF in our TF5G9 complex structure is similar to the published TFs with an r.m.s.d.
of 0.61 A  for 185 Ca atoms (compared to 2hft).
Our unliganded TF differs from these TF structures with an  overall r.m.s.
deviation of 1.33 A for 197 corresponding Ca atoms (compared to 2hft).
Superposition of the individual D1 and D2 modules,  however, shows much lower r.m.s.d.
values of  0.59 A for 89 D1 Ca atoms and 0.57 A for 98 D2 Ca  atoms.
Calculation of the intermodule angle  between D1 and D2 modules by program O (Jones  et al., 1991) shows that our unliganded TF structure  has an intermodule angle of 134 for both TF molecules I and II, different from those of 2hft (127)  and 1boy (127).
So, despite a large intermodule  hydrophobic interaction (Muller et al., 1996), a limited degree of orientational exibility (7)  between the TF D1 and D2 modules is permitted  (Figure 3).
Compared with the other TF structures  Figure 2.

  Conformational changes in Fab 5G9 upon TF  antigen binding  The elbow angle of Fab 5G9 in the TF5G9 complex (129) is close to that of the unliganded Fab  (133) at the lower end of those observed in Fab  structures (127 to 227, Wilson & Staneld, 1994).
  A comparison of all 428 Ca atoms between free  and bound Fab 5G9 gives an r.m.s.d. of 0.72 A .
  The corresponding r.m.s. difference for the Ca  atoms of the CDR loops is 0.64 A , comparable to  the overall r.m.s.
difference for all Ca atoms and,  thus, indicates that the overall structure, as well as  the combining site, of the free and bound Fab 5G9  is similar (Figure 4).
The largest Ca atom shifts in  the CDR loops upon complex formation are in  CDR L3 residues GlyL92 (1.5 A ) and AsnL93  (1.8 A ).
  Despite these small overall shifts in the CDR  loops, some differences appear signicant  (Figure 4).

values of  the 5G9 light chain.
In addition, a 30 swing of the  TyrH98 side-chain is critical for making two hydrogen bonds to the TF main-chain carbonyl oxygen  of Lys149 and the side-chain amide group of  Asn171 (Figure 5).
  Staneld et al. (1993) have observed a substantial  rotation (16) of the variable heavy (VH) chain relative to the variable light (VL) chain in Fab 50.1-peptide complex.
They also proposed that this VLVH  rotation is related to the length of CDR H3 loop  and the size of the buried surface area at the  VLVH interface.
The availability of both free and  TF-bound 5G9 allows us to calculate the Fab 5G9  VLVH rotation angle upon antigen binding.
Fab  5G9 has a relatively large VLVH interface  (1439 A 2  ) compared with the smallest observed so  far for Fab 50.1 (1063 A 2  ; Staneld et al., 1993;  Table 2).
Upon TF antigen binding, Fab 5G9 undergoes only a small VLVH rotation (2.8), that is  similar to that seen in other Fab-protein complexes  (Table 2).
  Antibody-antigen interactions  The six CDRs of Fab 5G9 form a large and somewhat concave surface.
The tips of the CDRs are all  approximately in the same plane with a small  depression between VL and VH particularly on the  VH side (Figure 1).
From these CDRs, 19 residues  interact with 18 antigen residues from four of the  six b strands (C0  , C, F and G) of TFs D2 module  (Figure 6).
The TF epitope consists of  C-strand residues Lys149, Ile152, Thr154, Tyr156,  C0  -strand residues Lys165, Lys166, Thr167, Ala168,  Lys169, Thr170, Asn171, F-strand residues Gln190,  Val192, Pro194, and G-strand residues Val198,  Arg200, Lys201, Asp204 (Table 3).
  The interacting surfaces of TF and Fab 5G9  (Figure 7) have a good shape and charge complementarity, a feature observed in other antibodyprotein antigen systems and a recurrent feature of  antibody-antigen recognition (Davies et al., 1990;  Wilson et al., 1991a,b; Wilson & Staneld, 1993,  1994; Padlan, 1994; Webster et al., 1994; Davies &  Cohen, 1996).
The surface areas buried on TF and  Fab 5G9 as a result of the complex formation are  891 A 2 and 923 A 2 (Table 2), respectively, as calculated by program MS with a 1.7 A probe  (Connolly, 1983), which is one of the largest antibody-antigen interaction surfaces seen so far  (observed range for protein antigens and Fabs are  538 to 901 A 2 and 556 to 982 A 2  , respectively, see  Table 2).
  The framework residues of the antibody usually  contribute only a very small surface area to antigen  binding (Wilson & Staneld, 1994), as seen here  Figure 5.
Interaction of TF C0  -strand with Fab 5G9.
Residue Lys169 of TF C0  -strand (magenta) is accommodated in a  pocket between the Fab CDRs L3 and H3 (magenta).
The unliganded Fab 5G9 L3 and H3 CDR loops are shown in  green and were superimposed on the liganded structure through the framework residues.
The subtle movement of  5G9 H3 and L3 loops in the bound form allows formation of six hydrogen bonds with TF.
  880 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complexwith only 5% of the total contact area (Table 2).
  The heavy chain accounts for 67% of the total antibody-antigen contact surface, whereas the light  chain only contributes 33%.
This skewed percentage of contact area for the light chain is at the  lower end of the observed range for known antibody-protein complexes (ranging from 21% for Fv  E5.2 to 49% for Fab HyHEL-5, Table 2), and closer  to those seen in antibody-peptide or antibody-hapten complexes (10% to 40%; Wilson & Staneld,  1994).
The light chain makes 32 contacts (eight, six,  and 18 for L1, L2, and L3, respectively) to the antigen, whereas the heavy chain contributes 109 of  the total 141 contacts (47, 39, 23 for H1, H2, and  H3, respectively).
A total of 15 hydrogen bonds  (ten VH, ve VL) occurs between TF and 5G9 with  two main-chain main-chain hydrogen bonds from  Thr167 O SerL94 N (L3) and Lys169 N GlyL92 O  Figure 6.

An ``open-book'' (along the yellow line) represention of the contact surfaces of the TF5G9 complex shows  the charge and shape complementarity between Fab 5G9 (right) and antigen TF (left).
The surface was color-coded  from blue to red for positive and negative charge.
The interacting surface of the TF D2 module is positively charged  (K166, K169, R200, K201), whereas the antibody generally has complementary negatively charged residues (D95H,  E93L, D52H).
The charge distribution was calculated by GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991).
  882 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex(L3) (Tables 3 and 5), which is typical (six to 17,  Davies & Cohen, 1996) for antibody-protein complexes.
  The TF epitope residues can be grouped into  four linear polypeptide segments (Table 3 and  Figure 6).
The C-strand residues 149 to 156 only  interact with 5G9 VH and account for approximately 20% of the total van der Waals contacts (28)  and buried surface area (165 A 2  ).
On the other  hand, residues 165 to 171 of the C0  -strand segment  interact primarily with 5G9 VL, with seven hydrogen bonds, four of which involve TF main-chain  atoms.
Indeed, the CDR L3 loop resembles a short  antiparallel b-strand interacting with the TF C0  -  strand and extending the C0  , C, F, G b-sheet of TF  (Figure 6).
This TF segment accounts for 30 to 39%  of all interactions in terms of van der Waals contacts (43) and buried surface area (330 A 2  ).
Residues 200 to 204 of strand G contribute 22 to 32% of  total interactions (45) and buried surface area  (201 A 2  ).
Strand F has fewer interactions (17% of  total) for residues 190 to 198 (25 van der Waals  contacts and 153 A 2 of buried surface) with Fab  5G9.
  Although many TF residues are involved in the  TF5G9 interactions, a few key residues (Novotny  et al., 1989) can be identied based on the current  TF5G9 structure.
Tyr156 of the TF C-strand makes  12 contacts with the heavy chain of Fab 5G9,  which include one hydrogen bond between its  side-chain OH and AspH52 Od  2 of CDR H2  (Tables 3 and 5).
This residue uses one third of its  side-chain surface (60.0 A 2 out of total 187 A 2  ;  Table 4; Miller et al., 1987) to interact with Fab  5G9.
Another key TF epitope residue is Lys169 in  the C0  -strand, which is deeply buried in a pocket  formed by CDR loops L1, L3 and H3.
The contact  area between Lys169 and 5G9 is 101 A 2 (78 A 2  from the side-chain), which is almost one-half of  the total surface area of a lysine residue (211 A 2  ;  Table 4.

The contact surface areas (A 2  ) for  side-chain and main-chain atoms of TF epitope residues are calculated by the program MS (Connolly, 1983) with a  1.7 A probe radius (Gelin & Karplus, 1979).
The total contact surface areas are zero for other TF residues not listed  here.
The right side of the Table shows the Ki values for the inhibition of the mutant TFVIIa complex by 5G9.
The Ki  for inhibition of wild-type TFVIIa complex on factor X activation by Fab 5G9 is 3.4(0.3)  109 M; corresponding to  a G of 11.5 kcal/mol.
G is the difference between G values of TF mutants and wild-type TF  (Gmutant  Gwild-type).
The standard errors shown are from three independent measurements.
The number of van der  Waals contacts were taken from Table 3.
  Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex 883Miller et al., 1987).
This interaction involves six van  der Waals contacts and three main-chain and sidechain hydrogen bonds (Figures 5 and 6; Table 5).
  Two basic TF residues, Arg200 and Lys201, also  appear to play a key role in antibody binding.
  These two residues alone contribute 140 A 2 (mostly  from their side-chains, Table 4) of the total 891 A 2  antigen contact surface area, and make 36 out of  the total 141 antibody-antigen contacts (Table 3).
  Their side-chains form four hydrogen bonds with  the 5G9 heavy chain (Figure 6), three of which are  with 5G9 main-chain atoms and one with an acidic  side-chain, AspH52, from CDR H2 which becomes  completely buried in the interface.
Hydrogen  bonds between charged groups have been proposed (Fersht et al., 1985) to be stronger (4.5 kcal/  mol) than regular hydrogen bonds (two to three  kcal/mol).
In a study of the HyHEL-5-HEL complex (Chacko et al., 1995), a 1000-fold reduction in  the binding constant of a lysozyme mutant (R68K)  was ascribed mainly to the loss of only one antibody-antigen charged hydrogen bond.
Thus, the  large contact area and the polar hydrogen bonds  between TF Arg200 and Lys201 and Fab 5G9, plus  a good charge complementarity (Figure 7), implies  that Arg200 and Lys201 are critical residues for  antibody 5G9 recognition.
  All these key residues (Tyr156, Lys169, Arg200,  and Lys201) are quite polar.
In fact, the whole TF5G9 interface is polar and hydrophilic in nature  (Table 3), in contrast to typical mutimeric proteins,  which usually have hydrophobic interfaces (Jones  & Thornton, 1996).
  Water molecules have now been recognized as  playing an important role in the antibody-antigen  interface (Bhat et al., 1994; Wilson & Staneld,  1994; Cohen et al., 1996).
The TF5G9 model does  not include any water molecules due to the moderate resolution of the structure determination.
Only  three small cavities are found in the antibody-antigen interface that are primarily apolar and hydrophobic.
The largest cavity lies between TF Thr154  and the CDR H1 and H2 loops with a volume of  36 A 3  .
Although this cavity analysis is based on  the 3 A complex structure, it seems to disfavor a  major role for water molecules in this antibodyantigen interface.
However, no conclusive assertions can be made until a higher resolution structure of the complex is obtained.
  Comparison of mutagenesis data with the  TF5G9 structure  In many cases, protein-protein interactions are  dominated by only a few ``hot spot'' residues  (Novotny et al., 1989; Covell & Wallqvist, 1997).
  Some examples are human growth factor human  growth factor receptor complex (Clackson & Wells,  1995; Wells, 1996), NC41 FabN9 inuenza virus  neuraminidase (Nuss et al., 1993), and barnase-barstar (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993).
An analysis of the  barnase-barstar interface (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995)  by single mutations and double mutant cycles  (Carter et al., 1984; for a recent review, see  Horovitz, 1996) has identied two strong interactions (with coupling energies of more than  3.0 kcal/mol) that had not been noted previously  from examination of the crystal structure as the  interacting distances were greater than 4.4 A .
The  authors conclude that an interaction cannot simply  be assessed by distance alone.
On the other hand,  a recent calculation of protein-protein binding free  energy (Covell & Wallqvist, 1997), based on  changes in buried surface area due to residue-residue contacts and nearby crystallographic water  molecules (Wallqvist & Covell, 1996) has found  that all the interactions identied by double  mutant cycles in the barnase-barstar system can be  fully accounted for by considering water molecules  in the barnase-barstar interface.
More studies are  needed to address these important issues.
  A panel of TF mutants (some of them are multiple point mutants) were prepared during our  TF5G9 crystal structure study.
We measured the  binding constants of these mutants with 5G9 antibody, and compared the results with the structural  Table 5.

Surprisingly, at rst glance,  a group of TF mutants, K165A/K166A and Y157A,  have apparent inhibition constants (Ki  ) that are  lower (i.e. stronger binding to Fab 5G9) than that  of wild-type TF (3.4(  0.3)  109 M; Ruf &  Edgington, 1994). Fab 5G9 is a competitive inhibitor of factor X binding to the TFVIIa complex.
The  TF5G9 binding was measured indirectly through  5G9's competition with factor X for TFVIIa binding (see also Materials and Methods).
Since Lys165  and Lys166 of TF are critical residues for substrate  factor X association (Ruf et al., 1992a), the decrease  in Ki for these mutants is likely to result from less  efcient competition by factor X for these mutants  under the experimental conditions.
The importance  of residue Tyr157, which lies underneath Lys165  and Lys166, is indirect and is likely due to its role  in positioning these lysine residues.
However, we  cannot entirely exclude the possibility that the  removal of these side-chains of TF by Ala  mutations actually increases the free energy of  binding between TF and 5G9.
  A strong and qualitative correlation between  structural data (number of van der Waals contacts  and contact surface area) and Ki is observed for the  mutants of key TF epitope residues (Table 4,  Figure 8).
Mutation of any of these residues profoundly diminishes the binding between TF and  5G9, and disrupts 5G9's ability to inhibit TFVIIa  complex formation.
Mutation of TF Tyr156 to  alanine results in an increase of the Ki to  2.1  106 M, that corresponds to more than  4.0 kcal/mol reduction of binding free energy.
  A double mutation of critical residues Arg200 and  Lys201 to alanine also reduces the TF5G9 binding  afnity by at least 4.0 kcal/mol.
Likewise, a triple  mutation of K169A/N171A/N173A results in a  large G (Gmutant  Gwild-type) over the wildtype (>4.0 kcal/mol).
Lys169 appears to be the  most important of these three residues, as it has  the largest contact area (101 A 2  ) with Fab 5G9  among these three residues (Table 4).
  A double mutation of Ser195 and Arg196 of TF  to alanine leads to a large reduction of binding  energy (>4.0 kcal/mol); there are no interactions  between these residues and Fab 5G9.
It seems that  the effect of these two residues is not from direct  interactions, but rather from the local structural/  hydration rearrangements of the alanine replacements.
The crystal structure of TF shows that  Ser195, Arg196, Asn199, Arg200, and Lys201 are in  a loop linking b-strands F and G; the loop conformation appears to be stabilized by the Arg196 guanidinium side-chain that is deeply buried in a  pocket formed by Asn105, Phe147 and Glu199.
  Mutational deletion of Arg196 may alter the conformation of the loop, displace the key interacting  residues Arg200 and Lys201, and thus abolish the  recognition of TF by Fab 5G9.
A similar argument  could be used to explain the effect of mutation on  Asn199, which has little side-chain (0.4 A 2  ) interaction with 5G9 but has a measurable effect on  5G9 binding (G of 1.1 kcal/mol) upon alanine  replacement.

Shown in pale-blue are TF residues that are in  contact with Fab 5G9 (Table 3).
Other contact residues are those that have been mutated and color-coded according  to the loss of binding free energy upon alanine substitution: red, more than 4 kcal/mol; yellow, 1 to 4 kcal/mol;  green, less than 1 kcal/mol.
  Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex 885TF Lys149 hydrogen-bonds to the 5G9 CDR H3  loop through its main-chain carbonyl oxygen.
Fab  5G9 inhibits the double mutant K149A/D150A,  with a slightly increased Ki of 2.5(0.42)  108 M  (corresponding to a G of 1.2 kcal/mol).
  Mutations of other C0  -strand residues of TF (T167A  and T170A mutants) have only unmeasurable or  small effects on TFVIIa inhibition (G of 0.0  and 1.0 kcal/mol, respectively), which is readily  explained by the TF5G9 structure.
The TF C0  -  strand uses mostly its main-chain atoms to make  hydrogen bonds with Fab 5G9's light chain (four  out of ve hydrogen bonds, Table 5), with the only  exception being the side-chain of the key Lys169  residue.
These data imply that Fab 5G9's interaction with the TF C0  -strand is largely specied by  TF main-chain atoms.
  In conclusion, our crystal structure of TF5G9  and the mutational study showed that four  (Tyr156, Lys169, Arg200, Lys201) out of 18 TF epitope residues have a major contribution (>4 kcal/  mol) to the 5G9 antibody recognition.
Three other  residues (Lys149, Thr170, Leu176) have some effect  (1 kcal/mol) on antibody-antigen interaction.
  Thus, despite our limited TF mutational study on  only a subset of the observed 5G9-interacting residues, a generally good correlation between the  binding energy and the structural data, which  includes van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bonding, buried surface, and the charge and shape complementarity (Tables 3 and 4), can be seen.
  However, the current crystal structure cannot completely explain all of the mutational results,  especially for those mutants which have relatively  minor effects on 5G9 binding.
For example, while  Leu176 of TF barely interacts with Fab 5G9 (sidechain contact area of 2.0 A 2  ), its mutation to alanine causes a measurable reduction on Fab 5G9  binding (G of 1.0 kcal/mol).
  Inhibitory mechanisms of Fab 5G9  The structure of the TF5G9 complex also offers  insights into 5G9's inhibition of binding of factors  IX or X to TF.
As 5G9 antibody can bind to the preformed TFVIIa complex (Ruf & Edgington, 1991),  the 5G9 antibody epitope and the VIIaTF interface  are inferred to be non-overlapping.
The TFVIIa  structure (Banner et al., 1996) shows that the epidermal growth factor-like modules and the protease module of VIIa are located some distance  from the antibody epitope.
The only potential overlap would come from the VIIa Gla-module which  binds to the D2 module of TF.
Positioning the Glamodule of the TFVIIa crystal structure (Banner  et al., 1996; PDB code 1dan) onto our TF5G9 structure (Figure 9) by superimposing the D2-modules  of TF in the two complex structures shows close  proximity but no overlap between Fab 5G9 and the  Gla module of VIIa.
Lys165 and Lys166 of TF, that  are the key residues for macromolecular substrate  factor X binding to the TFVIIa complex (Ruf et al.,  1992a), are within the TF interface with Fab 5G9.
  Hence, clear overlap exists on the TF surface  between the Fab 5G9 recognition site and the proposed binding site for factor X (Lys165 and  Lys166).
Fab 5G9 then must act as a direct competitor for factor X substrate binding, which conrms  the previous conclusions from kinetic studies (Ruf  & Edgington, 1991).
  It is noteworthy that the Gla module of VIIa also  plays an important role in the recognition of  macromolecular substrates (Ruf et al., 1991a).
  Hence, both the VIIa Gla module and the adjacent  regions of TF may be the recognition surfaces for  factor X in formation of the transient ternary  TFVIIaX complex.
The proximity of Fab 5G9 to  VIIa (Figure 9) implies that binding of 5G9 to TF is  also likely to hinder sterically the docking of factor  X substrate to the VIIa Gla-module, or to restrict  conformational exibility of the Gla-module and  affect factor X substrate assembly or product  release.
The potent inhibitory mechanism of Fab  5G9 is, therefore, best rationalized by the occupancy of a surface-exposed recognition site that  plays a central role in the assembly of the  TFVIIaX transient ternary complex.
A denite  answer to this inhibitory mechanism requires a  crystal structure of the TFVIIaX ternary complex.
  Materials and Methods  Crystallization and data collection (Tables 1 and 6)  Sitting-drop techniques (Stura et al., 1992) were used  in all crystallization experiments.
Protein solutions  (2.5 ml) were mixed with 2.5 ml precipitant solutions; the  Figure 9.
Binding of Fab 5G9 to TF does not inhibit  binding of factor VIIa.
The Gla-module of VIIa in the  TFVIIa complex structure (cyan, from PDB code 1dan;  Banner et al., 1996), positioned by superimposing the TF  D2 modules of the 1dan structure to that of the TF5G9  structure, does not overlap with the epitope of Fab 5G9  (in green) in the TF D2 module which is in CPK representation.
Shown in gray are carbon atoms, red for  oxygen atoms, blue for nitrogen atoms and yellow for  sulfur atoms.

X-ray diffraction data  were collected on either of two Siemens multiwire area  detectors in our laboratory using CuKa radiation from an  Elliott GX-18 rotating anode generator with a 100 mm  focal cup, operating at 40 kV and 55 mA, or a Siemens  rotation anode generator with a 300 m focal spot, operating at 50 mA, 80 kV, with Franks focusing mirrors  (Harrison, 1968) and a helium cone to reduce background scattering.
Diffraction data were processed with  the XENGEN program package (Howard et al., 1987).
  Expression and crystallization of tissue factor  The extracellular domain of human TF, consisting of  residues 1 to 218, was over-expressed in inclusion bodies  in E. coli and refolded in vitro as described (Stone et al.,  1995).
TF crystals can be routinely grown from 20 mM  phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), at a 40 mg/ml protein concentration.
The rst diffraction quality crystals were  actually crystallized, unexpectedly, in two days from an  NMR tube containing approximately 3.5 mM uniformly  15N-enriched (99 atom%) TF (at 85 mg/ml) in 20 mM  KNa2PO4, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 10% (v/v) 2  H2O and 90%  (v/v) H2O (pH 7.0) at 5C. Clusters of the shiny TF  extracellular domain crystals in the NMR tube were harvested, separated into individual crystals, and stored in  a 10% (w/v) 10 K polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution in  a constant temperature incubator at 22C. The crystals  were stable in this solution for over a year, as judged by  their X-ray diffraction.
The TF crystals have a typical size  of 0.5 mm  0.2 mm  0.3 mm, and are space group  P212121 with cell parameters of a  64.4 A , b  85.8 A ,  c  112.9 A . The Matthews (1968) coefcient (Vm) is  2.9 A 3  /Dalton, assuming the asymmetric unit contains  two molecules, and corresponds to a solvent content of  55%.
  Crystallization of Fab 5G9  The production, purication, and crystallization of  Fab 5G9 have been described (Ruf et al., 1992b).
Two  slightly different crystal forms of Fab 5G9 were obtained  using 17.5% PEG 10 K at pH 8.5 and 1.35 M sodium  citrate at pH 5.5 as precipitants, and protein concentrations of 16 mg/ml and 23 mg/ml, respectively.
Both  crystal forms are orthorhombic, P212121, with typical  sizes of 0.5 mm  0.4 mm  0.3 mm (citrate form) and  0.6 mm  0.35 mm  0.2 mm (PEG form), with slightly  different cell parameters of a  89.1 A , b  90.5 A ,  c  59.3 A (citrate) and a  91.6 A , b  93.7 A , c  60.7 A  (PEG).
Diffraction data from both crystal forms have  been collected to 2.4 A .
Only the crystal structure of PEG  crystal form is reported here.
The PEG crystal form contains one Fab molecule in the asymmetric unit and has a  Matthews coefcient (Matthews, 1968) of 2.4 A 3  /Dalton  with a solvent content of 46%.
  Production, purification and crystallization of  TF5G9 complex  Crystals of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-expressed  TF (Ruf et al., 1992b) complexed with Fab 5G9 were  grown in 1.7 to 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium  citrate (pH 5.0 to 5.5), 0.2% 2-methyl-2,4-pentane diol  (MPD), and 2% PEG 600 at an equal 5G9:TF molar  ratio.
The crystals grew extremely slowly, taking six to  nine months to reach a maximal size of  0.4 mm  0.4 mm  0.8 mm.
The crystals are monoclinic, P2, with unit cell parameters a  142.3 A , b  73.3 A ,  c  115.9 A and b  90.9. The Vm is 3.7 A 3  /Dalton  based on two TF5G9 complex molecules in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 64%.
  Structure determination and  crystallographic refinement  Fab 5G9  The 5G9 structure was determined by the molecular  replacement (MR) method using X-PLOR (Bru nger,  1992b) and MERLOT (Fitzgerald, 1988) software  packages.
The McPC603 (PDB code 1mcp, Satow et al.,  1986) and HyHEL-5 (PDB code 3hfm, Cohen et al., 1996;  Sheriff et al., 1987) Fabs were used as MR search models  due to their high sequence similarity to Fab 5G9.
Of  these two models, HyHEL-5 has the highest amino acid  identity (82%) in both heavy and light chains, whereas  McPC603 has 80% sequence identity in the light chain,  but only 40% in the heavy chain.
The McPC603, however, gave the best Crowther rotation function for the  ``whole'' Fab model using MERLOT.
The relative orientation of the variable and constant domains of 5G9 was  then rened by the PC-renement algorithm of X-PLOR  (Bru nger et al., 1987).
The X-PLOR package was also  used to solve the translation function and to rene Fab  5G9 model using the slow cooling protocol (Bru nger  et al., 1990).
Several cycles of renement and model  building with 10% OMIT maps were carried out using  FRODO (Jones, 1978, 1982).
The Fab 5G9 coordinates  have been deposited in the PDB with code 1fgn.
  Tissue factor  The initial structure determination of the extracellular  domain of TF was attempted by multiple isomorphous  replacement (MIR) since no TF structure was available at  that time.
The TF crystals from the NMR tube were quite  sensitive to ionic strength; the crystals crack even in  50 mM salt.
A no-salt medium (10% PEG 10 K) was,  therefore, chosen as the soaking mother liquor.
The pH  values of the heavy atom solutions were carefully  adjusted to the required value (pH 7) by addition of  small amounts of NaOH and HCl solutions.
After an  extensive heavy atom screening of 30 possible derivatives, samarium chloride (SmCl3), platinum(II) 2,20  ,60  ,20  -  terpyridine chloride (Pt(terpy)Cl), and trimethyllead  acetate ((CH3)3PbOAc) gave reasonable isomorphism  and good quality Patterson maps (Table 6).
For the  SmCl3 derivative crystal, both isomorphous and anomalous data were carefully collected.
It is worthwhile to  note that, after soaking in the SmCl3 solution, the TF  crystals were seriously etched, lost their shiny surface  and sharp edges and became more like rugged balls.
The  crystals, however, still retained a strong birefringence  and diffracted reasonably well.
  The XtalView 2.0 package (McRee, 1992) was used to  merge derivative and native data and to calculate difference Patterson maps.
Among the three derivatives,  SmCl3 had the best isomorphism.
The isomorphous Patterson map was readily solved by hand, and conrmed  by analysis of the anomalous Patterson map.
Phases  from the SmCl3 derivative were used to cross-phase the  other two derivatives in order to determine their heavy  atom positions.
The PHASES program package (Furey &  Swaminathan, 1990, 1997) was used to reject outliers  from the merged reection data, to rene the derivatives,  Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their Complex 887and to calculate nal phases.
All heavy atom sites were  conrmed to be signicant by criteria that included t to  difference Patterson maps, reasonable occupancies, and  proper renement behavior.
The nal gure of merit  was 0.471 for 7181 phased reections up to 3.6 A (see  Table 1).
The relative phasing power (FH/e) of the nal  MIRAS phases showed the SmCl3 derivative was strongest with 1.66 and 1.07 for isomorphous and anomalous  data, respectively, whereas the other two derivatives had  lower phasing powers of 0.98 (to 4.5 A ) for the  Pb(CH3)3OAc derivative and 1.03 (to 5.5 A ) for the  Pt(terpy)Cl derivative, which was consistent with weaker  peaks in the difference Patterson maps.
These two  derivatives were included because they contributed to  the data completeness for phased reections in the low  resolution range, which was important for the automatic  solvent mask generation in the solvent attening process.
  The combined phases from these three derivatives  were then solvent attened (Wang, 1985) with the  PHASES package using a solvent content of 45%, which  is smaller than that estimated by the Matthews coef-  cient, to avoid attening the protein molecule.
The electron density map after solvent attening showed a clear  molecule/solvent boundary and some continuous density, but the overall quality was not sufcient for an  unambiguous trace of the molecule (Figure 10).
Further  solvent attening, histogram matching, and averaging  methods using DM of CCP4 (Cowtan, 1994) were  applied to the MIRAS phases using the molecular mask  and symmetry operators that relate the two TF molecules  in the asymmetric unit.
The MIRAS phases were greatly  improved as judged by the drop of Rfree from 0.573 to  0.363 in the 15 to 3.6 A range, the overall increase in the  mean gure of merit (FOM) from 0.48 to 0.79, and a substantial improvement in the quality and interpretability  of the maps.
A portion of the MIRAS map at 3.6 A at  various stages of density modication is shown in  Figure 10.
  Two TF crystal structures from two different laboratories (Harlos et al., 1994; Muller et al., 1994) were published during our heavy atom screening, and the Ca  coordinates of the 1boy TF structure became available to  us from Dr C. W. G. Boys.
A backbone model of TF was  constructed using SYBYL (TRIPOS Associates Inc., 1992)  from these Ca coordinates, and the side-chains added by  the MODELLER program (Sali & Overington, 1994).
  After eliminating unreasonable repulsions by hand, the  model was energy minimized to give a starting model  for molecular replacement.
A rotation function solution  for one TF molecule was quite clear from both the real  space search of X-PLOR (Huber, 1985) and the reciprocal  space search by AMoRe (Navaza, 1994, implemented in  the CCP4 Suite, CCP4, 1994); the highest peak of 16.2s  intensity in the AMoRe 3.5 to 8 A search was 4.6s above  the next peak.
The correctly rotated TF model was positioned into the unit cell by the phased translation function (Read & Schierbeek, 1988) using the MIRAS phases.
  The phased translation function gave a strongest solution  with a peak height of 18.3s for the rst TF molecule,  Table 6.

The  rotational peak for the second molecule in the asymmetric unit was buried in the noise level (sixth strongest  peak in the AMoRe 3.5 to 8 A search).
The current solution was actually not identied until a later stage from  a partial T2 translational function search, which took  advantage of the rst TF molecule being correctly positioned.
The phased translation function of this TF orientation gave a peak of 11.3s, which was 6.8s higher than  the next peak.
  Rfree cross validation (Bru nger, 1992a), based on a 10%  randomly omitted data set, was used throughout the  renement.
The relative orientations of the TF molecules  and their D1 and D2 modules were rened by the rigid  body renement protocol in X-PLOR, leading to a drop  in R-value from 41.8% to 37.0% and the Rfree from 41.6%  to 37.0% for data in the 15 to 4 A range.
The next stage  of renement and model building used 2Fo  Fc shake  OMIT maps (McRee, 1993), generated with a random  error (0.25 A ) added to the model.
The crystal diffraction was found to be highly anisotropic with greater  decay along the crystallographic c* axis than along the a*  and b* axes.
An overall anisotropic B-value (6.8, 4.5,  11.3 A 2  ), estimated from X-PLOR, was applied to the  data set to correct the anisotropy.
Prominent peaks in  Fo  Fc maps and 2Fo  Fc maps were picked and scrutinized against their neighboring atoms to select for  chemically reasonable water molecules.
The TF coordinates have been deposited in the PDB with code 1tfh.
  TF5G9 complex  The molecular replacement method was used to position both the TF and Fab 5G9.
The orientation and translation of 5G9 was relatively straightforward since we  had a ``perfect'' Fab model from the 5G9 structure determination.
The molecular replacement of TF, however,  turned out to be difcult, even though the search model  was quite close to the nal model.
No obvious rotation  function solutions could be identied by using either the  entire TF or separate D1 or D2 modules as MR models,  despite enormous searching windows (different models,  integration radii and resolution ranges) and extensive  use of many search algorithms, which included reciprocal space search by ALMN and AMoRe (Navaza, 1994)  of CCP4, real space search (Huber, 1985) and direct  rotation search (DeLand & Bru nger, 1995) as  implemented in X-PLOR.
This difculty was assumed to  stem from similarity in the topology and overall threedimensional structures of the TF modules and the Fab  domains (particularly with the constant domains).
  Indeed, by simply subtracting the amplitudes corresponding to the Fab component from the observed  amplitudes using the following formula (where K is the  scaling factor);  Fmodified     jFobsj  2  K  jFfabj  2  q  we were able to identify the correct rotation solution for  the D2 module of both independent TFs by X-PLOR's  rotation function and PC renement using the modied  experimental amplitudes in the range of 15 to 5 A .
The  correct solution was still not the strongest peak in  X-PLOR's PC rened list (number six on the list).
However, a solution was identied by running the partial T2  translation function, in which the positions of Fab 5G9  were xed, on the rst 50 X-PLOR rotation function solutions.
The D1 module of the TF was then placed into  the cell assuming a similar intermodule angle between  D1 and D2 as that of unliganded TF; no steric clashes  resulted with neighboring molecules in the cell.
The  second TF molecule of the complex was generated using  the known NCS relationship between the two 5G9 molecules.
It is worthwhile to point out that the TF D2  search model used in this aspect of the molecular replacement accounts for only approximately 8% of the  scattering atoms in the asymmetric unit, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the subtraction method.
  Zhang & Matthews (1994) have previously elaborated  on a similar addition/subtraction strategy to enhance  the molecular replacement method.
  Before renement, 889 reections (2.5% of the total  34,656 I > sI reections) were set aside for calculating  Rfree and monitoring the renement process.
The relative  orientation of the six domains (VH, VL, CL, CH1 of 5G9  and D1, D2 of TF) were rened by X-PLOR's rigid body  renement protocols in 15 to 6 A and 15 to 4 A resolution ranges; no noticeable domain movements were  observed.
After the initial slow-cool renement, the  resulting 2Fo  Fc map was averaged by the RAVE program suite (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994b), with the molecular mask generated by the MAMA program (Kleywegt &  Jones, 1993).
The NCS matrix was derived from the molecular replacement models by the lsq_explicit command  of the O program (Jones et al., 1991), and was rened  against the 2Fo  Fc map to give a correlation coefcient  of 0.70.
The models were rebuilt according to a twofold  averaged map generated by RAVE and rened by  X-PLOR.
From this point on, only the rst TF5G9 molecule was rened and the second molecule was generated by the NCS matrix through X-PLOR's NCS strict  statement.
This procedure doubled the ratio of observed  reections to renement parameters to a value of 1.9.
  The B-values of the model were rened by groups (two  per residue), and were reset to 20 A 2 before renement.
  After several cycles of positional renement and model  building against shake OMIT maps, an R-value of 24.9%  (I > sI data) was obtained between 7.0 A and 3.0 A with  an Rfree of 28.1%.
The model at this stage had reasonable  stereochemistry (r.m.s.d. of 0.010 A and 2.1 for bond  lengths and bond angles, respectively), phi  psi distribution (73.1 residues in most favorable regions), and  real-space t of the overall atoms to the 2Fo  Fc map  (overall correlation coefcient of 0.80).
The NCS constraints were relaxed to NCS restraints with an Rfree  optimized force constant of 20 kcal/(molA 2  ) for mainchain atoms and 10 kcal/(molA 2  ) for all other nonhydrogen atoms; the R-value then dropped to 20.6%  (I > sI data, or 24.6% for all data).
This reduction in  R-value, although accompanied by an increase in the  number of the renement parameters due to the relaxation of NCS constraints, was validated by a reduction  in Rfree from 28.1% to 27.6%.
The release of NCS-constraints to NCS-restraints does not have any major effect  on the overall structure as can be seen from the relatively small r.m.s.
deviations between NCS-restraint and  NCS-constraint models (0.23 A each for the 196 Ca and  58 CDR Ca atoms).
The TF5G9 coordinates have been  deposited in the PDB with code 1ahw.
  Structure analyses  The r.m.s.d. of the CDR loops between the free and  TF-bound Fab 5G9 were calculated after superimposing  their respective framework residues of the variable  domain (light chain VL 1 to 23, 35 to 49, 57 to 88, 98 to  107, and heavy chain VH 1 to 30, 36 to 49, 67 to 98, 107  to 117) by LSQKAB (Kabsch, 1976).
All residues are in  890 Crystal Structures of TF, 5G9 Fab and Their ComplexKabat-Wu numbering (Kabat et al., 1991).
Ramachandran  plots were calculated by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al.,  1993), buried surface areas with the program MS  (Connolly, 1983) with a 1.7 A probe radius (Gelin &  Karplus, 1979) and standard van der Waals radii (Case  & Karplus, 1979) with water molecules excluded from  the calculation, and hydrogen bonds and van der Waals  contacts by HBPLUS (McDonald & Thornton, 1994).
  To calculate the intermodule angle of the TF structure,  the D1 and D2 modules were rst superimposed by the  lsq_explicit command of O program (Jones et al., 1991)  using the following residues pairs: D1 11  17, D2 112   118; D1 21  26, D2 123  128; D1 33  39, D2 151  157; D1  46  51, D2 166  171; D1 55  59, D2 173  177; D1 70  76,  D2 186  192; D1 93  99, D2 201  207, which gives the  lowest r.m.s.d. between these two sets of Ca atoms.
The  angle was then retrieved from the trace of the overlap  matrix.
  Effect of TF mutations on the Ki for inhibition of  TFVIIa by Fab 5G9  Fab 5G9 is a competitive inhibitor of factor X/IX substrate activation by the TFVIIa complex.
The effects of  mutations in TF on the binding of 5G9 in a competition  assay were characterized as follows.
Wild-type or  mutant TF expressed by transient transfection of Chinese  hamster ovary cells was incubated with serial dilutions  of 5G9 (0.03 to 2700 nM) for 15 minutes at ambient temperature, followed by the addition of enzyme VIIa  (5 nM) and substrate factor X (50 nM) in the presence of  5 mM CaCl2.
Factor Xa generation was quenched after  15 minutes at ambient temperature and the concentrations of factor Xa in each reaction was quantied with  chromogenic p-nitroanilide substrates.
Rates of factor Xa  generation versus the antibody concentration were tted  to a model of competitive inhibition of the antibody with  factor X, yielding a Ki for each of the mutants and wildtype TF.
