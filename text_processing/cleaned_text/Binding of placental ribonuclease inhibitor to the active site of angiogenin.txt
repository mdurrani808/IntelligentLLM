3556 Biochemistry 1989, 28, 3556-3561   Binding of Placental Ribonuclease Inhibitor to the Active Site of Angiogenid   Frank S. Lee and Bert L. Vallee*   Center for Biochemical and Biophysical Sciences and Medicine and Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular   Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 021 15   Received September 12, 1988   ABSTRACT: The importance of specific residues in angiogenin for binding to placental ribonuclease inhibitor   (PRI) has been assessed by examining the interaction of angiogenin derivatives with PRI.
PRI binds native   angiogenin with a Ki value of 7.1 X M [Lee, F. S., Shapiro, R., & Vallee, B. L. (1989) Biochemistry   28, 225-2301.
Substitution of a Gln for Lys-40 in angiogenin by site-specific mutagenesis decreases the   association rate constant 3-fold and increases the dissociation rate constant 440-fold, resulting in a 1300-fold   weaker Ki value.
The half-life of the mutant-PRI complex is 3.4 h compared to -60 days for the native   angiogenin-PRI complex.
The magnitude of the change in Ki value suggests that in the complex, Lys-40   forms a salt bridge or hydrogen bond with an anionic moiety in PRI.
Carboxymethylation of His-13 or   His-I 14 with bromoacetate increases the Ki value 15-fold, and oxidation of Trp-89 by means of dimethyl   sulfoxide and hydrochloric acid increases it 2.4-fold, suggesting that these residues also form part of the   contact region with PRI.
The changes in Ki value reflect an increase in the dissociation rate constant.
On   the other hand, dinitrophenylation of either Lys-50 or Lys-60 with l-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene does not   significantly alter the Ki value, suggesting that these residues are not part of the contact region.
These results   indicate that PRI inhibition minimally involves the three residues critical for the activity of angiogeninLys-40, His-13, and His-1 14-and to a lesser extent its single tryptophan, Trp-89.
  Human angiogenin, a protein that induces neovascularization (Fett et al., 1985), is -35% identical in sequence with   pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase)' (Strydom et al., 1985;   Kurachi et al., 1985) and is ribonucleolytically active (Shapiro   et al., 1986a; St. Clair et al., 1987; Rybak & Vallee, 1988).
  Placental ribonuclease inhibitor (PRI), a 50-kDa protein that   is a tight-binding inhibitor of RNases (Blackburn et al., 1977;   Blackburn & Moore, 1982), abolishes both the angiogenic and   the ribonucleolytic activities of angiogenin (Shapiro & Vallee,   1987).
The interaction between PRI and angiogenin is extremely tight (Lee et al., 1989a,b); the Ki value is 7.1 X   M, about 60 times lower than that for RNase A. The value   of the apparent second-order rate constant of association of   PRI with angiogenin is 1.8 X lo8 M-' s-', close to the diffusion-controlled limit, while the value of the dissociation rate   constant of the resultant complex is 1.3 X IO-' s-I, yielding   a half-life of about 60 days.
This tight-binding interaction   suggests that PRI may play a physiological role in the regulation of angiogenin (Shapiro & Vallee, 1987; Lee et al.,   1989a,b).
  The primary structure of PRI has been determined (Lee et   al., 1988), and it is therefore possible to investigate the contact   regions in angiogenin and PRI, with the eventual aim of designing and synthesizing angiogenin inhibitors with binding   properties similar to those of PRI.
In order to help define the   angiogenin contact region, we have examined the binding of   angiogenin derivatives to PRI.
We find that modification or   mutagenesis of three residues critical to the ribonucleolytic   activity of angiogenin-Lys-40, His-1 3, and His-1 14-and the   single tryptophan of angiogenin, Trp-89, each results in a   weakening of the interaction with PRI, suggesting that these   residues participate in the contact with PRI.
The interaction   of Lys-40 appears to be of critical importance: substitution   of glutamine for this residue increases the Ki value 1300-fold.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES   Materials.
UpA was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.   Butanedione was from Aldrich Chemical Co. Human angiogenin used for chemical modification studies was purified   from conditioned media of baby hamster kidney cells genetically engineered to synthesize it (Kurachi et al., 1988).
  Concentrations of angiogenin and its derivatives were determined by amino acid analysis.
The sources of all other materials, including proteins, have been described (Shapiro et al.,   1987; Lee et al., 1989a).
  Site-Specific Mutagenesis.
An angiogenin mutant in which   Lys-40 was changed to Gln by site-specific mutagenesis was   treated with Aeromonas aminopeptidase to remove the Nterminal Met as described (Shapiro et al., 1988a), thereby   generating the natural pyroglutamyl N-terminus.
Native   angiogenin was prepared in an analogous manner.
  Chemical Modifications.
All reactions were performed in   the dark at 25 "C. For C18 HPLC, a Synchropak RP-P   reversed-phase HPLC column (250 X 4.1 mm; Synchrom,   Inc.) and a Waters Associates liquid chromatography system   equipped with a 254/214-nm detector and a Hewlett Packard   3390A integrator were employed.
C18 HPLC solvents were   as follows: A, 0.1 % TFA; B, 2-propanol/acetonitrile/H20   (3:2:2 v/v) containing 0.08% TFA.
The flow rate was 1   mL/min unless otherwise noted.
  (A) Histidine.
Angiogenin, 410 pg, was treated with 30 mM   bromoacetate in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, for 4 h   'This work was supported by funds from Hoechst, A.

Derivatives were eluted with a 40-min linear gradient   from 0.1 to 0.3 M NaCl in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0,   at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
Fractions of the central peak were   pooled and desalted by C18 HPLC prior to kinetic analysis.
  (B) Tryptophan.
Angiogenin, 620 pg, was oxidized by   means of DMSO/HCl as described (Lee et al., 1989a) except   that the times of the DMSO/HCl and DMS/HCl reactions   were decreased to 20 and 30 min, respectively, and elution of   the derivatives from C18 HPLC was achieved with a 27-min   linear gradient from 30 to 42% solvent B at a flow rate of 0.8   mL/min.
  (C) Lysine.
Two different modifications of the lysines of   angiogenin were performed.
In one, 800 pg of angiogenin was   dinitrophenylated with 3 mM FDNB in 50 mM Hepes, pH   8, for 1 h (Shapiro et al., 1989).
The reaction mixture was   applied to a C18 column, and derivatives were eluted with a   135-min linear gradient from 30% to 60% solvent B. In the   other, 180 pg of angiogenin was reductively methylated with   2 mM formaldehyde and 10 mM sodium cyanoborohydride   in 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, for 90 min (Shapiro et al., 1987).
  Derivatives were separated from reagent by C18 HPLC employing a 27-min linear gradient from 24 to 48% solvent B.   (D) Arginine.
Angiogenin, 180 pg, was incubated with 20   mM butanedione in 25 mM Hepes, pH 8, for 90 min followed   by separation from reagent by C18 HPLC using a 27-min   linear gradient from 0 to 96% solvent B.   Protein Structural Characterization.
Amino acid analysis   was conducted using the Pico-Tag method (Bidlingmeyer et   al., 1984).
(Carboxymethy1)cysteine and tryptophan analyses   were performed as described (Shapiro et al., 1986b, 1988b).
  Peptide mapping of tryptic digests of unmodified and modified   angiogenin was performed as described (Shapiro et al., 1988a).
  Sequencing studies were carried out on a Beckman 890 sequencer upgraded to microsequencing status (Strydom et al.,   1986).
  Inhibition Kinetics.
(A) Association Rate Constant.
The   apparent second-order association rate constants, ka, for PRI   and angiogenin derivatives were determined by examining the   competition between the angiogenin derivative and RNase A   for PRI as described (Lee et al., 1989a).
PRI was added to   a mixture of angiogenin derivative and RNase A, and the   degree of partitioning of PRI between the two was determined   by assay of free RNase A. Under the conditions of the experiment, angiogenin does not cleave UpA, the substrate employed, at a detectable rate (Shapiro et al., 1986a), and dissociation either of RNase A or of any the angiogenin derivatives from PRI is negligible.
The following equation was   employed (Lee et al., 1989a):'   ka,A In ([AI T/ [AI F)   ka,R In ([RlT/[RlF)   -- -   where A and R refer to angiogenin derivative and RNase A,   respectively, and T and F denote total and free concentration,   respectively.
The value of ka,R was taken to be 3.4 X lo8 M-'   s-l (Lee et al., 1989a).
The substrate concentration, total   We have shown previously (Lee et al., 1989a) that PRI binds to   native angiogenin by a two-step mechanism:   K, (fast)   E+ I * EI&EI*   where E is angiogenin and I is PRI. k, N k2/KL when both [E] and [I]   << K,.
In this experiment, the highest concentration of either protein is   2.8 nM, 190-fold lower than the K, value observed for native angiogenin,   530 nM, and likely much less than the K, value for all angiogenin derivatives.
  4   Biochemistry, Vol. 28, No. 8, 1989 3557   RNase A concentration, and time between addition of PRI   and substrate were 100 pM, 0.70 nM, and 60 s, respectively.
  The values of ka,A obtained were averages of at least six determinations.
  (B) Dissociation Rate Constant.
The dissociation rate   constants, kd, of the angiogenin derivative-inhibitor complexes   were determined by first forming the complex, then adding   a scavenger for free PRI, and subsequently assaying for free   angiogenin derivative as a function of time, up to 10 days, as   described (Lee et al., 1989b).
The total derivative concentration was taken to be the free derivative concentration at   t = m. The scavenger was RNase A, and the method of assay   for free derivative was by cation-exchange HPLC as described   (Lee et al., 1989b).
The final concentration of angiogenin   derivative was 0.70 pM. All samples were incubated in the   dark.
  For the angiogenin derivatives prepared by modification with   formaldehyde/sodium cyanoborohydride or with butanedione,   free derivative was assayed by injection onto a Mono S cation-exchange HPLC column (50 X 5 mm; Pharmacia) instead   of a Synchropak CM300 column.
Elution was achieved with   either a 15-min linear gradient from 15 to 55% buffer B   (formaldehyde/sodium cyanoborohydride) or a 10-min linear   gradient from 15 to 85% buffer B (butanedione), where buffer   A is 10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, and buffer B is 10 mM Tris, pH   8, containing 1 M NaCl.
In all cases, free derivative was well   resolved both from its complex with PRI and from free RNase   A.   RESULTS   Ki Determinations.
Angiogenin binds to PRI with such an   extremely low Ki, 0.71 fM, that it was necessary to determine   both the association and dissociation rate constants in order   to obtain the Ki value (Lee et al., 1989b).
Accordingly, the   binding of angiogenin derivatives, modified at sites both within   and outside the active site, has been analyzed in a similar   manner using published methods (Lee et al., 1989a,b).
Briefly,   the apparent second-order rate constant of association is determined by competition between the angiogenin derivative   and RNase A for PRI.
From the known apparent association   rate constant of RNase A and PRI, the corresponding value   for the angiogenin derivative can be calculated.
The dissociation rate constant is determined by first forming the angiogenin derivative-PRI complex.
Release of free angiogenin   derivative from this complex is then followed as a function of   time in the presence of a 250-fold molar excess of RNase A   as scavenger for free PRI.
  Lysine Modification.
C18 HPLC following treatment of   angiogenin with formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride   results in a major peak with three minor shoulders eluting later   (not shown).
Amino acid analysis of the pooled material   reveals the loss of 6.2 of 7 lysines.
The apparent association   rate constant of this modified angiogenin with PRI is only   slightly decreased relative to that of unmodified angiogenin   (Table I).
The dissociation of this modified derivative from   its complex with PRI does not follow first-order kinetics over   the course of the experiment (56% dissociation, 3.3 days); the   rate constant of dissociation decreases as a function of time   (data not shown).
However, the initial rate of dissociation is   > 100-fold higher than that for native angiogenin, and half of   the complex has dissociated in only 2 days.
  Lys-40.
Lys-40 was changed to Gln by site-specific mutagenesis (Shapiro et al., 1989).
The isolated mutant was treated   with Aeromonas aminopeptidase to produce the natural pyroglutamyl N-terminus (Shapiro et al., 1988a) in >95% yield,   as indicated by Edman degradation.

The dissociation rate constant is obtained   from the slope of a plot of -In (([AIT - [A])/([AIT - [A],)) vs t, where   the subscripts T and 0 refer to the concentration of total angiogenin derivative and that observed several minutes after addition of scavenger, respectively.
All concentrations are normalized to a control sample   lacking PRI.
The angiogenin derivatives are Gln-40 (O), CM-His13;114 (O), DMSO/HCl-oxidized Trp89 (V), DNP-Lys-50 (0), and   DNP-Lys-60 (A).
Data for native angiogenin expressed from E. coli   are also shown (0).
  The apparent association rate constant of this mutant with   PRI is 6.1 X lo7 M-l s-I, 3-fold lower than that for native   angiogenin.
The dissociation rate constant of the mutant-PRI   complex is 5.7 X s-l (tllz = 3.4 h; Figure lA), 440-fold   higher than that for the native angiogenin-PRI complex (tl!z   = 62 days).
Therefore, the Ki value for the binding of this   mutant to PRI is 1300-fold higher than that for native angiogenin (Table I).
Native angiogenin was prepared in an   analogous manner from Escherichia coli, and its N-terminus   was also >95% blocked.
The parameters for PRI binding to   this native angiogenin expressed from E. coli are essentially   identical with those for native angiogenin obtained from human   plasma (Table I).

  Lys-50 and Lys-60.
Angiogenin treated with FDNB can   be resolved into several products, two of which are selectively   derivatized at either Lys-50 or Lys-60, by C18 HPLC.
The   isolation and characterization of these derivatives are described   elsewhere (Shapiro et al., 1989).
Both derivatives bind to PRI   with Ki values within 10% of that of native angiogenin (Table   1).
  His-13;I 14.
Attempts to separate monocarboxymethyl   (mono-CM) from di-CM-angiogenin and unmodified angiogenin following treatment with bromoacetate were unsuccessful (R. Shapiro and S. Weremowicz, personal communication).
These included cation-exchange HPLC (Mono S,   Pharmacia) at pH 8 and 9.5 and reversed-phase HPLC (C18,   Synchrom, Inc.).
On the other hand, cation-exchange HPLC   on a CM column at pH 4.0, near the pK, of the column's   functional group, did separate the derivatives (Figure 2A).
  Amino acid analyses combined with expectations of the numbers of histidines modified from previous work (Shapiro et al.,   1988b) indicate that the central peak (hatched in Figure 2A)   is mono-CM-angiogenin while the earlier and later eluting PRI Binding to Angiogenin Active Site Biochemistry, Vol. 28, No. 8, 1989 3559   dissociation rate constant of the complex is 2.5-fold higher   (Figure 1B).
The resulting Ki value is 2.4-fold higher than   that for unmodified angiogenin (Table I).
  Arginines.
Angiogenin treated with butanedione resulted   in a single sharp peak on C18 HPLC employing a steep gradient to separate product from reagent (not shown).
Amino   acid analysis of the material indicated loss of 6.9 of 13 arginines.
The apparent association rate constant of this modified angiogenin with PRI is 2.5-fold lower than that for unmodified angiogenin (Table I).
The dissociation of its complex   with PRI does not follow first-order kinetics over the course   of the experiment (20% dissociation, 8.6 days); the dissociation   rate constant decreases as a function of time (data not shown).
  In addition, the elution time of butanedione-modified angiogenin on the Mono S cation-exchange column employed for   assay of dissociated derivative shifts toward that of native   angiogenin during the course of the experiment, suggesting   reversal of the modification.
Nevertheless, the initial rate of   dissociation is > 10-fold higher than that for native angiogenin.
  DISCUSSION   Determination of the angiogeninvPR1 contact region is   necessary both to understand the basis of the extremely low   Ki value of the interaction and to design angiogenin inhibitors.
  We have therefore examined the effect of amino acid modification of angiogenin on its binding to PRI.
The following   were examined: (i) the active-site residues, Lys-40, His-1 3,   and His-114, since PRI is a competitive inhibitor of RNase   A and likely one of angiogenin (Lee et al., 1989b); (ii) the   single tryptophan, Trp-89, because previous fluorescence data   suggested that its environment undergoes a change in the PRI   complex (Lee et al., 1989a); and (iii) lysines and arginines   because they might be involved in binding a very basic protein,   such as angiogenin (PI > 9.5; Fett et al., 1985), to an acidic   one, PRI (PI = 4.7; Blackburn et al., 1977).
  Substitution of a Gln for the active-site Lys-40 in angiogenin   weakens the interaction 1300-fold (Table I); the effect corresponds to a free energy change of 4.3 kcal/mol.
This is in   the range of experimental values, -2-6 kcal/mol, for the   removal of either a salt-bridge partner or a hydrogen-bond   partner to a charged group (Fersht, 1972, 1987; Fersht et al.,   1985; Lowe et al., 1987; Wells et al., 1987), suggesting the   existence of a similar situation in this instance.
This, in turn,   would imply the presence of an anionic partner to Lys-40 in   PRI.
The marked effect of NaCl concentration on PRI kinetics supports this proposition: an increase in the NaCl   concentration from 0.1 to 1 M decreases the apparent association rate constant of PRI with angiogenin 100-fold (Lee   et al., 1989a) and weakens the binding of PRI to RNase A   20000-fold (Lee et al., 1989b).
The magnitude of the effect   of this single residue substitution on the binding of angiogenin   to PRI is similar to that observed with certain contact residue   substitutions in ovomucoids (e.g., Asp - Ala) on their binding   to serine proteases (Empie & Laskowski, 1982).
  The consequences of modification of either of two other   active-site residues of angiogenin, His-1 3 and His-1 14, suggest   that these are also involved in the interaction.
Amino acid   composition data (see Results) indicate that the reaction   product examined is a mixture of angiogenins singly carboxymethylated either at His-13 or at His-1 14 in a ratio of 1:1.8,   modified at the N3- and N1-positions, respectively (Shapiro   et al., 1988b), which bind 15-fold more weakly to PRI than   does native PRI (Table I).
The change in Ki value is due   entirely to a change in the dissociation rate of the derivative-PRI complex, and this dissociation follows first-order   kinetics for at least 80% of the process (Figure 1B).

In addition, amino acid analysis of the monoCM-angiogenin revealed the presence of 0.33 and 0.60 residues   of I@-CM-His and N1-CM-His, respectively (see Discussion).
  The apparent association rate constant of the mono-CM   derivative with PRI is essentially unchanged compared to that   of native angiogenin.
The dissociation of its complex with PRI,   despite the presence of a mixture of two mono-CM derivatives,   is first order (Figure 1B).
The dissociation rate constant is   15-fold higher (tl12 = 4.0 days) than that for native angiogenin;   the resulting Ki value is thus 15-fold higher (Table I).
  Trp-89.
The single tryptophan of angiogenin was oxidized   with DMSO and HC1.
The reported oxidation product of this   procedure is oxindolealanine (Savige & Fontana, 1977).
  Chromatography of the derivatives on C18 HPLC revealed   one major peak (hatched in Figure 2B).
Protein in this peak   was more than 99% uncleaved, as judged by SDS-PAGE   under reducing conditions (Laemmli, 1970).
Protein in all   other peaks was cleaved substantially.
Amino acid analysis   of the major peak showed loss of the one tryptophan with no   other changes in composition.
The tryptophan fluorescence   of this derivative was abolished (<5%).
  Tryptic digestion of the oxidized angiogenin followed by   fractionation indicated the presence of peptides indistinguishable in elution time from peptides 1-1 1 of native angiogenin [see numbering system of Strydom et al. (1985)l   except for peptide 10, the tryptic peptide containing Trp-89   (Figure 3).
A new peptide (hatched in Figure 3B) eluted   earlier than peptide This peptide had an amino acid   composition essentially the same as that of peptide 10, except   for the absence of tryptophan (data not shown).
These results   are consistent with modification solely at Trp-89.
  The association rate constant of this oxidized angiogenin   with PRI is similar to that for unmodified angiogenin, but the   This new peptide may be composed of more than one peak (see   minor peaks/shoulders at 88,90, and 94 min in Figure 3B).
This is most   likely due to the same reversible conformational change that characterizes   peptide 10 (Figure 3A).
Under the conditions employed, heterogeneity   in the tryptophan oxidation product is unlikely (Savige & Fontana,   1980). 3560 Biochemistry, Vol. 28, No. 8, 1989   this suggests that the two derivativePR1 complexes dissociate   at similar rates, which are significantly faster than that of the   native angiogenin-PRI complex.
This, in turn, suggests that   both histidines contact PRI.
Alternatively, the observed effects   could reflect other aspects of the modification, e.g., the introduction of a negative charge or the prevention of access of   Lys-40, His-13, and His-1 14 are all critical for the ribonucleolytic activity of angiogenin (Shapiro et al., 1987; Shapiro   et al., 1989). They are fully conserved in all pancreatic   RNases (Beintema et al., 1986) and correspond to the catalytic   triad of Lys-41, His-12, and His-119 of RNase A (Strydom   et al., 1985).
In the computed three-dimensional structure   of angiogenin, these three residues are in close proximity to   one another and reside in the proposed active-site cleft (Palmer   et al., 1986).
The view that these residues contact PRI, i.e.,   that PRI binds to angiogenins active site, is consistent with   previous kinetic studies which suggested that PRI is a competitive inhibitor of RNase A and, thus, likely one of angiogenin as well (Lee et al., 1989b).
  A number of observations previously suggested that the   single tryptophan of angiogenin, Trp-89, may also be part of   the contact region.
(i) Tryptophan fluorescence is enhanced   50% upon angiogenimPR1 complex formation and is abolished   when Trp-89 is first oxidized by DMSO and HCl (Lee et al.,   1989a). (ii) In the PRI complex Trp-89 becomes less accessible to acrylamide (Lee et al., 1989a). (iii) Tyr-92 in   RNase A substitutes for Trp-89 (Strydom et al., 1985); the   former is adjacent to Lys-91, which is fully protected from   amidination in the RNase A-PRI complex (Blackburn &   Gavilanes, 1982).
  The present studies indicate that oxidation of Trp-89 by   DMSO and HCl weakens the Ki value for binding by PRI   2.4-fold by increasing the dissociation rate of the derivativePRI complex (Table I).
This increase is significantly less   than that observed when any of the three active-site residues   of angiogenin are modified.
Still, the Ki value is greater than   that for the native angiogenin-PRI complex and, in light of   the previous work, suggests that Trp-89 is a contact residue,   although a less critical one than those at the active site.
In   the computed three-dimensional structure of angiogenin,   Trp-89 is close to and on the same face as the active site of   angiogenin (Palmer et al., 1986).
  Modification of lysine and arginine residues by reductive   methylation (6.2 residues) and by reaction with butanedione   (6.9 residues), respectively, weakens the interaction between   angiogenin and PRI (Table I) and suggests that these types   of residues are involved in the binding to PRI.
The dissociation   of the products of either reaction from PRI does not follow   first-order kinetics.
This is likely due in large part to heterogeneity of the modified species, generating heterogeneity of   dissociation rate constants.
With regard to the lysine residues,   the data presented indicate that Lys-40 is part of the contact   region but two residues not thought to be in the active site,   Lys-50 and Lys-60, are not.
Angiogenin has 13 arginines, most   of them in positions of nonconservative substitution in relation   to RNase A (Strydom et al., 1985), and it remains to be seen   which of these are involved in the interaction.
  Given the homology in the primary structures of angiogenin   and RNases (Strydom et al., 1985), the present results for the   interaction of PRI with angiogenin may bear upon that of PRI   with RNases in general.
It has been suggested that the binding   site of RNase A for PRI is extensive (Blackburn & Moore,   1982).
In the three-dimensional structure of RNase A, the   contact points can be grouped as follows: (A) Lys-7, Lys-41,   PRI to LYS-40.
  Lee and Vallee   Pro-42, Val-43, Lys-91, Tyr-92, Pro-93; (B) Lys-31, Lys-37;   (C) Lys-61 and adjacent residues.
Many of these residues are   identical or similar in angiogenin (Shapiro & Vallee, 1987).
  Of relevance here are the angiogenin counterparts of RNase   A Lys-41 (Lys-40), Tyr-92 (Trp-89), and Lys-61 (Lys-60).
  Comparison of the work on RNase A with the present results on angiogenin reveals several apparent differences.
(1)   Carboxymethylation of Lys-41 of RNase A weakens the interaction with PRI only 10-fold (Blackburn & Gavilanes,   1980), whereas substitution of Gln for Lys-40 of angiogenin,   a seemingly less drastic modification in terms of charge and   steric effects, weakens it 1300-fold. (2) Carboxymethylation   of His-12 and His-1 19 of RNase A strengthens the interaction   3-fold (Blackburn & Jailkhani, 1979; Blackburn & Gavilanes,   1980), whereas carboxymethylation of His-13 and His-1 14 of   angiogenin weakens it 15-fold.
(3) Lys-6 1 of RNase A is fully   protected from amidination by PRI (Blackburn & Gavilanes,   1982), whereas dinitrophenylation of Lys-60 of angiogenin does   not affect its interaction with PRI.
  With respect to the three residues discussed in (1) and (2),   we note that previous conclusions were based on experiments   that determined relative Ki values by examining the competition between RNase A derivatives modified at these residues   and unmodified RNase A for PRI at equilibrium (Blackburn   & Jailkhani, 1979; Blackburn & Gavilanes, 1980).
However,   in these experiments, the derivative was bound to PRI before   addition of RNase A, and the time required to reach equilibrium (up to several hours; Lee et al., 1989b) was likely   underestimated.
As a consequence, the effect of modification   on the strength of binding to PRI was probably underestimated   as well.
The present approach involves determination of both   the association and dissociation rate constants for the angiogenin derivative.
PR1 interaction.
Thus, attainment of   equilibrium is not necessary for determinations of Ki values.
  It remains to be seen whether the differences observed between   angiogenin and RNase A are solely due to the different   methodologies employed or to some inherent difference in their   modes of interaction with PRI.
  With respect to Lys-60 (3), we note that this residue is in   a region of the primary structure of the molecule which contains two deletions and other major changes in relation to the   primary structure of RNase A (Strydom et al., 1985).
  Therefore, in this instance, the two lysines (60 of angiogenin,   61 of RNase A) may differ in their placement in the threedimensional structure of the two proteins, and this may account, in part, for the apparent discrepancy.
Of interest here   is that an angiogenin/RNase A hybrid molecule, in which the   RNase A sequence Ser-59 to Tyr-73 substitutes for Glu-58   to Arg-70 in angiogenin, binds as tightly to PRI as does native   angiogenin (Harper & Vallee, 1989).
  Our studies indicate that PRI contacts a discrete region of   the angiogenin molecule, which may be smaller than that   suggested by Blackburn and co-workers for RNase A   (Blackburn & Moore, 1982), which minimally encompasses   Lys-40, His-13, His-1 14, and Trp-89.
The involvement of the   first three residues, all part of the active site of angiogenin,   indicates that PRI binds to that site.
The further elucidation   of the contact region of angiogenin and of its complement, Le.,   that of PRI, should provide the basis for the design of novel   angiogenin inhibitors based on PRI and be facilitated by our   recent cloning and sequencing of the PRI cDNA (Lee et a].,   1988).
