  E-mail: bent.jakobsen@avidex.com  Naturally selected T-cell receptors (TCRs) are characterised by low binding affinities, typically in the range  1  100 mM. Crystal structures of syngeneic TCRs bound  to peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)  antigens exhibit a conserved mode of binding characterised by a distinct diagonal binding geometry, with poor  shape complementarity (SC) between receptor and  ligand.
Here, we report the structures of three in vitro  affinity enhanced TCRs that recognise the pMHC tumour  epitope NY-ESO157  165 (SLLMWITQC).
These crystal  structures reveal that the docking mode for the high affinity TCRs is identical to that reported for the parental  wild-type TCR, with only subtle changes in the mutated  complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that form  contacts with pMHC; both CDR2 and CDR3 mutations  act synergistically to improve the overall affinity.
  Comparison of free and bound TCR structures for both  wild-type and a CDR3 mutant reveal an induced fit  mechanism arising from restructuring of CDR3 loops  which allows better peptide binding.
Overall, an  increased interface area, improved SC and additional  H-bonding interactions are observed, accounting for the  increase in affinity.
Most notably, there is a marked  increase in the SC for the central methionine and tryptophan peptide motif over the native TCR.
  Keywords: Biacore analysis/class I pMHC/crystal structure/  high affinity TCR  Introduction  The adaptive immune system employs two principally different defence mechanisms in response to pathogens.
Humoral  responses are characterised by the production of antibodies  that react with (usually) unprocessed antigens, mostly glycoproteins and polysaccharides.
Cell mediated immune  responses involve T-cell receptors (TCRs) that recognise proteolytic fragments from antigenic proteins in the context of  class I or class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  on target cells.
However, unlike antibodies, TCRs do not  undergo a process of somatic hypermutation and affinity  maturation that generate high affinity clonal populations.
  Rather, T-cells are subject to positive and negative selection  such that only those expressing TCRs with low affinities  (Kd  1  100 mM) for pMHC survive (van der Merwe and  Davis 2003).
Therefore, most naturally occurring T-cell  receptors display low affinities for their target molecules  (Davis et al., 1998; Willcox et al., 1999a).
  Each TCR is a hetero-dimer composed of either a and b  chains, or g and d chains.
The available TCR/pMHC  complex structures have provided an insight into the molecular details of MHC restriction and recognition by TCRs  (Rudolph et al., 2006).
Methods to produce soluble TCRs  (Willcox et al., 1999b; Boulter et al., 2003) combined with  phage display technology have recently enabled us to  produce high affinity versions of soluble human TCRs.
  These reagents may have broad applications as targeting molecules in biological assays and as therapeutics (Ashfield and  Jakobsen, 2006; Molloy et al., 2005).
  Both class I and class II MHC molecules are heterodimers with similar overall architecture composed of three  domains, one a-helix/ b-sheet (ab) superdomain that forms  the peptide binding site and two IgG-like domains.
In class I  MHC, the peptide binding site is constructed as a groove  formed by the a1 and a2 helices of the heavy chain.
Class I  MHC molecules usually bind peptides of 8  10 residues in  length (averaging 9 residues, termed P1 P9) in an extended  conformation with anchor residues buried into specificity  pockets, which vary from allele to allele (Rudolph et al.,  2006).
This binding mode leaves the central peptide side  chains available for interaction with the TCR.
Longer peptides are accommodated by extension at the C-terminus, or  by the bulging out of the binding groove (Stern and Wiley,  1994; Tynan et al., 2005).
Unlike class I MHC, the peptide  binding groove of class II MHC is formed from two noncovalently linked subunits of a and b-chains; the more open  peptide binding groove of class II MHC allows the accommodation of longer peptides.
  The comparison of previously reported TCR/pMHC  crystal structures reveals a flexible diagonal docking mechanism whereby the TCR crosses the long axis of the  MHC-peptide binding groove at an angle and with the Va  domain poised above the N-terminal half of the peptide  (Rudolph et al., 2006).
The complementarity determining  region (CDR) loops that form peptide contacts show a preference for centrally located peptide positions.
Comparisons of  crystal structures of free and bound TCR show that the  majority of CDR conformational changes are limited to the  hypervariable CDR3a or CDR3b loops.
However, in one  TCR (LC13) complex with MHC (TCR/MHC), both CDR3  loops as well as CDR1a and CDR2a, underwent conformational change (Kjer-Nielsen et al., 2003).
In this structure,  there is a large lateral shift of the LC13 TCR towards the  # The Author 2007.

  Interestingly, the mutation of P7 Tyr to Phe reduces affinity  by a factor of 10 suggesting that dominant interactions are  formed at this residue.
During docking, the buried surface  area ranges between 600 and 2000 A 2 and the majority of  this result from MHC contact with the TCR (Rudolph et al.,  2006).
The shape complementarity (SC), which is a measure  of geometrical match between protein interfaces, ranges from  0.41 to 0.75.
  The directed evolution of high affinity 1G4 TCR that  recognises NY-ESO-1157  165 peptide associated MHC, in the  context of human leukocyte antigen ( pHLA), has been  described previously (Li et al., 2005).
Although the structural  basis of TCR peptide specificity has been well documented  (Rudolph et al., 2006), it is difficult to extrapolate this data  to explain how high affinity is generated in the case of the  1G4 TCR.
We have solved the crystal structures of free and  bound 1G4 TCR with mutations in the CDR3 loops that  give moderate improvements in affinity and 1G4 TCR with  mutations in both CDR2 and CDR3 loops that give dramatic  improvements in affinity.
From these structures, it is apparent  that high affinity arises through an improved TCR/pMHC  surface complementarity resulting from the restructuring of  the CDR2/CDR3 loops around the peptide.
  Materials and methods  Molecular biology, expression and refolding  Peptide-HLA complexes were prepared as previously  described (Garboczi et al., 1992) by expressing  HLA-A*0201 heavy chain truncated at residue Pro-276 and  b-2 microglobulin separately in Escherichia coli in the form  of inclusion bodies, followed by in vitro refolding with synthetic peptide NY-ESO157  165 (SLLMWITQC).
pHLA for  Biacore analysis was prepared similarly, but with the HLA  fused to a biotinylation tag which was biotinylated in vitro  by BirA enzyme (OCallaghan et al., 1999).
  High affinity 1G4 TCR, which recognises HLA-A2  NY-ESO157  165, were generated using phage display as previously described (Li et al., 2005).
Plasmids containing the  target genes were expressed in BL21(DE3) E.coli cells in the  form of inclusion bodies and refolded to give soluble protein  as previously described (Boulter et al., 2003).
The protein  was buffer exchanged into 10 mM Hepes buffer pH7,  150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA for Biacore studies, or 10 mM  NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH8 for crystallisation.
  Binding analysis by BiacoreTM surface plasmon resonance  Binding analysis was performed on a BiacoreTM 3000  machine using CM-5 (research grade) chip and HBS  (Biacore) buffer.
Streptavidin was immobilized on all flow  cells using amine coupling to a level of .1000 RU  (response units).
Biotin tagged peptide-HLA ( pHLA) was  flowed over the streptavidin coated surface at a concentration  of 10 mg/ml until 150 RU pHLA was bound.
Control  surfaces were coated with non-binding pHLA-A2flu (influenza matrix peptide), pHLA-A2Tax (HTLV-1 tax11  19  peptide) or were left simply coated with streptavidin.
  Equilibrium binding was carried out on low affinity  mutants by injecting 1  200 mM concentration of TCR over  the chip as previously described (Li et al., 2005).
Kinetic  binding data were generated using the KINJECT program to  inject 10 100 nM TCR over the flow cells at 50 ml/min.
  Data were collected for at least 1 h and kinetic constants  were derived using the curve-fitting facility of the  BIAevaluation program (version 3.0, Biacore) that deploys  the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm.
Rate equations were  derived from the simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model  (A  B  AB).
Other curve fitting was performed in Origin  version 3 (MicroCal).
  Crystallisation and data collection  1G4 TCR/HLA-A2 NY-ESO157  165 complexes were mixed  at a 1:1 mole ratio (10 mg/ml final protein concentration) and  purified by SEC (S75 HR column) into 10 mM NaCl,  10 mM Tris pH8.
Crystals were grown using the hanging  drop method at 188C using Hampton Screen Cryo Buffer 41  (85 mM Na HEPES buffer pH7.5, 8.5% iso-propanol, 17%  PEG 4000, 15% glycerol).
After optimisation of initial crystallisation conditions, crystals appeared as thin plates.
  Single crystals of the different samples, measuring up to  200  200  100 mm, were mounted in thin nylon loops and  cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen.
Samples were irradiated at  SRS Stations 14.1 or 14.2 (Daresbury laboratory,  Warrington, UK).
Each crystal was set in a random orientation and a complete data set collected on an ADSC Q4  CCD detector, with the rotation method, at an exposure rate  of 30 to 90 s per 18 rotation.
Diffraction maximum resolution  ranged between 1.9A and 2.4A .
The relevant statistics are  included in Table II. MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992) was used to  estimate structure factor intensities, SCALA (Evans, 1993)  for merging and reducing the data sets to the unique indices,  and TRUNCATE (French and Wilson, 1978) for producing  amplitudes and other statistics (CCP4 program suite; CCP4  1994).
  Structure solution and refinement  The structures were solved with molecular replacement  methods using AMoRe (Navaza, 2001) or MOLREP (Vagin  and Teplyakov, 1997).
The search probe was taken from PDB  entry 2F53, the model of NYEc49c50.
Satisfactory solutions  were subjected to rigid-body refinement, followed by rounds  of restrained positional and thermal parameters refinement  with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997), and model adjustment in graphics sessions using O (Jones et al., 1991) or  COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004).
The resulting models  had average geometrical deviations from ideal values within  the expected range.
Completion of the structural analysis was  performed with the CCP4 suite.
Figures were made with  PYMOL (Delano, 2002).
  PDB submission  The refined models have been submitted to the RCSB  Protein Data Bank under accession codes 2P5E, 2P5W,  2PYE and 2PYF, respectively.
  Results  Biacore binding analysis  Kinetic analysis of all high affinity 1G4 TCR mutants  showed that the improved affinity results mainly from a  M.Sami et al.  398   at University of Georgia on July 9, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from decreased off-rate (Table I).
This is exemplified by the  highest affinity mutant c58c61 (KD  48 pM) which, containing a combination of alpha and beta CDR2/CDR3 mutations,  produced a 4800-fold decreased off-rate compared with the  wild-type TCR.
In contrast, the on-rate appears to have  increased moderately by 143-fold for this mutant.
  The c58c62 mutant was designed to retain most of the  CDR loop mutations from high affinity c58c61, apart from  its CDR2b loop, which was identical to the c49c50 mutant  (Table I).
The resultant c58c62 mutant displays a decreased  off-rate of 4000 and extended T1/2 values of 450 min compared with wild-type TCR (Table I).
  The mutation of CDR2 (c49c50) loops alone results in  550 fold decreased off-rate and a moderate (45) fold  increase in on-rate, suggesting that the improved affinity of  c49c50 mutant results mainly from a decreased off-rate.
  Overall, the improvement in affinity gained by the mutant  TCRs correlated well with improved half-lives of the mutant  complexes.
The highest affinity mutant TCR showed a  4500-fold improvement in T1/2 values.
  To investigate the role of TrpP5 as proposed contact hot  spot, we have made a c58c61 and wild-type 1G4 TCR with  the point mutation Y31Da.
Introduction of this mutation,  designed to knock-out p stacking interactions, caused a dramatic reduction in affinity in both TCRs.
The affinity of  wild-type Y31Da clone was reduced by nearly 10-fold and  hence was below the levels of accurate measurement by  Biacore.
The mutant protein c58 (Y31Da)/c61 showed 3.8   105 fold drop in affinity, thus demonstrating the importance  of this contact (Table I).
  X-ray structural analysis  The crystallographic analysis produced well-behaved models,  with deviations from ideal values of bond lengths and angles  within the expected range (Table II).
The general features of  the fold were well preserved across all the models.

  Crystal structures of high affinity human T-cell receptors  399   at University of Georgia on July 9, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Differences were concentrated at the CDR2/CDR3 mutation  sites.
Superposition statistics are included in supplementary  materials.
  As discovered earlier, the mutant TCR/pMHC complexes  had different interface geometries from those found in the  higher resolution model of the wild-type complex, 2BNR  (Chen et al., 2005).
However, the lower resolution model,  2F54 (Dunn et al., 2006), had two copies in the asymmetric  unit, one with interface geometry similar to that of 2BNR  and the other much closer to that of the c49c50 mutant,  2F53 (Dunn et al., 2006).
This observation was also true in  the case of the c5c1 (2PYE), c58c61 (2P5E) and c58c62  (2P5W) mutant models.
Figure 1A shows a multiple superposition of all the mutants onto the coordinates of wt-AV2,  the copy of the wild-type complex in 2F54 with the closest  interface geometry.
Previous studies of TCR-pMHC complexes compared the superposition based on the coordinates  of the MHC a1/a2 domain, the groove which binds the  peptide (Dunn et al., 2006), but in this work, the superposition was based on the coordinates of the peptide, to avoid the  variable geometries mentioned above.
Figure 1B shows the  multiple superposition of the peptide from all the mutant  complexes onto the co-ordinates of wt-AV2.
The wellmatched superposition of peptides suggests that this binding  surface remains invariant across the mutants.
  Calculations of interface areas between the TCR and  pMHC parts of the complex were completed with the Protein  Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies server at the EBI (http://  www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html).
Bearing in  mind that the interface geometry should be compared with  wt-AV2, the interface area increases significantly when  mutations occur simultaneously in both CDR2 and CDR3  (Table III).
The energy of interaction across CDR2/3-pMHC  interfaces may be quantified through approximations that  exclude solvent molecules from calculations, since solvent  molecules could not be located in the relatively low resolution (2.7 A    ) of the wt-AV2 model.
This space was eventually  filled by the mutant side chains.
  The calculated SC index (Lawrence and Colman, 1993),  listed in Table IV, showed three notable trends associated  with higher affinity: (i) rising SC index of TCR/pMHC;  (ii) rising SC index of TCR/peptide; (iii) rising SC index of  TCR/M4W5 peptide motif.
It is likely that these trends act  cooperatively and produce the substantial increase in the  measured affinity.
The overall SC index between the surfaces  of pMHC and TCR at the interface increased in all cases,  from 0.71 to 0.77 and correlates well with the increased  affinity.
It should be noted that this increase was discernable  only when CDR2a/b loops, or CDR3a/b loops, were  mutated.
Likewise, the SC index of TCR/pMHC in all  Fig. 1. (A) A domain-based multiple alignment of all the mutant models (c5c1, c58c61 and c58c62) onto wt-AV2.

  M.Sami et al.  400   at University of Georgia on July 9, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from mutant TCRs was found to increase compared with the wildtype native protein but appears to be indifferent to the type  of mutation.
The SC index between TCR/peptide did not  change dramatically and remained between 0.83 and 0.84  irrespective of the mutation.
Only minor changes occurred  for CDR3 mutations alone (c5c1), or CDR2 mutations alone  (c49c50).
However, when both CDR2 and CDR3 loops were  mutated, as in the case of c58c61, or c58c62, the SC index  increased to 0.87, suggesting an improved TCR/peptide  contact has been made.
The SC index for the TCR/M4W5  peptide motif followed a similar trend and appeared to  increase exclusively in the combined CDR2/CDR3 mutants,  thus suggesting that an improved contact has been made.
  Comparison of the CDR3 loops  The effect of the CDR3 mutations can be traced systematically via comparisons of the free wild-type (2BNU) and c5c1  mutant TCRs, free c5c1 mutant TCR and its complex with  pMHC, c49c50 (CDR2 only) mutant complex (2F53) and  c5c1 (CDR3 only) mutant complex, and the combined  c58c61 and c58c62 (CDR2/CDR3) mutant complexes.
The  CDR3a loops of the TCR show significant conformational  flexibility as seen in unbound and bound c5c1 (Fig. 2), and  bound wild-type and c58c61 (Fig. 3).
  Comparison between free and bound c5c1 TCR structures  clearly shows binding with an induced fit mechanism.
The  insertion of the central M4W5 core peptide into the large  CDR3a arc opens it up significantly, such that the aromatic  ring of Tyr100a can engage with a reoriented Leu94b  (mutated from Val) and complete a lock around the M4W5  motif (Fig. 2).
A much more dramatic movement occurs at  Asp97a at the apex of the large arc, which curls upward and  outward, making a side chain contact with Thr99a via ionic  contacts.
While the interaction between Asp97a and Thr99a  could be stable in a solution of free c5c1 TCR, the crystal  packing might have forced it to adopt an elongated form.
  In contrast, the side chain of Tyr100a does not appear to  move significantly upon complex formation, this therefore  requires a longer side chain in CDR3b to reach across and  complete this locking action, hence the mutation of  Val94Leu allows an improved contact.
The remaining point  mutations in the CDR3a loop, Leu94a and Leu95a, appear  to be unfavourable in the free TCR as they are accessible to  the solvent; however, when the complex is formed they  make favourable approaches to Ser51a in CDR2a and  Ala30a in CDR1athereby enhancing the stability of the new  conformation (not shown).
  Figure 3 shows unambiguously how the CDR3 (c58c61)  mutations can be separated and their effect can be made  cooperative.
The agreement between wild type and c58c61 in  the CDR3a loops is about the same for the common atoms,  at an rmsd of 0.8 A    .
However, the new side chain atoms in  c58c61 stabilise the CDR3 loops by forming a lock around  core peptide M4W5 motif during MHC binding, as observed  for c5c1.
These mutations emphasise the rigid nature of the  c58c61 mutant conformation, unlike the flexible loops  observed in the wild-type TCR (Fig. 3).
Figure 4 shows  clearly that all CDR3 mutants (c5c1, c58c61 and c58c62)  adopt very closely the same rigid CDR3 lock.
Together  with the calculated SC index data, the CDR2/CDR3 a/b  combinations appear to be a perfect match for the peptide  M4W5 motif.
  Discussion  This is the first definitive report describing the structureaffinity correlation of high affinity human TCR/ pMHC complexes obtained by the in vitro mutation of CDR loops.
The  key findings from the present data suggest that the characteristic diagonal docking of high affinity 1G4 TCR remains  unaffected and two key peptide residues (MetP4 and TrpP5)  on the pMHC form the predominant contact (hot spot) with  the mutated CDR3 loops.
This hypothesis was tested by  designing Y31Da knock-out wild-type and c58c61 mutants,  i.e. designed to remove the p ring stacking contacts between  CDR1/3a loops and peptide TrpP5 residue observed in all  wild-type and mutant structures.
The dramatic reduction of  binding confirmed our hypothesis that this interaction is  essential and invariant in both wild type and high affinity  TCR/pMHC complexes.
Further supporting evidence for this  was obtained from peptide mutation studies that removed  specific CDR3 loop contacts with MetP4 and TrpP5 residues;  the Ala substitution of MetP4 or TrpP5 residues was found  to abolish binding to all mutants and wild-type TCRs (data  not shown).
  To date, there is no reported structural data of high affinity  TCRs for direct comparison with the present study since most  naturally selected TCRs have low affinities (1100 mM);  therefore, a structural comparison was made with high affinity  Fab/pHLA A1:MAGE-1 (Hulsmeyer et al., 2004).
  Affinity-matured Fab-Hayb3 have indicated that burial of  increasing amount of apolar surfaces, in particular at the interface periphery, and improved SC are the key structural  elements that contribute to high affinity.
The crystal structure  of Fab/pHLA A1:MAGE-1 suggest that it may be possible to  have side-on or asymmetric docking modes of receptor molecules.

  Crystal structures of high affinity human T-cell receptors  401   at University of Georgia on July 9, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from SerP8 points into the solvent and ProP4 and ThrP5 appear to  be less exposed.
Although the Fab/HLA A1 binding interface  SC values are similar to those of the 1G4 TCR complexes, at  around 0.700.75, the peptide on its own is poorly matched  to the Fab and gives reduced SC values around 0.480.60  (Table IV).
In contrast, the corresponding residues (ProP4 and  ThrP5) appear to be well matched to the Fab with SC values  around 0.720.92.
This indicates that the Fab/peptide binding  is sub-optimal, only extending to part of the peptide.
Since  there is more affinity to the HLA A1 helices than the peptide,  there is an increased possibility of cross-reactivity with other  HLAs.
  We have solved the crystal structure of another in vitro  affinity enhanced TCR which binds to human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1(HTLV-1) tax11  19 peptide.
Like the high  affinity 1G4 described in this paper, this high affinity TCR  bound pMHC in a very similar geometry compared to its  wild type parent molecule (J.M.Boulter, personal communication).
In this case, the high affinity mutant was generated  by a subtle opening of the CDR3b loop to form a tight  Fig. 2.

  This altered conformation of TyrP5 in the high affinity  mutant complex relieves steric interactions observed in the  native wild-type complex structure reported earlier (Garboczi  et al., 1996).
We propose that improved CDR3 loop/peptide  contacts are a general structural feature of high affinity  TCRs.
  Previously, we have proposed that improved contacts at  the pMHC interface may alone account for improved affinity  (Dunn et al., 2006).
The present study suggests that dramatic  affinity gain arises via a combination of improved interactions (H-bonds, ionic associations), increased interface  area and increased SC.
