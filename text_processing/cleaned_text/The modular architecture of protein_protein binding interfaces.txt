Fersht, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom, and approved November 12, 2004 (received for review October 1, 2004)  Proteinprotein interactions are essential for life.
Yet, our understanding of the general principles governing binding is not complete.
In the present study, we show that the interface between  proteins is built in a modular fashion; each module is comprised of  a number of closely interacting residues, with few interactions  between the modules.
The boundaries between modules are  defined by clustering the contact map of the interface.
We show  that mutations in one module do not affect residues located in a  neighboring module.
As a result, the structural and energetic  consequences of the deletion of entire modules are surprisingly  small.
To the contrary, within their module, mutations cause  complex energetic and structural consequences.
Experimentally,  this phenomenon is shown on the interaction between TEM1--  lactamase and -lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) by using multiple-mutant analysis and x-ray crystallography.
Replacing an entire module of five interface residues with Ala created a large cavity  in the interface, with no effect on the detailed structure of the  remaining interface.
The modular architecture of binding sites,  which resembles human engineering design, greatly simplifies the  design of new protein interactions and provides a feasible view of  how these interactions evolved.
  cluster analysis  binding energy  proteinprotein interaction  structure  The evolution of proteinprotein binding sites is a result of  optimization with three boundary conditions: the definition  of the complex structure, optimization of the binding affinity for  a given task, and the generation of specificity.
Thermodynamic,  kinetic, and structural studies of proteinprotein interactions  have taught us much of how proteins interact rapidly, tightly, and  in a specific manner.
These results have been translated into the  development of in silico tools to calculate binding free energies,  to weigh the energetic consequence of mutations, and for protein  design (14).
However, from the modest degree of success of the  aforementioned methods, it is clear that our understanding of  proteinprotein interactions is still lacking (5).
  The most popular approach for studying the energetic contribution of an amino acid to the free energy of binding (or  stability) of proteins is to introduce a mutation and then measure  the subsequent change in free energy (6).
However, accurate  interpretation of the results of such experiments is limited by the  fact that the properties of a protein are a function of the entire  system, and not necessarily the sum of its parts (7).
As a result,  the energetic impact of any given residue on binding is not a  simple additive quantity (8). A more elaborate approach to study  the contributions of amino acids to binding and stability involves  the use of double and higher-order mutant cycles, where interactions between amino acids are treated within their native  contexts (7, 9).
Such cycles reveal whether the contributions  from a pair of residues are additive, or whether the effects of  mutations are coupled (10, 11).
  Chakrabarti and Janin (12) have shown that small recognition  sites between proteins (2,000 2) are comprised of a single  continuous patch, whereas large interfaces may be divided into  several patches (with a distance threshold of 13  between  patches).
In the present study we further divide the interface  based on the biochemical interactions made between all residues,  as derived from the structure of the complex.
We show that  proteinprotein binding sites have a modular architecture made  up of clusters of residues with both strong intracluster connections and weak intercluster connections.
The network of noncovalent interactions within or between proteins was defined  based on an atomic distance threshold and the chemical properties of the involved groups.
The networks obtained resemble  small world-like features, which have been used to identify key  residues in proteins, as well as the native conformations from  nonnative decoys (1316).
As a model system, we use the  interface between TEM1--lactamase (TEM1) and its protein  inhibitor, -lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP).
The structures  of the complex (17) and of the unbound proteins (18, 19) have  been determined to high resolution.
The affinity of this interaction is in the nM range, with an association rate constant of  3  105 M1s1 and a dissociation rate constant of 3  104  s1, values which are commonly found for many proteinprotein  interactions (20).
By means of cluster analysis, we divide the  TEM1BLIP interface into five clusters.
Extensive multiplemutant analysis of two of these clusters indicated that residue  clusters are energetically independent of each other but have a  high degree of cooperativity within each cluster.
We further  demonstrated that the deletion of a whole cluster of residues has  no impact on the structure of the interface, whereas single  mutations within a given cluster may lead to structural rearrangement of their cluster.
  Materials and Methods  Protein Expression and Purification.
Mutagenesis, expression  and purification of TEM1 and BLIP were undertaken as described (20).
  Kinetic Measurements.
Kinetic constants were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection by using a BIAcore  3000 (Uppsala) and a Laboratory SPR System (Proteoptics,  Haifa, Israel).
The Proteon F is a prototype biosensor that  measures proteinprotein interactions in a 6  6 format in real  time yielding results of a quality similar to the BIAcore.
Measurements were done in HBS (10 mM Hepes3.4 mM EDTA  150 mM NaCl0.05% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) at 25C (20).
For  all measurements, TEM1 was immobilized to the sensor chip,  and BLIP was the analyte, applied at six different protein  concentrations.
Binding curves were evaluated by using a simple  one-to-one kinetic model.
The change in free energy (GKA)  upon mutation was calculated from GKA  RTln[(KA  mut)  (KA  WT)], with KA values being determined in two ways, the first  (for interactions of kon  5  106 M1s1 and koff  0.2 s1)  being the ratio of the kinetic constants (KA  koffkon), and the  This paper was submitted directly (Track II) to the PNAS office.

Single crystals of both  complexes were obtained by the microbatch method under oil by  using the IMPAX 15 robot (Douglas Instruments, East Garston, Hungerford, Berkshire, U.K.).
The proteins were crystallized at a concentration of 12 mgml.

Atomic refinement  was carried out with the program CNS (21).
The atomic coordinates of TEM-WT,BLIP (F142A) and of KFYEY multiple  mutant complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank  (PDB ID codes 1S0W and 1XXM, respectively).
  Clustering.
Interactions between residues are defined by using the  CSU software package (22) (http:bip.weizmann.ac.iloca-bin  lpccsu).
Given a specific proteins structure as input, the software  produces a list of interatomic interactions and their distance.
The  CSU program further divides the atoms involved into categories,  based on their biochemical properties.
We considered only those  interactions that fall within a predefined threshold and chemistry  (Table 3, which is published as supporting information on the  PNAS web site).
Different thresholds gave a less clear yet similar  picture of clusters.
Two residues are defined as interacting if  their atoms are interacting.
Only sequence-specific interactions  are counted; backbonebackbone interactions were not included, because they are not sequence-specific.
We assigned a  weight of 1 to atomic backboneside chain interactions, and a  weight of 2 for sidechainsidechain interactions.
The weight of  any given interaction is defined by the sum of the (weighted)  atomic interactions.
We can thus define the network, or weighted  graph, of interactions as G  (V,E,W), where V, the set of  vertices (or nodes) is defined as the residues in the interface; E,  the edges, constitute the set of interactions (both inter- and  intrachain interactions); and the weight function W gives each  edge its weight, as defined above.
  For clustering, we used the superparamagnetic clustering tool,  SPC 3.3.13 (23, 24) which was previously used to cluster gene  expression networks.
The input to SPC is a distance matrix  representation of the network.
The order of separation of the  nodes is summarized in a dendogram.
SPC further calculates the  stability parameter for each possible residue set, represented by  its branch length (Fig. 1B).
  Results  The TEM1BLIP Interface as a Cluster Aggregate.
Traditionally, the  interface of proteinprotein interactions is described and analyzed as a network of interactions between residues of proteins  A and B. In the present study, we used standard clustering  techniques to separate the network into binding units or clusters.
  The bond definitions, along with the clustering tool, were  specified in Materials and Methods.
We define a cluster as  including at least three residues that form a continuous network.
  The clusters are semiindependent of one another, having a  maximum of a single weak edge connecting them.
The contact  map of the interface, indicating the five clusters, is shown in Fig.  1A.
The width of each edge relates to the interaction weight  whereas the length is arbitrary.
Clusters were extracted according to the stability parameters, calculated by the SPC (Fig. 1B).
  Using the same color scheme, the five clusters are superimposed  on the binding surfaces of TEM1 and BLIP (Fig. 1C).
A  magnification of the two clusters, which were experimentally  analyzed, is shown in Fig. 1D.
  Free Energy Relationships Within and Between Clusters.
To determine inter and intracluster relations of mutations on the free  energy of binding, most combinations of residues located in  clusters C1 and C2 were analyzed.
C1 includes BLIP D49 and the  four TEM1 residues S130, S235, R243, and K234.
C2 includes  three BLIP residues (K74, F142, and Y143) and four TEM1  residues (Y105, E104, and N170) (Gly and Ala are ignored  because their side chains cannot be deleted by mutation).
The  two clusters are adjacent to one another, with four water  molecules being located between them (Fig. 1D).
Mutant proteins (to Ala) were prepared to include the single mutations, as  well as the double and multiple mutations of all residues located  on each of the two clusters.
The effects of mutations on the free  energy of binding, from a single mutation located on one of the  proteins and up to the deletion of whole clusters, were measured  by means of surface plasmon resonance.
GKA(ma) values for all  combinations of TEM1BLIP mutants of C2, and of mutations  of residues located both in C1 and C2, are given in Table 1.
  GKA values for mutations involving only C1 are taken from  Albeck et al. (8).  Interactions Within a Cluster Are Nonadditive.
The additivity of G  of multiple mutations was determined by plotting the experimentally determined changes in free energy (G) versus the  sum of G values of the individual mutations.
Analyzing the  additivity of mutations of residues located within one cluster on  both TEM1 and BLIP (Fig. 2A) shows that most combinations  of mutations are subadditive.
In other words, the sum of  G values of the individual mutations is much larger than the  value measured for the multiple mutant.
This effect was demonstrated at its extreme when an entire cluster was mutated to  Ala. Summing up the loss of free energy of binding of the  five single mutants of C2 [BLIP(K74A,F142A,Y143A) and  TEM1(E104A,Y105A)] yields a value of 31.1 kJmol.
This  number is composed of an additive loss of 25.3 kJmol for the  three BLIP mutants, and 5.8 kJmol for the two TEM1 mutants.
  (The mutation N170A on TEM1 had no effect on binding in all  combinations tested, and therefore was ignored).
The G of  the triple BLIP mutant was found to be 16.3 kJmol, and that of  the double-TEM1 mutant, 4.3 kJmol. Removing all five residues simultaneously (by mutation to Ala) resulted in a loss of  only 10.1 kJmol of binding free energy.
Even the single BLIP  mutation K74A destabilized the complex to a greater extent than  the multiple C2 mutant KFYEY (Table 1).
The same phenomenon was detected for C1.
Here, the additive loss in binding  energy was found to be 28 kJmol, of which 7.5 kJmol came  from the BLIP (D49A) mutant, and 20.5 kJmol, from the sum  58  www.pnas.orgcgidoi10.1073pnas.0407280102 Reichmann et al.of the four single TEM1 mutants.
Mutating the whole C1 cluster  to Ala reduced the free energy of binding by only 7.1 kJmol.
  The Binding Energies of C1 and C2 Are Additive with Respect to One  Another.
What is the energy relationship between residues located on two independent clusters that are structurally adjacent?  Are they independent binding units, in which case mutations will  be additive, or is the interface a continuum? To answer this  question, we determined the additivity of intercluster mutants  (Fig. 2B).
In stark contrast to the intracluster mutations, all 23  tested combinations of intercluster mutations were additive.
  These measurements were between five different TEM1 mutant  proteins in C1 [the three single mutations S130A, K234A,  and R243A; and the two multiple mutations (K243AFig. 1. Cluster analysis of the TEM1BLIP interface.
The interactions between residues located within the interface were extracted by using the CSU package  (22) [for parameters, see Table 3; clustered with the SPC 3.3.13 tool (23)].
The interface was divided into five clusters of interactions, shown in A as a connectivity  map, with the dendogram given in B, where the final nodes are the residues.
A minimum of three residues is needed to form a cluster.

  Although the clusters are in close structural proximity, they are  energetically independent (Figs. 1 C and D and 2B).
In other  words, mutations in C1 do not affect residue in C2, and vice  versa.
  In a third set of experiments, the additivity of multiple  mutations located on one protein and within the same cluster  was measured and compared with the sum of the individual  mutations (Fig. 2C).
In this case, the degree of additivity  obtained is between those shown in Fig. 2 A and B. In other  words, mutations located on the same protein and within the  same cluster are more additive than mutations mapped to one  cluster but located on both proteins forming the complex, and  less additive than mutations located on two separate clusters.
  Effects of Mutations on the Structure of the Binding Site.
To better  understand the complex energetic relationships between mutations located within the same cluster, relative to the simple  additivity of mutations located on different clusters, we determined two mutant structures: that of the single BLIP mutant  F142A (in C2) in complex with WT TEM, and that of the  multiple KFYEY mutant where, in essence, cluster 2 is completely eliminated.
Fig. 3A shows the TEM1BLIP binding  interface of the KFYEY mutant structure, overlaid on the WT  complex interface.
The two structures are basically identical,  except for the deletion of the five mutated side-chains. [All-atom  rms deviation (rmsd) between the interfaces of the WT versus  the KFYEY structures is 0.37 .] The deletion of C2 results in  the creation of a large hole within the interface (Fig. 3B).
  Interestingly, this hole is not filled with structural water, and the  residues surrounding the hole maintain the same structure as in  the wild type.
  The structure of the single mutant F142A of BLIP (located at  the center of C2) reveals a more complex picture (Fig. 3C).
This  structure shows a number of local perturbations around the  mutated F142A residue.
For example, TEM1 Y105 flips away  from its place in C2 and takes on a new role as part of C4.
  Secondly, small but significant movements of both K74(BLIP)  and E104(TEM1) result in an unraveling of this important salt  bridge.
The distance between these two residues is increased  from 2.68  in the WT proteins to 4.45  in the F142A mutant  (Fig. 3C).
Overall, the whole organization of C2 seems to be  affected by the F142A mutation.
Analyzing this mutant structure  in comparison with the unbound TEM1 and BLIP structures (18,  19) provides interesting insights into the cause of the observed  structural movements.
The conformation of Y105 of TEM1 in  the mutant complex is similar to that found in unbound protein  (Fig. 3C).
Moreover, both E104 of TEM1 and K74 of BLIP move  outwards in the unbound structures, similar to what is seen in the  F142A mutant structure.
Thus, the F142A mutant structure  seems to suggest that the energetic importance of F142 in  stabilizing the complex is related to its role in structuring C2.
The  structure of the complex of TEM-WT with BLIP (F142A)  provides a logical explanation for the chaotic energetic picture  of this mutant, which is very much dependent on its environment  (Table 1).
For example, G of F142A alone is 8.8 kJmol, but  G of the double mutant BLIP(F142A),TEM(Y105A) is only  2.9 kJmol.
Furthermore, the G of the triple BLIP mutant  (F142A,E104A,Y105A) binding TEM-WT is only 6.3 kJmol (in  comparison with an additive value of 14.7 kJmol for the three  mutations independently).
  Discussion  In the present study we demonstrate that a proteinprotein  interface is built in a modular fashion.
Each cluster of residues  represents a module that can be removed or changed with  retention of the quaternary structure, and with a relatively small  loss in affinity.
An interface cluster is herein defined as a group  of amino acids that is mainly interconnected (i.e., very few  connections are made with residues outside the cluster).
The  cluster map is produced by clustering the bond information  obtained from interatomic contacts, as defined by distance and  chemical composition.
  Five such clusters were identified for the TEM1BLIP complex.
Of these, two proximate clusters, C1 and C2, were thoroughly tested for inter- and intracluster relationships.
Our results  clearly showed intracluster cooperativity, as well as intercluster  additivity.
Subadditivity for intracluster mutations was found to  be more pronounced when the probed residues are located on  different proteins, and weaker (although significant) when they  are on the same protein (compare Fig. 2 A with C).
Yet, with  respect to binding, the existence of partial nonadditivity between  residues on the same protein strongly suggests that amino acids  within a cluster are organized in a cooperative manner.
  The method most commonly used to analyze the contribution  of residues toward the stability of a proteinprotein complex  involves evaluating the loss in free energy of binding upon  mutation (6).
However, this method is not without problems,  because the loss in the measured free energy of binding caused  Fig. 2.

  60  www.pnas.orgcgidoi10.1073pnas.0407280102 Reichmann et al.by single mutations in C1 and C2 equals, or even exceeds, that  of removing the entire cluster.
The sum of the loss in free energy  of all of the single mutations within a cluster exceeds by far (up  to 4-fold) the loss in free energy generated when all of the  residues of the cluster are mutated simultaneously.
Comparing  the structure of the BLIP(F142A) mutant binding TEM1-WT  with the structure of the C2 deletion mutant KFYEY provides  some interesting insights into this phenomenon.
The single  mutation causes a structural relaxation within its cluster whereas,  in the KFYEY mutant structure, a large hole is created in place  of the original residues, but no underlying structural changes are  noted. It seems, therefore, that the energetic effect of many  single mutations is larger than their net contribution, due to a  penalty paid by leaving the rest of the cluster behind.
Once the  entire cluster is mutated, the change in binding free energy is  related to the simple lack of those interactions.
  Based on our results, can any generalizations be made concerning the cluster composition of a binding site?
The cluster  composition of four additional protein complexes with diverse  affinities [from 2 M for the CheAChey complex (25) to  nanomolar for both the human growth hormonereceptor and  Ranimportin- complexes (26, 27) and 0.01 pM affinity measured for barnasebarstar (28)] is presented in Fig. 4.
The cluster  composition of the two nM affinity binding complexes resembles  that of TEM1BLIP (Fig. 1), with the binding site being composed of a number of medium-sized clusters.
The weak interaction between CheA and Chey is characterized by relatively few  contacts between the two proteins, with only one medium-sized  developed cluster.
On the other side of the spectrum of affinities,  we have barnase-barstar.

  Reichmann et al. PNAS  January 4, 2005  vol. 102  no. 1  61  BIOCHEMISTRYonly two clusters, it is obvious that at least the larger of the two  is a highly developed cluster that forms a very elaborate network  of interactions.
Thus, the degree of connectivity is much higher  in this interface, compared with those of the other four complexes analyzed.
This result is intriguing and suggests that the  extent of connectivity, rather than the size of the interface, is the  driving force behind tight binding.
A proteinprotein binding site  is not just a conglomerate of proximate residues forming interactions; rather, it has a high degree of internal organization.
This  organization may be necessary if the two proteins are to bind to  each other in an aqueous solution.
Indeed, computerized docking simulations have shown multiple binding solutions that bury  at least as much surface compared with that measured for the  real complex, but dont generate binding (2933).
Thus, binding  seems to be a result of higher organization of the binding sites,  and not just of surface complementarity.
  So why arent all interfaces organized as tightly as barnase and  barstar?
The answer may be found in the inherent difficulty of  maintaining this high level of organization, which requires a  constant, strong driving force.
The case of barnase-barstar is  indeed unique, as the penalty for not having a tight binding  barstar inhibitor is instant death of the bacteria (resulting from  the RNase activity of barnase) (34).
With such strong pressure,  a very highly ordered binding site can be maintained.
On the  other hand, the construction of a binding site from a number of  well-organized clusters is a much easier solution to provide  cooperativity on one hand, but without the need to simultaneously organize the structure of the entire interface.
An  interface architecture that is modular in nature facilitates the  adaptation of proteins to evolutionary pressure, because only  small units rather than whole binding sites have to change, to  modulate specificity or binding affinity.
A modular architecture  provides the underlying flexibility necessary if different protein  partners are to be bound to one another with high specificity at  overlapping binding sites, as is indeed observed.
  The loss in free energy of binding caused by deleting C1 and  C2 is 7.1 and 10.1 kJmol, respectively, which constitutes 36% of  the free energy of the entire TEM1BLIP complex (47.5 kJ  mol).
With the energetics of clusters being additive, it will be  interesting to see to what extent the other three interface clusters  contribute to TEM1BLIP binding.
These data will provide  corroboration of the entropic cost of the complex formation,  which is estimated from theoretical considerations to be 60  kJmol (35).
Thus, the cluster view not only explains the  evolution of high affinity and specificity but also may be used to  simplify energy calculations and to create interface design.
  We thank Dr. Kay Gottschalk and Dr. Tal Peleg-Shulman for their  critical comments and help, Renne Abramovich for her assistance in the  purification of some of the proteins, the Israel Structural Proteomics  Center (ISPC) for doing the crystallization and solving the structures,  and the staff of Proteoptics for their collaboration.
