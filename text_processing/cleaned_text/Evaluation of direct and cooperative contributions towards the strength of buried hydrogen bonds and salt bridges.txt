Evaluation of Direct and Cooperative Contributions  Towards the Strength of Buried Hydrogen Bonds and  Salt Bridges  Shira Albeck1  , Ron Unger2 and Gideon Schreiber1  *  1  Department of Biological  Chemistry, Weizmann Institute  of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel  2  Department of Life Sciences  Bar Ilan University, Ramat  Gan 52900, Israel  An experimental approach to evaluate the net binding free energy of buried hydrogen bonds and salt bridges is presented.
The approach, which  involves a modied multiple-mutant cycle protocol, was applied to  selected interactions between TEM-1-b-lactamase and its protein inhibitor,  BLIP.
The selected interactions (two salt bridges and two hydrogen  bonds) all involving BLIP-D49, dene a distinct binding unit.
The penta  mutant, where all side-chains constructing the binding unit were mutated  to Ala, was used as a reference state to which combinations of sidechains were introduced.
At rst, pairs of interacting residues were added  allowing the determination of interaction energies in the absence of  neighbors, using double mutant cycles.
Addition of neighboring residues  allowed the evaluation of their cooperative effects on the interaction.
The  two isolated salt bridges were either neutral or repulsive whereas the  two hydrogen bonds contribute 0.3 kcal mol1 each.
Conversely, a  double mutant cycle analysis of these interactions in their native environment showed that they all stabilize the complex by 1-1.5 kcal mol1  .
  Examination of the effects of neighboring residues on each of the interactions revealed that the formation of a salt bridge triad, which involves  two connected salt bridges, had a strong cooperative effect on stabilizing  the complex independent of the presence or absence of additional neighbors.
These results demonstrate the importance of forming net-works of  buried salt bridges.
We present theoretical electrostatic calculations which  predict the observed mode of cooperativity, and suggest that the cooperative networking effect results from the favorable contribution of the  protein to the interaction.
Furthermore, a good correlation between calculated and experimentally determined interaction energies for the two salt  bridges, and to a lesser extent for the two hydrogen bonds, is shown.
  The data analysis was performed on values of Gz  Kd which reect  the strength of short range interactions, while G  KD values which  include the effects of long range electrostatic forces that alter specically  Gz  ka were treated separately.

The availability of protein  structures in their complexed and unbound forms,  has created a wealth of structural knowledge on  the determinants of protein-protein interactions  (summarized by Conte et al., 1999; Jones &  Thornton, 1996).
The energetics of these interactions arise from favorable intermolecular interactions including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic  and van der Waals interactions and ion pairing.
  However, it is difcult to invoke any generalization about the relative importance of each of these  terms because their relative contributions to binding vary (Stites, 1997).

Biol. (2000) 298, 503520  0022-2836/00/03050318 $35.00/0 # 2000 Academic PressThe currently popular approach to study the  energetic contribution of an amino acid towards  stability or binding of proteins is by mutating it  and monitoring the change in the protein properties.
However, the interpretation of such experiments is severely limited by the fact that the  properties of a protein are a function of the entire  system, and not necessarily the sum of its parts.
As  a result, the energetic importance of a particular  residue to binding cannot be explained by a physical analysis of the binding site.
A powerful experimental and theoretical approach to study proteinprotein interactions uses double and higher-order  mutant cycles, where interactions between amino  acids are treated within their native context  (Ackers & Smith, 1985; Carter et al., 1984; Horovitz,  1987).
Such cycles reveal whether the contributions  from a pair of residues are additive or whether the  effects of mutations are coupled (Horovitz &  Fersht, 1990; Serrano et al., 1990).
However, even  interaction energies derived from double mutant  cycles include, in addition to their direct interaction  energy, effects due to neighboring residues and  solvent (Fersht et al., 1992; Horovitz et al., 1990).
  The complexity in the analysis of pair-wise interaction energies derived from double mutant cycles  is demonstrated in the analysis of the barnase-barstar binding site (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995), where  residues separated by up to 7 A were shown to  interact.
This distance is too large to result solely  from direct bond formation.
Moreover, the magnitude of the interaction energy varies even for the  same type of interaction resulting in a poor relation  between structural data and energies deduced by  double mutant cycles.
The argument that indirect  interactions contribute to the interaction energy is  demonstrated by the multiple mutant cycle analysis of Glu73 on barnase (Schreiber et al., 1997).
  Glu73 is located in the active site pocket of barnase  and is surrounded by a number of positively  charged residues which interact with barstar.
  While Glu73 contributes to the stability of barnase,  it was less expected to contribute signicantly to  the binding of barstar, since the only potential residue on barstar close enough for binding is Asp39.
  A multiple double mutant cycle analysis of this site  suggested that neighboring residues were the  cause of the measured interaction energy between  Glu73 and Asp39.
The evaluation of third position  effects on the surface of proteins was further  demonstrated for the salt bridge triad Asp8,  Arg110 and Asp12 on the surface of barnase.
Multiple thermodynamic cycles were used to show  that the strength of each salt bridge was reduced  by 0.77 kcal mol1 in the absence of the other salt  bridge (Horovitz et al., 1990).
These studies show  that interaction energies cannot be reduced to a  sum of pairwise interactions due to their cooperative nature.
Therefore, instead of analyzing individual interactions, one should look at binding  units, composed of the interacting residues and  their neighbors.
  This study is intended to decipher the binding  energy of a binding unit, buried within the interface of two proteins, into its components.
Namely,  the net energetic contribution of individual interactions and the indirect cooperative effects of  neighboring residues.
Data analysis was performed  separately on the measured kd and ka values to distinguish between short range interactions which  stabilize the complex and which dictate Gz  kd  ,  and long-range electrostatic interactions which  dictate Gz  ka  .
Pairwise, ternary and higher order  coupling energies were calculated as described by  Horovitz & Fersht (1992).
The experimental  approach utilized double mutant cycles, where the  bond energy of an isolated interaction was determined for a pair of residues in the absence of its  neighbors.
This was done by mutating all the residues in the unit except for the interacting pair and  constructing a double mutant cycle using  Gz  kd  values.
Second order effects were evaluated  by selectively adding residues one by one and constructing higher order mutant cycles.
In a similar  manner the computational analysis, utilizing the  continuum electrostatic approach, allowed the  determination of the electrostatic contribution of a  specic bond towards protein stability and probed  parameters which are difcult to examine experimentally.
This experimental and computational  analysis of a single binding unit is described here  for a binding domain located in the periphery  of the binding interface of the complex between  TEM-1 b-lactamase and its protein inhibitor, BLIP.
  In this binding unit Asp49 on BLIP forms four  interactions with four conserved residues lining the  active site pocket of TEM; two hydrogen bonds  with S235 and S130, respectively, and two salt  bridges with R243 and K234, respectively  (Figure 1).
Single mutations of each of these residues alter the stability of the complex by up to  2 kcal mol  1 (Albeck & Schreiber, 1999).
The availability of the crystal structure of the TEM-BLIP  complex (Strynadka et al., 1996) on one hand, and  the multiple nature of this particular site on the  other, make it ideal for measuring the direct and  cooperative contributions towards the interaction  energy.
  Results  The interaction between two proteins A and B to  form the complex AB is typically described by a  three-state energy prole which includes an  encounter complex A:B, and a transition state.
  According to transition state theory, the kinetic  rate constants describe the formation of the transition state.
For the formation of the TEM-BLIP  complex, it has been shown that the relation  between the association rate constant, ka, the  dissociation rate constant, kd and the equilibrium  dissociation constant KD follows equation (1)  (Albeck & Schreiber, 1999):  504 Direct and Cooperative Contributions to BindingKD  kd  ka  1  Therefore, ka is proportional to the energy to form  the transition state starting from the unbound proteins, whereas kd is proportional to the energy to  form the transition state starting from the complex  (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999; Selzer & Schreiber,  1999).
The transition state energy is related to the  kinetic constants according to:  Gz  k  RT ln hk  RT 2  were h is the Plank constant and k is either the  association or dissociation rate constants.
While  values of Gz  k are problematic in denition  (especially ka, which is a second order rate constant), the change in Gz  k upon mutation, Gz  k is  a good measure of the change in transition state  energy upon mutation:  Gz  k  RT ln kmut  kwt 3  For systems which obey equation (1), the change in  free energy upon mutation (G  KD ) can be related  to the kinetic rate constants according to:  G  KD  Gz  ka  Gz  kd 4  Thus, the free energy contribution of a specic residue towards complex stability can be divided into  its contribution to the rate constants of association  and dissociation.
The rate of association is dictated  primarily by long range electrostatic interactions  which stabilize the encounter complex.
The  encounter complex can be described in structural  terms as a collection of states where the binding  sites of the two proteins are already pre-oriented  but still separated by a layer of water (Schreiber &  Fersht, 1996; Selzer & Schreiber, 1999; Gabdoulline  & Wade, 1999; Vijayakumar et al., 1998).
Short  range interactions seem to be unimportant in stabilizing the encounter complex.
On the other hand,  they directly affect the dissociation rate constant  which is a function of the strength of all the noncovalent interactions between the two proteins and  the contribution of solvation.
Therefore, the physical interpretation of the contribution of a sidechain towards afnity can be understood better if  Gz  ka and Gz  kd are treated separately.
  Trends in the binding kinetics of the  TEM-BLIP complex  Association kinetics  At ambient pH, both TEM-1 and BLIP carry a  net negative charge of 7e and 2e, respectively.
  Therefore, the association kinetics for the formation  of the TEM-BLIP complex is highly sensitive to  changes in the charge of one of the proteins  (Table 1, Figure 2(a)): mutation of any one of the  Ser residues on TEM (singly or doubly) has little  effect on the association rate.
However, removal of  a positively charged residue reduces the association rate constant by an average factor of 3 and  removal of an additional positive charge reduces it  by an order of magnitude.
Truncation of the negatively charged BLIP-D49 side-chain, eliminates  most of the negative potential on the TEM binding  surface of BLIP, thus removing most of the repulsive forces between the two proteins (Albeck &  Schreiber, 1999).
The observed association rate constants can be directly related to the perturbation in  the electrostatic eld between the two proteins  (Selzer & Schreiber, 1999).
Figure 3 shows the  relation between the Coulombic energy of interaction between the proteins and the measured  rates of association.
The Coulombic energy is  highly sensitive to the removal of a positively  charged TEM residue (causing a large repulsion).
  This effect is additive, so that removal of two positively charged residues doubles the repulsive Coulombic energy.
However, mutation of BLIP-D49  nullies the repulsive forces between the two proteins in such a way that mutation of the selected  positively charged residues of TEM, no longer  effect the electrostatic interaction energy. Since the  rates of association are directly proportional to the  electrostatic free energy at the encounter complex,  values of lnka are almost constant once BLIP-D49 is  removed (Figure 3).
  Dissociation kinetics  There is no general explanation for the observed  distribution of the dissociation rate constants of the  different mutants (Table 1, Figure 2(b)).
Since the  Figure 1.
Structure of the TEM-BLIP complex  (Strynadka et al., 1996) showing the ve residues constructing the binding unit which was used in the present  analysis.
BLIP-D49 forms two salt bridges with TEM  residues R243 and K234 and two hydrogen bonds with  TEM residues S235 and S130 (all designated with broken lines).
The Figure was made using Swiss-PDB  Viewer (Guex & Peitsch, 1997).
  Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Binding 505dissociation rate constant is a measure of the sum  of the contributions of all of the short-range interactions, it is not surprising that elimination of  BLIP-D49, causes an increase of over an order of  magnitude in the dissociation rate constant, as this  mutation causes the disruption of all four interactions with TEM-wt.
However, simple rules cannot explain the individual contributions to binding  of the TEM residues interacting with BLIP-D49.
  The results presented here will address this issue.
  An important observation is that the tetra-TEM  mutant (S130A, S235A, K234A, R243A) has the  same dissociation rate constant with either BLIP-wt  or BLIP-D49A.
This suggests that the side-chain of  BLIP-D49 interacts solely with these four TEM residues and vice versa (as seen in the crystal structure).
This allows us to treat this binding site as an  individual binding unit for our analysis.
  Cooperativity in the binding domain  Experimental results  The energy term which best reects the energetic  contribution of a particular residue towards stabilization of the complex is Gz  kd  .
Summing up the  individual Gz  kd values measured for the four  TEM single mutations (S130A, S235A, K234A and  R243A), Gz  kd  , equals 3.2 kcal mol  1 (Table 1).
  Conversely, mutating BLIP-D49 to Ala reduces  Gz  kd by only 2 kcal mol1  .
Moreover, removal of  the entire site by mutating all ve residues simultaneously to Ala (KSSR  D49 in Table 1), results  in a loss of binding energy of 1.6 kcal mol1  .
Thus,  the sum of the free energy contributions of the  individual mutations is much larger than the contribution of the binding site as a whole.
This extra  stabilization is due to cooperativity between the  residues which is disrupted upon a single  mutation.
This is one of the reasons why comparing the binding energy of a wild-type protein with  that of a mutant in which a side-chain has been  truncated often gives an apparent binding energy  which is greater than the incremental binding  energy attributable to that side-chain.
  A more advanced approach to dissect the total  binding free energy within a binding site into its  components, is to evaluate the interaction e?nergy  between pairs of residues using double mutant  cycles.
An effective interaction between two residues is characterized by a coupling energy  GKDint which denes the experimental measure  of binding strength between two residues.
Similarly, Gz  kdint denes the energetic contribution  of a bond between a pair of residues towards  stabilization of the complex.
Values of GKDint  and Gz  kdint are presented in Table 2.
While for  the two hydrogen bonds (S235-D49 and S130-D49)  the values of GKDint and Gz  kdint are similar,  the values differ signicantly for the two salt  bridges (R243-D49 and K234-D49).
This discrepancy results from the large contribution of the  charged but not polar residues to ka.
Summing up  the interaction free energies, Gz  kdint, for each of  the four interactions in the wild-type proteins gives  Table 1.

In the following sections, higher order  mutant cycles will be used to decipher the energy  into its direct and indirect contributions.
  Determination of the energetic contribution of  the individual bonds  In order to evaluate the direct energetic contribution of a specic bond towards complex stability, emphasis was made on isolating the effect of  the selected pair of residues in the absence, or  selective presence of its neighbors.
This novel  approach is summarized in Figure 4 for the interaction R243-D49.
In Figure 4(a) all the side-chains  in this domain were mutated to Ala, except for the  two interacting residues BLIP-D49 and TEM-R243.
  The interaction energy for this pair of residues,  Gz  kdint(I  j), was calculated from the following  double mutant cycle:  Gz  kdintI  j  Gz  kd  I; j; 0; 0; 0   Gz  kd  0; 0; 0; 0; 0   Gz  kd  0; j; 0; 0; 0   Gz  kd  I; 0; 0; 0; 0   0:38 kcal mol1  For simplicity we have designated a single letter  for each residue in Gz  kd  I; j; k; l; m:  Figure 2.

The value of Gz  kdint  I  j in the absence of the  other three residues is 0.38 kcal mol  1 (Table 2  and Figure 5, a negative sign indicates that the two  residues repel each other).
In a similar manner  Gz  kdint was calculated for the other three interactions with BLIP-D49 by the following double  mutant cycles:  Gz  kdintI  k  Gz  kd  I; 0; k; 0; 0   Gz  kd  0; 0; 0; 0; 0   Gz  kd  0; 0; k; 0; 0   Gz  kd  I; 0; 0; 0; 0   0:02 kcal mol1  Gz  kdintI  l  Gz  kd  I; 0; 0; l; 0   Gz  kd  0; 0; 0; 0; 0   Gz  kd  0; 0; 0; l; 0   Gz  kd  I; 0; 0; 0; 0   0:33 kcal mol1  Gz  kdintI  m  Gz  kd  I; 0; 0; 0; m   Gz  kd  0; 0; 0; 0; 0   Gz  kd  0; 0; 0; 0; m   Gz  kd  I; 0; 0; 0; 0   0:28 kcal mol1  Figure 5 illustrates the Gz  kdint values obtained  for each of the four interactions between BLIP-D49  and the isolated TEM residues compared to the  values obtained in their native environment.
The  two isolated hydrogen bonds between the individual Ser residue and D49 contribute about 0.3 kcal  mol1 each.
On the other hand the two isolated  salt bridges are energetically either neutral or  unfavorable.
  Evaluation of the cooperative effect of  neighboring residues  The cooperative contributions of neighboring  residues towards a given pairwise interaction were  evaluated by adding residues to the site and  measuring their effect.
In Figure 4(b) this is illustrated for the R243-D49 interaction in the presence  of K234.
Gz  kdint(I  j, [k]), is a measure of this  interaction and is calculated from the following  mutant cycle:  Figure 3.

  Gz  kdint values were determined for each of the  four interactions in the presence of a third neighboring residue from which Gz  kdint values were  determined (Table 2, rows 5-10).
Because of the  symmetry of the triple mutant box, equivalent  expressions are obtained for the effect of residue  K234 on R243-D49 and R243 on K234-D49.
Therefore, this manipulation yields for the four interactions only six different Gz  kdint terms which  are a measure of the cooperativity between the  three respective residues.
The highest cooperativity  (0.86 kcal mol1  ) is observed for the two salt  bridges and the lowest, negative cooperativity, for  the double hydrogen bonds with the two Ser residues (0.26 kcal mol1  ).
  Addition of a fourth residue to the site  (Figure 4(c)) will allow the evaluation of its added  effect on the interaction (Table 2, rows 11-14).
  Thus, for example, Gz  kdint(I  j, [k, l]), the interaction energy between R243-D49 in the presence of  both K234 and S235 is given by:  Figure 4.

  Addition of the fth residue (Figure 1), allows  the determination of the respective interaction  energy in the presence of all the neighboring residues (KSSR in Table 2, and Figure 5) and equals to  the Gz  kdint obtained from a standard double  mutant cycle analysis.
Thus, for example,  Gz  kdint(I  j, [k,l,m]), the interaction energy  between R243-D49 in the presence of all its neighbors is given by:  Gz  kdintI  j; k; l; m  Gz  kd  I; j; k; l; m   Gz  kd  0; 0; k; l; m   Gz  kd  0; j; k; l; m   Gz  kd  I; 0; k; l; m   1:36 kcal mol1  Note that this energy includes the direct binding  energy of the R243-D49 interaction (-0.38 kcal  mol1  ) and all the indirect contribution of its  neighbors.
In this case the entire binding energy  results from cooperative effects.
Figure 6 illustrates  the cooperative effects on each of the four TEMBLIP interactions by the remaining three amino  acids.
  Calculated results  The detailed experimental analysis shown above  calls for a theoretical analysis of the forces participating in these interactions.
A major obstacle in  performing calculations of values of G  KD using  the crystal structure of the wild-type complex is  the assumption that the structures of the mutant  proteins are similar to that of the wild-type.
In  order to validate this assumption, we performed  an energy minimization calculation of each of the  side-chains of the interacting residues upon  mutation of one of the residues.
Only small movements were observed for the side-chains of all the  mutants.
All the following calculations were performed either on the experimentally determined  crystal structure of the wild-type proteins, with the  mutations introduced by deleting the relevant  side-chains, or on a minimized mutant structure.
  No large deviations were found between the  two sets of calculations.
Therefore, only the  data obtained from the wild-type crystal structure  derived mutants will be presented.
To resolve  the concern of possible structural alterations  caused by mutations we are (in collaboration with  Dr Strynadka) in the process of solving the structures of some of the more interesting mutations.
  Solvent accessible surface area (SASA)  The correspondence between solvent-accessible  surfaces and thermodynamic quantities such as  enthalpies, entropies and heat capacities of solvation has promoted many investigators to explore  the connection between the two.
SASA was calculated for the wild-type complex, for each of its  mutants and for the unbound proteins and their  corresponding mutants using the known crystal  structure of the complex (Strynadka et al., 1996)  (the single proteins and mutant structures were  derived from this structure).
SASA is the difference between the calculated SASA of the complexed proteins and that of the free proteins while  SASA is the difference in SASA upon  mutation.
Figure 7(a) shows a very poor correlation between the calculated SASA values and  the experimental Gz  kd values.
The direct use of  surface areas to approximate the extent of all these  surface interactions does not consider geometric  considerations and their complicated energetic  implications.
The two polar interactions and two  salt bridges in this domain strongly rely on the correct orientation of the residues.
Therefore, exposure  of surface area is not enough to describe the energetic contribution of the various residues.
  Electrostatic energy calculations  Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, which are  exclusively found in this binding domain, can be  described by an electrostatic treatment.
We have  therefore, used continuum electrostatic methods to  calculate the effect of specic electrostatic interactions on the stability of the complex.
All calculations took advantage of the known X-ray crystal  structure of the TEM-BLIP complex.
Employing  nite-difference numerical methods to solve the  Poisson-Boltzmann equation using the Delphi computer program package (Molecular Simulations,  Inc.), the electrostatic contribution of bonds to complex stability was calculated.
Two methods of calculation were employed.
One, where the total  electrostatic energy difference between the complexed proteins and their free states was calculated  (U) for the wild-type proteins and for each of  the mutants from which U was derived  (Table 1).
In the second method, a thermodynamic  cycle allowed the electrostatic effect of an interaction on the complex stability to be dissected into  direct and indirect contributions within the protein  Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Binding 511to understand better the competing effects acting  on the protein complex stability (Hendsch & Tidor,  1994, 1999).
  Figure 7(b) shows that there is no correlation  between Gz  kd  and U. This emphasizes the  need to relate to pair-wise interactions and not to  changes in the system properties that result from  mutation.
Therefore, the calculated U values  were used to construct double mutant cycles from  which Uint values were obtained for each of the  four TEM interactions with BLIP-D49 in the  absence and selective presence of the different  neighboring residues.
These values are a measure  of the electrostatic contribution of a specic interaction towards the total electrostatic free energy  and are summarized in Table 3.
The relations  between Uint and Gz  kdint values for each of  the four interactions in the absence and selective  presence of neighbors are shown in Figure 8.
While  weak correlations were observed for the two  hydrogen bonds (Figure 8(a) and (b), correlation  coefcients of 0.60 and 0.62, respectively), the data  for the two salt bridges are linearly correlated  (Figure 8(c) and (d), without the stray point associated with the S235A mutation, correlation coef-  cients of 0.92 and 0.97, respectively, were  obtained).
Hence, the two salt bridges are stabilized primarily by electrostatic interactions.
Moreover, the cooperative nature of the two salt bridges  could be predicted from electrostatic considerations.
  Dissecting the electrostatic energy into contributions from solvent (Usol), the bond itself  (Ubon) and the effect of the protein on the interaction (Uprot) using the method introduced by  Hendsch & Tidor (1994, 1999), has the advantage  that it probes parameters that are difcult to examine experimentally.
On the other hand, the electrostatic contribution of an interaction towards  stability, Utot, calculated as the sum of these individual direct and indirect contributions, gives an  apparent value.
This results from the fact that only  the effect of the side-chain is calculated (see  Materials and Methods).
Therefore, unlike the  Uint calculations, changes in the interfacial  dielectric due to mutation are not accounted for.
  Despite this fact, values of Utot correlate well  with Uint and give similar correlations with  Gz  kdint (as for Uint in Figure 8).
Results of the  above calculated contributions for each of the four  interactions are summarized in Table 3.
For the  wild-type proteins (KSSR in Table 3), all of the  interactions except for S235-D49 are characterized  by a signicant negative Ubon term ranging  between 4 and 14 kcal mol1  . Usol and Ubon  are opposite in sign and the latter is usually smaller in magnitude.
Therefore, the electrostatic stabilization of the interaction requires a substantial  favorable Uprot term.
This term reects the stabilization of an interaction by its neighbors and in  other words it exemplies the electrostatic cooperativity between the residues.
Table 3 shows that this  term is the most sensitive to the mutation of neighboring residues.
The Uprot term for each of the  salt bridges is signicantly favorable for the double  salt bridge, providing an electrostatic explanation  for the experimental observation.
  Discussion  Evaluation of the energetic contributions of  hydrogen bonds and salt bridges towards both  protein and complex stability is a difcult task  both experimentally and theoretically.
Standard  mutagenesis experiments usually probe, to a greater or lesser extent, several physical contributions to  Figure 6.
The cooperative effect  of neighboring residues demonstrated by plotting Gz  kdint values  as a function of the residues present in the site for each TEM-BLIP  interaction.
Starting from the isolated interaction on the left, the site  was reconstructed to obtain KSSR,  which is the wild-type protein.
  512 Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Bindingstability at the same time making it difcult to  obtain the net contribution of a specic bond.
Here  we combine an experimental and a computational  approach to quantitatively evaluate non-covalent  interactions using a modied multiple mutant  cycle approach.
Our model system is a distinct  binding domain in the TEM-BLIP complex which  contains four interactions between side-chains of  residues lining the active site pocket of TEM and a  single BLIP residue, Asp49.
This binding site is  located at the periphery of the interaction interface  making it a pseudo-independent binding unit.
  Taking advantage of its solitude positioning, we  examined the two buried salt bridges and two  hydrogen bonds formed, and the cooperative contributions of the environment on the strength of  these interactions.
  The standard method for analyzing binding  energies is either by monitoring perturbations  caused by mutations, or by a more advanced protocol using double-mutant cycles.
The coupling  energy, GKDint, which is obtained by the latter,  is an experimental measure of binding strength  between two residues.
However, even this energy  includes, in addition to the direct interaction  energy, effects due to neighboring residues and  due to desolvation (Fersht et al., 1992; Horovitz &  Fersht, 1990).
  Here we reversed the double-mutant cycle method by changing the reference state of the system to  one where all involved residues are Ala, namely,  the complex of the tetra-mutant of TEM  (S130A,S235A,K234A,R243A) interacting with  BLIP-D49A.
This approach was introduced by  Horovitz & Fersht (1992) for measuring changes in  synergy during refolding of barnase using a cube  of mutant cycles.
Here we extended this approach  to construct a penta-mutant cycle which analyzes a  binding unit as a whole.
Most of the analysis utilized measured values of Gz  kd for the determination of Gz  kdint.
This excludes contributions of  long range electrostatic interactions which inuence the association process, but are not relevant to  the short range net bond energy between the two  residues.
The distinct contribution of charged residues towards the rate of association (and thus to  the afnity) was analyzed separately (Figure 3).
In  order to estimate the net strength of the isolated  pairwise interactions without the indirect effect of  neighboring residues, we constructed double  mutant cycles between each of the four pairs of  interacting residues (BLIP-D49 with either S130,  S235, K234 or R243 on TEM) with the remaining  three residues mutated to Ala. Using measured  Gz  kd values, the resulting energy term, Gz  kdint,  is a direct measure of the energetic contribution of  a specic interaction towards stabilization of the  complex.
Second order effects, such as cooperativity, which can contribute to the stabilization of the  interaction, were determined by selectively adding  neighboring residues and constructing higher  order mutant cycles.
  The two isolated salt bridges D49-K234 and D49-  R243 (in the absence of S130,S235,R243 and  S130,K234,S235, respectively) are good examples of  buried salt bridges as they are 93 % solvent inaccessible.
Both do not contribute to complex stability.
In fact the residues R243 and D49 repel each  other with a negative Gz  kdint value of 0.38 kcal  mol1  .
Neutral or negative contributions of salt  bridges to protein stability have been speculated,  but not shown experimentally.
These results are  consistent with octanol partitioning experiments on  a model system which showed that salt bridges are  energetically neutral in terms of protein stabilization (Wimley et al., 1996).
The destabilization due  to each separate salt bridge which we observed for  TEM-BLIP was suggested by Hendsch & Tidor  (1994) who performed electrostatic continuum calculation which indicated that buried, as opposed  to exposed, salt bridges usually destabilize proteins  with respect to mutation to hydrophobic isosteric  residues or Ala. This is a direct consequence of the  fact that ionic groups are thermodynamically more  stable when immersed in a high dielectric medium  such as water than when embedded in a lower  Figure 7.

  Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Binding 513dielectric medium such as that of the protein  matrix.
According to these theoretical calculations  the H31-D70 salt bridge in T4 lysozyme (75 % burial) destabilizes the protein by 3.5 kcal mol1  ,  while a solvent-exposed salt bridge (37 % burial)  such as E22-K35 of uteroglobin was calculated to  stabilize the protein by just over 1 kcal mol1  .
  Accordingly, Honig & Hubbel (1984) estimated  that the free energy cost of forming an ion pair in a  medium with a dielectric constant of 10, would be  about 5 kcal mol1  .
Conversely to calculations,  experimental measurements of the strength of buried salt bridges show consistently positive interaction energies between the residues involved.
For  example the buried I16-D194 salt bridge in chymotrypsin was determined by pKa shift to contribute  2.9 kcal mol  1 (Fersht, 1971, 1972).
Dahlquist and  co-workers have studied the H31-D70 salt bridge  in T4 lysozyme also by pKa shift and concluded  that it contributes 3-5 kcal mol1 toward the stability of the protein (Anderson et al., 1990).
These  experiments, as opposed to ours, measure the stability of the salt bridge relative to one or more  charged hydrogen bonds or relative to a neutral  hydrogen bond while our measurements and calculations measure the stability relative to Ala,  which for buried salt bridges is a preferred reference state.
The double-mutant cycle approach also  yielded positive contributions for salt bridges.
For  example the buried D14-R17 salt bridge in l  repressor was shown by double mutant cycle to  contribute 0.8 kcal mol  1 (Marqusee & Sauer, 1994)  and the buried salt bridges R31-E36 and R40-E36  in Arc repressor were shown to contribute 1.7 and  4.7 kcal mol  1  , respectively (Waldburger et al.,  1995).
Furthermore, GKDint values for a number  of salt bridges within the interface of barnase-barstar were shown to be in the range of 1.6-6 kcal  mol  1 (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995).
Even the interaction between two negatively charged residues  within the interface of barnase and barstar (E73-  D39) was shown to stabilize the complex by  2.9 kcal mol1  .
The main difference between these  cited studies and those presented here, is that the  negative contributions for D49-R243 and D49-K234  were measured in the absence of neighboring residues.
The interaction energy (Gz  kdint) between  BLIP-D49 and either K234 or R243 on TEM within  the context of the binding site (in the presence of  all their neighbors) are 1.0 and 1.4 kcal mol1  ,  respectively, which is in good agreement with the  other published results.
  Addition of a third residue to the site and construction of a triple mutant cycle allowed the determination of the cooperative effect between the  three selected residues.
Positive cooperativity  accounts for the enhanced stabilization of an interaction in the presence of the added residue.
The  strongest cooperative effect is observed for the salt  bridge triad (two salt links involving three residues) R243, K234 and D49 with a cooperative  value of 0.86 kcal mol1  .
This stabilization is quite  impressive considering the negative energetic contribution of each salt bridge alone.
Interestingly,  the cooperativity between the salt bridge triad  R110-D8-D12 located on the surface of barnase  showed a similar positive cooperativity of 0.77 kcal  mol  1 (Horovitz et al., 1990).
Statistical analyses  have shown that 37 % of ion pairs in protein crystal  structures occur as charge networks (Barlow &  Thornton, 1983; Musaa et al., 1995).
Networking  of salt bridges is suggested to be one of the mechanisms for increasing the thermostability of proteins (Elcock & McCammon, 1999; Perutz & Raidt,  1975; Vetriani et al., 1998; Yip et al., 1995).
  Examining the cooperativity exerted by the  addition of K234 to the R243-D49 interaction in the  presence of both Ser residues gives a value of  Figure 8.

  b KSSR, the wild-type protein where all four TEM residues are present.0.81 kcal mol1  , which is similar to the value  obtained in the absence of the Ser residues  (0.86 kcal mol1  ).
This implies that the cooperativity of the triad is not dependent on other, noncharged residues located in the vicinity.
This also  strengthens the notion that structural rearrangement is minor.
  Positive cooperativity for the D49-R243 interaction, though much lower, is exerted also by each  of the two Ser residues.
Addition of a single Ser  residue stabilizes the R243-D49 interaction by an  average of 0.3 kcal mol1  .
In a similar manner, the  addition of S235 to the double salt bridge with  R243 and K234 also contributes about the same  value.
Similar values for the positive cooperativity  between a salt bridge and hydrogen bond was  observed for the D14-R17-S77 interactions in l  repressor where each of the interactions is stabilized by 0.3 kcal mol1 in the presence of the other  interaction (Marqusee & Sauer, 1994).
Adding up  all the cooperative contributions participating in  the R243-D49 and K234-D49 interactions in TEMBLIP, one gets 1.46 and 0.95 kcal mol1  , respectively, which are close to the values of Gz  kdint for  the wild-type proteins (1.36 and 1.06 kcal mol1  ,  respectively).
Thus, for the two salt bridges most  of the interaction energy is attributed to additive  cooperative effects.
  To further understand the basis of the cooperative nature of the two salt bridges we related the  experimental results with calculated energy terms.
  The interactions between these residues are electrostatic in nature as no correlation between buried  surface area and binding energies was found  (Figure 7(a)).
The electrostatic contribution towards  the free energy for complex formation was calculated from which the contribution of the specic  interactions towards the total electrostatic energy  Uint was derived.
The same scheme was used  for the calculations as was used for the experimental analysis as well as the same reference state.
  Namely, Uint was rst determined by a double  mutant cycle for the isolated pair of interacting  residues and subsequently for the pair in the presence of its neighbors allowing higher order cooperative effects to be detected (note that for  interaction energies deduced from double mutant  cycles using either experimental or computational  data, a positive value indicates attraction).
Despite  the large difference in absolute values between the  calculated and measured data, a good correlation  was observed for the two salt bridges between the  experimentally determined values of Gz  kdint and  calculated values of Uint (Figure 8).
  The values of Uint for the double salt bridge  are more favorable than for the single salt bridges  (5.6 for the double salt-bridge versus 3.9 kcal mol1  for R243-D49 and 13.1 for the double salt-bridge  versus 11.4 kcal mol1 for K234-D49).
This suggests  that the observed cooperative effects are electrostatic in nature.
In order to understand the basis  for electrostatic cooperativity we employed the  continuum electrostatic approach of Hendsch and  Tidor which allows the total electrostatic energy of  an interaction to be dissected into the indirect contributions from solvent (Usol), the rest of the protein (Uprot) and the direct effect of the bond itself,  (Ubon).
This analysis showed that stabilization of  the salt bridge network between D49, K234 and  R243 results primarily from a relatively favorable  Uprot term for the double salt bridge compared to  the single one (7 for the double salt-bridge versus  6 kcal mol1 for R243-D49 and 2.9 for the double  salt-bridge versus 2.9 kcal mol1 for the K234-D49  interaction, Table 3).
This results from the presence  of charged residues on the surface that reduce the  repulsion between the two proteins.
Hence, this  electrostatic description provides an explanation  for the experimental observations.
Networking of  salt bridges to other polar and charged groups was  suggested to be a strategy for stabilizing the 434  repressor where the R10-E35 buried salt bridge  was calculated to stabilize the protein by 0.4 kcal  mol1 despite a very high solvation term.
This is  due to the presence of K7 which co-interacts with  E35 resulting in favorable Ubon and Uprot terms  (Hendsch & Tidor, 1994).
  In contrast to the charged residues, the two buried hydrogen bonds (D49-S130 and D49-S235) are  favorable (Gz  kdint0.3 kcal mol1 each) even in  the absence of all neighboring residues (in  S235A,K234A,R243A and S235A,K234A,R243A  backgrounds, respectively).
Values for Gz  kdint in  a wild-type background were measured to be 0.9  and 1.5 kcal mol1  , respectively.
These values are  in the range of the suggested net stabilization of  hydrogen bonds reported in the literature (0.5-  2.0 kcal mol  1  ) (Fernandez-Recio et al., 1999;  Fersht, 1987; Freier et al., 1986; Goldman et al.,  1997; Myers & Pace, 1996; Schreiber & Fersht, 1995;  Shirley et al., 1992; Yamagata et al., 1998;  Creighton, 1991).
Recent theoretical studies, however, have drawn the opposite conclusion arguing  that mutational studies of one member of a hydrogen bonding pair leaves the protein with an unsatised buried polar residue (Honig & Yang, 1995;  Lazaridis et al., 1995; Sippl et al., 1996).
The  interpretation of the cooperative effects of neighbors on the two hydrogen bonds is more complex.
  For both hydrogen bonds R243, but not K234, had  a positive cooperative effect of about 0.3 kcal  mol1  .
On the other hand, the presence of the  second hydrogen bond had an adverse effect on  the strength of binding of the probed hydrogen  bond of about 0.3 kcal mol1  .
If one adds to the  binding energy all the cooperative effects of the  participating neighbors, one does not account for  the interaction energy, suggesting more complex  phenomena and higher orders of cooperativity.
  Furthermore, the electrostatic calculations failed to  explain the experimental results which is clear  from the weak correlation between Uint and  Gz  kdint for the two hydrogen bonds in Figure 8.
  The reason for our difculty in accounting for the  effects of the two hydrogen bonds may stem from  the fact that they are very sensitive to the angle  516 Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Bindingand distance between the residues, while chargecharge interactions are less so.
  Stabilization of an interaction by the presence of  a third residue can also result from structural cooperativity, where formation of an interaction  between a pair of residues helps orient one of the  side-chains involved in the second interaction,  thereby reducing the entropic cost and making the  second interaction more favorable.
While electrostatic cooperativity can explain the stabilization of  the salt bridge triad, we suggest that structural  cooperativity may account for some of the extra  stabilization of the hydrogen bonds by their neighbors.
Structural cooperativity is especially important for hydrogen bonds which rely on the correct  positioning of its interacting residues.
Fixation of a  residue, by an interaction, in an unfavorable orientation for a second interaction can cause the  adverse effect which may explain the large negative cooperativity between the double hydrogen  bonds.
S235 may be involved in structural cooperativity which may account for the unexplainable  destabilization of the complex in the absence of  S235 (Figure 2(b), and the relatively high value of  Gz  kd  in Table 1), and of the other interactions as  well (relatively low values of Gz  kdint for  R243,K234,S130 in Table 2).
Furthermore, the salt  bridge triad cooperativity is lost upon mutation of  S235 (0.13 kcal mol1  ), which does not occur upon  mutation of S130 (0.97 kcal mol1  ).
Destabilization  of the complex with S235A is not accounted for in  the calculated results: U for S235A is almost 0  (Table 1), and values of Uint and Ubon for  R243,K234,S130 in Table 3 are not unusual.
This  discrepancy between experimental and calculated  results is the reason for the stray points in Figure 8.
  While the experimental data account for any type  of cooperativity, the calculated data reect only  electrostatic effects.
This is further supported by  the fact that while the experimental results suggest  a positive contribution for the S235-D49 interaction, electrostatic calculations indicate that the  S235-D49 interaction is unfavorable (Uint is  about 0 with or without neighboring residues and  values of Ubon for all the interactions are negative  with values ranging between 4 and 14 kcal  mol1  , whereas for the S235-D49 interaction the  value is close to zero, Table 3).
Structural relaxation may account for some of these observations.
  Therefore, structural studies are necessary to determine the answer unambiguously.
  A basic assumption for mutational analysis is  the intactness of the protein structures despite the  introduction of mutations.
As structures of the  mutant proteins are not available, all calculations  were done on structures derived from the crystallographically determined wild-type complex.
This of  course can introduce errors, if there are major  structural rearrangements of the residues upon  mutation.
To assess possible structural rearrangement upon mutation we performed energy minimization of the mutated structures allowing  freedom for the side-chain residues.
The resulting  structures were incorporated into the calculations.
  Small movements of the side-chains were  observed; however, they had very little impact on  the calculated energies.
It is noteworthy that the  position of the side-chains in the free TEM crystal  structure is almost identical to their position in the  complex.
This is not the case for BLIP-D49.
This  residue perturbs from the b-hairpin turn and  makes no contacts to other BLIP residues.
Therefore, it potentially can take different orientations,  which is exerted by the low temperature factor of  this residue in the BLIP structure.
The TEM pocket,  in fact, is large enough to accommodate most of  these structures.
The position of the D49 side-chain  is therefore imposed by the residues of TEM  with which it interacts.
The minimized structures  of the complex reect this exibility, with D49  making the largest movements.
Though when  implemented into our calculation, the minimized  structures made very small changes in U and  Uint values.
Structures of some of the key  mutations are currently being analyzed by X-ray  crystallography in collaboration with Dr Strynadka  to verify that no major movements occur in the  binding site.
  In summary, in order to evaluate interactions  one has to analyze them within their specic  environment and differentiate between the direct  binding energy and indirect effects.
The measured  interaction energy between a pair of residues is the  sum of these different contributions.
The picture is  further complicated by the fact that all interactions  have to compete with water at 55 M concentration.
  Here we have shown that the direct binding  energy is small (for hydrogen bonds) and is negligible or even repulsive for charge-charge interactions.
Albeit, once a network of interactions is  established cooperative effects can convert the  interactions to favorable ones.
This is especially  pronounced for salt bridges, where networking  changed the interaction from repulsive to attractive.
Thus the positive contribution of each salt  bridge in the wild-type proteins is due entirely to  the indirect cooperative effects due to neighboring  residues.
Theoretical electrostatic calculations compliment the experimental results showing quantitatively how the observed cooperative effect for  the salt bridge triad is due to the indirect electrostatic effect of the environment.
  Materials and Methods  Protein expression and purification  Site-directed mutagenesis and the expression and  purication of BLIP, TEM and their mutants were as  described (Albeck & Schreiber, 1999).
Mutant plasmids  were identied by direct sequencing.
  Kinetic measurements  Kinetic constants were obtained using SPR detection  on a BIAcore as described (Albeck & Schreiber, 1999).
  Either BLIP or BLIP-D49A were immobilized on to the  Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Binding 517sensor chip and the binding of TEM and its mutants was  monitored (HBS, 25 C).
Binding of protein to a control  surface without immobilized ligand was also measured  and the sensogram subtracted from the binding prole  measured on a surface with immobilized protein.
Association and dissociation rate constants were determined by  analysis of the appropriate regions of the resulting sensogram using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software package  (Pharmacia).
This conguration (with BLIP bound) was  shown to give apparent rate constants which are different from those obtained in the opposite conguration or  by other techniques.
However, values of the change in  free energy (or kd) for the alanine mutants relative to the  wild-type (G  KD , and Gz  kd  ) were independent of the  protein immobilized (Albeck & Schreiber, 1999).
  Energy minimization  Energy minimization of relevant side-chains was performed using CHARMM (Brooks et al., 1983) as  implemented in Quanta96, a Molecular Modeling Package of MSI (Molecular Simulation Inc.).
In order to save  computational time, the X-ray crystal structure of the  complex was modied so that residues over 15 A from  all of the interacting residues (R243, S235, K234, S130 on  TEM and D49 on BLIP) were mutated to glycine (to  reduce the solvation layer).
Minimization was then performed on the modied wild-type complex and on its  mutants in a similar way: polar hydrogen atoms were  built into the structure using CHARMM, subsequently  the structures were solvated in a radius of 10 A around  each residue (for the TEM-BLIP complex, for example,  about 2700 water molecules were added).
The back-bone  and side-chains of the entire complex were xed while  the position of the side-chains of all ve interacting residues were minimized.
Also included in the minimization  were water molecules in a sphere of 15 A around the  binding site.
The sphere was centered on Cg of D49, or  on Cb of residue S235 (whenever D49 was mutated).
  Typically, such a sphere contained 60-70 water molecules.
The minimization procedure ran for 500 steps  using the Powell (Brent, 1973) method.
The minimized  coordinates of the side-chains were then implemented  into the unminimized structure and the resulting construct was used for the calculations.
  Calculation of solvent accessible surface  area, SASA  Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) was calculated  for the wild-type complex, for each of its mutants and  for the unbound proteins and their corresponding  mutants using an analytical parametric approach based  on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (Fraczkiewicz & Braun,  1998) implemented in the molecular surface routine  GETAREA (a web service provided by the Sealy Center  for Structural Biology at the University of Texas Medical  Branch).
SASA is the difference between the calculated  SASA of the complexed proteins and that of the free proteins.
SASA is the difference in SASA upon  mutation.
  Electrostatic calculations  Continuum electrostatic calculations were carried out  with version 9.5 of DELPHI computer package incorporated in InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Inc.).
The linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved on an  89  81  81 point three-dimensional grid.
The grid center was dened to be the center of the nal complex.
The  individual proteins were mapped onto the grid in  relation to the grid center in the same way as they relate  to the center of the complex.
The total extent was set to  88 A with grid points separated by 1 A from each other.
  A solvent probe of 1.4 A was used to dene the molecular surface and a 2 A Stern layer surrounded the molecules.
The proteins and solvent were assigned dielectric  values of 4.0 and 80.0, respectively, for all the calculations except for the Coulombic energy where a continuous dielectric of 80.0 was assigned.
The X-ray  crystallographic coordinates of the TEM-BLIP complex  were obtained from Dr Strynadka.
The coordinates of  the free proteins were derived from the complex by eliminating the unwanted partner.
Hydrogen atoms were  added by model building using InsightII (Molecular  Simulations, Inc.).
Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg side-chains  and N and C termini were modeled in their ionized  state.
  Calculation of the total electrostatic energy of  interaction, U  The electrostatic energy of interaction, U was calculated from the difference between the total electrostatic  energy of the free proteins and that of the complex:  U  1  2  X  TEM  qifi   1  2  X  BLIP  qifi  1  2  X  Complex  qifi 5  where qi refer to the charges of the protein atoms and fi  are the electrostatic potentials at the atomic sites for a  protein specied under the summation sign.
These were  calculated as described above assigning Parse charges to  every atom in the molecule (Sitkoff et al., 1994).
This calculation was performed at an ionic strength of 0.15 M  (the same as the experimental data).
  Calculation of direct and indirect contributions to  the electrostatic energy of interaction  The following calculations are based on the method of  Hendsch & Tidor (1994, 1999).
The desolvation penalty,  Usol for the interaction j  k, is the sum of the loss of  solvent interaction energy upon binding, for each of the  two interacting residues:  Usoljk  1  2  X  i2j  qifjbound  i  1  2  X  i2j  qifjunbound  i  0  @  1  A    1  2  X  i2k  qifkbound  i  1  2  X  i2k  qifkunbound  i   !
6  Partial charges for side-chain atoms of one of the interacting residues were assigned (Cb and on).
All other residues were assigned 0 charge.
The potential was then  determined at each partial charge position of that same  side-chain and the energy computed.
This calculation  was performed for the complexed and uncomplexed proteins for each of the interacting residues separately.
  Usol was computed for each interaction in the absence  of neighboring residues by substituting the appropriate  coordinates of the desired mutation.
  The indirect effect between the side-chains of the interacting residues and the rest of the protein, Uprot, was  calculated by assigning partial charges to all atoms of  518 Direct and Cooperative Contributions to Bindingthe protein except for those in the side-chains of the  interacting residues which were set to 0 (Cb and on).
Solving the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation, the  potential was then determined at the position of both  side-chains of the interacting pair.
This was repeated for  the individual proteins where the potential was determined at the position of its relevant side-chain only.
The  energy was computed according to:  Uprotjk  X  Complex  qifi  X  TEM  qjfj  X  BLIP  qkfk 7  where i ranges over the partial atomic charges in both  side-chains of the interacting pair of residues (j and k)  while j and k are the individual interacting residues of  that protein.
  The contribution of the electrostatic interaction  between the interacting side-chains in the complex,  Ubond, was computed by assigning 0 charge to all  atoms in the complex except those on the side-chain of  one interacting residue.
The potential was then determined by solving the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann  equation at each partial charge position of the other sidechain and Ubond was calculated:  Ubond  X  i  qifi 8  where i ranges over the partial charges in the other sidechain.
The same results should be obtained when the  roles of the two side-chains are reversed.
The effect of  mutating neighbors on a given interaction was determined by repeating the calculation with the relevant  mutated coordinates.
The % burial of the interaction was  calculated as described by Hendsch & Tidor (1994).
