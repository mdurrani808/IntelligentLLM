M406157200  Zhen Zhang and Timothy Palzkill  From the Structural and Computational Biology and Molecular Biophysics Program, Department of Molecular  Virology and Microbiology, and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine,  Houston, Texas 77030  -Lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) binds and inhibits a diverse collection of class A -lactamases at a  wide range of affinities.
Alanine-scanning mutagenesis  was previously performed to identify the amino acid  sequence requirements of BLIP for inhibiting TEM-1  -lactamase and SME-1 -lactamase.
Two hotspots of  binding energy, one from each domain of BLIP, were  identified (Zhang, Z., and Palzkill, T. (2003) J. Biol.
  Chem. 278, 4570645712).
This study has been extended  to examine the amino acid sequence requirements of  BLIP for binding to the SHV-1 -lactamase, which is a  poor binding substrate (Ki  1.1 M), and the Bacillus  anthracis Bla1 enzyme (Ki  2.5 nM).
The two hotspots  previously identified as important for binding TEM-1  and SME-1 -lactamase were also found to be important  for binding Bla1.
The hotspot from the second domain of  BLIP, however, does not make substantial contributions  to SHV-1 binding.
This may explain why BLIP binds to  SHV-1 -lactamase with much weaker affinity than to  the other three enzymes.
Three regions, including two  loops that insert into the active pocket of TEM-1 -lactamase and the Glu-73Lys-74 buried charge motif, exhibit strikingly different effects on the binding affinity  of BLIP toward the various enzymes when mutated and,  therefore, act as specificity determinants.
Analysis of  double mutants of BLIP that combine specificity-determining residues suggests that these residues contribute  to the poor affinity between the second domain of BLIP  and SHV-1 -lactamase.
  Protein-protein interactions play a critical role in most cellular processes.
An understanding of the molecular basis of  these interactions is required to engineer novel protein-protein  interactions or to design drugs that manipulate these interactions in a rational way (2).
Protein binding surfaces exhibit  specific chemical and geometric characteristics that determine  affinity and specificity for binding to their targets (27).
It is  difficult to design small molecules that mimic the interactions  of a protein interface because of the generally very large binding area and the large number of residues participating in the  interface.
Alanine-scanning mutagenesis, however, indicates  that only a small number of residues on the interface make  significant energetic contributions to binding, and these residues are defined as a hot spot or functional epitope (2, 810).
  The existence of hot spots makes the task of designing small  molecules that alter protein-protein interactions less daunting.
  Several attempts have been made to understand the molecular  basis of protein-protein interactions by systematic analysis of  physiochemical properties or alanine-scanning mutagenesis  data on protein-protein interfaces (5, 7, 11, 12).
Some general  rules have been proposed, but they seldom hold true for all  protein-protein interfaces.
Conserved polar residues have been  proposed to constitute hot spots because they are frequently  found in interfaces (13).
Hydrophobic residues or large aromatic residues are also frequently found in hot spots, and  interfaces usually bury a large hydrophobic surface area (14).
  Neither polar interactions nor hydrophobic interactions alone,  however, are sufficient to identify binding sites (15, 16).
The  factors that differentiate residues in a hot spot from other  residues on the interface or other regions of the protein surface  remain elusive.
Therefore, additional structure-function studies are required to understand the key components of proteinprotein interactions.
  -Lactam antibiotics, such as the penicillins and cephalosporins, are commonly prescribed anti-microbial drugs.
The  extensive use of these drugs has resulted in widespread -lactam antibiotic resistance, which is becoming a threat to public  health.
The expression of -lactamases that catalyze the hydrolysis of -lactams is a common mechanism for bacterial  resistance to these drugs.
-Lactamases have been grouped  into four classes according to primary sequence alignments  (17).
Escherichia coli TEM-1, Serratia marcescens SME-1,  Klebsiella pneumoniae SHV-1, and Bacillus anthracis Bla1 are  all class A -lactamases that share at least 30% sequence  identity (Table I).
The x-ray crystal structures of the TEM-1,  SME-1, and SHV-1 -lactamases indicate that they possess a  similar-fold (1820).
The three-dimensional structure of Bla1  is not yet available.
All four of these enzymes are able to  hydrolyze most penicillins and early generation cephalosporins  but are unable to efficiently hydrolyze third generation cephalosporins.
The SME-1 -lactamase is also capable of hydrolyzing carbapenem antibiotics (21).
  The widespread antibiotic resistance due to -lactamase production has resulted in a need to develop novel inhibitors of  these enzymes to aid the treatment of infection.
-Lactamase  inhibitory protein (BLIP)1 is a 17-kDa protein produced by  Streptomyces clavuligerus that inhibits class A -lactamases  with a wide range of affinities (Table I) (22, 23).
BLIP consists  of two tandemly linked 76-amino acid domains.

Printed in U.S.A.  42860 This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org   by guest on March 9, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from that BLIP uses its 7-strand -sheet to clamp over the loop-helix  region of TEM-1 (residues 99114) (Fig. 1) (23).
Sequence  alignments of class A -lactamases that are inhibited by BLIP  do not exhibit extensive amino acid sequence conservation in  this region (23).
In addition, two loops in BLIP, one from each  domain, insert into the active site of TEM-1 -lactamase to  block the binding of substrates.
The interaction area between  BLIP and -lactamase (2636 2  ) is one of the largest among  known protein-protein interactions (23).
Several previous studies have focused on the TEM-1BLIP complex (1, 2329).
We  previously employed alanine-scanning mutagenesis to determine the functional epitopes of BLIP for binding the TEM-1  and SME-1 -lactamases (1).
Two patches of residues (patch 1,  residues Phe-36, His-41, and Tyr-53; patch 2, residues His-148,  Trp-150, Arg-160, and Trp-162), one from each domain of BLIP,  were shown to dominate the binding affinity.
In addition, the  two loops that insert into the active pocket of TEM-1 as well as  a Glu-73Lys-74 motif that is fully buried in the interface are  important determinants of the specificity of BLIP binding to  TEM-1 versus SME-1 -lactamase (1).
  In this study the alanine-scanning mutagenesis experiments  were continued to determine the functional epitope of BLIP for  binding two additional class A -lactamases, SHV-1 and Bla1.
  BLIP binds to SHV-1 (Ki  1.1 M) much weaker than it does  to TEM-1 -lactamase (Ki  0.5 nM) even though the enzymes  share 68% sequence identity and a similar substrate spectrum  (18, 25).
In contrast, BLIP inhibits the SME-1 and Bla1 -lactamases efficiently (Ki  2.5 nM) despite the fact that SME-1  and Bla1 share only about 30% identity to TEM-1 -lactamase.
  Examination of BLIP binding to the SHV-1 and Bla1 -lactamases provides an interesting comparison with the previous  study on binding of BLIP to the TEM-1 and SME-1 enzymes (1).
  The results suggest that that the weak interaction between  SHV-1 -lactamase and BLIP is due to a lack of contribution of  residues from the second domain of BLIP.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  MaterialsAll enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs  except the Pfu polymerase, which was purchased from Stratagene.
  Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.
Talon cobalt resin was purchased from Clontech.
Cephalosporin C was purchased from Sigma.
Nitrocefin was purchased from BD  Biosciences.
Cation exchange columns (SP Fast Flow) were purchased  from Amersham Biosciences.
  BLIP Mutagenesis, Cloning, and PurificationAll single mutants of  BLIP were constructed previously (1, 25).
The construction and cloning  of double mutants of BLIP follow the same protocol using overlapping  PCR (30).
The DNA sequence of each mutant was confirmed by the  dideoxy chain termination method using an ABI 3100 capillary DNA  sequencer.
The purification of BLIP mutants followed the procedure  described previously (1).
The purity of the BLIP samples was determined by SDS-PAGE.
BLIP concentrations were determined using a  Bradford assay with a standard curve calibrated by quantitative amino  acid analysis (31).
  Sequence Alignment of Class A -LactamasesSequences of class A  -lactamases were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein data base.
The sequence alignment was done  using ClustalW WWW Service at the European Bioinformatics Institute  (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw) (32).
  Molecular ModelingBla1 was modeled using SwissModel first approach mode at www.expasy.org/swissmod (3335).
To prevent bias, the  modeling was carried out three times with different choices of templates.
In trial 1, uncomplexed TEM-1 (1BTL) and SHV-1 (1SHV) were  retrieved from the PDB.
Both TEM-1 and SHV-1 are typical class A  -lactamases.
The PDB files were then edited according to the requirements of the SwissModel server.
The edited PDB files were then input  as templates for the modeling.
In trial 2, chain A of the TEM1BLIP  complex (1JTG), PC1 -lactamase (3BLM), SME-1 (1DY6), and SHV-1  (1SHV) were retrieved and edited as templates for the modeling.
PC1  and SME-1 -lactamases were used to increase diversity because of  their unusual structures compared with other class A -lactamases.
In  trial 3, the server was allowed to search for templates through the  ExNRL-3D data base, which is a sequence data base designed for the  purpose of finding templates for SwissModeling.
The server found 87  available structures with more than 24% identity and used them as  templates for the modeling.
This setting included more diversified templates.
All three methods gave basically the same Bla1 structure in the  area of interest (the root mean square deviation among loop-helix  domains of all three modeled Bla1 is 0.5 ).
All PDB files were  superimposed to 1JTG using Swiss PdbViewer before submission in  setting 1 and 2.
The returned output was a final model of Bla1 together  with the superimposed templates as a Swiss-PdbViewer project file.
  The superimposed model structure was used as a reference to facilitate  interpretation of the binding results.
  -Lactamase Inhibition AssayBLIP binding was assessed using an  inhibition assay as described previously (1).
The assays were performed  in a 96-well quartz plate.
12 reactions were monitored simultaneously  in a Tecan ultraviolet spectrophotometer controlled by Magellan (Phenix) software.
5 nM SHV-1 -lactamase or 1 nM Bla1 -lactamase was  incubated with 12 varying concentrations of BLIP for at least 1 h at  25 C in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mg/ml bovine  serum albumin.
50 M cephalosporin C (Km is 250 M for SHV-1)
was  added to the SHV-1/BLIP incubation buffer, whereas10 M nitrocefin  (Km is 19 M for Bla1 (36)) was added to the Bla1/BLIP incubation  buffer with a 12-channel pipetter.
The final reaction volume was 0.3 ml.
  Hydrolysis of cephalosporin C was monitored at A280, whereas hydrolysis of nitrocefin was monitored at A500.

  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Determination of the Functional Epitope for BLIP Binding to  SHV-1 -LactamaseSHV-1 is a class A -lactamase that is  most commonly found in the Gram-negative bacterium K.  pneumoniae and is responsible for up to 20% of the plasmidmediated ampicillin resistance in this species (38).
SHV-1  -lactamase shares 68% amino acid sequence identity with  TEM-1 and exhibits a very similar -lactam substrate spectrum.
The three-dimensional structures of the enzymes are  superimposable with the -carbon atom overlay within a root  mean square deviation of 1.4  (18).
SHV-1 -lactamase, however, is significantly different from TEM-1 with respect to  binding to BLIP.
BLIP binds and inhibits TEM-1 -lactamase  at high affinity (Ki  0.5 nM), whereas it inhibits SHV-1 weakly  (Ki  1.1 M) (25). It is, therefore, an interesting model to gain  insight into the determinants of affinity and thereby specificity  for the binding of BLIP to class A -lactamases.
For this purpose, 23 alanine mutants of BLIP that were constructed previously were tested for binding to SHV-1 -lactamase.
The 23  mutated residues were originally chosen because they are  within 4  of TEM-1 -lactamase in the TEM-1BLIP complex  structure (1, 23).
The residues comprising the functional  epitope of BLIP for binding to SHV-1 -lactamase are defined  as those that exhibit a greater than 10-fold increase in Ki value  when mutated to alanine compared with wild type BLIP.
According to this definition, the functional epitope consists of 5  residues including Phe-36, His-41, Asp-49, Tyr-53, and Trp-150  (Table II, Figs. 2 and 3).
Four of the critical residues are from  the first domain of BLIP, whereas Trp-150 is the only critical  residue from the second domain (Table II, Figs. 2 and 3).
  Asp-49 in loop 1 interacts with four essential residues (Ser130, Lys-234, Ser-235, and Arg-244) in the TEM-1 -lactamase  active site that are also conserved in the SHV-1 enzyme.
Superimposition of the TEM-1 and SHV-1 structures shows that  the four residues overlay closely in the two enzymes (the root  mean square deviation is 0.22  for CA and 0.52  for all  atoms).
Residues Phe-36, His-41, and Tyr-53 in patch 1 of BLIP  interact with Ser-106Pro-107Val-108 in TEM-1, which are  also conserved in the SHV-1 enzyme.
Therefore, it is not surprising that mutation of these BLIP residues to alanine has  similar effects on binding to both enzymes (Table II).
  In contrast, there are several differences between the effects  of alanine substitutions of residues in the second domain of  BLIP on inhibition of -lactamases (Table II, Fig. 3).
It is clear  that the residues from the second domain of BLIP, including  residues in patch 2, do not contribute as much energy for  binding to SHV-1 as they do for binding to the other enzymes.
  Residues Trp-112, His-148, Arg-160, and Trp-162 contribute  significantly to binding to the TEM-1 and SME-1 -lactamases  but are not part of the functional epitope for binding to SHV-1  -lactamase.
In addition, although Trp-150 is in the functional  epitope for binding TEM-1 and SHV-1, the W150A BLIP variant inhibits SHV-1 20-fold less efficiently than wild type BLIP,  whereas it inhibits TEM-1 360-fold less efficiently.
The residues in patch 2 of BLIP interact with residues 99QNDLV103 of  TEM-1 in the TEM-1BLIP complex (23).
The corresponding  region in SHV-1 -lactamase is 99QQDLV103, which is very  similar to that of TEM-1.
The difference at position 100 from  asparagine in TEM-1 to glutamine in SHV-1 may contribute to  the weaker interaction between patch 2 of BLIP and SHV-1.
  Trp-150 of BLIP makes contact with Asn-100 in the TEM1BLIP complex structure (23).
By comparison with the unbound TEM-1 -lactamase structure, Asn-100 of TEM-1 undergoes a conformational change when bound to BLIP to avoid  collision with the side chain of BLIP residue Trp-150.
A longer  side chain in SHV-1 at this position might not be able to carry  out the same conformational change to prevent the collision.

  42862 Class A -Lactamase-BLIP Interaction   by guest on March 9, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from collision, in turn, could also effect interactions between other  BLIP residues and SHV-1 by altering distances between residues in the interface.
  Determination of the Functional Epitope for BLIP Binding to  Bla1Bla1 is a class A -lactamase encoded on the chromosome of the Gram-positive bacterium B. anthracis (39).
It is of  interest that BLIP inhibits Bla1 with a Ki of 2.5 nM despite  Bla1 having only 30% sequence identity to TEM-1 -lactamase (Table I).
The set of 23 alanine mutants of BLIP was  tested for its ability to inhibit Bla1 (Table II).
Alanine substitutions at 8 positions resulted in a 10-fold increase in Ki  ,  including Phe-36, His-41, Asp-49, Tyr-53, His-148, Trp-150,  Arg-160, and Trp-162 (Table II, Fig. 3).
With the exception of  Asp-49, which is in a loop that inserts into the -lactamase  active site, these residues clustered in the two patches of residues that were previously identified as functional epitopes of  BLIP for binding the TEM-1 and SME-1 enzymes (1).
Therefore, the functional epitope of BLIP is similar for all of the high  affinity interactions, whereas the epitope for the weak interaction with SHV-1 is much smaller and is a subset of the high  affinity epitope.
  Specificity DeterminantsSpecificity is an important component of protein-protein interactions.
Thousands of proteins are  crowded in a cell, carrying out functions that are dependent on  specific binding events.
Although a great deal is understood on  the molecular basis of interactions, less is known about the  determinants of specificity.
BLIP interacts with several different class A -lactamases with varying affinities and is, therefore, a good model protein with which to study specificity determinants of protein-protein interactions.
  In our previous study of the determinants of binding of BLIP  with the TEM-1 and SME-1 -lactamases, three specificitydetermining regions were identified in BLIP including loop 1,  loop 2, and a Glu-73Lys-74 motif that is buried in the binding  interface (Fig. 2) (1).
A specificity determinant is defined as a  residue that, when mutated to alanine, has a significantly  different effect on binding affinity for different targets.
For  example, the Y50A substitution in loop 1 increases binding  affinity of BLIP for TEM-1 -lactamase by 45-fold but decreases the affinity of BLIP for SME-1 -lactamase by 13-fold  (1).
The data for binding of the 23 BLIP alanine-scanning  mutants to the SHV-1 and Bla1 enzymes also support a role for  loop 1, loop 2, and the Glu-73Lys-74 motif as specificity determinants (Table II).
Alanine substitutions at any of three  positions including Tyr-50 in loop 1, Tyr-143 in loop 2, or  Glu-73 in the Glu-73Lys-74 motif increases the binding affinity of BLIP to SHV-1 more than 20-fold (Table II).
The E73A  mutant also binds to Bla1 40-fold tighter than wild type BLIP  (Table II).
Interestingly, all these residues contact a similar  region in class A -lactamases, which includes Glu-104Tyr105Ser-106Pro-107 in TEM-1, which are located at the tip of  FIG. 2.

The lower significance control line  indicates a   G value of 1.36 kcal/mol,  which corresponds to a 10-fold decrease in  the Ki value (Ki  ,wt/Ki  ,mut  10).
  Class A -Lactamase-BLIP Interaction 42863   by guest on March 9, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from loop-helix region and at the mouth of active pocket (Fig. 1).
  The interaction of the three specificity-determining regions  with the four class A -lactamases used in the study is shown  in Fig. 4.
Tyr-105 of TEM-1 -lactamase rearranges its side  chain into a crowded space surrounded by the three specificitydetermining regions in BLIP to prevent collision with Tyr-50 of  BLIP (Fig. 4A) (23).
The side chain of Tyr-105 is within 4   distance from surrounding residues in TEM-1BLIP complex  structure.
SHV-1 and Bla1 also have a tyrosine at the same  position.
All three enzymes exhibit a stronger interaction with  Y50A BLIP than with wild type BLIP (Table II).
In SME-1, a  histidine residue occupies the corresponding position, which  would be expected to alter the local interactions.
The shorter  side chain of histidine may avoid collision with Tyr-50, and the  partially positive charge could form a cation- interaction with  Tyr-50 of BLIP, which could contribute to binding affinity and  explain why the Y50A mutation decreases the binding affinity  between SME-1 and BLIP by 13-fold.
  The Glu-73Lys-74 motif is a BLIP specificity determinant  that is buried in the TEM-1/BLIP interface (23).
Lys-74 is part  of the functional epitope for binding to TEM-1 -lactamase and  forms a salt bridge with Glu-104 and a hydrogen bond with the  main chain of Gly-141 of TEM-1 (23).
Modeling suggests Tyr104 in SME-1 collides with Lys-74 in the complex, which could  explain why the BLIP K74A protein is a much stronger inhibitor than wild type BLIP for binding to SME-1 -lactamase (1).
  SHV-1 and Bla1 have an aspartate at position 104, which may  be too short to form a strong salt bridge with Lys-74.
This could  explain why the K74A substitution does not exhibit large differences in binding to SHV-1 and Bla1 compared with wildtype BLIP.
Glu-73, which forms a hydrogen bond with the  backbone of TEM-1, does not play a significant role in binding  between TEM-1 and BLIP.
However, the E73A mutant inhibits  SHV-1 and Bla1 with much higher affinity than wild type BLIP  (Table II).
Both SHV-1 and Bla1 have an aspartate at position  104, which is different from Glu-104 in TEM-1 by missing only  one CH2 group.
Modeling suggests the shorter side chain of  Asp-104 in SHV-1 brings the negative carboxyl group to a  distance of less than 3  to the negative side chain of Glu-73  provided that no conformational change occurs upon binding,  whereas the side chain carboxyl group of Glu-104 of TEM-1 is  further away (6 ) from that of Glu-73 of BLIP in TEM1BLIP complex (Fig. 4B).
The E73A substitution would eliminate this adverse interaction and thereby increase binding  affinity to SHV-1 and Bla1.
It is also of interest that a role for  the Glu-to-Asp difference at position 104 of SHV-1 -lactamase  in determining the affinity of BLIP has previously been suggested based on modeling of SHV-1 with BLIP (18).
  Tyr-143 in loop 2 of BLIP is another specificity determinant  for binding to class A -lactamases in that the alanine substitution at this position does not alter binding to TEM-1 but  greatly increases affinity for SHV-1 -lactamase (Table II).
  Tyr-143 is in contact with Glu-104 in the TEM-1/BLIP structure (23).
As stated above, SHV-1 contains an aspartate at  position 104.
The replacement of the Tyr-143 side chain with  alanine could result in a more favorable interaction between  Lys-74 of BLIP and Asp-104 of SHV-1.
Note also that the Bla1  enzyme, which also has Asp-104, is bound 5-fold tighter by  Tyr-143 mutant than wild-type BLIP, whereas the TEM-1 and  SME-1 enzymes, which have a glutamate or tyrosine at this  position, do not exhibit significant differences in binding to the  Y143A mutant compared with wild type BLIP.
  Additivity Relationships between Alanine Substitutions  Double mutants were constructed to determine the additivity  relationships between BLIP residues that contribute to binding  affinity.
The specificity-determining residues Tyr-50, Glu-73,  and Tyr-143 make contacts with a similar region in class A  -lactamases, and therefore, it was of interest to determine  whether these residues act independently of one another.
This  was addressed by constructing the BLIP double mutants E73A/  Y50A, E73A/Y143A, and Y50A/Y143A and testing the mutants  for inhibition of each of the four class A -lactamases.
The  coupling free energy ( GI) was used to evaluate the interdependence of the mutations (4042).
In an additive effect,  GI  will be near zero, which means that the two residues act independently of one another.

  42864 Class A -Lactamase-BLIP Interaction   by guest on March 9, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from additive effect was defined when  GI ranged from 1.00 to 1.00  kcal/mol.
  As discussed above, SHV-1 is 68% identical in amino acid  sequence to TEM-1 -lactamase and yet binds BLIP 2000-fold  weaker than TEM-1.
The alanine mutagenesis data indicates  that residues in the second domain of BLIP that contribute to  the binding of TEM-1 -lactamase, such as Trp-112 and Trp150, do not contribute as substantially to binding SHV-1 -lactamase.
It was also found that some substitutions, such as  Y143A, bind SHV-1 much tighter than wild-type BLIP.
A possible explanation for these observations is negative cooperativity between residues in the BLIP binding interface.
By this  view, the presence of a certain residue at one site prevents an  optimal interaction with the target protein by a residue at  another site at the interface (43).
If there exists negative cooperativity between Tyr-143 and Trp-112 or Trp-150, the double  mutants W112A/Y143A and W150A/Y143A should exhibit a  less than additive effect on binding than the sum of the single  mutants.
As seen in Table III, the effect of the W112A/Y143A  double mutant is similar to the sum of the effects of the single  mutants, suggesting these positions are independent, and  therefore, the increase in binding affinity of the Y143A substitution is not mediated through Trp-112.
In contrast, the  W150A/Y143A binds with 1.0 kcal less energy than predicted  from the sum of the single mutants.
This suggests that Trp-150  makes stronger interactions with SHV-1 in the background of  the Y143A mutation, which suggests that Tyr-143 is responsible in part for the weak interaction between the second domain  of BLIP and SHV-1.
In addition, double mutants containing  Glu-73 display clearly non-additive effects with respect to binding to SHV-1.
For example, based on the single mutant results,  the E73A/Y50A double mutant is expected to bind much tighter  than what is observed.
Similarly, the E73A/Y143A double mutant binds SHV-1 with significantly less affinity than expected  based on the sum of the single mutants.
These results suggest  the presence of Glu-73 prevents optimal interactions between  Tyr-50 and Tyr-143 with SHV-1 -lactamase.
The Glu-73 double mutants also bind Bla1 -lactamase with significantly  lower affinity than expected based on the sum of the single  mutants, suggesting that Glu-73 also restricts interactions between Tyr-50 and Tyr-143 with Bla1 (Table III).
In contrast,  the Glu-73 double mutants do not exhibit strong non-additivity  effects with respect to binding the TEM-1 and SME-1 -lactamases (Table III).
Examination of the -lactamase sequence  alignment (Table I) for the region contacted by Glu-73 suggests  that the presence of Asp-104 in SHV-1 and Bla1 versus Glu and  Tyr at position 104 in the TEM-1 and SME-1 enzymes may  contribute to the observed differences in additivity relationships for Glu-73 interactions with the target -lactamases.
  Functional Epitopes for -Lactamase BindingThe common  functional epitope of BLIP for binding the four class A -lactamases TEM-1, SME-1, SHV-1, and Bla1 consists of only 5  residues, including Phe-36, His-41, Asp-49, Tyr-53, and Trp150.
Four additional residues in domain 2 of BLIP, Trp-112,  His-148, Arg-160, and Trp-162, make energetically significant  contributions to binding of all of the -lactamases except  SHV-1.
The lack of contribution of these four residues for  binding SHV-1 may explain the low affinity between BLIP and  this enzyme.
Therefore, the nine residues discussed above are  considered as common affinity determinants for tight binding  to class A -lactamases.
These residues, with the exception of  Asp-49, make mainly hydrophobic interactions with target enzymes.
Important residues from domain 1 (Phe-36, His-41, and  Tyr-53) form hydrophobic interactions with Pro-107Val-108 of  TEM-1 -lactamase.
Pro-107 is conserved through all class A  -lactamases that are inhibited by BLIP, and most of these  enzymes have a valine or isoleucine at position 108.
Both  residues 107 and 108 in TEM-1 -lactamase were previously  shown to be important for BLIP binding (28).
The fact that  these hydrophobic interactions are important for binding between class A -lactamases and BLIP is consistent with previous systematic analyses of protein-protein interfaces (14).
  Glu-31, Gly-48, Gly-141, Arg-144 and four serine residues of  BLIP do not make significant contributions to binding affinity  for any of the tested -lactamase targets based on the alanine  substitution results (Table II).
These residues are mainly polar  and located at the periphery of the interface.
Clackson and  Wells have proposed that peripheral residues might contribute  to binding specificity by repulsion of non-target molecules (2).
  Because these peripheral residues in BLIP do not effect binding  affinity to any of the targets tested, they do not appear to play  a role in discrimination among class A enzymes; however, they  could play a role in the discrimination among natural in vivo  targets of BLIP.
  The ability to engineer protein-protein interactions or design  binding sites could facilitate the development of new therapeutics.
A rational design strategy requires understanding of the  determinants of affinity in protein-protein interfaces.
The presence of hotspots may be a general feature of protein-protein  interactions, as suggested by systematic analysis of alaninescanning mutagenesis data (11).
However, the nature of a hot  spot is still unclear because of the variation of many physiochemical and geometric parameters of residues in hotspots (4).
  It is not obvious which residues are critical for binding by  examination of structural data.
Compounding the challenge is  the cooperativity of interactions between residues in proteinprotein interfaces (43).
For example, the double mutant cycle  data presented here indicate that Glu-73 exhibits negative  cooperativity with Tyr-50 and Tyr-143 of BLIP with respect to  binding SHV-1 and Bla1 but acts independently with regard to  binding to the TEM-1 and SME-1 -lactamases.
The low affinity of the BLIP-SHV-1 interaction appears to result from weak  interactions between residues in domain 2 of BLIP, which may  be due to negative cooperativity with residues in the specificitydetermining region.
It is also interesting to note that three  targets: TEM-1, SME-1, and Bla1 -lactamase, are inhibited by  BLIP at a similar high affinity even though residues in the  specificity-determining region exhibit widely different effects  upon mutation to alanine.
The co-crystal structures of BLIP  with class A -lactamases in addition to TEM-1 are required for  a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for interactions  in these interfaces.
