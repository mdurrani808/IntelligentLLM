MST4 acts downstream of LKB1/  MO25/STRAD complex to induce brush border  formation.
MO25 directly interacts with MST4 to  promote its kinase activity.
Here, we report the  crystal structure of MST4 in complex with MO25.
  Association of MO25 rotates the aC helix of MST4  toward its catalytic core, stabilizing the aC helix in  an active position.
The kinase domain of MST4 forms  a specific homodimer that is required for transautophosphorylation.
MO25-stimulated activation  of MST4 promotes apoptosis in HEK293T cells.
  Atomic resolution permitted the study of interface  mutations capable of disrupting the MST4-MO25  interaction or the kinase-domain-mediated homodimerization.
These mutations impaired MST4 kinase  activation and function within the cell.
Collectively,  our study identifies the activation mechanism of  MST4 and provides a structural basis for further  functional study.
  INTRODUCTION  The mammalian STE20-like kinases play multiple roles in the  regulation of signaling pathways governing cell mitosis, homeostasis, polarity, migration, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation (Dan et al., 2001; Delpire, 2009; Fanger et al., 1997).  Germinal center kinases (GCKs) constitute the majority of the  STE20 family and participate in development, stress responses,  and immune regulation (Dan et al., 2001; Delpire, 2009; Ling  et al., 2008; Pombo et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2012).
GCKs are  divided into eight subfamilies, and all possess a relatively conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a diversified C-terminal  domain.
  MST4 is a member of the GCK-III subfamily and is highly  expressed in placenta, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes  (Dan et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2001; Qian et al., 2001).
The  C-terminal domain of MST4 mediates homodimerization, which  influences kinase activation (Dan et al., 2002; Qian et al.,  2001).
MST4a, an alternatively spliced isoform lacking  substrate-binding subdomains, is specifically expressed during  early stages of development (Qian et al., 2001).
  MST4 may activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  (ERK) signaling pathway to regulate cell growth and transformation (Lin et al., 2001).
Overexpression of MST4 in prostate  cancer cell lines increases cell proliferation and contributes to  anchorage-independent growth (Sung et al., 2003).
During this  process, MST4 may be activated by epidermal growth factor  (EGF) and function downstream of the EGF receptor (EGFR)  family.
However, other studies, done with different cell lines,  showed that MST4 might not readily activate ERK, p38, JNK,  and NF-kB pathways (Qian et al., 2001).
  The scaffold protein MO25 binds to the pseudokinase STE20-  related adaptor (STRAD) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) to form  a ternary complex, which is critical for the activation of LKB1  (Boudeau et al., 2003; Zeqiraj et al., 2009a).
LKB1 induces  complete polarization of intestinal epithelial cells, which allows  the regulated uptake of nutrients (Baas et al., 2004).
During this  process, MST4 acts downstream of LKB1 to phosphorylate the  actin-binding protein Ezrin and induce brush border formation  (ten Klooster et al., 2009).
Recently, the small G protein Rap2A  was identified as a molecular link directly coupling microvilli  formation to the preceding cell polarization (Gloerich et al.,  2012).
LKB1 triggered apicobasal polarity creates a microenvironment for Rap2A signaling through its downstream effector  TRAF2 and NCK-interacting protein kinase (TNIK), which, in  turn, targets MST4 for apical recruitment.
The brush border  formation is therefore controlled by Rap2A and TNIK through  apical localization of MST4 followed by phosphorylation of Ezrin.
  In addition to activating LKB1, MO25 can directly interact with  certain STE20 kinases including MST4, MST3, STK25, oxidative  stress-responsive 1 protein (OSR1), and STE20/SPS1-related  proline-alanine-rich protein kinase (SPAK) and dramatically  increase their kinase activities (Filippi et al., 2011).
The structure  of MO25 in complex with the pseudokinase STRAD was previously resolved, revealing an active conformation of STRAD  (Zeqiraj et al., 2009b).
The concave surface of MO25 forms an  extensive interaction network with STRAD.
The 3-amino-acid  (Trp-Glu-Phe, WEF) motif C-terminal to the kinase domain of  STRAD, which is essential for MO25 binding, is embedded into  a hydrophobic pocket of the horseshoe shaped MO25 (Boudeau  et al., 2003; Milburn et al., 2004).
Based on the conserved motif  analysis, it was proposed that MST4 would bind to MO25 in  a similar manner as does STRAD (Filippi et al., 2011).
However,  Structure 21, 449461, March 5, 2013 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 449it is unclear whether this is the case, and, if so, how MO25  regulates the activation and function of MST4 remains largely  unknown.
  Here, we report the crystal structure of MST4 kinase domain  in complex with MO25.
The MST4 kinase domain N-lobe, aE  helix of C-lobe, and the conserved Trp-Ser-Phe (WSF) motif  interact intensively with MO25 in a similar manner observed in  STRAD-MO25 complex (Filippi et al., 2011; Zeqiraj et al.,  2009b).
Importantly, MO25 binding rotates the aC helix of  MST4 to a closed active conformation, promoting the kinase  activity of MST4.
Moreover, in the presence of MO25, the kinase  domain of MST4 forms a homodimer that differs from the  previously reported dimer of apo MST4.
Structure-guided  biochemical and cell-based studies support and further corroborate the mechanistic model of MST4 activation in which MST4  is regulated by MO25 binding and homodimerization of kinase  domain.
  RESULTS  Reconstitution of the MST4-MO25 Complex  MST4 comprises a kinase domain (amino acids 1297), a linker  region (amino acids 298346) with a MO25-binding motif (WSF  in MST4; WEF in STRAD), and a C-terminal dimerization domain  (amino acids 347416) (Figure 1A) (Ceccarelli et al., 2011; Record  et al., 2010).
MO25 is composed of seven a-helical repeats  (designated as R0R6) (Milburn et al., 2004).
Previous work has  demonstrated that MST4 is a MO25-regulated kinase (Filippi  et al., 2011; ten Klooster et al., 2009).
To confirm the biological  existence of a stable MST4-MO25 complex in vivo and in vitro,  we first transfected HEK293T cells with constructs encoding  cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged MO25 or/and YFPtagged MST4 to check the cellular localization of MO25 and  MST4 (Figure 1B).
Consistent with previous notion that MO25  diffused freely between cytoplasm and nucleus (Boudeau  et al., 2003), we found that MO25 was widely distributed  throughout the cell when overexpressed alone.
On the other  hand, MST4 was predominantly localized in cytoplasm and  could hardly be detected in nucleus.
Strikingly, MO25 was  dramatically excluded from nucleus and retained in cytoplasm  when cotransfected with MST4, a phenomenon also observed  when MO25 was cotransfected with STRAD (Boudeau et al.,  2003).
Overall, these observations suggested that MST4 and  MO25 are colocalized in cells and their association prevents  MO25 from shuttling between cytoplasm and nucleus by free  diffusion.
  We then performed coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) by transfecting HEK293T cells with constructs expressing Myc-tagged  MO25 and different fragments of Flag-tagged MST4 including  full-length MST4 (amino acids 1416), C-terminal truncation  MST4 (amino acids 1327), and MST4 (amino acids 1297), as  well as a kinase dead mutation MST4 D162A (amino acids 1  416).
Flag-tagged MST4 was immunoprecipitated and then  precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Flag and anti-Myc  antibody (Figure 1C).
Myc-tagged MO25 was detected in the immunoprecipates of all MST4 fragments.
Together with the colocalization analysis, these results clearly indicated that MST4 and  MO25 coexist in a complex in cells, possibly through MST4  kinase domain.
  Next, we used purified recombinant proteins to detect the  direct interactions between MO25 and different MST4 fragments using Octet Red 96 (ForteBio).
Compared with full-length  MST4, the fragment 18327 had similar binding affinity to  MO25, yet the fragment 18297 showed apparently reduced  level of MO25 binding (Table 1; Figure S1 available online).
  This observation indicated that the MST4 linker region containing the MO25-binding motif (WSF motif) might enhance its  interaction with MO25, although MST4 kinase domain alone  could form complex with MO25.
It has been reported that  ATP could promote STRAD binding to MO25 (Zeqiraj et al.,  2009b).
We then tested whether the binding of MST4 and  MO25 was influenced by the presence of ATP.
Our results  showed that ATP did not seem to affect MST4 binding to  MO25 (Table 1; Figure S1).
The binding affinity of MST4 for  MO25 is higher than that of STRAD in the absence of ATP,  while similar binding affinities for MO25 were observed when  ATP is present (Figure S1).
  It was previously shown that MO25 promotes MST4 kinase  activity toward myelin basic protein (MBP), a general kinase substrate (Filippi et al., 2011).
We performed in vitro kinase assays  using purified proteins of full-length MST4 and various fragments.
As shown in Figure 1D, full-length MST4 and truncation  fragments 18327 or 18297 had similar kinase activities.
Addition of MO25 increased MST4 kinase activity by approximately  10-fold.
As a negative control, the kinase dead mutant of  MST4 (D162A) did not show significant activity alone or in the  presence of MO25 (Figure 1D).
  Structure of MST4-MO25 Complex  After the confirmation of the stable MST4-MO25 complex and  the characterization of the minimum domains required for  complex assembly, we purified MST4 kinase domain (amino  acids 18297, D162A) in complex with MO25 (amino acids 11  334) and crystallized the complex with or without a cyclin-dependent kinase 1/2 (CDK1/2) inhibitor III (DKI) and a peptide  EWSFT which mimics the MO25-binding motif (Figures S2A  S2C).
The crystal of MST4-MO25 complex diffracted to 3.15 A  resolution.
Structures were determined by molecular replacement with final Rwork of 0.206 and Rfree of 0.252.
The refinement  statistics were summarized in Table 2.
  The overall structures of MST4-MO25 complex with inhibitor  compound DKI or WSF motif peptide are very much the same  to that of the MST4-MO25 complex alone (Figure 2A).
The asymmetric unit of the MST4-MO25 crystals contains one molecule of  MST4 and one molecule of MO25 bound to each other, forming  a 1:1 subcomplex.
Further examination of symmetry-related  molecules indicated that MST4 and MO25 form a 2:2 tetrameric  heterocomplex on the basis of MST4-kinase-domain-mediated  homodimer, consistent with in vitro kinase assays (see more  details below).
No significant conformational change was  observed for MO25.
The rmsd value is 1.35 A on 311 Ca atoms  when the complexed-MO25 structure overlapped with the apo  MO25 structure reported previously (Milburn et al., 2004).
In  brief, MO25 is composed of seven a-helical repeats and forms  a horseshoe shape.
The concave surface of MO25 interacts  with the N-lobe and the aE helix of MST4 kinase domain.
The  monomer structure of the MST4 kinase domain observed in  MST4-MO25 complex crystals is similar to the MST4 kinase  Structure  Structure of MST4-MO25 Complex  450 Structure 21, 449461, March 5, 2013 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserveddomain structure determined alone with the exception of a repositioned aC helix and a well defined activation loop (A-loop) (Figure S3) (Record et al., 2010).
The rmsd of overlapping these two  MST4 structures is 1.84 A for the complete kinase domain (amino  acids 18297), and 1.41 A when the aC helix and A-loop were  excluded.
Notably, the ordered A-loop of MST4 in our complex  structures adopted an inactive conformation that would block  substrate binding.
  A DKI compound was found in the ATP binding pocket of  MST4 in the MST4-MO25-DKI complex (Figure 2A), consistent  with previous finding that DKI binds to MST4 with high affinity  (Record et al., 2010).
The glycine-rich loop and the region  between b4 and aD of MST4 tether the DKI molecule to the  hydrophobic active cleft between the two lobes of the kinase  domain (Figure S3).
Similar as observed for the quinazoline inhibitor compound GVD bound to MST4, residues L102 and D109 of  Figure 1.
MO25 Binds to MST4 and Stimulates Its Kinase Activity  (A) Schematic illustration of domain organization for human MST4 and MO25.
MST4 contains a kinase domain at the N terminus, following with a linker  region, which contains a Trp-Ser-Phe (WSF) motif, and a dimerization domain at the C terminus.
MO25 is composed of seven a-helical repeats (designated as  R0-R6).

The relative association was calculated by ratio of Myc-tagged and  Flag-tagged protein level in IB and the association between MST4 (amino acids 1416) and MO25 was set to 1.0.
b-actin was used as an independent loading  control.

  Details of the MST4-MO25 Interaction  Previous studies identified four major sites (termed A, B, C, and D  sites) on STRAD for the binding of MO25, three of which interact  with the concave surface of MO25 (Filippi et al., 2011; Zeqiraj  et al., 2009b).
Correspondingly, MST4 mainly interacts with the  MO25 concave surface through three major sites involving the  MST4 kinase domain N-lobe and the aE helix (Figure 2A).
For  site A, the loop between the b3 sheet and the aC helix of  MST4 kinase domain forms intensive interactions with the H3  helix of the MO25 repeat R4 and R5 (termed R4H3 and R5H3,  similarly naming hereinafter).
This binding network involves  residues Y223, R227, K231, S267, and N269 of MO25 and  E58, E61, and E63 from the aC helix region of MST4, which  form hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, contributing a total of 222 A 2 buried surface area (Figure 2B).
In addition,  the aC helix of MST4 walks along the concave surface of MO25,  burying a total of 354 A 2 surface area (Figure 2C).
Particularly  residues E65 and Q68 in the aC helix of MST4 interact with  S182 and Q228 from the H3 helix of the MO25 repeat R3 and  R4 by electrostatic interactions.
  For site B, residue F178 in the H3 helix of the MO25 repeat R3  extends to a hydrophobic region of MST4, involving residues L57  near the b3 sheet, L90 in the b4 sheet, L95 in the b5 sheet, and  V224 in the H3 helix of the MO25 repeat R4.
The buried surface  area of the hydrophobic region is up to 275 A 2 (Figure 2D).
Moreover, residue D179 in the H3 helix of the MO25 repeat R3 interacts with residues Y85 and S88 from the MST4 b4 sheet through  hydrogen bonding.
  At C site, the aE helix from the C-lobe of MST4 kinase domain  interacts with the H3 helix of the MO25 repeat R1 (Figure 2E).
  Specifically, residues E93 and K96 of MO25 interacted with  Y134 and E138 of MST4.
These interactions were mainly mediated by hydrogen bonding and salt bridges.
  For the relatively isolated site D, the WSF motif of MST4 binds  intimately to the hydrophobic pocket on the C-terminal convex  surface of MO25 (Figure 2F).
Hydrophobic packing mediated  by the WSF motif appears dominant in this site.
For example,  the side chains of W324 and F326 of the WSF motif form hydrophobic interactions with residues K257, M260, L263, F278, I294,  K301, L302, and F305 of MO25, burying a total of 424 A 2 molecular surface.
In addition, K297, N298, and K301 of MO25 form  hydrogen bonds with S325 and the main chain of the motif.
  Moreover, a pair of cation-p interaction was observed between  W324 of the WSF motif and R264 of MO25, highlighting W324  as a critical residue for interaction with MO25.
All the key residues in the interface of MST4 and MO25 are highly conserved  between different species, indicating a conserved role of  MO25 for regulating MST4 (Figures S4A and S4B).
  MST4 Kinase Activity Is Regulated by MO25 Binding  After the examination of the MST4-MO25 interface, we performed biochemical- and cellular-based assays to verify our  crystallographic analysis and identify specific amino acids  most critical for MST4-MO25 association.
To this end, a series  of mutants based on the full-length MST4 and MO25 were constructed.
Purified recombinant proteins were then used to detect  interactions between wild-type or mutant of MST4 and MO25 by  Octet Red 96.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy results  showed that the overall structures and folds of these mutant  proteins have not been altered when compared with wild-type  MST4 or MO25 (Figure S5).
Single mutations F178E (site B),  Y223A, R227A (site A), M260E (site D) and double mutation  F178E/V224E (site B) of MO25 greatly impaired its interaction  with MST4 (Table 3; Figure S6).
Similarly, single mutations  L95E (site B), Y134A (site C), W324E (site D), and double mutation L90E/L95E (site B) of MST4 markedly reduced its association with MO25.
Single mutation E138A (site C) of MST4 did  not significantly affect their association.

Mutations F178E, Y223A, R227A, M260E, and F178E/  V224E of MO25 and E58A (site A), L95E, Y134A, W324E, and  L90/L95E of MST4 impaired MO25 association with MST4,  consistent with Octet results.
Collectively, these observations  suggest that all four sites are required for MST4 interaction  with MO25; i.e., disruption any of these sites would block  complex formation.
  To further analyze the mechanism of MST4 activation stimulated by MO25 binding, we used purified recombinant proteins  to measure the kinase activity of MST4 toward MBP in the presence or absence of MO25 (Figures 3C and 3D).
Our results  showed that wild-type MO25 promoted the kinase activity of  wild-type MST4 dramatically.
However, the MO25 mutants  (F178E, Y223A, R227A, M260E, and F178E/V224E) and MST4  mutants (E58A, W324E, E58A/E61A, and E63A/E65A) that impaired MST4-MO25 interactions as shown by Octet and co-IP  could not activate MST4 kinase as did wild-type proteins, correlating MO25 binding to the regulation of MST4 kinase activity.
  Moreover, these MST4 mutants (except Y134A) retained a basal  level of kinase activity similar to that of wild-type MST4 in the  absence of MO25, corroborating the folding integrity of MST4  mutant proteins.
These results further confirmed the necessity  of all four sites for complex formation and MST4 activation.
  It is interesting that Y134A mutant of MST4 showed no kinase  activity regardless of MO25 binding (Figure 3D).
We checked the  structure of MST4 and found that the residue Y134 lies under the  aC helix and forms hydrogen bond and salt bridges with residues  Q76, C77, and D78 near the aC helix (Figure S7).
Thus, Y134A  mutant abolished MST4 activity probably through alteration of  the aC helix conformation.
  Kinase-Domain-Mediated Homodimerization  Is Required for MST4 Activation  In the crystals of MST4-MO25 complex, the MST4 kinase  domain can form homodimer in two different manners (referred  Figure 2.

For type A dimer, the Aloop and the following aEF and aG helices form a symmetric  interface with a nature of hydrophobic interactions (Figure 4A).
  Residues M186 in the A-loop, V190, and I191 in the aEF helix  and M225, L228, and F229 in the aG helix form a hydrophobic  core, while residues D171 and K233 form salt bridges  surrounding the dimeric core for additional stabilization.
The total  buried accessible surface for this type of dimerization is 822 A 2  .
  Alternatively, the aE helix and the aH, aJ and aK helices of MST4  mediate type B dimerization (Figure 4B).
In this case, two  aromatic residues (F119) in the aE helix of two MST4 molecules  pack against each other.
Residues D242 and T244 near the aH  helix, K276 in the aJ helix, and Y283 and E286 in the aK helix  of one MST4 molecule form hydrogen bonding and electrostatic  interactions with the same group of residues of other molecule.
A  total of 422 A 2 surface area is buried in this type of dimerization.
  As crystal packing may cause artifacts, we carried out co-IP  and in vitro kinase assays to verify our crystallographic observation regarding the MST4-kinase-domain-mediated dimerization.
  The C-terminal region of MST4 is known to mediate homodimerization.
To assess the kinase-domain-mediated dimerization  without interference by the C-terminal dimerization domain, we  used the N-terminal fragment of MST4 containing the kinase  domain with WSF motif (amino acids 1327) to perform co-IP  assay in HEK293 cells.
According to different types of dimerization, two groups of mutations based on the N-terminal fragment  of MST4 were designed to probe MST4 homodimerization  through kinase domain.
The first group of mutations derived  from type A dimeric interface, including mutations M225E,  L228E and F229A, and deletion of residues 222233 (del 222  233), impaired homoassociation of the MST4 kinase domain as  shown by co-IP in HEK293T cells (Figures 5A).
Moreover, this  group of mutations abolished the kinase activity of MST4 no  matter MO25 is present or not (Figure 5B).
On the contrary,  the second group of mutations derived from type B dimeric  interface (mutations F119E and D242A/K276A) only partly  reduced homoassociation of the MST4 kinase domain and  slightly decreased its kinase activity (Figures 5A and 5B).
To  rule out the possibility that mutation alters overall structural  folding of MST4 and therefore affect its dimerization, we used  CD spectroscopy to monitor secondary structures of these  mutant proteins (Figure S5).
The CD results suggested that no  major change of overall folding occur upon introduction of mutations.
Additionally, we tested the interactions between wild-type  MO25 and different MST4 mutants.
The Octet results indicated  that the binding affinity decreased, especially for those mutations in type A dimerization interface (Figure S8).
We speculate  that this could be caused by decreased avidity due to disruption  of MST4 dimer, as well as perturbed conformation of the activation loop that is adjacent to the MO25 binding interface.
Taken  together, these observations indicated that type A but not type  B dimerization is of physiological relevance, and that the  kinase-domain-mediated homoassociation of MST4 is a prerequisite for its autophosphorylation, activation, and further stimulation by MO25.
  MO25-Stimulated Activation of MST4 Promotes  Apoptosis  To gain further functional insights into the MST4-MO25 complex,  we overexpressed wild-type and mutant MST4 in HEK293T  cells.
Propidium iodide staining showed that transfection of  either wild-type MST4 or MO25 significantly promoted apoptosis  (Figure 6A).
More strikingly, coexpression of wild-type MST4 and  MO25 resulted in dramatically increased apoptosis.
Similarly,  coexpression of wild-type MO25 with MST4 E138A mutant,  which partially impaired kinase activation stimulated by MO25,  also enhanced apoptosis, although to a lesser extent.
However,  coexpression of wild-type MO25 and MST4 mutants W324E or  E58A/E61A that disrupted MST4-MO25 association did not  induce substantial apoptosis, indicating a critical role of MO25  association induced MST4 activation.
Moreover, coexpression  of a kinase dead version of MST4 (D162A) with wild-type  MO25 did not cause apoptosis, suggesting that MST4 kinase  activity is essential for MST4 and/or MO25 induced apoptosis.
  Finally, we further confirmed these observations by TUNEL  assay.
As shown in Figure 6B, coexpression of MO25 with  wild-type or mutant MST4 promoted apoptosis in a similar trend  as observed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
  DISCUSSION  Comparison of MST4-MO25 with STRAD-MO25  The overall structure of the MST4-MO25 complex is similar to  that of the pseudokinase STRAD in complex with MO25  (Figure 7A), consistent with previous studies (Filippi et al.,  2011; Zeqiraj et al., 2009b).
The interaction between MST4 and  MO25 is mediated by several conserved sites identified from  the STRAD-MO25 complex interface.
Mutation or deletion of  the WEF motif of STRAD abolished its binding with MO25 (Boudeau et al., 2003).
Our crystallographic study, Octet analysis,  in vitro kinase assays and co-IP results indicate that removal of  the WSF motif (site D) by truncation reduces but does not disrupt  MST4-MO25 complex formation.
However, mutation of this  site in the context of full-length MST4 significantly limited its  interaction with MO25, suggesting that the WSF-motif-mediated  interaction stabilizes a needed conformation of MST4 when it  associates with MO25 in cells.
  When associated with MO25, STRAD adopts an active conformation and as such its A-loop is extended to touch the R0 and  R1 helical repeats from the concave side of MO25.

  Structure  Structure of MST4-MO25 Complex  454 Structure 21, 449461, March 5, 2013 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reservedour structure of the MST4-MO25 complex, MST4 appears to be  in a transition state between the inactive and fully active  states.
A feature of the MST4 transition state is that its aC helix  is in a closed conformation while its A-loop is folded back to  the substrate cleft.
Based on comparison of MST4-MO25 and  STRAD-MO25 complexes, we propose that upon activation,  the loop between the R0 and R1 helices of MO25 shifts toward  MST4.
Together with R0 and R1 repeats, this rearranged loop  of MO25 can interact with the autophosphorylated A-loop of  MST4 to stabilize an extended active conformation (see more  below).
  Conformational Change of MST4 aC Helix Induced  by MO25 Binding  When compared with the structure of the MST4 kinase domain in  apo state (Record et al., 2010), the aC helix of MST4 in complex  state is rotated by MO25 toward its catalytic core (Figure 7B).

  This conformational change of aC helix  resulted in an 8 A shortening of the  distance between the K53 residue of the  conserved Val-Ala-Ile-Lys (VAIK) motif  and the E70 residue of the aC helix,  promoting formation of a canonical ion  pair, which keeps the MST4 kinase  domain in a closed conformation.
This  effect renders the aC helix of MST4 in a position that is observed  in active conformations of kinases such as MST3 (Ko et al., 2010)  and STK25 (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 2XIK).
The distance of  the K53-E70 pair is reduced from 11.9 A (apo MST4, inactive  state) to 3.1 A (MST4-MO25 complex), which is even shorter  than those of MST3 (4.0 A ) and STK25 (4.2 A ) in their active states  (Figure 7B).
  Together with our mutational studies, these observations  suggested that the conformational change of the aC helix is a  hallmark of the mechanisms through which MO25 stimulates  MST4 activation.
This principle has been observed for other  kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) (Honda  et al., 2005; Jeffrey et al., 1995).
Cyclin A or cyclin E binds to  the C helix of CDK2, resulting in a rotation of the C helix (i.e.,  the PSTAIRE helix, similar to aC helix) and subsequent formation  of K33-E51 ion pair which keeps CDK2 in an active conformation.
Moreover, the binding mode between MST4 and MO25  Structure  Structure of MST4-MO25 Complex  Structure 21, 449461, March 5, 2013 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 455also resembled the interactions between CDK2 and cyclin A/E.  Notably, the hydrophobic cleft nearby the C helix of CDK is  also involved in the association with cyclin A/E. Other examples  include cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Aurora  A/B kinases.
The C-terminal hydrophobic motif of PKA binds to  its kinase domain N-lobe and activates PKA (Knighton et al.,  1991).
Aurora A/B can be activated by binding of a hydrophobic  motif in targeting protein for Xklp2 (TPX2)/inner centromere  protein (INCENP) (Bayliss et al., 2003; Sessa et al., 2005).
These  shared features reflect a universal activation mechanism in  which a hydrophobic area of a regulatory partner or a hydrophobic motif of a subunit or domain binds to the hydrophobic  cleft nearby the aC helix of the kinase domain to induce a closed  conformation.
  Kinase-Domain-Mediated Homodimerization Is  Required for MST4 trans-Autophosphorylation  Previous structural study of the MST4 kinase domain alone also  revealed a dimeric association involving the A-loop (Record  et al., 2010).
Our current work revealed a 2:2 MST4-MO25  complex with homodimerization of the MST4 kinase domain  involving the aEF/aG helices and the A-loop.
Structural comparison of the MST4 kinase domain homodimer identified in this  study and the previously reported one reveal conformational  rearrangements of the dimer from the apo state to the MO25-  complexed state (Figures 7C, 7D, and S9A9C).
It is likely that  MO25 binding alters the conformation of the MST4 kinase  domain by rotating the aC helix, which then induces reorganization of the dimeric interface for activation.
Our co-IP and in vitro  kinase assay showed that mutations disrupting the dimeric  interface of MST4 abolished its kinase activity, highlighting the  functional importance of the particular dimeric conformation  identified in the structure of MST4 in complex with MO25  (Figure 5).
  Single mutation such as M225E or L228E that disrupt the typeA homodimerization of the MST4 kinase domain completely  Figure 4.
MST4 Kinase Domain Forms Symmetric Homodimers in Crystal Structure  (A) Type A dimerization interface of MST4 kinase  domain.
The two molecules of MST4 are colored  yellow and orange, respectively.
The activation  loop (A-loop) and the following aEF and aG helices  form a symmetric dimer through hydrophobic  interactions.

The colors are the same as type A  dimerization.
The aE, aH, aJ, and aK helices of  MST4 are involved in this dimerization.
  abolished MST4 kinase activity, even  though the rest of the catalytic elements  including the aC helix, A-loop, active  cleft, and the substrate binding motif  were intact.
However, mutations disrupting type-B homodimer of MST4 did not  significantly affect its kinase activity.
  These observations strongly indicate  that it is the type A dimeric conformation  of the kinase domain, per se, is required for the activation  of MST4.
  In the presence of MO25, the MST4 kinase domain forms  a dimer via the aEF/aG helices and the A-loop.
A-loop exchange  of kinases has recently been discussed as a mechanism for  trans-autophosphorylation (Lee et al., 2009; Pike et al., 2008;  Villa et al., 2008).
For example, the A-loop and aEF, aF, and  aG helices are involved in dimerization in certain kinases  including STE20-like serine/threonine-protein kinase (SLK),  lymphocyte-oriented kinase (LOK), OSR1, and death-associated  protein kinase 3 (DAPK3).
In our structure, in addition to the  A-loop, the homodimerization interface of MST4 also includes  the Ala-Pro-Glu (APE) motif and P+1 loop, which are related  to substrate binding, suggesting that one MST4 molecule  may serve as a substrate of another.
Therefore, dimerization  of the MST4 kinase domain is required for its transautophosphorylation.
  Functional Implications of the MST4-MO25 Complex  MST4 has been implicated in the regulation of cell polarity and  growth control (Dan et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2001; Ma et al.,  2007; Sung et al., 2003; ten Klooster et al., 2009).
In fact, the  other two GCK-III subfamily members MST3 and STK25, which  are highly homologous with MST4, are also involved in caspase-dependent or independent apoptosis (Chen et al., 2009;  Huang et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2010; Nogueira et al., 2008; Wu  et al., 2008, 2011).
  Our cell-based assays indicated that MST4 and MO25 associate together to promote apoptosis in HEK293T cells.
These  studies corroborated the structural and biochemical studies of  the MST4-MO25 complex.
We found that neither MST4 kinase  dead mutant (D162A) nor MST4 mutations (W324E and E58A/  E61A) that disrupt its interaction with MO25 could efficiently promote apoptosis.
Our results suggest that these MST4 mutants  play a dominant-negative role by forming homodimers with  endogenous MST4 and therefore preventing efficient MO25  Structure  Structure of MST4-MO25 Complex  456 Structure 21, 449461, March 5, 2013 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reservedstimulation on MST4.
Taken together, our observations suggest  that MO25-stimulated activation of MST4 promotes apoptosis,  but further studies are required to identify and dissect molecular  signaling pathways by which MST4 induces apoptosis.
  Conclusions  The actions of most kinases are regulated by different mechanisms involving phosphorylation, dimerization, subdomain and  subunit interactions, and coregulator binding.
Our study identifies a working model for MO25 stimulated MST4 activation, in  which binding of MO25 poses two major conformational effects  on MST4.
The first is to promote a closed conformation of the  active site by rotating the aC helix inward and formation of the  conserved K53-E70 ion pair; the second is to induce specific  homodimerization of the kinase domain, which is required  for trans-autophosphorylation of MST4 (Figure 7E).
After transautophosphorylation, conformational change of A-loop destabilizes the kinase domain-mediated MST4 homodimer, allowing  substrate binding.
This model is also applicable for the activation  Figure 5.
