M011600200  Markus G. Rudolph, Thomas Linnemann, Petra Gru newald, Alfred Wittinghofer,  Ingrid R. Vetter, and Christian Herrmann  From the Abteilung Strukturelle Biologie, Max-Planck-Institut fur Molekulare Physiologie, Otto-Hahn-Strasse 11,  44227 Dortmund, Germany  Proliferation, differentiation, and morphology of eucaryotic cells is regulated by a large network of signaling molecules.
Among the major players are members of  the Ras and Rho/Rac subfamilies of small GTPases that  bind to different sets of effector proteins.
Recognition of  multiple effectors is important for communicating signals into different pathways, leading to the question of  how an individual GTPase achieves tight binding to diverse targets.
To understand the observed specificity,  detailed information about binding energetics is expected to complement the information gained from the  three-dimensional structures of GTPase/effector protein  complexes.
Here, the thermodynamics of the interaction  of four closely related members of the Ras subfamily  with four different effectors and, additionally, the more  distantly related Cdc42/WASP couple were quantified  by means of isothermal titration calorimetry.
The heat  capacity changes upon complex formation were rationalized in light of the GTPase/effector complex structures.
Changes in enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity  of association with various Ras proteins are similar for  the same effector.
In contrast, although the structures of  the Ras-binding domains are similar, the thermodynamics of the Ras/Raf and Ras/Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator interactions are quite different.
The  energy profile of the Cdc42/WASP interaction is similar  to Ras/Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator,  despite largely different structures and interface areas  of the complexes.
Water molecules in the interface cannot fully account for the observed discrepancy but may  explain the large range of Ras/effector binding specificity.
The differences in the thermodynamic parameters,  particularly the entropy changes, could help in the design of effector-specific inhibitors that selectively block  a single pathway.
  Ras plays a central role in cellular signal transduction by  distributing many different extracellular signals into distinct  cellular responses through activation of various downstream  pathways (1).
In its resting state, Ras is in a GDP-bound form  and becomes activated by stimulated exchange of GDP for GTP  (2).
The GTP form of Ras binds more tightly to the so-called  effector molecules than the GDP form and as a result of this  interaction initiates, in the case of Raf, a protein phosphorylation cascade (3) that eventually leads to cell proliferation.
  Alternatively, other activities may be induced, such as RalGDS1 (4) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (5).
Using pull-down  or two-hybrid assays, many other proteins were identified as  Ras targets by their GTP-dependent association, all of which  are sensitive to mutations in the effector-binding region of Ras  (6).
However, for many of these Ras targets an assigned biological function is yet to be determined.
For instance, no sequence homology and no functional relationship has been ascribed to the putative Ras effectors AF6 (7) and Byr2 (8), the  Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of the mammalian  MEKK1 (9).
Another avenue of the signals distributed by Ras  leads to the Rho family of GTPases that consists of the members Rac, Rho, and Cdc42.
These proteins also control cell  proliferation but additionally are involved in the regulation of  the NADPH oxidase complex (10) and the reorganization of the  actin cytoskeleton (1113).
A key step in the latter process is  the interaction of Cdc42 with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome  protein WASP (1416).
  The three-dimensional structures of the RBDs of the effectors Raf and RalGDS were first determined by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography, respectively, and revealed the  same ubiquitin-like fold for both domains (1719).
The crystal  structures of the Ras/RalGDS-RBD and the Rap/Raf-RBD complexes have been solved (2023).
Besides a 30 rotation of the  RBD relative to Ras or Rap, the mode of binding to a Ras  protein is similar for Raf- and RalGDS-RBD in both complexes.
  The contacting areas of the molecules are anti-parallel  b-strands that are held together by interactions of predominantly hydrophilic amino acid side chains (Fig. 1).
Whether  this represents a paradigm for Ras/effector interactions is currently investigated by the structural determination of the  RBDs of Byr2 and AF6 (24, 25).
In contrast, the contact area of  the Cdc42/WASP complex contains predominantly hydrophobic  side chains, and it is much larger than in the Ras/effector  complexes (Fig. 1) (26).
  Rap, TC21, and R-Ras are closely related to Ras and similarly interact with the Ras effectors in a GTP-dependent fashion.
However, activation of enzymatic activity either could not  be demonstrated or is much smaller than that induced by Ras.
  The interactions of Ras proteins with some of the effectors show  large differences in individual affinities (27, 28).
Intriguingly,  Rap binds to some of the effectors more tightly than Ras, but  * This work was supported by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (to C. H.).

Details about the effector binding of Ras  proteins are known from biochemical and structural studies,  but the differences in their biological functions could not be  rationalized at the molecular level.
To learn more about the  origin of effector specificity for small GTP-binding proteins of  the Ras subfamily, we investigated the thermodynamic properties of these interactions by means of isothermal titration  calorimetry (ITC) and compared them to the thermodynamic  characteristics of the Cdc42/WASP system.
ITC is uniquely  suited for this study because it directly measures the enthalpy  of association, DH0  , and the affinity constant, Ka (30).
Striking  differences in the thermodynamic parameters are observed  even with the closely homologous complexes of Ras-related  proteins and effector RBDs that are difficult to reconcile with  their structural similarities.
The role of water in the protein/  protein interface that provides Ras proteins with a wide range  of binding specificity and possible implications for its biological  functions are discussed.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Protein Purification and Nucleotide ExchangeHa-Ras and Rap1A  used in this work are termed Ras and Rap, respectively.
Ras and Rap  were produced in Escherichia coli CK600K, whereas for all other proteins E. coli BL-21 was used.
Ras and Rap were cloned in ptac, and in  the case of Rap, pGRO/EL, encoding the E. coli Hsp60 chaperonin, was  co-transformed into the cells.
TC21 was cloned in pGEX 2T and R-Ras  in the pET 11a plasmid.
Only the RBDs of the effectors were used and  purified as described: Raf-RBD corresponding to residues 51131  cloned in pGEX 2T (31, 32), RalGDS-RBD 197 corresponding to residues 790886 cloned in pGEX 4T3 (27), AF6-RBD corresponding to  residues 1141 cloned in pGEX 4T3 (28), and Byr2 corresponding to  residues 65180 cloned in pGEX 2T (24).
Except for Byr2, which is from  S. pombe, all proteins were derived from the human sequence.
Gel  filtration of Byr2 yielded both a monomer and a dimer.
Only the monomer was used, which was stable for several hours.
The Ras proteins  were purified, and bound nucleotide was exchanged as described (27).
  Two different fragments of WASP were used in this study, termed W4  and W10 according to their molecular mass (in kDa), comprising amino  acid residues 222257 and 222310, respectively.
Cdc42 and W4 were  prepared as described previously (33).
GST-W10 containing an IgA  protease recognition sequence was incubated overnight with the protease (1:200 w/w) in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl.
After gel  filtration (Superdex 75) in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, the protein was  concentrated over a 5-kDa cut-off membrane.
All of the proteins were  shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280 C.
The protein purity  was greater than 90% as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining.
The protein  concentrations of GTPases and Ras effectors were measured by the  Bradford method (34) using bovine serum albumin as a standard,  whereas the W4 and W10 concentrations were determined according to  Gill and von Hippel (35) using absorption coefficients at 280 nm of 5690  and 6970 M21 cm21  , respectively.
  Spectroscopic and Calorimetric MeasurementsFluorescence measurements were performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 instrument with excitation and emission monochromators set to 360 and 450  nm, respectively, and slits set to 5 nm resolution.
The concentration of  RaszmantGppNHp was 50 nM, and the integration time was 2 s. The  data of the GDI assay were analyzed as described earlier (6, 27, 28).
  Far-UV CD spectra were recorded and converted to mean residue ellipticities as described previously (33).
  GTPase/effector interactions were measured using an isothermal  titration calorimeter (MCS-ITC, MicroCal, Inc.).
The primary ligand  was placed into a sensitively temperature-controlled cell, and the secondary ligand was placed into a syringe immersed into the cell (30).
The  concentrations of the primary ligand were 680 mM, and the concentration of the secondary ligand was set to 1020 times this value.
The  proteins were titrated by computer-controlled stepwise injections.
The  change in heating power was followed until equilibrium was reached  before the next injection was started.
Exothermic and endothermic  processes were reflected by negative and positive power pulses, respectively.
Saturation of the complex formation was reached when the heat  change leveled off to a constant background value because of dilution  effects.
This background was also measured in control experiments  where the secondary ligand was injected into buffer alone.
The background was subtracted from the integrated pulses, and the data were  analyzed using the manufacturers software yielding the stoichiometry  (N), the binary equilibrium association constant (Ka, which is equal to  [GTPasezGppNHpzeffector]/[GTPasezGppNHp]/[effector] and equal to  Kd  21  ), and the enthalpy of binding (DH0  ).
DH0 was assumed to be  independent of primary ligand concentration.
From the relationship  DG0 5 2RTlnKa and the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, the free energy of  binding (DG0  ) and the entropy of association (DS0  ) were calculated.
The  experimental error on DH0 is 510% and is predominantly governed by  the error on the protein concentration in the syringe, whereas the  experimental error on DG0 is 0.2 kcal/mol, corresponding to an error of  40% on Ka.
The upper limit of reliable determination of Ka is ;108 M21  .
  The data were averaged over two or three ITC experiments.
The result  for N was 1.0 6 0.2 for all measurements.
  FIG.
1. Interface areas of effector  complexes.
The figure illustrates the different modes of binding of the Rap/RafRBD complex (upper panel) and the  Cdc42-WASP complex (lower panel).
RafRBD and WASP are shown in green as  backbone worms, and the GTP-binding  proteins as molecular surfaces are colored  according to their electrostatic potential.
  The boundaries of the effector contact  area are marked by light green lines.
In  contrast to Raf-RBD, which displays a  rather flat interface, WASP wraps around  the GTP-binding protein in a largely extended conformation.
The buried surface  area is 1249 2 in the Rap/Raf-RBD complex and 2939 2 in the Cdc42/WASP  complex.
It is predominantly hydrophobic  in the Cdc42/WASP complex, whereas the  Rap/Raf-RBD complex has a strongly  charged interface.
The figure was prepared with GRASP (53).
  Thermodynamics of GTPase/Effector Interactions 23915   at Brown University on March 5, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from RESULTS  Direct Access to the Thermodynamics of GTPase/Effector  Systems through ITC  We have described previously a fluorescence-based method  (GDI assay) that allows accurate but indirect determination of  Ras/effector binding constants (6, 32).
In contrast, with ITC,  the enthalpy change DH0 and the association constant Ka are  directly measured and therefore precise.
Additionally, no  chemical modification of the system under study is necessary.
  To compare the results from ITC experiments with those  obtained by the GDI assay, we derived binding constants using  both approaches for the Ras/RalGDS-RBD system.
The dissociation rate of the RaszmantGppNHp complex was measured at  37 C as a function of RalGDS-RBD concentration as described  (27) (Fig. 2a).
In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, the derived Kd  value is 2.0-fold higher compared with the absence of NaCl.
  The Kd values resulting from ITC at 25 C using the same  buffers differ by a factor of 2.1, in excellent agreement with the  difference observed in the GDI assay.
This comparison is not  derogated by the fact that both experiments were done at  different temperatures because the binding partners are the  same, and only relative, not absolute comparison is made.
  To further test the possible influence of the fluorescent mant  group on effector binding, RaszmantGppNHp was used in ITC  experiments and titrated versus Raf-RBD and RalGDS-RBD,  respectively (data not shown).
The calculated Kd values are  about 1.5-fold smaller compared with the results obtained with  RaszGppNHp, which is close to the error range.
Thus, the mant  group at the ribose of the nucleotide has only a weak effect on  Ras/effector binding.
This contrasts with the Cdc42/WASP interaction in which both fluorescence and calorimetric titrations  reveal a 7-fold lower affinity of the WASP fragments for  Cdc42zmantGppNHp than for Cdc42zGppNHp (see Table II).
  WASP exhibits no significant GDI effect on Cdc42 but upon  binding decreases the Cdc42zmantGppNHp fluorescence (33),  which contrasts the Ras/effector interactions.
As a result, the  mant group does not seem to interfere with Ras/effector binding but does interfere in the Cdc42/WASP system.
  Proteins may form oligomers at the concentrations needed  for ITC, thereby possibly altering the thermodynamics of their  interaction.
This was tested for the Ras/RalGDS-RBD interaction at two different effector concentrations (6 and 50 mM; Fig.  3).
As anticipated for the absence of oligomerization, the results  for DH0 and Kd are almost identical, albeit less accurate in the  case of the lower effector concentration.
Thus, within experimental error, the results do not depend on the concentrations  used, which excludes the possibility of protein oligomerization.
  This finding is corroborated by the fact that all proteins used  here eluted as monomers in gel filtration studies.
Also, swapping of the primary and secondary ligand yielded the same  results for DH0 and Ka (data not shown).
  Proton release or uptake by amino acid side chains or the  protein termini upon association leads to additional enthalpy  effects and can be evaluated by performing ITC in buffers with  different protonation enthalpies (3639).
The protonation enthalpies for Tris and phosphate are 211.4 and 20.8 kcal/mol  (40), respectively, and this large difference should reliably allow the detection of a proton transfer process.
To determine  whether protons are exchanged during Ras/effector interactions and thereby influence the effector specificity of Ras, the  FIG. 2.

  23916 Thermodynamics of GTPase/Effector Interactions   at Brown University on March 5, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from binding of Ras to all four effector RBDs was measured in both  50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 100mM NaCl,  and 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl (Table  I).
Within experimental error, DH0 was buffer-independent for  RalGDS, Byr2, and AF6, which corresponds to no net proton  release or uptake upon complex formation.
Interestingly, the  Ras/Raf-RBD association has a DH0 value around 22.5 kcal/  mol in phosphate buffer (data not shown) and 25.2 kcal/mol in  Tris buffer and indicates a partial proton release upon formation of the Ras/Raf-RBD complex.
Because no net proton transfer is observed with the other three effectors, it may be inferred  that Raf-RBD can loose a proton upon binding to Ras.
Subtracting this proton transfer effect, the difference in the thermodynamic constants between Raf and RalGDS binding to Ras is  even more pronounced (see below).
  Enthalpy and Entropy Characteristics of GTPase/Effector  Binding  To quantify the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the  association reaction of small GTPases with their effectors, the  interactions of Ras, Rap, TC21, and R-Ras with the RBD of Raf,  RalGDS, Byr2, and AF6 were chosen.
Additionally, the complex  formation of Cdc42, a small GTPase of the Rho subfamily, with  its effector WASP was investigated.
  The Ras Subfamily and Its EffectorsTable I shows the  primary results of the ITC experiments, Ka and DH0  , together  with the calculated TDS0 values.
The binding constants observed and the resulting specificities for the different Ras proteins are similar to data obtained earlier by means of the GDI  method (27, 28).
Raf-RBD binds most strongly to Ras, whereas  AF6- and RalGDS-RBD bind more strongly to Rap.
The binding  of Byr2 to the Ras proteins is less differentiated, whereas TC21  and R-Ras have similar and moderate effector affinities.
  The comparison of the Ras proteins shows moderate differences in the thermodynamic constants.
The weaker binding of  Raf-RBD to Rap compared with Ras is due to a smaller enthalpy change, whereas the entropy changes are similar.
The  lower affinities of TC21 and R-Ras for Raf-RBD are due to less  positive entropy changes with the enthalpy changes being the  same.
The affinities of Rap for Raf-RBD and RalGDS-RBD are  inverse to those of Ras, and the stronger binding of RalGDSRBD to Rap compared with Ras is the result of a less unfavorable entropy change, whereas the enthalpy change stays the  same.
TC21 and R-Ras show large differences of DS0 and DH0  as compared with Ras that compensate each other almost entirely and lead to very similar affinities for RalGDS-RBD as  Ras.
The binding affinities to Byr2 are not significantly different for Ras and Rap, and the enthalpy and entropy changes are  the same and close to zero.
By contrast, significant differences  in Ras and Rap binding to AF6 are observed.
DH0 for Rap is less  favorable by 6.1 kcal/mol, but TDS0 is increased by 7.7 kcal/  mol, which increases Ka 15-fold.
  The binding of Raf-RBD to the Ras proteins is achieved to a  similar extent by both favorable enthalpy and entropy changes.
  In contrast, the interaction of RalGDS-RBD with the Ras proteins results from an unfavorable entropy change that is counteracted by a large negative change in enthalpy.
Byr2 and AF6  exhibit similar enthalpy and entropy changes upon GTPase  binding and lie in between the two extremes Raf and RalGDS;  their binding to Ras is motivated by a medium-sized decrease  in enthalpy, whereas the entropy change is close to zero.
  One of the most meaningful thermodynamic parameters in  terms of characterizing the nature of protein/protein interactions is the change in heat capacity, DCp  0 (4143).
Provided the  temperature dependence of DH0 is linear over the temperature  range studied, DCp  0 is obtained as the slope of a plot of DH0  versus the temperature.
Fig. 4a shows calorimetric titrations  FIG. 4.

All  protein complexes studied exhibit a decrease in heat capacity  upon association (Tables I and II), indicating that the complex  buries hydrophobic areas.
As with the observations on DH0 and  DS0  , the values of DCp  0 are largely different between the effectors, whereas similar results are obtained for both Ras and  Rap.
No apparent correlation exists between the DCp  0 and DH0  or DS0 values.
  The Rho Subfamily: Cdc42 and WASPTo compare the  thermodynamic data of Ras and effector proteins to a more  distantly related GTPase/effector couple, the interaction of  Cdc42, a member of the Rho/Rac family of small GTPases, with  two different fragments of its effector WASP was investigated.
  Although the RBD of Ras effectors is compactly folded, a short,  unstructured 4-kDa sequence (W4) in WASP containing the  Cdc42/Rac interactive binding motif is sufficient for Cdc42  binding (33).
Yet a 10-kDa fragment (W10) binds even more  tightly (Table II).
Effector-type binding of W10 is evidenced  by a 470-fold difference in the affinities for the GDP- and  GppNHp-bound form of Cdc42.
The affinity of Cdc42 and  WASP is at the high end compared with the Ras and effector  proteins.
Similar to the Ras/RalGDS complex, Cdc42 binding to  WASP is strongly favored by a large negative enthalpy change  that overcompensates for a negative entropy change.
Intriguingly, there is a large difference in the enthalpy and entropy  contributions for the W4 and W10 fragments.
Whereas the  enthalpy change becomes less favorable by 5.1 kcal/mol upon  extension of W4 to W10, the entropy change becomes less  unfavorable by 6.2 kcal/mol, which leads to the 7-fold stronger  binding of W10.
This large difference in entropy may reflect the  ordering of the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding motif in W10 in  a binding-competent conformation that is not present in W4.
  Indeed, the circular dichroism spectra of W4 and W10 reveal a  significant amount of secondary structure in W10 but not in W4  (data not shown).
Comparing the GTP and GDP complex of  Cdc42 binding to W10, the 470-fold drop in affinity is almost  exclusively due to a less favorable enthalpy change of 3.8 kcal/  mol for the GDP form, whereas the entropic contribution to  binding is virtually unaltered.
This could be interpreted as a  structural difference between the GTP and GDP states of  Cdc42 that does not affect the size of the interface area but only  the intermolecular distance or particular conformations of the  side chains involved.
This would lead to impaired hydrogen  bond or salt bridge formation between residues in the  Cdc42zGDP/W10 complex.
Alternatively, Cdc42zGDP may bind  WASP in a manner similar to Cdc42zGTP, but extra energy is  required to convert it to the GTP-like conformation.
  In contrast to the interaction of Ras and Rap with their  respective effectors, where the presence of 100 mM NaCl increases Ka by a factor of 2 or more, the Cdc42/WASP interaction  is not influenced by even the presence of 2 M NaCl (data not  shown).
This indicates that the interaction between Cdc42 and  its effector WASP is of a strongly hydrophobic nature, whereas  the Ras and Rap interaction with their effectors has strong  electrostatic components.
  Mutants of Ras and Raf-RBDFrom the comparison of the  GTPase/effector systems, it is apparent that enthalpy and entropy changes are not directly evident from the high resolution  crystal structures of the protein complexes.
Even closely related proteins, as investigated here, show large variations in  their thermodynamic parameters.
To test whether single  amino acid residues are responsible for this, we extended our  studies using mutants of Ras and Raf-RBD.
Residues to be  mutated were selected among those that are involved in the  interaction.
Table III collects the DH0 and TDS0 values for Ras  mutants that bind to wild type Raf and vice versa for Raf  mutants that bind to Ras.
Relatively small changes in comparison with the wild type proteins are observed.
No mutation  causes a change of more than 2 kcal/mol in DH0 or TDS0  .
A  clearly consistent effect of the elimination of a distinct residue  on DH0 or TDS0 cannot be recognized among this limited number of mutants.
In conclusion, the differences in binding energetics observed for the different effectors are much larger than  effects that can be evoked by single residues.
  Comparison of Measured and Calculated Heat Capacity of  Binding  From structural and protein folding studies, an empirical  relationship between the heat capacity of folding DCp  0 and the  change in the accessible surface area (DASA) was derived (44)  as follows.
  DCp 5 0.45 cal/(mol K 2  ) DASAapolar  2 0.26 cal/(mol K 2  ) DASApolar (Eq. 1)  The apolar surface area that becomes buried in the interior of  the protein upon folding results in a negative change of the  heat capacity, whereas polar amino acid residues have a positive contribution that is smaller in amount.
Protein folding and  protein/protein association may be regarded as related because  in both processes surface area is buried in the interior of a  protein or a protein complex, respectively.
For some of the  Ras/effector complexes, the three-dimensional structures are  known, namely for Rap/Raf-RBD (20), for Rap(E30D/K31E)/  Raf-RBD (21), for Ras(E31K)/RalGDS-RBD (22), and for Ras/  RalGDS-RBD (23).

The  interface areas are similar in size, and the polar areas are  about twice as large as the apolar areas (Fig. 1 and Table IV).
  A similar number of polar and apolar amino acid side chain  interactions constitutes the complex interface.
This lead to  calculated DCp  0 values for all complexes close to 0 that do not  agree with the experimental results (Table IV).
Whereas in  protein folding essentially all solvent molecules are stripped off  the protein surface to become part of the protein core, many  examples are known where water molecules are bound at complex interfaces.
Consequently, the interface area of the Ras/  effector complexes may not be completely desolvated, and the  number of water molecules needs to be taken into account for  the calculation of DCp  0  .
The crystal structures of Rap/Raf-RBD  and Ras/RalGDS-RBD show water molecules that bridge amino  acid residues of the interacting proteins by simultaneously  forming hydrogen bonds to both proteins.
Although different  numbers of such water molecules are observed in the different  complexes (Table IV), they cannot by far account for the different experimental DCp  0 values or for the discrepancy to the  calculated values.
In addition, the different temperatures of  x-ray data collection (277K for the Raf-RBD complexes and 92K  for the RalGDS-RBD complex) and the different resolution  ranges of the structures (1.82.1 ) have to be considered,  which may lead to the different numbers of water molecules  found in the structures.
Interestingly, for the Cdc42/WASP  complex the measured and calculated DCp  0 values are very  similar (Table IV).
The hydrophobic nature of this interface  may prevent water molecules from being trapped upon complex  formation.
Thus, the equation for the calculation of DCp  0 from  the interprotein surface areas may be useful only for complex  interfaces that are highly hydrophobic in nature.
  DISCUSSION  The interaction of Ras with various effectors is essential for  signal transduction into different pathways and is the basis for  its high functional diversity.
However, the biological importance of the closely related Ras proteins that bind to the same  effectors still remains elusive.
The effectors differ both in their  functions and in their primary sequences, but it appears that a  small domain in each of them, 80140 amino acid residues in  size and located in different parts of the effector, is responsible  for Ras binding.
Similarly, a sequence in WASP is responsible  for its interaction with Cdc42 (33, 45), and in this study a 4-  and a 10-kDa fragment were used.
For the interactions of Ras  proteins and effectors very different affinities were reported  that span 3 orders of magnitude and thereby indicate a possible  biological significance (27, 28).
In addition, the three-dimensional structures of RalGDS- and Raf-RBD revealed an identical fold and a docking similar to that of the Ras protein (2023).
  Here, we wanted to characterize the underlying binding energetics by quantifying the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the GTPase/effector association reactions.
This should  provide information about the type of binding that can be  grouped in a first approach into hydrophilic and hydrophobic  interactions.
The latter are believed to result predominantly in  favorable entropy changes because strongly constrained water  molecules from the surface of hydrophobic amino acid side  chains are released into bulk water on complex formation (41).
  In contrast, the change in entropy caused by contact formation  between hydrophilic residues should be small because the number of hydrogen bonds including inter-water binding does not  change (46).
However, the global conformational changes and  the restriction of side chain mobility may substantially contribute to a decrease in entropy (see below).
Although desolvation  is entropically favored, a penalty in enthalpy must be paid that  needs to be counterbalanced by formation of polar interactions  such as hydrogen bonds and salt bridges.
A priori it is difficult  to predict the net energy outcome because many single molecular events with large individual changes in enthalpy and  entropy contribute to the association process (46).
These for the  most part compensate each other and result in relatively small DH0  and DS0 values.
We have tried to investigate to what extent the  high homology among the Ras proteins and the same topology of  Raf-RBD and RalGDS-RBD is reflected in the similarity of their  binding energy profile and compared them to a different type of  small GTPase/effector interaction, the Cdc42/WASP complex.
  Considering the structural similarities of Raf- and RalGDSRBD and their similar type of interaction with the Ras proteins  (2023) with respect to the number of hydrogen bonds and salt  bridges and the size of the hydrophobic interface area, more  similar thermodynamic parameters might have been expected.
  The opposite sign in the change of entropy for Raf and RalGDS  binding, which leads to a difference of more than 10 kcal/mol in  TDS0  , is an especially intriguing finding and difficult to explain  from the structures.
We can exclude proton transfer reactions  from being responsible for the difference in the thermodynamic  constants, because only a small buffer-dependent effect on DH0  was visible for Raf-RBD.
No single amino acid residue causes  the large differences either because mutants resulted only in  moderate changes of DH0 and TDS0  .
Rather, the large differences in DH0 and TDS0 for the interaction of Ras proteins with  Raf and RalGDS might indicate a different mode of binding  that is not obvious from the three-dimensional structure.
  The hydrophobic effect, commonly believed to increase the  entropy, cannot account for this difference because the apolar  interface area in the Rap/Raf complex is even slightly smaller  than in the Ras/RalGDS complex.
The maximum gain in entropy by the transfer of protein-bound water to bulk solution is  7 cal/(mol K) corresponding to TDS0 # 2 kcal/mol at 25 C (47).

  Thermodynamics of GTPase/Effector Interactions 23919   at Brown University on March 5, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from If the strongly bound water molecules were responsible for the  observed entropy effects, Raf binding should release at least six  water molecules more than RalGDS binding.
This seems unlikely, because there are no clefts or other sites on the Raf-RBD  surface that could fix water.
In fact, the interface volumes of  the x-ray structures suggest the same number of water molecules in the Rap/Raf and Ras/RalGDS complexes (21, 22).
  Another source of entropy change is the loss of side chain  flexibility or conformational freedom of the protein backbone.
  Comparison of the RBD structures in the free state (1719) and  in the complexes reveals no major structural rearrangements.
  Huang et al. (22) suggest that a conformational difference  between free and complexed RalGDS-RBD, localized in loops  b1/b2 and a1/b3, might play a role in the activation of the  catalytic domain.
However, the Ca root mean square deviation  of 1.3  is not exceedingly large.
A decrease in entropy as  observed here for Ras/RalGDS binding would support this notion if this structural rearrangement resulted in decreased  conformational freedom of the complex.
However, this evidence  is weak, and the structures of the free and complexed proteins  do not have significantly different temperature factors indicating similar main chain mobility.
It is difficult to quantitatively  relate structural to entropy changes, and here not even the  large differences in DS0 between Raf- and RalGDS-RBD can be  attributed to obvious structural differences.
In conclusion, subtle conformational changes of amino acid side chains or loop  regions or incorporation of solvent molecules into the binding  site may lead to the large observed differences in entropy.
  Additionally, a change in hydration of bound metal ions can  also contribute to the DS0 value, but a different influence of the  effectors on the environment of the nucleotide-bound Mg21 ion  seems to be unlikely.
  The heat capacity changes are also different for all effectors  and are not reconcilable with the empirical relationship between DCp  0 and the burial of surface area in protein folding.
A  more refined set of parameters taking a different contribution  of Ser and Thr into account (43, 48) or using a set of parameters  derived from hydrophobic model compounds (49, 50) does not  lead to an agreement either.
In protein folding the change in  heat capacity is predominantly due to a change in hydration  (95%).
Noncovalent bond formation contributes to DCp  0 only by  5% (43), and these figures should be essentially the same for  protein/protein association.
Even a significant difference in the  number of noncovalent bonds in the effector complexes could  not explain the large differences of the DCp  0 values.
But similar  to the differences in the DS0 values, the decrease of polar and  apolar surface area upon complex formation cannot explain the  experimental DCp  0 results.
According to the interface areas of  the complexes and their similar partitioning into hydrophilic  and hydrophobic parts, DCp  0 should be roughly the same for the  Raf and RalGDS complexes, which is not the case.
The possibility of small conformational changes unique for each complex  that may influence the change in heat capacity cannot be  excluded.
  The thermodynamic results for the Cdc42/WASP couple  strongly resemble the values obtained for the interaction of  Rap or Ras with RalGDS, although the interaction is very  different from the two structural points of view.
First, the  WASP fragments appear to be less structured in their free form  (33) than the RBDs, and therefore a large conformational  change must parallel the binding process.
Second, the WASP  fragments do not form a globular domain when bound to Cdc42,  but part of it, including the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding  motif, wraps around Cdc42 leading to an interface area more  than twice as large as in the Ras/effector complexes (26).
This  results in unpredictable thermodynamics because the enthalpy  and entropy changes are probably a combination of peptide  folding and Cdc42 binding and impossible to disentangle.
  Our results do not allow general conclusions as to how the  GTPase/effector structures and their changes with respect to  the free proteins are related to the thermodynamics of their  interactions.
Nevertheless, the data reported here indicate that  the effectors not only exert different Ras affinities but also  show fundamental differences in their binding modes that in  turn could be used to develop inhibitors for specific signaling  pathways.
The differences in DS0 may prove particularly useful  in complementing electrostatic force field models that underlie  conventional calculations of biomolecular interactions.
Future  work shall address in more detail the role of interfacial water  by heat capacity measurements (44, 50) and osmotic stress  experiments (51).
Double mutant cycle analysis (52) will help  quantify the contributions of single amino acids.
This knowledge will ultimately be useful not only to block Ras/effector  function but also for the general understanding of protein/  protein interaction in the cell and how to interfere with it in a  rational approach.
