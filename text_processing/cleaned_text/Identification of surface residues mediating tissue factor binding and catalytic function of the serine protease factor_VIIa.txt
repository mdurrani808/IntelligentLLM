DICKINSON, CURTIS R. KELLY, AND WOLFRAM RUF*  Departments of Immunology and Vascular Biology, IMM-17, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037  Communicated by Robert Huber, Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany, September 30, 1996 (received for review  June 5, 1996)  ABSTRACT Factor VIIa (VIIa), the serine protease that  initiates the coagulation pathways, is catalytically activated  upon binding to its cell surface receptor and cofactor tissue  factor (TF).
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of  the functional surface of VIIa by alanine scanning mutagenesis of 112 residues.
Residue side chains were defined which  contribute to TF binding and factor X hydrolysis.
Energetically important binding contacts at the interface with TF were  identified in the first epidermal growth factor domain of VIIa  (Gln-64, Ile-69, Phe-71, Arg-79) and in the protease domain  (Arg-277, Met-306, Asp-309).
The observed energetic defects  are in good agreement with the corresponding residues in TF,  suggesting that the VIIa light chain plays a prominent role in  high affinity binding of cofactor.
Mutation of protease domain  interface residues indicated that TF allosterically influences  the active site of VIIa.
Stabilization of a labile zymogen to  enzyme transition could explain the activating effect of TF on  VIIa catalytic function.
Residues important for factor X  hydrolysis were found in three regions of the protease domain:  (i) specificity determinants in the catalytic cleft and adjacent  loops, (ii) an exosite near the TF binding site, and (iii) a large  electronegative exosite which is in a position analogous to the  basic exosite I of thrombin.
TF regions involved in factor X  activation are positioned on the same face of the TFzVIIa  complex as the two exosites identified on the protease domain  surface, providing evidence for an extended interaction of  TFzVIIa with macromolecular substrate.
  Coagulation factor VIIa (VIIa) is the initiating protease of the  coagulation pathways (1).
VIIa binds to its cellular receptor  and catalytic cofactor, the transmembrane glycoprotein tissue  factor (TF).
Interaction of VIIa with TF markedly enhances  the catalytic activity of the serine protease which is a poor  enzyme when free in solution.
However, the mechanism by  which the cofactor achieves this activation is unknown.
VIIa is  a multidomain enzyme characterized by an amino-terminal  g-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (Gla) domain, two epidermal  growth factor (EGF)-like modules and a trypsin-like serine  protease domain.
Various experimental approaches indicate  that the Gla-domain, the first EGF domain (EGF1), and the  protease domain provide the most significant contributions to  the interaction with TF (reviewed in ref. 2).
The recently  determined three-dimensional structure of the TFzVIIa complex revealed a discontinuous interaction involving each domain of VIIa and the two fibronectin type III modules that  constitute the cytokine receptor-like extracellular domain of  TF (3).
  While extensive mutagenesis of TF has defined the functional and energetic importance of residues that interface with  VIIa, there is little information on the contributions of specific  amino acid side chains in VIIa to TF binding or proteolytic  function.
The following surface-exposed residues in VIIa are  known to play a functionally important role: Arg-79 in EGF1  (4, 5) and Arg-304 [c162] (6, 7) in the protease domain are  implicated in binding to TF; whereas Arg-290 [c148] (8) and  Lys-341 [c192] (9) are critical for proteolytic function and  substrate specificity of VIIa.
In the present study, we used the  structurally conservative approach of alanine scanning mutagenesis of surface residues (10) to establish an extensive list  of residues that are functionally involved in cofactor interaction and substrate factor X (X) activation.
We provide evidence that EGF1 predominantly tethers the protease to its  receptor, whereas specific interactions of protease domain  residues with TF are required for full catalytic function of the  bound protease.
The location of catalytically important residues in the VIIa protease domain provides further insight into  the potential mechanisms of protease activation through cofactor interaction.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Homology Modeling.
Homology models for the threedimensional structure of VIIa domains were generated using  Homology in InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Waltham,  MA).
Xa (11) was the primary reference source for the  structure of the catalytic domain docked with the EGF2  domain.
Certain nonconserved loops were built using coordinates from neutrophil elastase (12) (residues 1621 for VIIa  residues 153158 [c1621], 3341 for 170177 [c3341], and  144153 for 287295 [c144153]), streptomyces trypsin (13)  (residues 5967 for VIIa residues 195203 [c5963]), human  trypsinogen (14) (residues 6981 for VIIa residues 209221  [c6981]), and citrate synthase (15) (residues 190198 for VIIa  residues 313321 [c171174]).
According to the classification  of Morris et al. (16), the overall structure quality of the model  was rated class 2 for phi-psi distribution, class 1 for chi-1  standard deviation, and class 3 for hydrogen bonding energy.
  Using PROCHECK (17) there are no bad contacts and only  Asn-240 [c100] was found in a unfavorable region of the  Ramachandran plot.
The EGF1 domain was modeled upon the  respective module of factor IX (18) and rated class 1, 1, and 2,  respectively, with no bad contacts.

The preparation contained ,1  pM VIIy100 nM X.  Mutagenesis and VII Expression.
The VII coding sequence  in pED4 (8) was used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis  (20).
All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
  Mutated proteins were transiently expressed by transfecting  Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells using lipofectamine  (BRL).
Cells were maintained in serum-free Excel 301 (JRH  Scientific, Lenexa, KS) for 48 h to collect VII containing  supernatant which was concentrated with a Centricon 30  (Amicon), if necessary.
VII in serum-free culture supernatant  from stably transfected cells was isolated by a Ca21-dependent  anti-VII antibody followed by ion exchange chromatography  with elution by Ca21 gradient to select for fully g-carboxylated  VII (8).
VIIAla-287 did not spontaneously activate during purification and this mutant was activated with factor IXa  following repurification by ion exchange chromatography.
All  other mutants and wild-type VIIa converted .90% to the  active enzyme during the purification.
  Functional Characterization of Mutants.
Serum-free supernatants from transiently transfected cells were analyzed by  ELISA to determine the concentration of secreted wild-type  or mutant VII.
The assay used two light chain reactive mAbs  (F5-8A1 and F4-2.1B) with the biotinylated detection antibody  directed to the Ca21-dependent conformation of the VII Gla  domain.
The standard curve was generated with purified VII,  and interassay variability was assessed by an internal standard.
  For all light chain mutants, the concentration was confirmed  by an alternative ELISA employing antibodies reactive with  the VII protease domain.
The binding of mutant VII to TF and  the catalytic function of VII when in complex with TF was  analyzed in a functional assay, which had previously been used  to characterize mutants of TF (21, 22).
A fixed concentration  of TF (5 pM) was saturated with increasing concentrations of  VII in the serum-free culture supernatant, followed by measuring activation of 100 nM X to Xa.
Rates of Xa generation  versus the VII concentration were fitted to the single site  binding equation, as described by Krishnaswamy (23).
This  calculation yielded apparent dissociation constants (KDapp) as  well as the maximum rate of Xa generation as a measure of the  proteolytic function of the mutant VIIa in complex with TF.
  Characterization of Peptidyl Substrate Hydrolysis by VIIa  in Complex with Soluble TF1218.
A fixed concentration of  mutant or wild-type VIIa (5 nM) was saturated with increasing  concentrations of TF1218, followed by monitoring of the  hydrolysis of 1 mM chromogenic substrate Chromozym tPA  (Boehringer Mannheim), S2366 (Chromogenix, Molndal, Sweden), or Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) at 405 nM. Apparent dissociation constants for these  experiments were calculated based on the saturation curves as  described above.
  Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of VIIa Binding to TF.
  In a BIAcore 2000 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) the flow cell was  equilibrated with 10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM  CaCl2, 1 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-  propanesulfonate (CHAPS), and 0.005% surfactant P20 and  the same buffer was used for all washes at a flow rate of 10  mlymin.
Full-length TF1263 solubilized in 1 mM CHAPS was  captured by a non-inhibitory anti-TF mAb (10H10) (24) which  was immobilized to the sensor chip surface by amine coupling.
  Association of wild-type or mutant VIIa was monitored during  injection of 12 nM to 2 mM VIIa onto the TF-saturated sensor  chip.
VIIa dissociation was monitored over 5 min after return  to buffer flow.
After each analysis, bound VIIa was completely  eluted by injection of 100 mM EDTA, and the antibody was  saturated by a new injection of TF1263.
The kinetic binding  constants (ka, kd, and KD) were determined by nonlinear  regression analysis as described previously for the TFzVIIa  interaction (25) with software from the manufacturer.
The  calculation of the association rate constant (ka) was based on  multiple association sensograms with at least five different  VIIa concentrations.
The dissociation rate constant (kd) was  calculated from the initial dissociation phase of the binding  curves, and the equilibrium dissociation constant KD equals  the ratio of kdyka.
  RESULTS  Mutational Analysis of VII.
Alanine scanning mutagenesis  of solvent-exposed residue side chains is a proven strategy to  define functional regions in proteins (10).
We generated  models for the structural domains of VII to predict solventaccessible residue side chains in the VII EGF1, EGF2, and  protease domains.
One hundred and twelve residues of VII  were individually replaced with Ala, and these mutants were  tested for both TF binding and proteolytic function in a linked  functional assay.
This assay has proven reliable in identifying  functional defects resulting from mutations in TF (21, 22).
The  analysis (Fig. 1) of transiently expressed Ala mutants at  positions known to affect TF binding (Arg-79) (4, 5), proteolytic function {Arg-290 [c148] (8) and Lys-341 [c192] (9)}, or  to produce a combined defect in TF binding and proteolytic  function {Arg-304 [c162] (6, 7)} demonstrated that the functional assay has the sensitivity to discriminate between specific  functional defects resulting from single residue replacements  in VII.
  Light Chain Mutations That Reduced Affinity for TF.
We  hypothesized that a hydrophobic face on the EGF1 homology  model was a likely docking site for TF.
Ala replacements of  Lys-62, Gln-64, Ile-69, Phe-71, and Arg-79 had a significant  impact on the binding of TF.
The largest reduction in the  calculated free energy of binding was 1.9 kcalymol for the  mutant at Ile-69.
Mutants in EGF1 which were defective in TF  binding generally appeared to have normal proteolytic activity  (Fig. 1).
We attribute the slightly reduced maximal rate of Xa  generation by the Ile-69 mutant to technical difficulties in  achieving full saturation due to the severe binding defect.
  Other selected mutations in EGF1 and EGF2 showed no  defect in the functional assay.
  Mutations in the Protease Domain That Affect Proteolytic  Function.
Out of 97 Ala mutations in the protease domain, 33  substitutions resulted in a reduction of proteolytic function  without affecting TF binding, whereas 5 mutant proteins had  essentially unmeasurable activity in the functional assay (Fig.  1).
Mutations affecting proteolytic function are mapped to the  face of the VIIa protease domain displayed in Fig. 2.
Among  the residue replacements within the catalytic cleft, the most  significant functional defects were observed for (from left to  right): Gln-366 [c217], Trp-364 [c215] (inactive), Leu-177 [c41]  (inactive), Gln-176 [c40], Thr-293 [c151], and Leu-213 [c73].
  The catalytic triad (in red) is flanked by two functionally  important regions.
In the loop 236239 [c96-99] (Fig. 2 Left),  residue Thr-239 [c99] contributes to X activation.
We also  observed a similar mutational effect at an adjacent residue,  Asn-240 [c100], which is more buried (not visible in Fig. 2), and  attribute the loss of function to conformational effects on  Thr-239 [c99].
Secondly, Lys-341 [c192] and Arg-290 [c148],  previously shown to be important for catalytic function (8, 9),  constitute a prominent basic cluster just below the catalytic triad.
  These basic residues and the amino terminus ([c1622])  separate two potential exosite regions located below the cleft.
  (i) Positioned near the TF interface (Fig. 2 Left), substitutions  at Val-371 [c223], Ser-336 [c187], and Asp-334 [c185B] caused  functional defects, whereas mutation of the adjacent Lys-337  [c188] actually enhanced proteolytic function.
(ii) To the right,  a large cluster of mutations which caused catalytic defects  extended from the exit of the catalytic cleft downwards to  where the amino-terminal Ile-153 [c16] inserts to form the  activating salt-bridge with Asp-343 [c194].
This exosite also  14380 Biochemistry: Dickinson et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 (1996)includes the trypsin-analogous Ca21 binding site at its right  perimeter.
Consistent with previous analysis (29), replacements of the Ca21-coordinating residue side chains Glu-210  [c70] and Glu-220 [c80] affected catalytic function of VIIa.
The  mutational effect at these positions is likely due to structural  effects on other residues in this loop, most notably Asp-212  [c72] and Leu-213 [c73], the latter being located in the catalytic  cleft.
Marked defects were further observed for mutations of  Glu-296 [c154], which may contribute to the exosite, and  Met-298 [c156] and Leu-287 [c144] (inactive) which may affect  stabilization of the activating insertion of the protease domain  amino terminus.
We exclude overall conformational defects of  the Leu-287 [c144] mutant, based on the normal binding to TF  (Table 1).
Most functionally important residues are located in  or below the catalytic cleft.
We observed only a modest defect  for mutation of Lys-197 [c60A], located above the catalytic  triad.
Moreover, only subtle effects on X activation were detected  upon mutations in the Gln-313 [c171] to Glu-325 [c178] loop  which has a uniquely extended conformation in VIIa (3) and is  located at the left perimeter of the display in Fig. 2.
  Protease Domain Mutations Which Reduced Affinity for  TF.
A limited number of protease domain residue mutants  i.e., Arg-277 [c134], Pro-303 [c161], Arg-304 [c162], Leu-305  [c163], Met-306 [c164], Asp-309 [c167], and Arg-379 [c230]  had reduced affinity for TF with modest losses in the calculated free energy of binding ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 kcalymol.
  In contrast to residues in EGF1, all protease domain substitutions that caused cofactor binding defects were also defective  in proteolytic function.
To exclude the possibility that the  increase in KDapp resulted from limitations of the functional  assay, we purified prototypic mutants and analyzed binding by  surface plasmon resonance.
We also analyzed the Lys-341  [c192] replacement in the catalytic cleft which had a selective  defect in catalytic function (Fig. 1).
This mutant displayed TF  binding characteristics indistinguishable from wild-type VIIa  (Table 1).
In contrast, mutants in the TF interface at position  Arg-277 [c134] and Met-306 [c164] had concordantly reduced  affinity when analyzed by direct binding measurements (BIAcore) or by functional assay.
Both mutations selectively affected the dissociation of VIIa from TF, demonstrating that  protease domain interactions indeed contribute to the stability  of the TFzVIIa complex.
  In agreement with results obtained with transiently expressed proteins, VIIaAla-277 and VIIaAla-306 both had reduced  proteolytic function (Table 1).
To explore the possibility that  the mutation of these interface residues interfered with activating allosteric changes of the active site induced by TF  binding, both mutants were saturated with increasing concentrations of soluble TF extracellular domain (TF1218) and  analyzed for amidolytic function (Fig. 3).
The replacement of  Met-306 [c164] reduced amidolytic function of VIIa in complex with TF to an extent which fully accounted for the  proteolytic defect (Fig. 1 and Table 1).
In contrast, the  reductions in hydrolysis of peptidyl p-nitroanilide chromogenic  substrates upon Arg-277 [c134] substitution were less pronounced, despite the fact that the proteolytic defect of this  mutant exceeded that of the Met-306 [c164] replacement.

  DISCUSSION  The identification of functionally important residues by the  comprehensive mutational analysis of VII presented here  complements the recently determined crystal structure of the  TFzVIIa complex (3).
VIIa contacts TF through an extended  interface involving (i) the Gla domain with the carboxylterminal module near the membrane insertion, (ii) EGF1 with  the TF intermodule interface, and (iii) a protease domain  EGF2 surface contacting the amino-terminal TF module.
The  energetically most significant contacts were found at the EGF1  interface where Ile-69, Phe-71, and Arg-79 account for a total  of 4.2 kcalymol of the free energy of binding to TF.
The  respective cofactor contacts, TF residues Lys-20, Ile-22, and  Phe-140, together contribute 5.4 kcalymol (21), thus demonstrating good energetic complementarity of the two interfaces.
  In contrast to the important energetic contribution of the  hydrophobic face of EGF1, the major contact residues in  EGF2 (Gln-88, Val-92, Asn-93) had negligible effect on TF  binding, consistent with mutational analysis of TF residue  Phe-50 (22) which packs into the EGF2 interface.
Of several  protease domain contacts with TF, only Arg-277 [c134], Met306 [c164], and Asp-309 [c167] substitutions affected cofactor  Table 1.

Free energies of binding were calculated based on DG 5 2RT ln  (1yKD), DDG is the change in DG for mutants as compared to wild-type VIIa.
KDapp from the functional assay are in pM, whereas KD from BIAcore  analysis are in nM. It is unclear whether these differences result from the presence of substrate.
However, calculated DDG values demonstrate  consistent results in assessing the functional defect of mutations.

The contribution of the protease domain to TF  binding was about 2 kcalymol, in agreement with the mutational effect of reciprocal TF residues Phe-76, Tyr-94, and  Trp-45 which contribute 2.9 kcalymol (30).
We have identified  protease domain residues (Pro-303 [c161], Leu-305 [c163],  Arg-379 [c230]) which displayed binding defects upon substitution but did not contact TF in the crystal structure.
The  location of these residues suggests that they function indirectly  through the local structural presentation of TF binding residues.
The protease domain contact is weaker than the hydrophobic EGF1 contact, an observation that fits well with the  atypical nature of TFprotease domain interface which contains several water molecules.
The role of the EGF1 contact  thus appears to be high affinity binding of TF, tethering the  protease domain to the cofactor and relieving this interaction  of high affinity constraints which could interfere with its  activating function.
EGF1 residue replacements with TF binding defects were normal in proteolytic function, while all of the  protease domain interface mutants with decreased cofactor  affinity had substantial reductions in proteolytic function.
  The activation of the protease by cofactor binding may  involve substantial conformational changes.
The flexibility of  the light chain of VIIa may allow protease domain interactions  that block substrate access, and cofactor binding may release  this autoinhibition through reorientation of the light chain and  protease domain of VIIa.
Because the overall docking of VIIa  with TF should be largely unaffected by site-specific mutants  in the contacts, the pronounced reduction in proteolytic  function of single residue replacement mutants in the protease  domain interface with TF indicates more specific cofactor  effects on protease conformation.
A more localized mechanism of autoinhibition was inferred from the crystal structure  of the TFzVIIa complex which showed a flexible, extended  loop of residues Gln-313 [c171] to Glu-325 [c178] that in free  VIIa might block access to the catalytic cleft or even prevent  the activating amino-terminal insertion (3).
Since this loop  extends from the energetically important Met-306 [c164] and  Asp-309 [c167] contact with TF, cofactor interactions may  directly influence the loop conformation.
Although such a  regulatory role of this loop cannot be excluded by our mutational analysis, it is notable that mutations in this loop had only  subtle effects on proteolytic function of VIIa.
  A potential mechanism by which TF may activate VIIa is  through stabilization of the active conformation of the protease domain.
This may involve conformational changes of the  Cys-329 [c182] to Ser-339 [c190] loop which is disulfide linked  to the Thr-307 [c165]Cys-310 [c168] a-helix at the TF interface.
In these segments, partially buried residues Thr-307  [c165] and Tyr-332 [c185] contribute to catalytic function and  are thus potentially involved in a TF-induced allosteric switch.
  The [c182190] loop is part of the activation domain, a  region of increased flexibility in zymogens as compared with  active enzymes, as defined by structural analysis of trypsinogen  and chymotrypsinogen activation (31).
In thrombin, the same  loop is involved in coordination of a Na1-ion which results in  allosteric changes responsible for a switch in substrate specificity (32).
If the allosteric change proposed for VIIa activation  is analogous to allosteric switches of trypsin and thrombin, TF  may ultimately affect Asp-338 [c189] which provides recognition of the basic P1 (33) residue in trypsin-like serine proteases.
  Consistent with the notion that cofactor interaction influences  the active site of VIIa, we found reduced hydrolysis of small  peptidyl substrates as a result of replacement of the TF binding  residue Met-306 [c164].
However, substitution of another TF  binding residue, Arg-277 [c134], caused a less pronounced  defect in amidolytic function and a more substantial reduction  in macromolecular substrate activation.
A similar mutational  effect has been found for TF residue Asp-44 (34) which likely  has indirect effects on Arg-277 [c134] interactions, based on  the spatial arrangement of interface residues in the structure  of TFzVIIa (3).
These data support the concept that the  activating effect of cofactor may include changes in extended  recognition of substrate.
  TF interactions with the VIIa protease domain appear to  stabilize the amino-terminal insertion of Ile-153 [c16] (35).
  The crystal structure of the TFzVIIa complex demonstrated  that the amino terminus of the protease domain does not  directly contact TF, and therefore the amino-terminal insertion must be stabilized through indirect effects.
Since Ile  [c16]Asp [c194] salt-bridge formation is energetically interdependent with stabilization of the activation domain (31),  the favored amino-terminal insertion in the presence of cofactor lends support to the concept that TF interactions induce  allosteric changes similar to those observed in zymogen-toenzyme conversion of cofactor-independent serine proteases.
  Moreover, functionally important residues Leu-287 [c144] and  Met-298 [c156] at the insertion site were found at positions  which in tissue type plasminogen activator are surface exposed  and involved in regulating its zymogenicity (36).
  Surface residues which were important for catalytic function  are found on the front face of the protease domain as viewed  in Fig. 2.
Besides residues which form the bottom of the  catalytic cleft, determinants for substrate recognition are  provided by residues in the rim of the cleft: Thr-239 [c99] is  probably involved in P2 recognition, whereas Lys-341 [c192]  could contribute to P9 recognition (9).
Unlike the Lys-341 3  Gln exchange (9), we found a reduction in amidolytic function  for the Ala replacement of Lys-341 [c192] (Fig. 3), suggesting  that the aliphatic side chain has also some role in forming the  P1 and possibly the P3 specificity site.
  Macromolecular substrate assembly may further involve two  potential exosites, one of which is between the entrance to the  catalytic cleft and the TF binding site.
Notably, this exosite  region is part of the activation domain, indicating that cofactor  interactions may influence functionally important surface  residue side chains.
Sequences amino terminal to the S3  residue in the activation peptide of X have little importance for  the interaction with TFzVIIa (37), suggesting that the activation peptide may not directly interact with this exosite located  some distance from the P side of the catalytic cleft.
The other  potential exosite is located at the P9 side of the catalytic cleft  and stretches from the groove which accommodates the protease domain amino terminus to the high affinity Ca21 binding  site, known to be important for catalytic function of VIIa (29,  38).
The surface of this region, as modeled, was found to be  highly electronegative (Fig. 2 Inset).
VIIa thus differs from  thrombin in which the analogous exosite I is positively charged  (39, 40).
  FIG. 3.
Effect of Ala substitutions of VIIa protease domain  residues on amidolytic function of TFzVIIa.
The rate of hydrolysis of  Chromozym tPA by 5 nM mutant or wild-type VIIa is shown versus the  concentration of soluble TF1218.
Binding defects are apparent for  mutations of Arg-277 [c134] (KDapp 5 73 6 1 nM) and Met-306 [c164]  (KDapp 5 77 6 16 nM), as compared with wild-type VIIa (KDapp 5  2.8 6 0.3 nM) and the mutant at residue Lys-341 [c192] (KDapp 5 1.7 6  0.6 nM).  Biochemistry: Dickinson et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 (1996) 14383Because the zymogen structures of VII, X, and IX are  unknown, the precise docking of the macromolecular substrates with TFzVIIa remains unclear.
However, the [c2227]  disulfide bond in VII and X imposes constraints on the  distance between the zymogen protease domain and the  scissile bond which enters the catalytic cleft.
Because of these  constraints, it is likely that the zymogen protease domain  interacts with one or both of the VIIa exosites which are  located downwards from the active site cleft to the membrane  proximal regions of TFzVIIa. If the zymogens adopt a similarly  extended conformation, as demonstrated for VIIa in the  TFzVIIa complex (3) or free factor IXa (41), macromolecular  substrates may simultaneously contact membrane through  their Gla-domains, providing a rational for the rate accelerating effect of charged phospholipid for X activation (42).
In  this orientation, the substrate EGF and Gla-domains may be  positioned in proximity to the face of TFzVIIa which is formed  by TF (residues Lys-165, Lys-166) and by the VIIa Gla-domain,  both of which are critical for macromolecular substrate activation (24, 43).
The detailed analysis of the residues involved in  function of VIIa presented here is thus compatible with the  concept that macromolecular substrate assembles through an  extended interface formed by one face of the TFzVIIa complex.
