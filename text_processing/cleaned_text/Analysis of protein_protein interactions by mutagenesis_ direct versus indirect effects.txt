Protein Engineering vol.12 no.1 pp.4145, 1999  Analysis of proteinprotein interactions by mutagenesis: direct  versus indirect effects  Daniel E.Otzen1 and Alan R.Fersht2  MRC Unit for Protein Function & Design, Cambridge IRC for Protein  Engineering, University Chemical Laboratory, Lensfield Road, Cambridge  CB2 1EW, UK  1Present address: Department of Biochemistry, Chemistry Centre, University  of Lund, PO Box 124, S- 22100 Lund, Sweden  2To whom correspondence should be addressed  Site-directed mutagenesis, including double-mutant cycles,  is used routinely for studying proteinprotein interactions.
  We now present a case analysis of chymotrypsin inhibitor  2 (CI2) and subtilisin BPN9 using (i) a residue in CI2 that  is known to interact directly with subtilisin (Tyr42) and  (ii) two CI2 residues that do not have direct contacts with  subtilisin (Arg46 and Arg48).
We find that there are similar  changes in binding energy on mutation of these two sets  of residues.
It can thus be difficult to interpret mutagenesis  data in the absence of structural information.
  Keywords: chymotrypsin inhibitor 2/inhibitory activity/loop  flexibility/proteinprotein interactions/stability/subtilisin BPN9  Introduction  Protease inhibitors bind very tightly to their cognate proteases,  usually via an extended loop that docks onto the protease (Bode  et al., 1992).
Binding is tight for two main reasons: the inhibitors  form numerous specific side chain and backbone interactions  with the active site of the protease (even when cleaved) and the  loop is generally very rigid, reducing the unfavourable decrease  in entropy that accompanies complex formation (Blow, 1974).
  The structure of an inhibitorprotease complex will generally  reveal the intermolecular contacts that contribute most to the  strength of association, but this analysis needs to be complemented by functional studies, as is the case for all protein  protein interactions.
For instance, only a quarter of the side  chains buried at the interface between human growth hormone  and its receptor contribute significantly to binding energy  (Cunningham et al., 1993).
Conversely, several electrostatic  intermolecular interactions in the barnasebarstar complex are  stronger than might be expected at first sight of the structure  (Schreiber et al., 1995).
The energetic coupling between two  residues in a proteinprotein complex is best analysed using  double mutant cycles, where the two residues are mutated singly  and together and the effect on binding is analysed (Carter et al.,  1984; Schreiber et al., 1995).
In the absence of a direct or indirect  coupling, mutation of one residue will be independent of the  mutation of the other residue.
This approach has also been used  to map the architecture of the complex between the Shaker  potassium channel and a high-affinity peptide inhibitor (Hidalgo  et al., 1995) where the structures of the individual components,  but not the complex, are available.
Arg24 on the inhibitor was  deduced to be in intimate contact with Asp431 in the K1-channel,  since a detailed mutagenic analysis of the residues surrounding  Arg24 and Asp431 ruled out an unspecific through-space electrostatic attraction (Hidalgo et al., 1995).
   Oxford University Press 41  In the absence of available structural information, interactions  between two proteins are often mapped out by mutational scanning.
When deletion of a given side chain results in decreased  binding, that side chain is assumed to be situated at the intermolecular interface.
However, we show that it is necessary to distinguish between the direct and indirect effects of deletion of a side  chain.
As a model system we use chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2),  which inhibits subtilisin BPN9 with a dissociation constant Ki of  about 1012 M (Longstaff et al., 1990).
It consists of a single  domain, in which one face of a six-stranded -sheet packs against  an -helix to form the hydrophobic core.
From the opposite face  of the -sheet, between strands 3 and 4, projects an 11-residue  extended loop (Gly35Asp45) which contains the reactive site  bond between Met40 and Glu41 (Harpaz et al., 1994; McPhalen  et al., 1987).
In contrast to many other inhibitors, CI2 does not  have disulfide bonds in the reactive site loop; nonetheless, a  backbone dynamics study using 15N relaxation data showed that  the loop is almost as constrained as the rest of the protein (Shaw  et al., 1995), because of a number of noncovalent side-chain  interactions.
In complex with subtilisin BPN9, residues 3642  in the reactive site loop are responsible for virtually all the  contacts ,4  with the protease (McPhalen et al., 1985).
  In this study, we have mutated residues from two different  environments (Figure 1). (i) A residue (Tyr42 in the P29 site)  which forms intermolecular contacts with subtilisin: Tyr42 is  very solvent-exposed in free CI2, and stacks against Phe189 of  subtilisin BPN9 in a hydrophobic interaction. [Nomenclature of  Schechter and Berger (1967).
Amino acid residues of the inhibitor are numbered P1, P2, P3, etc. towards the N-terminus and  P19, P29, P39, etc. towards the C-terminus from the reactive-site  bond (the peptide bond in the inhibitor cleaved by the enzyme).]  The mutation YA42 removes this stacking interaction, while  YG42 additionally increases the conformational freedom of the  reactive loop.
(ii) Two residues (Arg46 and Arg48) which are  not in contact with subtilisin but whose side chains contribute  to the rigidity of the loop by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic  interactions with Thr39 and Glu41 (residues P1 and P19).
RC48  removes the guanidinium group while retaining a mimic of the  hydrophobic linear part of the side chain; the mutants RA46,  RA48 and RA46/RA48 remove both charged and hydrophobic  moieties from the Arg side chain.
The mutants TA39 and EA41  have dissociation constants increased 80- and 140-fold relative  to wild-type CI2 (Jackson et al., 1994), and in the case of EA41,  inhibition is reversed over longer timescales.
We show how both  sets of residues contribute substantially to the binding energy in  the CI2subtilisin complex, but the effect is direct in the case of  Tyr42 and only indirect in the case of Arg46 and Arg48.
  Materials and methods  Materials  All materials were obtained as described (Jackson et al., 1994).
  Mutagenesis  Mutants of CI2 were prepared, expressed and purified as  described (Jackson et al., 1993).

  CI2 is at the bottom of the figure, with the reactive loop projecting into the  active site of subtilisin.
CI2s Tyr42 stacks against subtilisins Phe189, while  the CI2 residues Arg46 and Arg48, as well as Thr39 and Glu41, are not  involved in any intermolecular interactions.
  YA42 and YG42, concentrations were determined spectroscopically using an extinction coefficient  5 6965 cm1 M1, as  determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel (1989).
The  loss of the Tyr side chain reduced the extinction coefficient of  CI2 to  5 5780 cm1 M1 for YA42 and YG42.
  Equilibrium denaturation  Equilibrium unfolding of CI2 mutants in guanidinium chloride  (GdmCl) was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and the  data analysed as described (Clarke et al., 1993; Jackson et al.,  1993).
The destabilization relative to wild-type CI2 (GU-F)  is calculated as follows:  GU-F 5 ,m.([GdmCl] 50%  wildtype  [GdmCl] 50%  mutant) (1)  where ,m. is the average dependence of the free energy of  unfolding on denaturant concentration [the value of 1.93 kcal  mol1 M1 is based on measurements of a large number of  CI2 mutants (Itzhaki et al., 1995)], and [GdmCl]50% is the  denaturant concentration at which the protein is 50% unfolded.
  Equilibrium denaturation and inhibition studies on RC48 were  performed in 5 mM DTT to avoid possible dimer formation.
  Inhibition studies  CI2 is a slow tight-binding inhibitor of subtilisin BPN9 with  a dissociation constant of 2.931012 M (Longstaff et al., 1990).
  The inhibition parameters are determined by following the  proteolytic activity of subtilisin BPN9 towards the substrate  succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroaniline (sAAPFpNA) (measured as the increase in absorbance at 412 nm) in 10 mM Tris  HCl pH 8.6 at 25C in the presence of different concentrations  of CI2 (where [CI2]  103[subtilisin BPN9]) (Cha, 1975;  Jackson et al., 1994).
The concentration of subtilisin BPN9  was between 100 and 1000 pM, while the range of inhibitor  concentration depended on the dissociation constant.
For strong  inhibitors (wild-type CI2 and the mutants YA42, RA46, RA48  and RC48), the concentration was 1030 times that of the  enzyme.
For the weak inhibitors, the concentration was  42  Fig. 2.

At these concentrations,  the association rate (kon[CI2]) is so fast that steady-state  conditions are reached within the deadtime of the experiment  (30 s).
However, the association between the weak inhibitors  and subtilisin BPN9 could be measured directly by stopped  flow fluorescence spectroscopy using an Applied Photophysics  Stopped-Flow spectrophotometer model SF 17MV.
Excitation  was at 280 nm and emission was monitored at wavelengths  above 315 nm using a glass filter.
To obtain sufficiently large  fluorescence signals, the enzyme concentration was 0.5 M,  while the inhibitor concentration was 520 M.  Results  Stability data  Both wild-type CI2 and the six mutants unfold according to a  cooperative two-state mechanism (Figure 2).
Stability data are  shown in Table I. Despite its solvent exposure, the phenol ring  of Tyr42 makes hydrophobic contacts with the side chains of  Met40, Glu41, Arg43, Ile44 and Val63.
Based on the correlation  between loss of hydrophobic contacts within 6  and loss of  stability in a three-residue hydrophobic patch in the reactive  loop (Otzen et al., 1995), we would predict that YA42 and  YG42 are destabilized by 2.25 and 2.46 kcal/mol, which is  close to the actual values of 1.93 and 2.21 kcal/mol.
Therefore,  although the insertion of Gly in position 42 is likely to increase  the flexibility of the loop, the destabilization of YG42 relative  to YA42 can be attributed mainly to the loss of packing  interactions by deletion of the C methyl group.
  Arg48 is only able to form a hydrogen bond with Thr39,  whereas Arg46 is involved in electrostatic interactions with  both Glu41 and the C-terminus.
RA48 is destabilized by only  1.2 kcal/mol and RA46 by 2.9 kcal/mol.
  The interaction energy between Arg46 and Arg48 was   at Universitat Autonoma Barcelona on June 22, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Direct versus indirect effects in proteinprotein interactions  Fig. 3.

Binding of CI2 to  subtilisin was monitored as the effect on the rate of subtilisins hydrolysis  of sAAPFpNA (hydrolysis of sAAPFpNA leads to an increase in absorption  at 412 nm).
(B) Association between YG42 and subtilisin BPN9 monitored  by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy.
Due to the weak binding of  YG42 and RA46/RA48 to subtilisin and the requirement for high  concentrations of inhibitor, the binding step of these two mutants could only  be monitored by stopped flow experiments.

The interaction energy  Gint between two residues X and Y is calculated from  Gint 5 GU-F  XA 1 GU-F  YA  GU-F  XA,YA (2)  where GU-F  XA,YA is the change in stability (relative to wild  type) of the mutant where both X and Y are mutated, and  GU-F  XA and GU-F  YA are the changes in stability of the  mutants where X and Y, respectively, are mutated (Fersht  et al., 1985, 1992; Horovitz et al., 1990).
The interaction  energy between Arg46 and Arg48 is 1.1060.10 kcal/mol, that  is, Arg46 and Arg48 interact favourably in the native protein,  relative to its denatured state.
Evidently the interactions  between the hydrophobic groups in the Arg side chains  outweigh the unfavourable chargecharge interactions,  although the guanine groups are within 46  of each other.
  Inhibition data  Representative inhibition profiles are shown in Figure 3.
These  plots yield the observed rate constant of binding kobs, the initial  rate of hydrolysis vo and the steady-state rate of hydrolysis vs  (Figure 4), from which we calculate the inhibition parameters  (Table II).
Dissociation constants are converted into binding  energies relative to wild-type CI2 as follows:  Gbinding 5 RT ln(Ki  wildtype/Ki  mutant) (3)  There is no correlation between changes in stability and  changes in inhibitory activity.
YA42 and YG42 are almost  equally destabilized but YG42 has an inhibitory constant ~70  times higher than YA42.
Conversely, RA46, RA48 and RC48  43  have very different stabilities but very similar Ki values.
In all  cases, the increase in Ki is predominantly due to an increase  in the dissociation rate koff.
  Tyr42 is strongly conserved in the potato inhibitor I family  of serine protease inhibitors, either as Tyr, Phe or Leu (Svendsen  et al., 1982).
The phenol ring is offset-stacked against Phe189  in subtilisin BPN9.
This parallel-ring aromaticaromatic interaction is not so favourable as the perpendicular arrangement,  where there is an electrostatic attraction.
In the offset stacking  arrangement, the main contribution to binding is from van der  Waals interactions (Jorgensen et al., 1990).
From the number  of hydrophobic contacts between Tyr42s phenol ring and  subtilin within 6  (42), we predict a reduction in binding  energy (Gbinding) of 2.3 kcal/mol on removal of the phenol  ring, which is identical within error to the actual value (2.2  kcal/mol).
In this case, loss of binding energy can be attributed  entirely to loss of packing interactions.
However, the further  removal of the C methylene group (YG42) has an effect on  binding energy (Gbinding 5 4.7 kcal/mol) which is far beyond  that predicted from losses in packing interactions.
This may  be explained either by the increase in conformational freedom  of an otherwise rigid reactive site loop, resulting in an  increase in the loss of entropy on binding, or by structural  rearrangements in the area of the mutation.
  The side chains of both Arg46 and Arg48 are almost  completely buried; only N1 and N2 of Arg48, and N1 of  Arg46, are slightly exposed.
Mutations of either Arg46 or  Arg48 to Ala decreases kon 35-fold and increase koff 50-fold.
  In contrast to Tyr42, mutations of Arg46 and Arg48 affect the  stability of the complex indirectly, since their side chains make  no contacts to subtilisin in the crystal structure of the CI2  subtilisin BPN9 complex (McPhalen et al., 1985).
  Coupling energies  
The coupling energy between Arg46 and Arg48 in complex  with subtilisin BPN9 can be calculated by an equation analogous  to the interaction energy in eq. 2 (Jackson et al., 1994):  Gint  binding 5 GXA  binding 1 GYA  binding  Gbinding  XA,YA (4)  (nomenclature as in eq. 2).
This gives a value of 0.9560.18  kcal/mol, which is similar to the interaction between the two  Arg side chains in stabilizing free CI2 (1.1060.10 kcal/mol).
  Discussion  We have prepared two different sets of mutants in CI2.
In the  first set (YA42 and YG42), interactions within CI2 as well as  interactions with subtilisin are removed, while only intramolecular interactions are removed in the second set (RA46, RA48,  RA46/RA48 and RC48).
Both sets of mutations have a  detrimental effect on the binding to subtilisin, but for different  reasons.
The loss of binding energy for the mutant YA42 can  be ascribed entirely to loss of packing interactions with  subtilisin.
All the other mutants exert their effect indirectly,  either by increasing the flexibility of the loop or by distorting  it.
In the absence of structural knowledge, the loss of binding  energy would most likely be misinterpreted as the removal of  an intermolecular contact.
For example, the double mutant  cycle in this study reveals an apparent coupling energy between  Arg46 and Arg48 with regards to binding to subtilisin.
In the  absence of structural rearrangements, double mutant cycles  report on specific interactions between side chains, and the  coupling binding energy between Arg46 and Arg48 a priori  suggests that the two residues cooperate in binding interactions   at Universitat Autonoma Barcelona on June 22, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from D.E.Otzen and A.R.Fersht  Fig. 4.

  with subtilisin, but structural data (McPhalen et al., 1985) rule  out such a conclusion.
This emphasizes that it is necessary to  combine mutagenic analysis with structural insight to reach a  valid conclusion.
  The fact that the coupling energy between Arg46 and Arg48  is the same in the complex as in free CI2 does not in itself  demonstrate that the two residues do not contact subtilisin,  since the two coupling energies apply to two entirely different  processes.
For unfolding, it is the coupling energy of the two  side chains in the native structure relative to that in the  denatured state.
For the association constants, it is the coupling  between the two side chains in the native state of free CI2  and the native state of CI2 in complex with subtilisin.
Any  similarity in coupling energy is purely fortuitous; the only  time one would expect identical coupling energies is for the  process of denatured inhibitor binding to subtilisin to give a  native CI2subtilisin complex.
  44  When a side chain participating in an intermolecular interaction is deleted by mutagenesis, the stage at which the  intermolecular interaction is formed may be deduced from the  effect on kon and koff.
For instance, the removal of nonelectrostatic interactions observed in the structure of the  barnasebarstar complex predominantly increases koff, while  kon is only lowered to a small extent (Schreiber et al., 1995).
  This is also observed for the complex between human growth  hormone and its receptor (Cunningham et al., 1993).
This  indicates that these interactions are formed not in the transition  state of the initial binding step (measured as kon).
Therefore,  these interactions are also the first to be broken in the  dissociation step.
A similar conclusion applies to the mutant  YA42 in CI2, where koff is increased 40-fold, while kon  decreases by less than 50%.
Obviously such a deduction cannot  be made for the five other mutations where no intermolecular  interactions are removed.
One can only make the general   at Universitat Autonoma Barcelona on June 22, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Direct versus indirect effects in proteinprotein interactions  conclusion that either the rigidity or structure of the extended  loop, maintained via conformational restrictions on the polypeptide backbone and via extensive side chain interactions, is  crucial not for the association step but for slowing down the  release of CI2 from subtilisin BPN9.
The situation is analogous  to the study of protein folding by -value analysis (Fersht  et al., 1992).
Here the formation of side-chain interactions  during folding is probed by selective removal of interacting  groups and measuring the effect on the kinetics of folding,  but for a meaningful interpretation it is essential that the  mutation does not change the folding pathway, i.e. the probe  must not perturb the system.
