Transcription  of dha operon is regulated by the DhaR transcription  factor and its action is under control of the kinase  subunits.
DhaR is activated by interaction with DhaL  while it is repressed by DhaK. We have determined  the structures of DhaK and DhaL bound to the tandem  GAF-like and PAS domains of the DhaR, providing  an architectural model for how GAF/PAS tandem  domains work together in binding protein partners.
  The structures reveal a mechanism of opposite  transcriptional regulation by the DhaK and DhaL  subunits.
The kinase subunits interface with DhaR  through surfaces that partially overlap with their  active sites, allowing sensing of ATP- versus ADPloaded DhaL subunit and also precluding a ternary  complex between DhaK-DhaL and DhaR. The rotation of helices within the DhaR coiled-coil linker  upon DhaL binding provides the mechanism for  transmitting the binding signal from the GAF/PAS  domains to the C-terminal DNA-binding domain.
  INTRODUCTION  Bacterial enhancer binding proteins (bEBP) constitute a large  group of transcription regulators, with common architecture  consisting of the N-terminal regulatory region, central AAA+  ATPase domain and C-terminal DNA-binding helix-turn-helix  motif (Schumacher et al., 2006; Tucker and Sallai, 2007; Bush  and Dixon, 2012; Joly et al., 2012).
The regulatory region contains diverse input domains, sensing a wide range of environmental clues (Studholme and Dixon, 2003).
Often, regulation is  accomplished through binding of a low-molecular-weight ligand  to sensory input domains, such as GAF (named after cGMPspecific phosphodiesterases, Adenylyl cyclases and FhlA) and  PAS (after Period circadian protein, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor  nuclear translocator protein and Single-minded protein), or  through phosphorylation of a response regulation domain.
  Other groups of bEBPs respond to environmental clues via  interactions with proteins; these bEBPs have been less studied  (Buck et al., 2000) and remain poorly understood to date.
  One interesting bEBP, which regulates transcription through  protein-protein interactions, is the Escherichia coli DhaR. It controls the expression of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent  dihydroxyacetone (Dha) kinase, an enzyme that produces  dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
Dha kinase consists of three  subunits DhaK, DhaL, and DhaM, which are encoded by the  genes dhaK, dhaL, and dhaM of the dha operon.
DhaM is a  phosphotransferase component of the phosphoenolpyruvate:  sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS).
This subunit is phosphorylated by the small phospho-carrier protein HPr of the  PTS (Erni et al., 2006) and transfers the phosphate to the ADP  moiety tightly bound to DhaL (Gutknecht et al., 2001; Ba chler  et al., 2005a; Oberholzer et al., 2005).
Therefore, ADP functions  as a phosphate transferring coenzyme.
The DhaL-ATP complex  subsequently associates with the DhaK subunit containing the  Dha substrate covalently bound to His218 through a hemiaminal  bond (Siebold et al., 2003), whereupon the phosphate is transferred from ATP to Dha yielding Dha-P (Gutknecht et al., 2001;  Ba chler et al., 2005a; Oberholzer et al., 2005).
  The transcription regulator DhaR functions as an autorepressor of the dhaR gene and a Dha-dependent activator of the  dha operon (Ba chler et al., 2005b).
The DhaK kinase subunit  functions as a corepressor while DhaL is a coactivator of  DhaR. They belong to so called trigger enzymes that have  dual roles: in catalysis and in transcriptional regulation (Commichau and Stu lke, 2008).
The activation is triggered by phosphorylation of Dha by the kinase that restores the DhaL-ADP  complex, which through direct interactions with the DhaR  N-terminal sensor region activates the transcription of the dha  operon (Ba chler et al., 2005b).
  The majority of bEBPs activate RNA polymerase by conformational changes and/or oligomerization induced by environmental signals, resulting in an active form of AAA+ ATPase,  which interacts with the s54 factor (Bush and Dixon, 2012;  478 Structure 22, 478487, March 4, 2014 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reservedJoly et al., 2012).
DhaR belongs to a subgroup of bEBPs that  control transcription through the s70 factor (Ba chler et al.,  2005b).
The mechanism of regulation by this group is relatively  poorly understood, but their ATPase domain does not have a  s54 binding sequence motif (Ba chler et al., 2005b), a critical  element for RNA polymerase activation.
Thus downstream signal  propagation by DhaR is likely very different from s54-dependent  systems and may not require signal transmission from the  sensor region to the ATPase domain.
Some of these bEBPs  function via direct interactions between their sensory region  and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase (Pittard et al.,  2005); DhaR may use a similar mechanism.
  The architecture of bEBP reveals a frequent presence of  multiple small domains in the regulatory region, the role of which  is often not clear in sensing and signaling (Studholme and Dixon,  2003).
The dihydroxyacetone kinase system provides a new  mechanism of sensing, in which transcription regulation by  DhaL and DhaK involves physical interaction of these subunits  with the sensory region of DhaR comprising a tandem PAS  and GAF-like domain.
Such domains are frequently present in  sensory regions of bEBPs.
PAS and GAF domains have a related  fold and belong to the profilin-like superfold in the SCOP  classification (Murzin et al., 1995; Lewis et al., 2013).
They are  one of the largest and most widespread folds in all kingdoms  of life, have versatile functions, and are often involved in signal  transduction pathways and protein regulatory systems.
Most  of the structurally characterized PAS and GAF domains bind  low-molecular-weight ligands or serve as homodimerization  modules (Ho et al., 2000; Mo glich et al., 2009; Henry and  Crosson, 2011).
Dha kinase regulatory system uniquely involves  interactions of these domains with other proteins.
  In this report, we provide extensive mechanistic studies of  this system through crystal structures of the E. coli DhaR  N-terminal regulatory region complexed with the DhaK or DhaL  subunits of the kinase.
Our studies have uncovered the molecular basis of recognition between a transcriptional regulator,  its corepressor and co-activator, and provide the first example  of how interactions of two different kinase subunits with the  sensory domain of the transcription regulator trigger different  downstream responses.
  RESULTS  Overall Structures of the DhaR(N)-DhaK  and DhaR(N)-DhaL Complexes  The pertinent details of data processing and refinement are  shown in Table 1.
  DhaR(N)-DhaK Complex  The crystals of the DhaR(N)-DhaK complex diffract to only 3.25 A  resolution, possibly due to their high solvent content.
Diffraction  has been moderately improved (to 2.83 A ) by using bigger crystals of DhaR(N)-DhaK(T79L).
Other than the mutation itself, no  structural difference (root-mean-square deviation [rmsd] of  0.34 A for all 1,300 Ca atoms) could be detected between the  wild-type and mutant crystals of this complex.
We therefore  used the DhaR(N)-DhaK(T79L) model for the description below.
  Each asymmetric unit contains one DhaK dimer and one  DhaR(N) dimer, in which each DhaK monomer contacts only  one DhaR(N) (Figure 1A).
However, the molecules pack in the  crystal in such a way that the second DhaK subunit in the  DhaK dimer interacts with one DhaR subunit belonging to  another DhaR dimer, thus forming helical chains extending  throughout the crystal (Figure S1A available online).
This interaction pattern can be represented as .DhaKA  0  -DhaKB  0  -DhaR(N)ADhaR(N)B-DhaKA-DhaKB., where subscript denotes dimer  components and superscript (0  ) indicates a symmetry-related  heterotetramer (Figure 1A).
The pseudo 2-fold symmetry that  relates two monomers of DhaR(N) extends to the DhaKB  0  -  DhaR(N)A-DhaR(N)B-DhaKA segment.
Thus the interface contacts between DhaR(N)B-DhaKA (within one asymmetric unit)  are nearly identical to those of DhaR(N)A-DhaKB  0 (between two  asymmetric units; Figure 1A).
The interface is large and encompasses an area of 1,150 A 2 on each molecule as calculated  by PISA (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007).
These values are nearly  identical for the DhaR(N)B-DhaKA and DhaR(N)A-DhaKB  0 interfaces.
In comparison, the DhaR dimerization interface has an  area of 2,350 A 2  , the DhaKA-DhaKB dimerization interface is  1,960 A 2 and the next largest contact between symmetry  related molecules is only 350 A 2  .
Moreover, the DhaR surface  Table 1.

All residues in both DhaK subunits are well defined in the  electron density map and they can be well superposed with an  rmsd of 0.28 A for all the corresponding 356 Ca atoms.
The  DhaR(N) structure includes residues 13306; 12 residues at  both termini are disordered.
Each DhaK molecule contains Dha  covalently bound to His218.
Previous studies with gel filtration  and analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that DhaR and  DhaK form a dimer of [DhaR2:DhaK2] (Ba chler et al., 2005b).
  We carried out ITC experiments and determined Kd to be  15 mM (Figure S1D).
The complex DhaR(N)-DhaK(H56N), which  does not contain bound Dha (Shi et al., 2011), is marginally  weaker (Kd = 26 mM), indicating that DhaK substrate loading  does not have a major influence on interactions with DhaR.  The crystal structure of DhaK-DhaR confirms that the stoichiometry of DhaK and DhaR is 2:2 or (2:2)n.
  DhaR(N)-DhaL Complex  For the DhaR(N)-DhaL complex, eight molecules forming two  heterotetramers of DhaL-DhaR(N)2-DhaL were found in the  asymmetric unit.
These two heterotetramers are almost identical  as shown by an rmsd of 0.40 A for all the corresponding 1,007 Ca  atoms.
Similar to the DhaR(N)-DhaK complex, the DhaR(N)  subunits in the DhaR(N)-DhaL contain residues 13306 and  lack 12 residues at both termini.
All the 210 residues of the  DhaL subunits and the bound ADP and Mg2+ ions are well  Figure 1.

  defined in the electron density (Figure 1B).
  There is no detectable structural difference between each individual DhaL or  DhaR(N) molecule in the DhaR(N)-DhaL  complex as indicated by an rmsd of  0.12 to 0.38 A for all corresponding  Ca atoms.
The interface between  DhaR dimer and DhaL covers an area  of 1,410 A 2 on each molecule and is  larger than the DhaK-DhaL interface  (1,230 A 2  ) and in a typical range for  biologically significant protein-protein  contacts.
The contact surface on DhaR  also shows a higher level of conservation  than parts of the surface not involved in  contacts with either DhaL or DhaK (Figures S1B and S1C).
Size exclusion experiments detected the  DhaR(N)-DhaL complex of 96 kDa with a stoichiometry of 2:1  (Ba chler et al., 2005b), which agrees with our isothermal titration  calorimetry (ITC) experiments.
On the other hand, the crystal  structure of DhaL-DhaR complex unambiguously indicates its  stoichiometry to be 2:2.
The Kd value for the DhaR(N)-DhaL  complex, as determined by ITC, is 0.5  0.1 mM, and hence it  is significantly stronger than the DhaR(N)-DhaK complex.
  Structure of DhaR Sensor Region  The DhaR sensor region in both DhaR(N)-DhaK and DhaR(N)-  DhaL complexes is present as an intimate dimer (Figure 1).
  Each DhaR(N) subunit is an elongated molecule, 85 A in  length, with two globular domains (residues 13190 and  212306) connected by a long helical linker (residues 191211;  Figure 2A).
These domains have a similar, although not identical,  fold and belong to the profilin-like fold superfamily (Andreeva  et al., 2008).
For the reasons given below, we refer to them  as the N-terminal GAF-like and C-terminal PAS domains.
  Superposition of all six DhaR(N) crystallographically independent molecules from both crystal structures shows that  the molecule displays some flexibility, expressed by varying  degree of bending of the linker helix.
Three different orientations  of the PAS domain relative to the connecting helix and the  GAF-like domain were observed among the six molecules  (Figure 2B).
  Structure  DhaR Regulates Transcription by Helix Rotation  480 Structure 22, 478487, March 4, 2014 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reservedThe description of the DhaR(N) structure is based on the  DhaR(N)-DhaK complex.
The core of the N-terminal domain (residues 51190) comprises a central five-stranded antiparallel b  sheet with the strand order 2-1-5-4-3 (b2[-b1Y-b5[-b4Y-b3[).
  The central b sheet is flanked by a two-helix bundle (helices a3  and the N-terminal part of the helix a7) on one side, and helices  a4, a5, a6, on the other side.
Structurally, this domain is most  similar to the transcriptional regulators in the prokaryotic  isocitrate lyase regulator (IclR) family, such as TM-IclR from  Thermotoga maritima (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code 1MKM),  the E. coli glyoxylate and allantoin utilization regulatory protein  AllR (PDB code 1TF1), and the E. coli IclR protein (PDB code  2O9A).
All these domains have been classified as GAFs.
The  N-terminal domain of DhaR(N) lacks the peripheral edge strand  b3 of the classical GAF domain fold (GAF has strand order 3-2-  1-6-5-4; Figure 2C) and adheres more to the PAS fold.
However,  based on the most pronounced structural similarity of the  N-terminal domain of DhaR to GAF domains, we will call it  Figure 2.

  GAF-like.
There are other instances  where the domains without strand b3  have been assigned to the GAF fold, for  example the DosT heme-bound GAF  domain (Podust et al., 2008).
The unique  feature of the DhaR GAF-like domain is  the presence of two additional N-terminal  helices (a1 and a2) with an extended a1/  a2 connecting loop (Figure 2C).
  A ten-turn long helix a7 connects  the N-terminal GAF-like domain to the  C-terminal PAS domain (residues 213  306).
This PAS domain displays the  structural features of a typical PAS  domain, with a five-stranded antiparallel  b sheet in the topological order 2-1-5-4-  3 (b7[-b6Y-b10[-b9Y-b8[).
This b sheet  is flanked by the C-terminal part of  the connecting helix a7 on one side and  by a8, a9, and a10 on the other side  (which usually contains the ligand-binding site; Figure 2D).
The  closest structural homolog of this domain based on the DALI  program (Holm and Sander, 1995) is the photoactive yellow  protein (PDB 1ODV, rmsd of 2.4 A for the 90 superposed  Ca atoms).
  A typical GAF/PAS domain has an internal ligand-binding  pocket located between the central b sheet and helices a4, a5,  and a6.
No such pocket exists in DhaR GAF-like domain; this  space is filled with bulky hydrophobic side chains of Phe76,  Leu78, Leu97, Phe102, Ile113, Leu118, Leu140, Trp143, and  Phe145 (Figure 2C).
The PAS domain has only a very small cavity  of 67 A 3 lined exclusively with hydrophobic residues (Ile217,  Trp219, Leu236, Ile248, Leu252, Leu254, Leu258, Phe275, and  Leu301; Figure 2D).
This cavity is too small for ligand binding  and is sealed from the solvent by surrounding hydrophobic  side chains.
These structural adaptations clearly reflect a transition from a small ligand binding to protein binding for these GAF/  PAS domains.
Moreover, the topological arrangement of the  Structure  DhaR Regulates Transcription by Helix Rotation  Structure 22, 478487, March 4, 2014 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 481GAF-like and PAS domains within the DhaR sensor region is  very common for GAF and PAS domains (Martinez et al., 2005;  Mo glich et al., 2009; Winkler et al., 2013).
  DhaR Sensor Region Is a Homodimer  Dimerization of the DhaR sensor region is achieved through  extensive side-by-side interactions involving the GAF-like  domain, the PAS domain and the connecting helix a7 (Figure 3A).
  The homodimer possesses a pseudo 2-fold symmetry with  departures from the exact symmetry varying between the  structures.
The dimer interface is extensive and covers an area  of 2,350 A 2 on each DhaR(N) molecule.
The connecting helices  a7 form a parallel coiled-coil, resulting in a dimer having a butterfly-like shape (Figure 1).
GAF-like domains interact through the  two helices (a3 and a7) from each subunit, forming a four-helix  bundle.
The GAF-like domain interface is predominantly hydrophobic (Met68, Ala173, Leu177, and Ala180), while two salt  bridges at the top (Arg71A  -Asp174B and Arg71B-Asp174A  ) are  solvent-exposed.
Within the PAS domain, the contacts are  also mainly hydrophobic, involving side chains from the C-terminal segment of the connecting helix a7 and a side of the b sheet  (Leu205, Leu208, Leu209, Met212, and Phe227; Figure 3A).
  DhaK Binds to the GAF-like Domain of DhaR  DhaR(N) binds to DhaK exclusively via its GAF-like domain  and makes no contacts with the helical linker or the PAS domain  (Figure 1A).
Complex formation buries 1,150 A 2  , or 7.3%, of the  molecule surface (15,800 A 2  ) of each DhaR subunit.
The DhaR  residues involved in binding are mainly located at helices a1,  a2, and their connecting loop, which are unique for the DhaR  and are not present in other GAF domains.
Additionally, a few  residues located at the loops b1/b2, a4/a5, and b4/b5 of the  core of the GAF-like domain are in contact with DhaK but provide  only 30% of the total contact area.
The DhaK/DhaR interface involves numerous van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bonds, and  salt bridges (Figure 3B).
The mutation T79L is located at this interface and the more bulky leucine side chain makes more favorable  van der Waals contacts with DhaR than would threonine.
  The DhaK surface that contacts DhaR overlaps partially with  the surface that forms the DhaK-DhaL dimer (Figure S2A;  Shi et al., 2011).
The common part of these interfaces includes  the loops b4/a2 and b7/b8 and helix a3.
This DhaK region is  thus not only important for catalysis but also critical for binding  to DhaR transcriptional regulator.
Upon binding to DhaR, DhaK  undergoes conformational changes that include ordering of the  loop b7/b8 and ten N-terminal residues (Figure S2B).
Similar  ordering was also observed upon DhaK binding to DhaL. Overall,  the DhaK molecule in the DhaK-DhaR complex adopts an  intermediate conformation between both the free DhaK and  that in DhaK-DhaL complex.
  Because DhaK interacts only with the GAF-like domain of a  single DhaR subunit, the conformations of the connecting helix  a7 and the PAS domain are likely unaffected by DhaK binding  and would be the same as in the free DhaR dimer.
These two  a7 helices form tightly packed coiled-coil interface (Figure 3A,  left) through interactions between Leu188, Leu195, Leu202,  and Leu209 and Thr191, Thr198, Leu205, and Met212.
This  coiled-coil differs from the canonical parallel leucine zipper in  that the leucines are in position a rather than in position d  in the heptad repeat sequence (abcdefg)n (OShea et al., 1989).
  Moreover, the two DhaR subunits in DhaR-DhaK complex  show a difference in the orientation of their PAS domain relative  to the GAF-like domain, which results in an asymmetric DhaR  dimer in this complex.
  DhaL Binds to All Three Domains of the Sensor Region  of DhaR  The overall structure of the DhaR(N)-DhaL complex is organized  as a DhaL-(DhaR)2-DhaL heterotetramer with the DhaR homodimer recruiting two DhaL molecules.
DhaL binds at the DhaR  dimer interface and contacts both subunits to a different degree.
  DhaL binds to the GAF-like and PAS domains as well as the  connecting helix a7 of the first DhaR subunit, but only to the  GAF-like domain and the connecting helix a70 of the second  DhaR subunit (Figure 3C).
DhaL binds DhaR with its helical barrel  nearly parallel to the coiled-coil of DhaR dimer, forming a  supercoiled-coil structure.
In this way, half of the helical barrel  (a2, a3, a4, and a5) is snugly embedded between the two  GAF-like domains and a single PAS domain of the DhaR dimer.
  The top end of the DhaL helical barrel interacts with the GAFlike domains, the bottom end packs against the PAS domain,  and the middle packs against the connecting helices a7 and  a70 (Figure 3D).
Although the ADP molecule and Mg2+ ions within  the DhaL active site are located close to the GAF-like domain,  they are not participating directly in the interactions except  for a single, water-mediated hydrogen bond between ADP  b-phosphate and Glu66 of DhaR. A large patch of negatively  charged residues, consisting of Glu62, Asp63, and Glu66 in the  GAF-like domain, faces the ADP b-phosphate.
The electrostatic  potential calculations suggest that this negative patch would  discriminate against the g-phosphate in the ATP-loaded DhaL  (Figure 3E), providing a structural explanation for the observation  that DhaR selectively binds ADP-loaded DhaL but not ATPloaded DhaL (Gutknecht et al., 2001; Ba chler et al., 2005a,  2005b).
  Numerous hydrogen bonds are established between DhaL  and DhaR upon complex formation (Figure 3C).
Interactions  between the helix a2 of DhaL and the connecting helix a7 of  DhaR, as well as between Phe63 and Met70 from helix a3 of  DhaL and several leucine residues (Leu190, Leu195, and  Leu202) of the coiled-coil helix of DhaR (see below), are likely  important.
Compared with the DhaK-DhaL complex, DhaL  adopts a different orientation to approach DhaR (Figure 1).
  The two DhaR subunits in the DhaR-DhaL complex display  very similar conformations, making the DhaR dimer more  symmetric than in the DhaR-DhaK complex.
Indeed, the four  independent DhaR(N) molecules in two DhaR(N)-DhaL heterotetramers can be superimposed on each other with an rmsd less  than 0.4 A for all atoms in these molecules.
  DhaL Triggers Structural Response upon Binding DhaR  The individual GAF-like or PAS domains in all DhaR subunits of  both complexes are almost identical.
Nevertheless, the overall  conformations of individual DhaR subunits vary somewhat  between complexes.
As we have described above, the DhaR  dimer in a complex with DhaL is quite symmetrical while  there are deviations from a 2-fold symmetry in the DhaK  complex.
These conformational differences can be described  Structure  DhaR Regulates Transcription by Helix Rotation  482 Structure 22, 478487, March 4, 2014 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reservedFigure 3.

This bend leads to a displacement  of as much as 15 A for some Ca atoms in the PAS domain  (Figures 3A and 3F).
The asymmetric nature of the DhaR(N) dimer  in the DhaR(N)-DhaK complex is largely maintained by the  formation of a leucine zipper in the connecting helices.
  DhaK interacts only with the GAF-like domain and has little  effect on the coiled-coil conformation of the connecting helices.
  On the other hand, DhaL interacts intimately and extensively with  the connecting helices.
Comparison of the structures of DhaR(N)  in both complexes shows how binding of DhaL induces quite  dramatic conformational changes (Figures 3A and 3F).
Upon  binding to either side of the DhaR dimer, the helix a4 (eg,  residues Arg90 and Gln93) of DhaL displaces the loop b4/b5  (eg, Lys154 and Gly155) in the GAF-like domain from its original  position toward the connecting helix.
The relocated b4/b5 loop  pushes against the adjacent connecting helix a7 in the vicinity  of Leu190, which together with a similar effect on the second  connecting helix in the dimer, results in a structural rearrangement of the coiled-coil region that can be best described as a  rotation of the two helices in opposite directions, each by 50  (Figures 4 and S3).
The most notable consequence of these  changes is that the leucine zipper in the coiled-coil is unzipped  (Figures 4 and S3).
The first leucine residue in the leucine zipper,  Leu188, is shifted by 2 A at its Ca atom in a direction opposite  to its equivalent on the second subunit, leading to a loss of their  favorable contacts, with the closest distance between them  increased from 3.2 A to 8.9 A .
As a result, Ser74 in the a3 of  DhaL repositions (Ca shift by 1 A ) to better interact with  Leu188.
Leu195 and Leu202 in the connecting helix a7 no longer  face their equivalent leucines in a70  , now also oriented toward  the a3 of DhaL and forming many hydrophobic interactions  with Phe63, Met70, and the aliphatic parts of Lys59 and Lys63  side chains of DhaL. Similarly, shifts are also observed for  the last leucine in the connecting helix, Leu209, which is now  separated by 10 A from its counterpart in a70  .
The side chain  of Phe227 from the b sheet of the PAS domain rotates 120  to accommodate the repositioned Leu209.
All these adjustments  lead to a replacement of the interface residues in the coiled coil  from Leu188, Leu195, Leu202, and Leu209, to Asn187, Leu194,  His201, and Leu208, respectively.
This rearrangement brings  the b sheet of the PAS domain closer to the coiled-coil and leads  to a more compact packing through numerous new van der  Waals interactions.
Upon DhaL binding, a series of additional  H-bonds and salt bridges are formed between the PAS domain  and the coiled-coil region.
All these changes bring the C termini  of the PAS domains in the DhaR dimer much closer to each  other (eg, the distance between C-terminal Val306 decreases  from 16.4 to 11.9 A ).
  DISCUSSION  GAF and PAS domains belong to one of the largest and most  widespread domain families in all kingdoms of life and have  been conserved for over two billion years of evolution as  indicated by their presence in species from cyanobacteria to  mammals (Martinez et al., 2002).
GAF and PAS domains are  distantly related as they share the same basic folding pattern  despite very low sequence identity.
PAS domains are important  components of signal transduction proteins in that they function  as interaction hubs and universal signal sensors, typically  sensing oxygen tension, redox potential or light intensity  (Mo glich et al., 2009).
Most of the structurally characterized  PAS and GAF domains involve ligand binding or serve as  homodimerization modules (Mo glich et al., 2009; Schultz,  2009).
Many bacterial transcription regulators from the bEBP  family contain N-terminal sensory regions consisting of multiple  small domains, often GAF and PAS domains, but the role of  these domains in signaling is frequently poorly understood  (Studholme and Dixon, 2003; Bush and Dixon, 2012).
Structure  determination of the DhaR sensor region provides a new  structure-based perspective on the domain organization of this  large number of transcriptional regulators.
  One of the most interesting observations from the structure  of DhaR is that neither the GAF-like nor PAS domain contains  internal ligand binding cavities frequently present in other GAF  or PAS domains.
In DhaR, the corresponding regions are filled  with hydrophobic and/or bulky side chains, leaving no room for  binding small molecules.
This structural adaptation reflects functional differences as transcriptional regulation by DhaR involves  binding of a protein partner rather than a small molecule ligand.
  The GAF-like domain of DhaR uniquely contains 40 extra  residues at the N terminus, which are involved in the binding of  DhaK. Similar to many other GAF domains, such as in phosphodiesterase 2A (Martinez et al., 2002), the GAF-like domain  of DhaR participates in dimerization through the helical bundle.
  The leucine zipper present in the coiled-coil region further  enhances dimerization of DhaR.  The structure of the sensory region of DhaR bound to two  individual subunits of the dihydroxyacetone kinase nicely explains existing biological data for this system (Ba chler et al.,  2005b) and allows us to propose a mechanistic model for  Figure 4.

The most striking observation is that interaction of  each of the kinase subunits with DhaR involves the active site  region.
There are multiple consequences following such design.
  Because the active site in Dha kinase is located on the interface  between two subunits (Shi et al., 2011), the kinase must dissociate upon binding DhaR. The exposed active site of DhaL allows  DhaR to clearly differentiate between ADP and ATP-loaded  DhaL. It was previously shown that DhaR could not bind the  ATP form of DhaL (Ba chler et al., 2005b).
Sensing nucleotideloaded DhaL rather than the levels of free ATP/ADP is essential,  because DhaL-ADP is phosphorylated in situ by DhaM and  its state is uncoupled from the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio.
  The structure of DhaL-DhaR complex identifies electrostatic  repulsion as a basis of this discrimination against DhaL-ATP  (Figure 3E).
  Previous functional studies (Ba chler et al., 2005b) proposed  that transcriptional activation by Dha is coupled to the enzymatic  turnover of Dha and involved DhaL, which is fully supported by  the structural data.
Although the DhaR(N) interacts with the  DhaK region proximal to the active site, it does not contact  directly bound Dha.
Indeed, the Kd values for the DhaR(N)-  DhaK complex are very similar for the Dha loaded wild-type  DhaK and DhaK(H56N), which was shown before to be incapable  of binding Dha (Shi et al., 2011).
  The structures of two complexes provide a simple explanation  to previously observed mutual exclusiveness of binding of DhaR  to the two subunits of the Dha kinase (Ba chler et al., 2005b).
  Although the binding interfaces on DhaR for DhaK and DhaL  are not directly overlapping, superposition of two complexes  reveals that steric conflicts between DhaL and DhaK would  prevent simultaneous binding.
Because DhaR engages the  DhaK-DhaL interface of each kinase subunit, DhaK, DhaL, and  DhaR cannot form a ternary complex.
In this way, dynamic rearrangement of complexes can be accomplished and Dha can  activate transcription through enhancing DhaL-ADP population.
  Dha operon regulation involves s70, rather than typical for  bEBPs s54 factor (Ba chler et al., 2005b).
Little is known about  the mechanism of signal transmission downstream from the  effector regions in such systems.
The most studied of these,  TyrR regulon of E. coli, is regulated by the bEBP protein called  TyrR (Pittard et al., 2005).
This transcription regulator has  also two domains in the sensory region, ACT and PAS. It was  shown that this region interacts directly with the C-terminal region of the a-subunit of RNA polymerase (Pittard et al., 2005).
  Thus, the binding of DhaL likely activates transcription either  through the ATPase domain or directly through RNA polymerase.
  The most interesting finding from the crystal structures of  DhaL-DhaR and DhaK-DhaR complexes lies in the different responses of DhaR to binding different partners.
In the absence  of coactivator DhaL, the leucine zipper found in the coiled-coil  linking GAF-like and PAS domains likely keeps DhaR in a state  that prevents activation.
Upon binding, the helical barrel of  DhaL triggers structural reorientation of DhaR by intercepting  the leucines of the coiled-coil interface.
These now bind to the  residues of the helix a3 of DhaL. This results in a 50 rotation  in each of the coiled-coil helices without compromising the  stability of the DhaR dimer and leads to spatial reorganization  of the PAS domains (Figure 3F).
Consequently, this structural  reorganization of the sensor region likely contributes to transcription activation, the specific mechanism of which remains  to be determined.
  Tandem domains with a coiled-coil linker between them are a  well-recognized motif in signaling proteins, although the functional role of such an arrangement is only partially understood  (Doucleff et al., 2005; Anantharaman et al., 2006).
The dynamic  behavior of coiled-coils, including helix staggering, the rotation,  and register shift is of critical importance for the regulation of  many biological processes involving transmembrane signaling  (Hulko et al., 2006; Matthews et al., 2006; Kon et al., 2009;  Croasdale et al., 2011; Xi et al., 2012).
Given the large number  of coiled-coil proteins in nature and their involvement in various  biological processes, the DhaR system may provide a new  mechanistic model for signal transmission through coiled-coil  helix rotation upon the binding of a protein partner.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Cloning, Expression, and Purification of DhaR(2-318), DhaL,  and DhaK  The segment of the E. coli K12 dhaR gene (protein reference gi:87081858;  residues 2318) was cloned into a modified pGEX-4T1 vector (Pharmacia)  that coded for a glutathione-S-transferase followed by a tobacco etch virus  (TEV) protease cleavage site followed by the DhaR construct.
This plasmid  was expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain.
The DhaL (gi: 1787449) and  DhaK (gi: 87081857) constructs were cloned and purified as previously  described (Shi et al., 2011).
DhaR(2-318) (DhaR(N)) was expressed in minimal  media with 0.4% glucose (w/v) and supplemented with 1 mM FeSO4, 1 mM  MgSO4, 100 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM thiamine).
Cell cultures with an optical density 600 >0.6 were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside  (IPTG) at 22C and grown overnight.
Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer  A (13 PBS, pH 7.4, with 300 mM NaCl) and stored at 20C.
Cells were lysed  by sonication and cleared lysates were applied to glutathione resin equilibrated with buffer A and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT).
The resin was washed  extensively with buffer A and 1 mM DTT, followed by two column volumes of  50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol.
DhaR (2318)  was cleaved from the resin by TEV protease after an overnight incubation at  4C.
The flow-through was collected and the sample was passed through  nickel resin to remove the His-tagged TEV protease.
Protein concentrations  were measured using UV and Bradford method, giving the same results.
  Crystallization  For the DhaR(N)-DhaL complex, the DhaR(N) and His6-DhaL were mixed in  a 1:1.5 molar ratio and the complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated in buffer B (20 mM Tris pH 8,  150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 2% glycerol) with 1 mM magnesium acetate  and 1 mM ADP.
Fractions containing the complex were concentrated by  ultrafiltration to 6.5 mg/ml.
Crystals were obtained by microbatch where 1 ml  protein (6.5 mg/ml) with 1 ml buffer (0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 and  25%30% (v/v) 2-ethoxyethanol) was overlaid with paraffin oil.
In our previous  investigations of the DhaL-DhaK complex, we found that the DhaK(T79L)  mutant led to better diffracting crystals of the DhaR-DhaK complex and we  have used it here in parallel with the native DhaK. The DhaR(N) and DhaK  were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and the complex purified on a Superdex 200  column equilibrated in buffer B. Complex-containing fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration to 5.5 mg/ml, and 5.9 mg/ml for DhaR(N) with DhaK,  and with DhaK(T79L), respectively.
Crystals were obtained by hanging drop  vapor diffusion by equilibrating 1 ml protein with 2 ml reservoir solution (0.1 M  imidazole pH 6.5 and 38%46% PEG 200) over 1 ml reservoir solution.
  Crystals of the DhaR(N)-DhaK and DhaR(N)-DhaK(T79L) complexes are  isomorphous and belong to space group P61 with a = b = 231.4, c = 79.8 A .
  They contain two DhaK subunits and two DhaR(N) units in the asymmetric  unit with a Vm = 4.23 A 3 Da1 (solvent content of 71.0%; Matthews, 1968).
  Crystals of the DhaR(N)-DhaL complex belong to space group P1 with unit  Structure  DhaR Regulates Transcription by Helix Rotation  Structure 22, 478487, March 4, 2014 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 485cell dimensions a = 89.8, b = 91.5, c = 93.8 A , a = 84.2, b = 72.4, g = 90.0.
They  contain four DhaL molecules and four DhaR(N) subunits in the asymmetric unit  with a Vm = 3.17 A 3 Da1 (solvent content of 61.3%).
For data collection, crystals were flash-cooled (no additional cryoprotectant required) in a nitrogen  stream at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems).
  X-Ray Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement  Diffraction data for the DhaR(N)-DhaK, DhaR(N)-DhaK(T79L), and DhaR(N)-  DhaL complexes were collected at a wavelength of 0.9793 A to resolutions  of 3.25, 2.83, and 2.32 A , respectively, at the 31-ID beamline (LRL-CAT),  Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data integration  and scaling were performed with the program HKL2000 (Otwinowski and  Minor, 1997).
The previously published DhaK structure (PDB code 1OI2) was  used as a search model for structure determination of the DhaR(N)-  DhaK(T79L) complex using the program Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007).
To  improve the density for the DhaR(N) subunits, we applied the prime-andswitch routine of the Resolve program (Terwilliger, 2003).
This procedure  resulted in an initial model for DhaR(N,) which contained 60% of the main  chain atoms.
Starting from this initial model, we performed iterative cycles  of model building and refinement with COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004)  and Refmac (Murshudov et al., 1997) from the CCP4 suite.
The structures of  the DhaR(N)-DhaK complex was determined by molecular replacement using  the above DhaR(N)-DhaK(T79L) structure as the search model.
The structure  of the DhaR(N)-DhaL complex was determined by molecular replacement  using the previously published DhaL structure (PDB code 2BTD) and the  DhaR(N) model obtained above as search models.
All models have good  geometry as analyzed with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993).
Final data  collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1.
  Isothermal Titration Calorimetry  Experiments were carried out on a MicroCal iTC200 titration calorimeter  (GE Healthcare).
Proteins were extensively dialyzed in 20 mM Tris pH 8,  150 mM NaCl, 1 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM ADP, and 2% glycerol.
  Twenty 2 ml injections of DhaK (866 mM), DhaK H56N (1.04 mM), or DhaK  T79L (824 mM) were added to 49 mM DhaR(N) in the cell.
Injections of DhaLHis (200 mM) were added to 42 mM DhaR(N).
All experiments were performed  at 150 s intervals at 20C.
Calorimetric data were processed using software  provided by the manufacturer using a single site model.
  ACCESSION NUMBERS  The PDB accession numbers for the crystal structures of the DhaR(N)-DhaK,  DhaR(N)-DhaK(T79L), and DhaR(N)-DhaL complexes reported in this paper  are 4LRX, 4LRY, and 4LRZ, respectively.
