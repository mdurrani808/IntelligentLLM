As a result, buried surface area  is, by itself, an insufficient indicator of a particular residues importance in binding.
Thus, our value of 21 cal  mol1 2 for the effective hydrophobicity of a peripheral tryptophan in the D1.3-HEL complex, although  probably valid for other hydrophobic residues that pack  against predominantly hydrophobic surfaces, appears  to be considerably less for hydrophobic residues that  pack against mainly polar surfaces (Sundberg et al.,  2000).
Similar considerations likely apply to central residues.

Although the physical basis for this effect remains to be  defined, at least two possibilities exist.
