  Results: The crystal structure of the LD-LDI complex reveals a new and unexpected binding mode among cereal type inhibitors.
  Conclusion: A hydrophobic cluster drives the picomolar affinity of LDI.
  Significance: The molecular understanding of regulation of starch mobilization during germination is augmented.
  Molecular details underlying regulation of starch mobilization in cereal seed endosperm remain unknown despite the paramount role of this process in plant growth.
The structure of the  complex between the starch debranching enzyme barley limit  dextrinase (LD), hydrolyzing -1,6-glucosidic linkages, and its  endogenous inhibitor (LDI) was solved at 2.7 A. The structure  reveals an entirely new and unexpected binding mode of LDI as  compared with previously solved complex structures of related  cereal type family inhibitors (CTIs) bound to glycoside hydrolases but is structurally analogous to binding of dual specificity  CTIs to proteases.
Site-directed mutagenesis establishes that a  hydrophobic cluster flanked by ionic interactions in the proteinprotein interface is vital for the picomolar affinity of LDI to LD  as assessed by analysis of binding by using surface plasmon resonance and also supported by LDI inhibition of the enzyme  activity.
A phylogenetic analysis identified four LDI-like proteins in cereals among the 45 sequences from monocot databases that could be classified as unique CTI sequences.
The  unprecedented binding mechanism shown here for LDI has  likely evolved in cereals from a need for effective inhibition of  debranching enzymes having characteristic open active site  architecture.
The findings give a mechanistic rationale for the  potency of LD activity regulation and provide a molecular  understanding of the debranching events associated with optimal starch mobilization and utilization during germination.
  This study unveils a hitherto not recognized structural basis for  the features endowing diversity to CTIs.  Starch, constituting the major carbohydrate and energy  reserve in plant leaves, tubers, and seeds, is organized in insoluble supramolecular granules containing a mixture of two  polysaccharides: amylopectin, an -1,4-glucan with -1,6  attached branches, and amylose, an essentially linear -1,4-glucan (1).
Starch has been identified as a prominent integrator in  the regulatory network that adjusts plant growth to the available carbon supply (2).
In addition to its central function in  plant physiology, starch is the most important carbohydrate for  food and feed (3), comprising up to two-thirds of the calorie  intake in humans.
  The mobilization of starch granules in barley grains during  germination involves the concerted action of - and -amylase,  -glucosidase, and limit dextrinase (LD).5 LD provides the sole  debranching activity relevant for degradation of stored starch  during germination through hydrolysis of -1,6-glucosidic  linkages in branched malto-oligosaccharides (limit dextrins)  liberated by the action of - and -amylases (4, 5).
LD is designated as a pullulanase type I debranching enzyme because of its  high activity on pullulan (6), a linear polysaccharide of -1,6-  linked maltotriose units, whereas it displays low activity toward  amylopectin (7).
Substantial LD activity has also been detected  in the endosperm of developing rice (Oryza sativa) and maize  (Zea mays) seeds, and LD is proposed to play a role in starch  biosynthesis in rice, maize, andArabidopsis(810).
This is consistent with changes observed in starch structure in the developing barley grains elicited by antisense down-regulation of the  * This work was supported by the Carlsberg Foundation, the Danish Council  for Independent Research, Natural Sciences, Technical University of Denmark Ph.D. stipends (to M.

Published in the U.S.A.  12614 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290NUMBER 20MAY 15, 2015endogenous LD inhibitor protein, LDI (11), and with changes in  sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) starch digestibility that were positively correlated with LD activity (12).
  LDI suppresses the LD activity in barley seeds during the  early stages of germination (1315).
It belongs to the family of  cereal type inhibitors (CTIs) sharing a common fold of four  -helices connected by irregular loops and stabilized by either  four or five disulfide bonds (16).
CTIs are widespread in cereals  and participate in physiologically important processes in the  seeds, e.g. regulation of endogenous hydrolases, as well as  defense against pathogens and pests, mainly fungi and insects.
  Some CTIs have dual target enzyme specificity and inhibit both  -amylases and proteases, e.g. trypsin or chymotrypsin (17).
  The regulation of LD activity by LDI is intimately associated  to the intriguing double role that LD plays at the interface of  starch synthesis and degradation.
The molecular features that  govern the formation of the regulatory LD-LDI complex are  pivotal to promote our understanding of the regulation of  starch metabolism in cereals.
Here, a comprehensive analysis of  the LD-LDI complex, covering x-ray crystal structure determination, binding kinetics, and vant Hoff thermodynamic characterization, is combined with mutational analysis of key residues at the interface in the protein-protein complex.
The  findings from this study also bring new insight into the functional versatility of the CTI protein scaffold by demonstrating a  novel binding mode that overcomes the entropic penalty associated with the inhibition of a debranching enzyme that displays an open active site architecture.
The exquisite mechanistic insight is discussed and reconciled with the upstream  regulatory cascade that governs mobilization of starch in germinating barley seeds.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  LD-LDI Protein Complex Formation and Crystallization  Recombinantly produced LD (6) and LDI (15) were mixed in a  1:4 molar ratio, and the LD-LDI complex was purified by size  exclusion chromatography on a Hiload Superdex 200 26/60  column (GE Heathcare) in 50 mM Mes/NaOH (pH 6.6), 250 mM  NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.
The LD-LDI  containing fractions were pooled and concentrated (Centricon,  30-kDa cutoff; Millipore) to A280  12.1.
LD-LDI crystals were  obtained using hanging drop vapor diffusion with equilibration  of the droplet against a reservoir of 24% (w/v) PEG 8000 and  0.05 M KH2PO4.
0.5 l of 0.1 M NAD was added to the crystallization droplet consisting of 2 l of protein solution purified as described above added 2 l of reservoir solution.
By  applying crystal seeding, new crystals appeared within 5 days  at 22 C.
The crystals were mounted in elliptical Litholoops  (Molecular Dimension) and cooled in N2(l) after addition of  25% (w/v) PEG3350, 0.05 M KH2PO4, and 10% glycerol to the  droplet.
  Data Collection, Molecular Replacement, and Structure  RefinementFinal diffraction data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) microfocus Beamline ID23-2 (wavelength, 0.873 ).
Data were  merged from four different sections of the crystal to minimize  the effect of radiation damage on the data quality.
The raw data  were processed using MOSFLM (18) and merged and scaled  using the program SCALA from the CCP4i program suite (19,  20).
The resulting structure factors were used for molecular  replacement using MOLREP from the CCP4i suite.
The protein  models were the protein moiety of HvLD--cyclodextrin (PDB  code 2Y4S) and the -helical parts of the bifunctional -amylase/trypsin inhibitor from ragi (Eleusine coracana) (RBI; PDB  code 1B1U).
The model was refined using Refmac5 from the  CCP4i program suite.
Manual inspection, rebuilding, and addition of water molecules and ions were performed with Coot  (21).
Data analysis using xtriage (22) revealed that the crystal  was twinned C2221 with a  b and a refined twin fraction of  0.57.
NCS (noncrystallographic symmetry) restraints were used  in the initial stages of refinement, but not in the last refinement  rounds.
Twin refinement was applied throughout the refinement.
In addition to the Coot validation functions, a final model  geometry optimization was performed using the output from  MolProbity (23).
Coordinates and structure factors for the LDLDI structure were deposited to the PDB with accession code  4CVW.
  BioinformaticsThe phylogenetic tree was constructed with  a set of 45 sequences found from BLAST searches with LDI  (ABB88573), RBI (P01087), the 0.19 -amylase inhibitor from  wheat (Triticum aestivum) (0.19 AI; P01085), or the Hageman  factor inhibitor from corn (Zea mays) (CHFI; P01088) against  all sequences from monocots in the NCBI database.
The  sequences were selected following the criteria: Sequences with  E values of 8  1010 were pooled, and those with 95%  identity were removed using the EMBOSS software suite (24).
  No sequences with E values of 8  1010 were identified  when dicot sequences from the NCBI database were searched.
  The resulting set of 45 sequences was aligned using MUSCLE  from the MEGA version 5, and a neighbor-joining tree was  constructed with 1000 bootstrap steps (25).
The tree and alignment were visualized using Dendroscope and ESPript, respectively (26).
  Site-directed Mutagenesis, Production, and Purification of  Wild Type LDI, LD, and LDI VariantsThe single and double  mutations in LDI were introduced following the manufacturers protocol (QuikChange; Stratagene) using the primers  listed in Table 1.

The N-terminally truncated LDI variant (TLE deleted; denoted E3  LDI) was obtained  as a side product from V5  LDI purification.
The LDI variants  were produced and purified essentially as described previously  (15).
The V5  LDI variant, however, was only purified by nickelnitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography followed by buffer  exchange to 10 mM Bicine/NaOH (pH 8.5) (Microcon, 3-kDa  cutoff; Millipore).
V5  LDI (770 g/ml) gave a single band by  SDS-PAGE analysis, and the N-terminal sequence was confirmed by automated N-terminal sequencing.
The structural  integrity of the LDI mutants was confirmed using circular  dichroism (data not shown).
  Recombinant LD WT and variants D730R and D730W were  produced in Pichia pastoris and purified as described (6) (see  Table 1 for list of primers).
Enzyme kinetic constants of LD WT  and variants were determined using a reducing sugar assay (6)  with an LD concentration of 5.2 nM. The Michaelis constant,  Km, and the catalytic constant/turnover number, kcat, were  determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation for  uncompetitive substrate inhibition to the initial velocities,  where Ki,s is the inhibition equilibrium constant.
The fitting  and plotting were done using the Enzyme Kinetics Module 1.0  of the program Sigmaplot 9.01 (Systat Software, Chicago, IL).
  The effect of the double mutation L41G-V42D of LDI on the  inhibitory activity was assayed using a modified version of the  assay described above: LD was diluted in 20 mM sodium acetate  (pH 5.5), 5 mM CaCl2, 0.005% Triton X-100 (100l), mixed with  LDI in 1 mM Bicine/NaOH (pH 8.5), 0.005% Triton X-100 (100  l) and incubated at room temperature (10 min).
The reaction  was initiated by addition of LD (assay concentration, 10 nM)/  LDI (assay concentration, 0, 0.1, 1, or 5 M) mixtures (110 l) to  990 l of substrate (0.4 mg/ml pullulan) pre-equilibrated at  37 C (10 min).
Aliquots (100 l) were removed at 3-min intervals (015 min) and mixed with developing buffer (500 l) (6)  and Milli-Q water (400 l).
  Surface Plasmon Resonance AnalysisThe LD-LDI interaction was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR;  FIGURE 1.

Immobilization of WT LDI  and variants on BIAcore CM5 sensor chips was performed by  amine coupling according to the manufacturers protocol using  110 g/ml LDI in 5 mM sodium acetate (pH 4), to a final chip  density of 200 400 response units.
The standard analysis comprised 4 min of association, 15 min of dissociation, and two  cycles (2  60 s) of regeneration with 10 mM glycine HCl (pH  1.5); flow rate 30 l/min.
The assays were run at 25 C at seven  LD concentrations (0.1 4 nM) in 10 mM Mes/NaOH (pH 6.0),  150 mM NaCl, 0.005% P-20 surfactant.
In the analysis of the  V42D and L41G_V42D LDI variants, the concentration of LD  was increased to 11000 nM and 0.5 8 M, respectively.
Furthermore, the concentration of the LD variants D730R and  D730W were 0.4 48 and 0.1 8 nM, respectively.
Mass transfer  limitations were shown not to be relevant by comparing with  rate constants obtained with 60 l/min flow rate.
Reference cell  sensorgrams were corrected for refractive index changes, for  possible nonspecific LD binding to the cell surface, and for drift  specific for the sample cell.
The effect of ionic strength on the  binding kinetics of WT LD and LDI was determined at the  standard analysis conditions, but with 0.0751 M NaCl, whereas  the pH dependence was evaluated using 10 mM of sodium  acetate (pH 5.05.5), Mes/NaOH (pH 6.0 6.5), Hepes/NaOH  (pH 7.07.5), glycine/NaOH (pH 8.09.0), and Bicine/NaOH  (pH 9.510.0).
Temperature dependence was measured at nine  temperatures (10 45 C) for five LD concentrations (0.4 8  nM).
  Two independent data sets were collected for all conditions,  and all conditions were analyzed in duplicate, except for 0.4 nM  LD samples that were analyzed in quadruplicates and served as  a control to assess the response level changes during the course  of the experiment.
The corrected sensorgrams were analyzed  using BIAcore T100 Evaluation Software (ver.
1.1).
A 1:1 binding model (27) accounting for possible mass-transport limitations was applied by nonlinear regression fitting to the sensorgrams to determine the association (kon, M1 s  1  ), the  dissociation rate constant (koff, s1  ), and KD given by koff/kon.
  Thermodynamic parameters at 25 C and standard conditions were calculated from nonlinear vant Hoff analysis  (BIAcore T100 Evaluation Software version 1.1) using kinetic  data obtained in the 1035 C range.

LD,  LDI, or LD-LDI samples (0.4 or 1 mg/ml; 2 ml) were dialyzed at  4 C (Spectra/Por dialysis tubings, 3500-Da cutoff; Spectrum  Laboratories) against 1 liter of 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH  6.0, 6.5, or 8.0), or 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 150 mM  NaCl.
Protein and buffer samples (for baseline scans and reference cell) were degassed prior to scanning at 20120 C (1 C/  min).
The reversibility of LDI unfolding was evaluated by rapid  cooling and rescanning.
Thermograms were background corrected and analyzed using Origin ver.

The LDI and LD  structures from complexes I and II were very similar and superimposed with an RMSD of 0.2 and 0.3 , respectively, based on  C atoms.
  The three-dimensional structure of LDI was composed of  four -helices (1 4) twisted into a right-handed superhelix,  where the -helices are connected by long loops and stabilized  by four disulfides: Cys9  Cys57, Cys23Cys46, Cys32Cys87, and  Cys47Cys105 (Fig. 1B).
This fold is common to CTIs (16), and  the overall structure of LDI is similar to the three other structure-determined CTIs: the bifunctional -amylase/trypsin  inhibitor from ragi (E. coracana) (RBI; PDB codes 1B1U and  1TMQ), the Hageman factor inhibitor from corn (Z. mays)  (CHFI; PDB code 1BEA), and the 0.19 -amylase inhibitor from  wheat (T. aestivum) (0.19 AI; PDB code 1HSS) with RMSDs of  the C atoms between LDI and these inhibitors in the 0.81.2   range (Table 3).
Differences between the four CTI structures  were essentially confined to loops and the N- and C-terminal  regions (Fig. 2).
  The overall LD structure in the LD-LDI complex was identical to that of free LD (PDB code 4AIO) superimposing with an  RMSD of C atoms of 0.4 . However, three short flexible loops  in the N-terminal domain of free LD (28) were too flexible to be  modeled in LD-LDI as seen also for LD-cyclodextrin complexes  (29).
The catalytic site residues Asp473, Glu510, and Asp642 from  free LD and from LD in complex with LDI were essentially  superimposable, but two residues at the active site, Phe553 and  Arg697, adopted different rotamers in LD-LDI compared with  free LD (Fig. 3).
  The active site region of LD features a wide cleft, which was  buried by LDI upon complex formation, resulting in the loss of  1325 2 of solvent-accessible surface.
LDI residues from 1 and  2, loop regions 1 and 3, as well as the segment connecting C9  with 1 were in contact with LD (Fig. 1B and Table 4).
A number of side chain rearrangements were observed in LD outside  the active site region in the LD-LDI interface (intermolecular  FIGURE 2.

Thus, Asn551, Arg582, Glu726, and Asp730  occurred as different rotamers than in free LD (Fig. 3).
  The N-terminal segment of RBI has been shown to be essential for the interaction with yellow mealworm -amylase (30) in  contrast to LD-LDI, where the LDI N terminus is not involved  in the interaction (Fig. 1B).
This observation was confirmed by  LDI variants with extended or shortened N terminus, where the  binding to LD was barely influenced (Fig. 4 and Table 5).
In fact,  LDI and LDI-like proteins lack the N-terminal Ser-Val dipeptide that is essential for binding of RBI to yellow meal worm  -amylase, as illustrated by a multiple alignment of protein  sequences from monocots (Poaceae) found by using the  sequences of LDI, RBI, CHFI, and 0.19 AI in a protein BLAST  search in the NCBI database (Fig. 5 and Table 6).
The three  putative LDI-like inhibitors from wheat, rice, and Brachypodium distachyon identified from this BLAST search all lack the  FIGURE 3.

The KD increased 1215-fold at pH 5.0 or 10.0, largely  because of increases in the dissociation rate constant, koff (Fig.  7).
Furthermore, KD decreased at lower temperatures (10  20 C) but increased about 6-fold at 45 C as compared with KD  at 25 C, mainly because of a higher koff (Fig. 7).
By contrast, KD  was independent of ionic strength in the range 751000 mM  NaCl.
A vant Hoff nonlinear thermodynamic analysis using  SPR data from the 1035 C temperature range (Fig. 8a)  showed that LD-LDI complex formation was accompanied by a  large decrease in heat capacity (Cp    3.2 kJ K1 mol1  ) and  driven by a free energy change (G  57 kJ mol1  ) originating from equally favorable entropy (TS  30 kJ mol1  )  and enthalpy (H  27 kJ mol1  ) changes.
  The conformational stability of free LD, LDI, and the LD-LDI  complex was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry.
The  thermogram of LD featured a single peak with an assigned  unfolding temperature (Tm) of 65.9 C, whereas the calorimetric trace of LDI showed a very broad peak with Tm of 97.4 C  (Fig. 8b).
As judged from the lack of thermal transition area  recovery after rescanning, the unfolding of LD and LDI was  irreversible, which precluded a full thermodynamic analysis.
  The thermogram of LD-LDI revealed two peaks with Tm values  of 77.4 and 100 C, respectively.
The first transition was  ascribed to the dissociation of the complex and unfolding of LD,  whereas the second probably originates from unfolding of LDI  at higher temperature (Fig. 8b).
Thus, the LD-LDI complex provides substantial stabilization to LD as manifested in a Tm  increase of more than 11 C as compared with free LD.
  Key Residues of LD-LDI Complex FormationAn examination of the LD-LDI interface for residues involved in the complex formation guided the selection of Arg34, Arg38, Leu41, and  Val42 in LDI and Asp730 in LD for mutational analysis.
LDI  Arg34 forms an ionic network with Glu729 and Asp730 (Fig. 1c) at  the entrance of the LD active site.
LDI Arg38 has contacts with  both the catalytic nucleophile (Asp473) and the general acid/  base catalyst (Glu510) of LD (Fig. 1d and Table 4).
In addition to  these ionic/polar interactions, LDI residues Leu41 and Val42  establish a central hydrophobic cluster jointly with LD residues  Trp512, Phe514, and Phe553 (Fig. 1e).
Trp512 is situated at LD  substrate binding subsite  2 (29) and belongs to a conserved  motif in glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) that also includes  the general acid-base catalyst (31).
LD D730 binds in a positively charged pocket on the surface of LDI via a hydrogen bond  (2.7 ) and a salt bridge (4.0 ) to Arg34 and a hydrogen bond to  Arg84 (3.2 ) (Fig. 1c and Fig. 1f).
Furthermore, LD Asp730  adopts different rotamers in the free LD and LD bound to LDI  as mentioned above (Fig. 3).
  In total, seven variants of LDI were made based on the protein-protein interactions listed above: the single R34A (probe  for charge and size effects), R38A, R38W (probe for charge  effects), L41G (probe for size effects), L41W (probe for size  effects), V42D (probe for charge effects), and the L41G-V42D  variants.
In addition, the mutations D730R and D730W were  introduced in LD to probe an electrostatic interaction with LDI  at a distant position from the active site (23  from the catalytic  nucleophile).
Binding of the LDI variants to WT LD and the  binding of WT LDI to the LD variants were evaluated by SPR.
  Changes in the association rate constant (kon) were modest for  all the LDI variants as compared with the WT.
By contrast, koff  increases of varying magnitude were measured for all LDI variants with the exception of LDI-L41W (Table 5).
The KD values  for LDI-V42D and LDI-L41G-V42D were determined from  steady state data because koff was too fast to allow determination of the binding kinetics.
Thus, the KD of L41G and V42D  increased by 100 400-fold, whereas R34A, R38A, and R38W  caused modest 1233-fold increases.
The combined mutation  of L41G and V42D led to a dramaticKD increase of 5  105  -fold.
  Although no residual activity was detected for LD in the presence of WT LDI at a 1:1 molar ratio (15), 500-fold molar excess  of the double mutant LDI-L41G-V42D was not sufficient to  TABLE 5  Key residues of the LD-LDI interaction analyzed by SPR  The values show Kinetics of LD binding to LDI WT and to LDI variants and binding of LD variants to WT LDI measured by SPR at 25 C, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl (see Fig.  4 for representative plots of the SPR data sets).

This poor inhibitory activity fits well with the KD of 20 M  determined by SPR and emphasized the pivotal role of LDI  Leu41 and Val42 in their joint contribution to LD-LDI complex  formation.
Finally, the KD values of LD-D730W and LD-D730R  binding to WT LDI were 8- and 171-fold higher, respectively,  than for WT LD (Table 5).
Although LD-D730R showed a  10-fold decrease, the kon of LD D730W was only reduced 1.5-  fold.
The two mutations of LD had no significant effect on the  kinetics of LD acting on pullulan: the Km for both variants was  0.24  0.05 mg/ml (0.16  0.02 mg/ml for WT LD), whereas  kcat was 94  16 s1 for LD-D730R and 85  14 s1 for  LD-D730W (78  10 s1 for WT LD).
  DISCUSSION  This is the first study exploring the binding of a proteinaceous inhibitor of a starch debranching enzyme, which is found  both in seeds and leaves of many plants including maize (8, 32),  mung bean (33), oat (34, 35), pea (36), rice (32), sorghum (12),  spinach (37), sugar beet (38), and wheat (39).
LD inhibitory  activity measured previously in wheat seed extracts (40) may  stem from an LDI-like protein (pUP88; CAA68248) annotated  in the present study.
Relatively high levels of LD inhibitory  activity were also reported for rye and triticale and low levels in  oat (40).
Therefore close homologues of LDI perform similar  important functional roles in other cereals, underlining the  broad relevance of the present study.
  A Novel Inhibitory Binding Mode of CTIs to Glycoside  HydrolasesOnly two crystal structures of LDI homologues of  the CTI family in complex with -amylases have been reported,  i.e. the complex formed by -amylase from yellow meal worm  (TMA) and RBI, the LDI homologue from ragi (30), and the  complex between pig pancreatic -amylase and the wheat  inhibitor 0.28 AI; the structural coordinates of the latter complex are not deposited in the PDB (41).
Very surprisingly, superimposition of the complexes of LDI (LD-LDI) and its homologue from ragi (TMA-RBI; PDB code 1TMQ) showed their  binding modes to be entirely different (Fig. 9), although both of  these target enzymes belong to GH13 and hence share a similar  fold of the catalytic domain, as well as active site amino acid  motifs (31).
  First, the N-terminal segment of RBI (Ser1  Ala11) exerts a  key role in inhibition by blocking the active site of its -amylase  target (TMA).
Thus, the N-terminal sequence 1  SVGTS5  assumes a 310-helical conformation upon binding to TMA but  is unstructured in the free RBI (42, 43).
This rearrangement  appears essential for the inhibition mechanism that involves  contacts between the N-terminal amino group of RBI with the  three acidic residues at the active site in TMA (30).
Essentially  the same binding mode is reported for an LDI homologue from  wheat with its porcine -amylase target (0.28 AI) (41).
By contrast, the N-terminal segment of LDI (1  TLESVKDE8  ) has no  contact with LD (Fig. 2b), consistent with the lack of significant  electron density for the first five residues, indicating that this  FIGURE 5continued  Barley LD-LDI Complex  MAY 15, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 20 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 12623region is disordered.
Remarkably, the close homologues of LDI  are either having an additional N-terminal di/tripeptide (wheat  pUP88 and LDI itself) preceding the functionally important serine residues observed in -amylase inhibitors or the serine residue is not present at the N terminus (B. distachyon and rice)  (Fig. 6a).
This is in excellent agreement with a different binding  mode of the LDI-like proteins targeting debranching enzymes  as opposed to those inhibitors targeting -amylases, which  have a narrower active site cleft.
  Five of the RBI residues (Pro52, Cys55, Val67, Thr69, and  Pro70) from the TMA binding regions (Pro52Cys55, Arg61,  Val67Ser71, Thr107Gly110, and Leu115Leu117) (30) are conserved in LDI (Fig. 6a), but these residues make no contact with  LD in the LD-LDI complex (Table 4).
The variable residues  flanking these five residues in LDI probably contribute to the  lack of -amylase inhibition (44) as known for the RBI binding  mode.
The LD-LDI binding mode vice versa cannot be applied  to -amylases because of steric clashes between their narrow  cleft-shaped active site and LDI.
Based on the phylogeny (Fig.  6b) and the missing N-terminal dipeptide motif, we propose  that the proteins that confer inhibition of LD-like debranching  enzymes form a clade among the CTI proteins, which we designate as LDI-like (Fig. 6b).
  LDI Loop 1 Involvement in Protein-Protein Interactions  Certain CTI proteins have dual targets (17).
The LDI homologue RBI is a dual -amylase/trypsin inhibitor, and its inhibition of trypsin is effectuated by a trypsin-binding loop  located at the opposite side of the -amylase-binding site.
  Arg34 and Leu35 from this loop interact with the active site in  trypsin (Fig. 9a) (30).
Notably, the sequence of the RBI trypsin-binding loop is not conserved in the corresponding LDI  loop 1 (Ser37 and Arg38 correspond to Arg34 and Leu35,  respectively, in RBI) (Fig. 6a), which is central in the LD-LDI  complex contacts (Fig. 6a).
LDI indeed fails to inhibit trypsin  (44).
In addition, no equivalent to the hydrophobic patch  demonstrated here to be critical for the LD-LDI complex  formation exists in the RBI:trypsin interface.
This asserts a  diversity of interactions mediated by CTI proteins and a  fine-tuning of their surfaces to match their physiologically  relevant targets.

Strikingly, this site  will only be available for regulation by the 14-3-3 proteins in  free LDI.
The interaction could have implications for LDI  involvement in regulatory networks, but the biological relevance of the reported LDI-14-3-3 protein interaction is not  known.

  Barley LD-LDI Complex  MAY 15, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 20 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 12625Inhibitory Mechanism of LDIThe large drop in heat capacity (Cp    3.2 kJ K1 mol1  ) and the favorable entropy  change associated with LD-LDI formation (approximately 50%  of the total free energy of binding) could be caused by the burial  of substantial hydrophobic solvent-accessible surface area in  the complex (46).
This is consistent with the LD-LDI structure,  where LDI Arg38 binding to the catalytic site of LD is flanked by  a hydrophobic patch containing Leu41 and Val42 shown to be  crucial for affinity to LD (Fig. 9c).
For both LDI and RBI, a patch  with positively charged surface potential becomes buried in the  complex interface, but the insertion of RBI into the narrower  active site cleft of the -amylase (Fig. 9b) occurs without concurrent intermolecular hydrophobic patch matching.
Thermodynamic data are not available for the TMA-RBI interaction;  however, the ordering of the N-terminal segment of RBI upon  binding to TMA possibly includes a significant entropic penalty  and a concomitant enthalpic compensation.
Binding of porcine  pancreas -amylase to the LDI homologue from wheat (0.19  AI) was driven by a favorable change in both entropy and  enthalpy, albeit with a larger enthalpic contribution (47), suggesting that polar interactions are more important for that  complex than for LD-LDI.
The liberation of ordered solvent  molecules accompanying hydrophobic cluster formation at the  LD-LDI interface provides an important entropic favorable  contribution to the complex formation, which seems to be a  characteristic energetic determinant that distinguishes the  open active site architecture of debranching enzymes as  opposed to the more narrow active site of -amylases.
  Electrostatic interactions seem less critical for the LD-LDI  complex formation than was expected based on the positive  surface potential patch of LDI (Fig. 9c), and the observed contact between LDI Arg38 and the acidic LD catalytic site residues.
  This interpretation is further supported by the insensitivity of  LD-LDI affinity to ionic strength and by the LDI mutational  data (Table 5).
Nonetheless, charged interactions are likely to  contribute to electrostatic steering at the molecular encounter  distance (48).
Indeed the largest decrease in kon among the  present mutants occurred because of electrostatic complementarity being lost for LD-D730R.
LD Asp730 was 4  from a  positively charged patch at the periphery of LDI (Arg34) in LDLDI (Fig. 1c and f).
Concordantly, KD is pH-dependent (Fig. 7a),  possibly because of charge disruption of hydrophilic patches.
  Biological Implications of LD InhibitionDuring the first  24 h of germination, LD and LDI are spatially separated, residing mainly in the aleurone layer and in the endosperm of the  seed, respectively (49).
LD has no classical signal peptide to  direct secretion and is released slowly from aleurone cells (4, 49,  50).
Possibly, the degradative damage to the aleurone cell walls  occurring 24 48 h after germination onset allows diffusion of  LD into the starchy endosperm (50).
When LD encounters LDI  at this stage, further hydrolysis of branched dextrins products  from starch degradation catalyzed by the abundant - and  FIGURE 7.

Consequently, undesirable germination occurring because of fluctuations in environmental  factors (e.g. premature sprouting) at an otherwise unfavorable  state can be brought to a halt without complete exhaustion of  the carbohydrate reserve, and furthermore the LD activity will  be protected for more favorable times by conformational stabilization of LD as it forms a complex with the LDI as judged by a  marked increase in unfolding temperature of LD (Tm  11 C)  in the complex as compared with the free form of the enzyme.
  The full activity of LD can only be unleashed when inactivation  of LDI takes place.
The amount of intact LDI is reduced to  below the detection limit concomitant with a reported increase  in the level of free LD during germination (51).

  Barley LD-LDI Complex  MAY 15, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 20 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 12627maybe caused by proteolysis (51) is probably facilitated by thioredoxin h reduction of disulfides in LDI, which per se results in  LDI inactivation (15).
The abundances of CTIs in general  decrease during germination (52).
  The binding mode of LDI to LD illustrates an extraordinary  versatility of CTIs featuring in a variety of regulatory and  defense related protein-protein interactions in plants.
The  impressive conformational stability of LDI together with possibility for integration with redox regulatory networks provides a  possible rationale for conservation of the structural scaffold of  the CTIs through a divergent evolution of the individual protein subfamilies.
The outcome of this is a multitude of roles  played by CTIs in regulation of plant development as seen in the  present study and for previously described defense mechanisms  (53).
