Effects of Oncogenic Mutations and DNA Response Elements  on the Binding of p53 to p53-binding Protein 2 (53BP2)*  Received for publication, May 17, 2006, and in revised form, August 2, 2006 Published, JBC Papers in Press, August 2, 2006, DOI 10.1074/jbc.
M604725200  Henning Tidow1  , Dmitry B. Veprintsev, Stefan M. V. Freund, and Alan R. Fersht2  From the Centre for Protein Engineering, Medical Research Council, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, United Kingdom  The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently mutated in human  cancers.
Upon activation it can induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
ASPP2 can specifically stimulate the apoptotic function  of p53 but not cell cycle arrest, but the mechanism of enhancing  the activation of pro-apoptotic genes over cell cycle arrest genes  remains unknown.
In this study, we analyzed the binding of  53BP2 (p53-binding protein 2, the C-terminal domain of  ASPP2) to p53 core domain and various mutants using biophysical techniques.
We found that several p53 core domain mutations (R181E, G245S, R249S, R273H) have different effects on  the binding of DNA response elements and 53BP2.
Further, we  investigated the existence of a ternary complex consisting of  53BP2, p53, and DNA response elements to gain insight into the  specific pro-apoptotic activation of p53.
We found that binding  of 53BP2 and DNA to p53 is mutually exclusive in the case of  GADD45, p21, Bax, and PIG3.
Both pro-apoptotic and non-apoptotic response elements were competed off p53 by 53BP2 with  no indication of a ternary complex.
  The tumor suppressor p53 is a tetrameric multidomain transcription factor that functions to maintain the genomic integrity of the cell (1).
In response to cellular stresses like DNA  damage, aberrant growth signals, UV irradiation, and hypoxia,  p53-mediated transcriptional activation leads to DNA repair,  cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis (2 4).
  In about 50% of all human cancers, p53 is inactivated directly  as a result of mutations in the p53 gene (5).
On the basis of the  crystal structure of human p53 core domain bound to consensus DNA (6), common cancer mutations can be classified as  structural mutations that cause structural perturbations  within the core domain or a loss of stability and contact mutations directly affecting DNA binding by the loss of a contacting  residue (7).
A third class of p53 mutations is proposed for those  mutants that retain the capacity to bind DNA but are no longer  able to interact with important cofactors (8).  It is still poorly understood why some cells undergo apoptosis upon p53 activation, whereas others respond with cell cycle  arrest.
Important factors seem to be the degree of DNA damage, cell type, and the presence of survival factors, but the exact  mechanism remains unknown (9, 10).
Recently, a family of proteins termed ASPP was identified that specifically stimulates  the apoptotic function of p53 but not cell cycle arrest (11, 12).
  Full-length ASPP2 interacts with p53 and increases its ability to  induce apoptosis when it is artificially expressed in cells (11).
  Further, the apoptotic function of p53 in response to chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin is inhibited when the expression  of intrinsic ASPP23 is prevented.
However, the mechanism of  enhancing the activation of pro-apoptotic genes over cell cycle  arrest genes is still unknown.
  53BP2 (p53-binding protein 2) is the C-terminal domain of  ASPP2.
Shortly after 53BP2 was initially discovered in a yeast  two-hybrid screen (13), the crystal structure of a complex of  53BP2 and p53 core domain has been solved (14).
Unlike most  other p53-interacting proteins that bind the N or C terminus of  p53, 53BP2 interacts with the core domain of p53 (15, 16).
  53BP2 contains four ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain.
The  C-terminal ankyrin repeat and the SH3 domain bind to an evolutionarily conserved region within the p53 core domain that is  frequently mutated in human cancers and overlaps with its  DNA-binding region (14).
  In this study, we used biophysical techniques to characterize  the interaction between 53BP2 and p53 core domain to determine the effects of common cancer mutations in p53 on binding to cofactors that further determine the fate of cells after p53  activation.
These results are discussed in comparison with  mutational effects on DNA binding.
We found mutants of p53  that do not bind 53BP2 even though they bind DNA.
This might  explain their effects in causing cancer by disrupting an important pro-apoptotic pathway.
  Further, the existence of a ternary complex consisting of  53BP2, p53, and different response elements was investigated  to gain insight into the specific pro-apoptotic activation of p53.
  We found that binding of 53BP2 and DNA to p53 is mutually  exclusive for pro-apoptotic and non-apoptotic response elements, i.e. they compete with each other.
The magnitude of  competition is modulated by differences in the binding affinity  of p53 to these response elements with no indication of a ternary complex.

D. Allen, CPE, Cambridge).
The construction of the plasmids pRSET-p53C and  pET24a-HLTV-flp53 has been described previously (17, 18).
  For full-length p53 and unstable hot-spot mutants of p53C,  respectively, we used plasmids expressing the superstable  mutant of p53 containing the following mutations in the core  domain: M133L/V203A/N239Y/N268D (19, 20).
  Protein Expression and Purification53BP2 was expressed  in Escherichia coli BL21 at 20 C for 12 h and purified using  standard His tag purification protocols followed by TEV protease digestion, a second nickel affinity chromatography step to  separate the HislipoamylTEV tag, and a final gel filtration step.
  10% glycerol (v/v) was used throughout the purification to  reduce aggregation.
The protein was kept in storage buffer (25  mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT) and  flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Wild-type p53C, T-p53C  mutants, and full-length T-p53 were expressed and purified as  described previously (1719).
Isotopically, 15N-labeled p53C  was expressed in M9 minimal medium supplemented with vitamin mix and 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl as sole nitrogen source.
  Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC)Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were performed with a Beckman XL-I  Ultracentrifuge equipped with a Ti-60 rotor and 6-sector cells  at 11,000, 15,000, 20,000, and 24,000 rpm at 10 C.
Data were  collected at 280 nm for unlabeled protein and at 494 nm for  fluorescein-labeled DNA or protein.
To assess the oligomeric  state of 53BP2, we used a 12 M sample.
When testing the  interaction between 53BP2 and p53C, the concentrations were  8 M each.
For binding of 53BP2 and/or p53C to various fluorescein-labeled DNA response elements (21) (sequences and  annealing procedure are described below), the protein concentrations were 50 M (p53C) and 100 M (53BP2), respectively;  the concentration of fluorescein-labeled DNA was 5 M. Buffer  conditions were 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mM  NaCl, and 1 mM DTT.
Sample volume was 110l.
Samples were  considered to be at equilibrium as judged by a comparison of  the several scans of each speed.
Data were processed and analyzed using UltraSpin software and KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck  Software, Reading, PA) for graph plotting.
  NMRAll NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with CryoProbeTM and single-axis  gradients.
For binding studies, HSQC spectra were acquired in  a 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM  DTT at 298 K using standard Bruker pulse sequences (22) with  concentrations of 53BP2 and uniformly labeled, perdeuterated  15N,2  D-p53C of 180 and 100 M, respectively.
The data were  processed in Feliz98 (MSI Biosystems), and figures were generated using NMR View (23).
Effects of binding were analyzed  using the assignment of p53C (17, 24) and mapped onto the  structure using PyMOL (25).
  Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)The thermodynamic parameters were determined using an isothermal titration calorimeter (VP-ITC, MicroCal, Inc.) as described previously (26, 27) at 20 C in a 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH  7.2), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT.
For binding of 53BP2 to  wild-type p53C and various p53C mutants, 200 M p53C was  titrated into the sample cell containing 10 M 53BP2.
Injection  steps were 10 l (first injection, 3 l) with 250-s spacing.
Baseline corrections were performed by titrating protein into sample buffer.
Further data evaluation was done using the MicroCal  OriginTM program.
  Fluorescence Anisotropy TitrationMeasurements were performed on a PerkinElmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer  equipped with a Hamilton Microlab titrator controlled by laboratory software.
Fluorescence anisotropy was measured with  excitation at 480 nm and emission at 530 nm and slit width of 14  and 18 nm, respectively.
Reactions were carried out at 16 and  37 C in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 150 mM  NaCl, and 5 mM DTT.
Titrations were performed as described  previously (28, 29).
In the binding experiments, 200 M p53C  was titrated into 10 nM fluorescein-labeled DNA constructs.
  Dissociation constants were obtained by fitting anisotropy data  to equations corresponding to a one-site binding model with  Kd  (K1K2K3K4)  0.25.
In the competition binding assay, a  stock solution of 150300 M 53BP2 was titrated into 1 ml of  preincubated mixture of 510 M p53C or 200 nM full-length  FIGURE 1.

Oligonucleotides  used for fluorescence anisotropy were labeled only on the  5-end of the forward strand with fluorescein (represented by Fl  in the sequences) to avoid energy transfer between fluorophores.
The following sequences were used for the different  response elements (30) (only forward strand shown, reverse strand  accordingly): GADD45 response element: 5-Fl-GTACAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGGGAC-3/p21 response element:  5-Fl-ATCAGGAACATGTCCCAACATGTTGAGCTC-3/Bax  response element: 5-Fl-TCACAAGTTAGAGACAAGCCTGGGCGTGGG-3/PIG3 response element: 5-Fl-GCACCCAGCTTGCCCACCCATGCTCAAGAT-3. The oligonucleotides were  annealed by heating to 95 C for 10 min followed by gradually  cooling to 4 C over 4 h.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Characterization of Binding of 53BP2 to p53 Core Domain  We characterized the binding of 53BP2 to p53C in solution  using different biophysical techniques.
Analytical ultracentrifugation is a suitable technique to determine the mass of a protein or a  complex under native conditions.
  53BP2 is monomeric in solution.
  The complex p53C53BP2 had an  Mr of 52,000  1100 corresponding  to a 1:1 stoichiometry in solution  (data not shown).
  NMR spectroscopy is able to provide information about the binding  surface as well as conformational  changes at a residue-specific level.
  The HSQC spectrum of p53C  revealed that several peaks disappeared because of intermediate  exchange upon binding to 53BP2  (Fig. 1A).
Most of the affected residues are localized in the binding  surface that is present in the crystal  structure (14).
In addition, residues  within loop 1, which shows conformational flexibility in the solution  structure (24), and the C-terminal  helix of p53C were also affected  (Fig. 1B).
  We further analyzed the magnitude of binding by ITC.
53BP2  binds to p53C in a 1:1 ratio with a  Kd of 2.2 M (Fig. 2A).
This value is  in the range of other proteins  binding to p53 core domain, like  53BP1-BRCT (31), Rad51 (32), or  HIF-1 (33, 34).
  Investigating the Binding of p53  Hot-spot Mutations to 53BP2  Most mutations that are observed  in human cancers map to the  DNA-binding core domain (5).
  The binding of several of these  point mutants including the most  frequently occurring hot-spot  mutants to 53BP2 was investigated  using ITC (Fig. 2).
For some  mutants, a superstable quadruple  mutant (T-p53C  M133L/V203-  A/N239Y/N268D) with almost  identical structure and DNA bindFIGURE 2.

T-p53C-V143A, T-p53C-F270L, p53C-R273H, and  T-p53C-R282W bind 53BP2 with an affinity similar to wildtype p53C or T-p53C, respectively (Table 1).
T-p53C-V143A  and T-p53C-F270L are structural mutants that simply create  a cavity within the hydrophobic core.4 Although the  presence of these mutations decreases the thermodynamic  stability, it has no major influence on either binding to DNA  or 53BP2.
  The crystal structure of T-p53C-R282W revealed that loop  L1 is disordered in this mutant.4 The retention of binding of  T-p53C-R282W to 53BP2 suggests that loop L1, which has an  important yet modular role in apoptotic signaling (35), is not  crucial for binding to 53BP2.
  53BP2 bound tightly to p53C-R273H, although it is a contact mutant with substantially reduced DNA binding (20).

  Binding of p53 to 53BP2  OCTOBER 27, 2006VOLUME 281NUMBER 43 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 32529   at NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIV on May 26, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Presumably, although Arg273 makes a crucial DNA contact  (6), it is located at the edge of the 53BP2-binding interface  (14) and makes only minor electrostatic contributions to the  binding.
  Arg249 is located in the centers of both the DNA- and 53BP2-  binding interfaces.
The structural mutation R249S disrupts a  network of interactions that stabilize the L3 loop in a conformation enabling Arg248 to make DNA contacts (20).
As Arg249  also directly interacted with the SH3 domain of 53BP2, it was  not surprising that the structural mutant p53C-R249S did not  detectably bind to 53BP2 (Fig. 2C and Table 1).
  Interestingly, the double mutant T-p53C-R249S/H168R  does bind to 53BP2 with Kd  5.2 M (3-fold weaker than  T-p53C), and thus this double mutation, which is identified as a  second-site suppressorin vivo (36, 37) reverts not only defects  in DNA binding but also in binding to 53BP2 (Fig. 2D and Table  1).
The recently solved crystal structure of T-p53C-R249S/  H168R revealed that the structural changes caused by the cancer mutations H168R and R249S are reverted if both mutations  are present in the same molecule (20).
In this case, the guanidinium group of Arg168 superimposes very well with its corresponding position in Arg249 in wild-type p53.
The fact that  binding of the second-site suppressor mutant T-p53C-R249S/  H168R to 53BP2 is 3-fold weaker than T-p53C, despite full restoration of DNA binding, highlights the importance of Arg249  in binding to 53BP2.
  We also found two mutants that did not detectably bind to  53BP2 even though they retained a weak DNA-binding affinity.
  p53C-G245S as well as the stabilized variant T-p53C-G245S  did not bind to 53BP2 (Fig. 2B and Table 1).
Because Gly245 does  not directly interact with 53BP2, this finding is somehow surprising and might be explained by an unfavorable destabilization of loop L3 that disrupts the p53C-53BP2 interaction.

  Binding of p53 to 53BP2  32530 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 281NUMBER 43OCTOBER 27, 2006   at NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIV on May 26, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from fact, the crystal structure of T-p53C-G245S revealed small but  distinct changes within the L3 loop.4  The short H1 helix of p53C forms the main interface with  53BP2.
By mutating Arg181 3 Glu within this helix, binding of  p53C to 53BP2 is disrupted (Table 1).
There are several p53  mutants with mutations at residue Arg181.
They lack apoptosisinducing activity, although they retain DNA binding activity in  vivo (11, 38 40).
Although the H1 helix is not directly involved  in DNA binding, it provides an additional core domain-core  domain dimerization interface (41 44), and mutations in this  region reveal weaker DNA binding than wild-type p53 (18).5  The fact that these mutants did not bind to 53BP2 despite  retaining DNA-binding capacity could relate them to a third  class of p53 mutations (8) alongside contact and structural  mutations.
Their effect in promoting cancer might be caused by  disrupting the binding to ASPP2 as a cofactor within an important pro-apoptotic pathway.
  53BP2 Competes off p53 from Both Pro-apoptotic and Nonapoptotic DNA Response ElementsTo investigate the selective up-regulation of pro-apoptotic response elements, we  used fluorescence anisotropy to analyze the competition  between 53BP2 and different response elements for binding  to p53C and full-length p53.
GADD45 and p21 were used as  examples of non-apoptotic genes, whereas Bax and PIG3  were used as pro-apoptotic response elements.
First, we  measured the binding of p53C to these fluorescently labeled  response elements.
The binding of p53C to GADD45 (Kd   7.5 M) and p21 (Kd  7.1 M) is significantly tighter than its  binding to the pro-apoptotic response elements PIG3 (Kd   15 M) and Bax (Kd  48 M) (Fig. 3).
AUC equilibrium  sedimentation revealed that p53C bound to the response  elements in a 4:1 complex.
As 53BP2 binds to p53C with  Kd  2.2 M, and the binding surface on p53C shows significant overlap with the one in the p53CDNA complex (14),  we tested whether competition occurs between 53BP2 and  DNA response elements bound to p53 (Fig. 4).
  We found that binding of 53BP2 to p53C competes off both  pro-apoptotic and non-apoptotic response elements.
For the  non-apoptotic response elements GADD45 and p21, this effect  is most obviously detectable by fluorescence anisotropy.
On  adding 53BP2 to p53C, preincubated with the appropriate  response element, the anisotropy decreased to the value of the  free DNA (Fig. 4A), consistent with their overlapping binding  sites on p53C.
  As the binding of p53C to the pro-apoptotic response elements Bax and PIG3 is much weaker compared with GADD45  and p21, competition experiments with these response elements by fluorescence anisotropy showed a decrease in anisotropy followed by a linear increase (Fig. 4B).
The smaller  decrease in anisotropy is because of the fact that at the starting  point only a small fraction of p53C is bound to DNA.
The linear  increase at high titrant concentration results from an increase  in viscosity and could not be explained by binding of 53BP2 to  the response element as tested in a control experiment (Fig. 5).

This indicates that 53BP2 is able to  compete off pro-apoptotic response elements from p53C  and excludes the existence of a ternary complex.
  Further, we confirmed the competition between 53BP2 and  both pro-apoptotic and non-apoptotic response elements with  full-length p53 at physiological temperature (Fig. 4C).
All tested  response elements bound tightly to full-length p53 and were  displaced upon addition of 53BP2 as indicated by the decrease  in fluorescence anisotropy.
In summary, these results indicate  that p53 can either bind DNA response elements or 53BP2, but  not both simultaneously, as DNA is displaced from p53 when  53BP2 is present.
  Several models exist to explain how cells choose between  apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (45, 46).
Supporting a variant of  the promoter-specificity model, it was postulated that ASPP2  might act as a cofactor by subtly altering the ability of p53 to  bind low-affinity pro-apoptotic response elements and thus  forming a ternary complex, ASPP2p53DNA (12, 16).
Our  results, however, showed that binding of 53BP2 and various  DNA response elements to p53 is mutually exclusive with no  indication for a ternary complex.
Analysis of both DNA and  53BP2 binding surfaces on p53C (6, 14) revealed a significant  overlap emphasizing the structural hindrance of a postulated  ternary complex.
As both 53BP2 and ASPP2 exhibit the ankyrin  repeat and SH3 domain that constitute the binding motif to  p53C, it is unlikely that they interact differently with p53.
Thus,  it seems more likely that ASPP proteins stimulate the apoptotic  function of p53 either through transcription-independent  pathways or by recruiting other transcription or chromatin  remodeling factors (16).
