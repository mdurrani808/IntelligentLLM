USA  Vol. 88, pp. 4877-4881, June 1991  Biochemistry  Epitope mapping by mutagenesis distinguishes between the two  tertiary structures of the histidine-containing protein HPr  (antibody/phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system/x-ray crystallography/two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance)  SADHANA SHARMA*, FAWZY GEORGESt, Louis T.

Many of the mutations  have wild-type activity suggesting an unaltered tertiary structure but have altered binding to three monoclonal antibodies:  Je142, Je144, and JeI323.
This altered binding defines the  residues that are involved in the epitopes of HPr.
At present,  two different three-dimensional structures have been determined for HPr, one from two-dimensional nuclear magnetic  resonance spectra and the other from x-ray diffraction of HPr  crystals.
The epitope mapping for Jel42 does not distinguish  between the tertiary structures.
However, only the HPr structure derived from two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance  spectra is consistent with a contiguous surface binding site that  can be defined as the epitope for Je144.
Thus the x-ray structure  may represent a partially unfolded HPr.
  (15), and its complex with HPr has recently been investigated  (16).
The crystals of the complex were obtained using less  severe conditions, pH 6.0 and 25% saturated ammonium  sulfate, and thus offer another opportunity to determine the  structure of HPr.
However, to properly investigate either the  structure of HPr or the potential effects of antibody binding  on the antigen, HPr, it is important to determine which of the  two HPr structures is the physiologically correct structure.
  To aid in the assessment of the interactions between HPr  and the antibodies, site-directed mutagenesis of putative  surface residues has been carried out.
It was realized that the  mapping of the epitopes by studying the effects of residue  changes on antibodies had the potential to discriminate  between the two structures of HPr.
Sufficient information has  now been accumulated to propose that the 2D-NMR is the  structure most compatible with our present knowledge of  epitopes in proteins (17, 18) and thus is probably the physiologically correct structure.
  Histidine-containing protein HPr from Escherichia coli is a  small (85 amino acids) phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS).
  HPr is phosphorylated by enzyme I, then transfers the  phosphate group to sugar-specific components, either factor  III or enzyme II, and ultimately leads to the phosphorylation  and translocation of a number of sugars (1-4).
The PTS has  a number of regulatory interactions that result in major  controls being imposed upon carbon-source utilization in E.  coli and other bacteria (3-7).
  The three-dimensional structure of HPr has been determined by two independent methods: two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) studies of HPr in solution (8-10) and x-ray diffraction investigation of HPr crystals  (11).
The structures determined by these methods are shown  in Fig. 1.
They share the same secondary structure elements,  three small a-helices, four strands of antiparallel (8-sheet,  which in the 2D-NMR structure form a four-stranded sheet,  but exist as two pairs in the x-ray diffraction structure.
The  active site components, His-15, Arg-17, and the C-terminal,  Glu-85, are maintained in both structures.
Clearly the tertiary  structure folding is different, and as such these two structures  represent one of the few major disagreements between structures determined by the two methods (12).
The only conditions under which HPr crystallized, pH 3.7 and 68% saturated  lithium sulfate (11, 13), could be considered harsh, and it has  been proposed that the x-ray diffraction structure may be a  partially unfolded HPr (11).
  There are three monoclonal antibodies that are specific for  HPr: Jel42, Jel44, and Jel323 (14).
The three-dimensional  structure of the Fab fragment of Jel42 has been described  MATERIALS AND METHODS  The monoclonal antibodies were prepared as described (14).
  The gene for HPr (within a Cla I-Sma I DNA fragment) was  obtained from H. Kornberg (19) in pAB65 and was transferred into the Acc I and Sma I restriction endonuclease  cloning sites in pUC19 for protein overproduction and in  M13mpll for oligonucleotide-dependent site-directed mutagenesis (20).
  HPr wild-type and mutant proteins were prepared from E.  coli strain ES7 (14), which was ptsH and was made recA.  Some preparations were made from E. coli strain TP2811,  which contained a deletion of the pts operon and was  obtained from A. Danchin (21).
Four liters of LB broth with  100 gg of ampicillin per ml (20) yielded 20-30 g of wet weight  cells from which 20-400 mg of HPr or mutant HPr was  obtained.
Purification of HPr involved the following: the  removal of membranes by centrifugation; chromatography  on Ultrogel AcA 54 (10 x 100 cm column) equilibrated with  10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5); chromatography on DEAEcellulose or Q Sepharose using the same buffer and eluting  with gradients up to 0.3 M NaCl; lyophilization and then  dialysis against 5 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5); chromatography on S Sepharose with the same buffer and gradients up to 0.5 M NaCl.
This purification method is a rearrangement of the previous methods (22).
Mutated genes or  pure proteins of some of the mutant HPrs were obtained from  others (Table 1).
All preparation of these HPrs contained  <1% of the deaminated product, HPr-1 (23).
  Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the general  methods of Zoller and Smith (24) as modified by Kunkel (25).
  For single base changes, generally 12-15 base primers would  Abbreviations: PITS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; 2D-NMR, two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance.

Polypeptide chain folding of HPr.
The two structures show only the a-carbon chain folding and are oriented such that the active site  components, His-15, Arg-17, and Glu-85, are in approximately the same positional relationship.

  give adequate results, whereas double and triple base  changes require primers up to 22 bases.
Primers rich in  adenosine and thymine residues needed to be longer.
All  mutations were confirmed by the complete sequencing of the  open reading frame of the HPr gene.
  The ability of the antibodies to bind to HPr and mutant  HPrs was assessed using a competition solid-phase radioimmune assay as has been described (14).
Mutant HPr protein  concentration was determined by the methods of Lowry et al.  (26) and of Waddell (27) using wild-type HPr as a control.
The  PTS activity of the HPr mutants was determined using an  enzyme Ilma"nose assay as described (28).
The HPrs were  assayed as substrates of enzyme 11mannose using concentrations of about 1, 2, and 4 /LM.
These concentrations represent  the part of the Michaelis-Menten function that approximates  a first-order relationship, and the activity of mutant HPrs was  expressed as a percentage of the response given by wild-type  HPr.
Higher concentrations of mutant HPrs were used when  activities were low.
  The space-filling models of HPr were generated using the  RASTER3D program written by D. Bacon (University of Alberta) and modified by A. Beghuis and M. E. Murphy  (University of British Columbia).
The structures used are the  published structures (10, 11).
  RESULTS  The experimental approach and conclusions are based upon  the following rationale.
The three-dimensional structures of  several protein antigens with monoclonal Fab fragments have  been described (17, 18, 29-31).
These reports indicate that  the surface area comprising epitopes on proteins can vary  between 680 and 880 A2 and involve about 14-21 surfaceexposed residues, essentially all of which are in a continguous area.
The best-described system involves lysozyme as  the protein antigen.
Lysozyme (Mr 14,388) is larger than HPr  (Mr 9017), but both are small proteins, and thus lysozyme is  a reasonable molecule for comparison.
If, as is the situation  for HPr, there were two proposed tertiary structures for a  protein, then a discontinuous epitope on the correct structure  should form a contiguous area, whereas in the other structure, the residues identified as being part of this epitope could  be dispersed throughout the structure.
If surface-exposed  residues were changed by mutagenesis such that they did not  cause general structural changes, then the epitopes could be  mapped by measuring the effect or lack of effect of the  changes on antibody binding.
A discrimination between the  two structures could then be made by examining the location  of residues on the two structures.
  A large number of residues in HPr have been changed by  mutagenesis (Table 1), and their effects on antibody binding  have been assessed using a sensitive competition assay (14).
  It would appear that radical changes can often be made to  surface residues, without causing general structural rearrangements.
The lack of structural rearrangement was assessed in the following ways: changes to HPr activity; the  detection of a significant change in binding with one antibody  but little or no changes for the other antibodies.
This latter  assessment was compromised because the results suggest  that Jel42 and Jel44 have overlapping epitopes.
  Many of the mutant HPrs had small (20%o) or no changes  in activity.
The activity assays have a reliability of about  10%1 of the values given.
However, some mutant HPrs had  significant changes.
Mutants V6F, E68A, and D69E have  significant activity changes, but they cause only minor  changes to the ability ofthe antibodies to bind to the epitopes.
  Mutations of residues at or near the active site, residues 17  and 83-85, all gave expected losses in activity, but apart from  termination at residue 83 none of them is involved in the  epitopes.
Residue 83 was changed to alanine and gave a  change in antibody binding without the concomitant loss in  activity.
Some mutants with low activity, K24E and the  double mutant, F48M, M49G, appear to be involved with  only the epitope of Jel323, suggesting that the structural  changes are limited.
Similarly, S41K and E66K are very  specific for Jel42.
One mutant, T34N, resulted in a change in  antibody binding for all three monoclonal antibodies.
T34N  had no detectable PTS activity; thus it may have been a  disrupted structure.
The T34Q mutation suggests that Thr-34  is not a residue involved with the epitopes.
Phe-2 when  changed to Tyr-2 did not alter Jel42 binding or PTS activity,  yet the subsequent examination of both of the structures of  HPr (see below) indicated that this residue was in the middle  of the Jel42 epitope.
The subsequent mutation to Trp-2  yielded the result expected from examination of the structures but resulted in a loss in activity.
Residues 2 and 66-72  are located close to each other in the 2D-NMR structure (Fig.  1), and residues 66-72 form a loop between the last strand of  Proc.

  /-sheet structure and the C-terminal a-helix.
In both structures these residues are not in the vicinity of the active site,  yet the integrity of residues in this region appears to be  required for activity.
  Most mutations gave no change in the binding of at least  one antibody.
Between the three antibodies, about 50%o of the  surface of HPr is being monitored.
Given that a 10-fold  change in binding can be equated to one hydrogen bond  formed or disrupted, these antibodies provide a sensitive  surface-monitoring system.
Collectively, the results in Table  1 suggest that the Jel323 epitope determinants are largely  independent of those for Jel42 or Jel44, whereas Jel42 and  Jel44 epitopes are different but overlapping.
Some mutants  gave small changes to antibody binding (2-fold or 3-fold).
For  Jel42 and Jel44, the 2-fold changes have been grouped with  those giving no change in binding for the purpose of description of the epitopes.
This is because they represent measurements at the limit of our confidence in the competition assay.
  The competition assay with Jel323 showed more variation,  and values up to 3-fold changes in binding were not considered definitive.
  In the space-filling models of HPr that follow (Figs. 2 and  3), residues whose mutation changes antibody binding are  colored deep and pale blue for significant and weak changes,  respectively.
The division between these is arbitrary but  reflects our assessment of the alteration: "significant" is any  change giving at least a 10-fold change in binding, whereas a  "weak" change is between 3- and 10-fold.
  The residues that have been identified as part of the Jel44  epitope are shown in Fig. 2. "Back and front" views (resulting from a 1800 rotation about the horizontal axis) of the  2D-NMR (Fig. 2A) and the x-ray diffraction (Fig. 2B) structures revealed a contiguous area of the epitope (blue colors)  in the 2D-NMR structure, which is uninterrupted by those  residues (brown) that apparently have no involvement.
In the  center of the epitope, three residues whose side chains have  limited surface exposure in the 2D-NMR structure have not  been mutated.
These are Ala-73, Val-74, and Leu-77, which  make up part of the hydrophobic core of HPr in the 2D-NMR  structure.
Mutation of such residues could cause packing and  folding distortions.
In general, the residues are located in the  2D-NMR structure in a pattern that is consistent with our  present understanding of a protein epitope.
In contrast, the  same residues when located in the x-ray diffraction structure  (Fig. 2B) are found scattered throughout the molecule, some  buried, and generally mixed among noninvolved residues.
  Residues Glu-75 and Glu-83 would appear to be major  determinants in the epitope, yet they are essentially buried  within the HPr structure that was determined by x-ray  diffraction.
In addition, Ser-64, His-76, and Lys-79 with  apparent weaker contributions are essentially buried, and in  fact Lys-79 is primarily exposed on the back of the molecule.
  In contrast, all of these residues have good surface exposure  in the 2D-NMR structure.
  The residues (blue colors) identified in the Jel42 epitope are  shown in Fig. 3 A and B. Clearly, the residues form a  contiguous area on both structures.
The epitope has components that are discontinuous but that are close to each other  in both structures.
The N-terminal methionine residue is the  prominent nonmutated residue in the center of the epitope  and would appear to be part of the epitope.
It may be part of  the Jel44 epitope (Fig. 2A).
This cannot easily be changed as  it is the translational initiation site.
There are two residues,  Glu-75 and His-76, that cause changes to Jel42 binding that  are buried in the x-ray structure, whereas they are surface  exposed on the 2D-NMR structure.
  The results in Table 1 clearly indicate that Jel323 epitope  is distinct from the other epitopes.
There are only a few  antigenic determinants yet identified for Jel323 (Fig. 2C),  most of which also inhibit PTS activity.
In the 2D-NMR  structure, the Jel323 epitope residues are located primarily on  the "side" opposite to the Jel44 epitope and are not interspersed with residues that were identified as not being part of  the epitope.
In contrast, the same Jel323 epitope residues  located on the x-ray diffraction structure are dispersed among  residues that have no effect on antibody binding.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 (1991) 4881  DISCUSSION  Application of x-ray diffraction and 2D-NMR techniques to  the determination of protein structures has for the most part  resulted in considerable agreement.
The two threedimensional structures determined for HPr have presented  one of the major deviations (12).
The results of epitope  mapping presented here indicate that the structure being  recognized by the antibodies, in particular for Jel44, is  consistent with that determined by 2D-NMR.
Jel42 binds to  a surface that is contiguous in both structures, which is  consistent with the fact that the two structures, although  different, share common features.
It would therefore appear  that the 2D-NMR structure is the one present under physiological conditions.
  Neither of the structures for HPr is a high-resolution  structure.
The x-ray structure was determined to 2.8 A and  had an R value of 23% (11).
The 2D-NMR structure is also an  initial structure (10).
It has been proposed that the structure  determined by x-ray diffraction may be a partially unfolded  protein, and this view would appear to be the most likely  explanation for the differences (11).
Many protein structures  are determined from crystals that are often formed under  conditions that are much harsher than those normally accepted as being close to the physiological state.
The example  of HPr does not justify any sweeping conclusions that such  conditions lead to nonphysiological structures.
However, the  results suggest that the conditions of crystallization may have  effects on the structures ofsmall proteins and perhaps protein  domains.
  The epitope descriptions presented here, although not  complete, represent an extensive investigation of the surface  of a protein.
The results indicate that there is considerable  flexibility to the residues that may be introduced into surface  positions not involved in the active site or at other sensitive  locations.
Completion of the Jel42 epitope description by  mutagenesis, independently of knowledge of the Jel42 epitope from the current x-ray diffraction studies on the Fab  Jel42/HPr complex, will provide a good assessment of the  potential use of mutagenesis to describe epitopes.
