In the present study, we report the  crystal structure of a macromolecular complex, in which human transthyretin, human holo-retinol-binding protein and a murine anti-retinol-binding  protein Fab are assembled according to a 1 : 2 : 2 stoichiometry.
The main  interactions, both polar and apolar, between retinol-binding protein and  transthyretin involve the retinol hydroxyl group and a limited number of  solvent exposed residues.
The relevance of transthyretin residues in complex formation with retinol-binding protein has been examined by mutational analysis, and the structural consequences of some transthyretin point  mutations affecting proteinprotein recognition have been investigated.
  Despite a few exceptions, in general, the substitution of a hydrophilic for a  hydrophobic side chain in contact regions results in a decrease or even a  loss of binding affinity, thus revealing the importance of interfacial hydrophobic interactions and a high degree of complementarity between retinolbinding protein and transthyretin.
The effect is particularly evident when  the mutation affects an interacting residue present in two distinct subunits  of transthyretin participating simultaneously in two interactions with a retinol-binding protein molecule.
This is the case of the amyloidogenic I84S  replacement, which abolishes the interaction with retinol-binding protein  and is associated with an altered retinol-binding protein plasma transport  in carriers of this mutation.
Remarkably, some of the residues in mutated  human transthyretin that weaken or abolish the interaction with retinolbinding protein are present in piscine transthyretin, consistent with the lack  of interaction between retinol-binding protein and transthyretin in fish.

  FEBS Journal 275 (2008) 58415854  2008 The Authors Journal compilation  2008 FEBS 5841Transthyretin (TTR), a homotetramer of approximately 55 kDa, is a thyroid hormone-binding protein  present in the extracellular fluids of vertebrates,  where it participates, together with other binding  proteins, in the distribution of thyroid hormones  (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) [1].
It was generated  during early vertebrate evolution as a result of a  duplication event in the gene encoding 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase, an enzyme distributed in several  prokaryotes and in several eukaryotic lineages and  involved in purine metabolism [26].
The extracellular transport of retinol (vitamin A alcohol) is specifically mediated by retinol-binding protein (RBP, also  known as RBP 4), a monomeric protein of 21 kDa  that delivers the vitamin molecule to the target cells  [7,8], where a membrane RBP receptor represents a  major mediator of cellular vitamin A uptake [9,10].
  TTR and RBP are synthesized primarily by the  hepatocytes and are secreted into the circulation,  where RBP is found bound to TTR.
The association  of RBP with TTR increases the stability of the retinolRBP complex [11,12] and, according to various  lines of evidence [1315], is believed to reduce the  glomerular filtration of the relatively small RBP molecule.
In turn, the stability of the RBPTTR complex is strongly affected by the presence of retinol  bound to RBP within the complex, a feature that is  believed to be of physiological significance.
The  affinity of holoRBP for TTR is significantly higher  than that of apoRBP [16,17], which is consistent  with holoRBP being retained in the circulation as  the proteinprotein complex and with the uncomplexed apoRBP molecule, resulting from the delivery  of retinol, being selectively cleared from the circulation by glomerular filtration.
TTR has been associated with human diseases.
It is one of several  proteins that can produce the extracellular accumulation in tissues of protein aggregates, in the form of  fibrils, which are responsible for degenerative diseases  known as amyloidoses; to date, more than 100 point  mutations have been described for TTR, most of  which are involved in familial amyloidoses [18,19].
  Moreover, a protective role of TTR in Alzheimers  disease has recently been proposed [20,21].
RBP is  an adipocyte-derived signal that may contribute to  the pathogenesis of insulin resistance [22].
  Well-refined crystal structures of TTR from different vertebrate species, including mammals [2325],  chicken [26] and fish (sea bream) [27,28], and of  RBP from mammals [2933] and chicken [34], have  been described.
The crystal structures of heterologous  (human TTRchicken RBP) [35] and homologous  (human TTRhuman RBP) [36] TTRholoRBP complexes have also been determined, both characterized  by a 1 : 2 TTR : RBP stoichiometry in which each  TTR-bound RBP molecule interacts simultaneously  with three TTR subunits [35,36].
TTR is a tetrameric  protein formed by the assembly of four identical subunits.
Each monomer is composed of eight anti-parallel b-strands (AH), arranged in a topology similar  to the Greek key b-barrel, with a short a-helix  located at the end of b-strand E. In the tetramer,  the four monomers are organized as a dimer of  dimers.
Specifically, two monomers are held together  to form a stable dimer through a net of H-bond  interactions involving the two edge b-strands H and  F. To form the tetramer, two dimers associate back  to back, mainly through hydrophobic contacts  between residues of the loops formed by b-strands A  and B and b-strands G and H. One of the two-fold  symmetry axes of the tetramer is coincident with a  long channel that transverses the entire molecule and  harbors two binding sites for thyroid hormones.
  RBP is a single domain protein, made up of an  N-terminal coil, eight anti-parallel b-strands (AH)  and a short a-helix close to the C-terminus.
The  core of the protein is the internal cavity of an eightstranded up-and-down b-barrel.
The vitamin molecule is accommodated within the cavity of the barrel:  the b-ionone ring is innermost, the polyene chain is  fully extended and the hydroxyl end group is almost  solvent exposed, in the region of the loops that connect b-strands A and B, C and D and E and F and  surround the entrance of the b-barrel at the open  end of the cavity.
As a result of evolutionary  restraints imposed by the multiple interactions established by both RBP and TTR, a high degree of  structural similarity appears to be preserved for these  two proteins from phylogenetically distant vertebrate  species.
It should be noted, however, that piscine  TTR and RBP lack the ability to form a protein  protein complex [27].
The molecular basis of the  evolution of the two piscine proteins into proteins  that possess the ability to interact with each other in  terrestrial vertebrates remains to be clarified.
  In the present study, we report on the structure of  a complex formed by the association of human TTR,  human holoRBP and a murine anti-RBP Fab, and  on a mutational analysis of the RBP-binding determinants present in the human TTR molecule.
The data  provide insight into the molecular basis of the altered  plasma transport of RBP in carriers of a relevant  amyloidogenic TTR mutation (I84S) and of the  changes in the TTR molecule that have affected its  ability to interact with RBP during the course of  vertebrate evolution.
  Transthyretinretinol-binding protein interactions G. Zanotti et al.  5842 FEBS Journal 275 (2008) 58415854  2008 The Authors Journal compilation  2008 FEBSResults  Structure of a complex between human TTR,  human holoRBP and an anti-RBP Fab  The crystal structure of the human TTRRBP complex bound to an anti-RBP Fab could be determined  at a resolution of 3.36 A , similar to that obtained for  the crystal structures of TTRRBP complexes [35,36].
  The molecular model, obtained by molecular replacement starting from the available high resolution crystal structures of RBP and TTR, is of reasonable  quality.
The anti-RBP Fab is bound to an RBP epitope that is well separated from the TTR-binding  determinants present in the RBP molecule.
It interacts with RBP on the side opposite to that involved  in the binding to TTR (Fig. 1A), so that the interactions between RBP and TTR are not affected by the  RBP-bound Fab.
The entire complex, composed of  one TTR tetramer and two holoRBP molecules in  complex with Fab, is present in the asymmetric unit  (Fig. 1A).
The two RBPFab sub-complexes are  arranged symmetrically around the two-fold axis of  TTR running through the central channel that transverses the TTR molecule.
RBP and TTR substantially maintain the structure they have in the  uncomplexed state, with only minor changes in contact regions.
  The region of entrance of retinol into the b-barrel  cavity of RBP (i.e. loops 3236, 6367 and 9298),  and retinol itself, participate in the recognition of  TTR, involving residues that are essentially located in  loops connecting b-strands of the tetrameric protein,  in such a way that one RBP molecule interacts simultaneously with three TTR subunits (Table 1 and  Fig. 1A,B).
The RBPTTR interactions are both  polar or apolar (Table 1).
The contact surface of  TTR is characterized by a prevalence of hydrophobic  residues in the case of the subunits B and C and of  hydrophilic residues in the case of the subunit A.  Val20, Trp79, Leu82, Ile84, Pro113 and Tyr114 from  both subunits B and C of TTR form a hydrophobic  patch, which is in contact in the proteinprotein complex with the hydrophobic patch formed by the residues Trp67, Leu63, Leu64, Val69, Phe96 and Leu97  of RBP.
Instead, the interacting hydrophilic residues  from the subunit A of TTR are closer to the border  of the contact surface of TTR.
Four H-bonds, mainly  between RBP and the subunit B of TTR, are also  present (Table 1).
The area buried on the two proteins upon complex formation is 1443 A 2  , out of a  total area of 9307 and 21502 A 2 for the two separated RBP and TTR molecules, respectively.
  The FabRBP interaction involves the region preceding the a-helix and the C-terminal b-strand of RBP  and the hyper-variable regions of Fab: loops 5356  and 100103 and the short helix 2832 of chain H and  loops 3136 and 5356 of chain L. The interactions,  which are mainly polar and comprise several H-bonds,  are summarized in Table 2.
The number of residues  involved in the formation of the FabRBP complex is  smaller than that of interacting residues in the RBP  TTR complex (Table 2) but the surface buried upon  complex formation is comparable to that for the RBP  TTR complex (1588 A 2  ).
The contacts between interacting surfaces of RBP and Fab are shown in Fig. 1C.
  Mutational analysis of the RBP-binding  determinants of TTR  The amino acid sequences of RBP and TTR from different vertebrate species showing the residues of  human RBP and TTR that are mainly involved in  interactions, according to our structure of the TTR  RBPFab complex, are shown in Fig. 2.
The functional and structural consequences of several TTR  point mutations on the RBPTTR interactions have  been investigated.
The values of the dissociation constants for several complexes between human TTR variants and human RBP, as determined by means of  fluorescence anisotropy titrations (Fig. 3A), are  reported in Table 3.
For some TTR mutations that  abolish or weaken significantly the RBPTTR interactions, the crystal structures of the variants have been  determined or already available structures have been  examined to provide details of the interference with  proteinprotein recognition by mutations.
  V20S TTR variant  Two Val20 residues present in two distinct TTR subunits (B and C, according to our designation of TTR  subunits) are located at the center of a large hydrophobic patch in the contact area between TTR and RBP,  so that their replacement by a hydrophilic residue is  expected to significantly impair proteinprotein interactions.
Accordingly, the V20S mutation has been  found to almost abolish the binding affinity between  RBP and TTR (Table 3 and Fig. 3A).
To investigate  the structural consequences of the V20S replacement  on the RBPTTR recognition, we have determined the  1.6 A resolution crystal structure of the V20S TTR  variant.
The overall structure is very similar to that of  the wild-type protein (PDB: 1F41) [25]: a superposition  of equivalent Ca atoms gives an rmsd of 0.40 and  0.68 A for subunits A and B, respectively.

  Transthyretinretinol-binding protein interactions G. Zanotti et al.  5844 FEBS Journal 275 (2008) 58415854  2008 The Authors Journal compilation  2008 FEBSsignificant differences are observed for loop region  98103, which connects b-strands G to F and is flexible in most TTR structures, and for loop 1922, which  connects b-strands A and B and hosts the mutation.
  The movement of the latter loop is not large (the Ca  atom of Val20 is displaced by 1.6 A from its position  in the wild-type structure) but the entire loop 1922 is  displaced by more than 1.5 A from its original position  (Fig. 3B), so that the change in the positions of Val20  and Arg21 of two distinct TTR subunits (Table 1) may  interfere simultaneously with two interactions established with RBP.
  I84S and I84A TTR variants  A drastic effect on the recognition between TTR and  RBP is caused by mutations at position 84.
The in vitro  binding of the I84S and I84A TTR variants to RBP is  abolished or becomes almost negligible, respectively  [37] (Table 3 and Fig. 3A).
Accordingly, the lack of  interaction between RBP and the amyloidogenic I84S  TTR is known to lead to a markedly lowered plasma  concentrations of RBP in individuals carrying the  mutation due to the impaired transport function of the  TTR variant [38].
The explanation for this effect is not  straightforward because the structures of the I84S  (PDB: 2G4G) [39] and I84A (PDB: 2G4E) [39] TTR  variants at neutral pH are very similar to that of the  wild-type protein.
In both cases, the amino acid  replacements are not associated with significant local  conformational changes.
Ile84 occupies a central position in a hydrophobic patch of TTR involved in hydrophobic interactions with RBP; its replacement by a  serine can perturb the polarity of the microenvironment  at the interface, thereby impairing proteinprotein recognition.
A reduction of the steric hindrance of the side  chain of Ile84 as a consequence of the I84A mutation  can instead perturb the interaction.
It is concluded that  the residue at position 84 is particularly relevant for  proteinprotein recognition.
In this respect, it should  be noted that, as in the case of Val20 and Arg21, two  lle84 residues of two subunits present in two different  dimers of the TTR tetramer are involved at the same  time in the interactions with one RBP molecule  (Table 1).
Therefore, an amino acid substitution at  position 84 in TTR can lead to the loss of two relevant  contacts between two residues of an RBP molecule and  both dimers of the TTR counterpart.
Moreover, we  have demonstrated that, at variance with wild-type  TTR, at pH 4.6, both I84S and I84A mutations induce  a remarkable conformational change in the region comprising residue 84, with the disruption of the a-helix  itself [39].
It is tempting to speculate that the two  amino acid replacements cause a destabilization of the  TTR region hosting the mutation, as revealed by the  structural alteration at acidic pH, which in turn may  affect the interaction with RBP.
  S85A TTR variant  Ser85 appears to be relevant for the TTRRBP interaction on the basis of the structure of the complex  because it participates in several contacts with RBP  residues: two are H-bond interactions, one between the  Ser85 -OH group and the amide nitrogen of Lys99 of  RBP and the other between the amide nitrogen of  Table 1.

  Transthyretinretinol-binding protein interactions G. Zanotti et al.  5846 FEBS Journal 275 (2008) 58415854  2008 The Authors Journal compilation  2008 FEBSmutation may be partially compensated by a novel  hydrophobic interaction in a hydrophobic patch  involving Ala85.
  D99A and S100E TTR variants  These are important mutations because each of them  causes an approximately 20-fold decrease in binding  affinity of TTR for RBP (Table 3 and Fig. 3A).
Both  replaced residues interact with Lys99 of RBP and,  moreover, Ser100 is close to Trp91 (Table 1).
Consequently, it is conceivable that the replacements of  Asp99 by a hydrophobic residue and of Ser100 by a  charged residue significantly perturb the interactions.
  However, it is likely that the effects of the D99A and  S100E mutations are less drastic compared to the I84S  and V20S replacements because the interactions involving residues at positions 99 and 100 are present at the  periphery of a contact area between RBP and TTR.
  Moreover, the new electrostatic situation for the TTR  variants could result in new interactions of the  mutated residues with the solvent.
  Y114F and Y114H TTR variants  A special case is represented by Tyr114: its substitution  for a phenylalanine lowers the dissociation constant of  the proteinprotein complex by an approximate factor  of two, whereas the dissociation constant is three-fold  higher when Tyr114 is replaced by a histidine (Table 3  and Fig. 3A).
We have also determined the crystal  structure of the amyloidogenic Y114H variant: no significant conformational changes have been observed,  and, in particular, the side chain of His114 maintains  the same position and orientation compared to  Tyr114.
The same holds for the position and orientation of the Phe114 residue present in the structure of  both chicken TTR [26], which interacts well with RBP  [17,40], and piscine TTR [27].
The -OH group of  Tyr114 forms an H-bond with the -OH group of Ser95  of RBP.
Moreover, Tyr114 is in a hydrophobic patch  of TTR, despite its proximity to the protein surface.
  Its replacement by a phenylalanine is not drastic in  terms of modification of the surface potential but it  leads to the loss of an H-bond interaction.
It must be  assumed that the loss of a H-bond interaction for the  Y114F variant is compensated by some conformational rearrangements that result in stronger hydroA  B  Fig. 3.

The  replacement of Tyr114 by a potentially charged histidine could have a marked effect on the surface potential; the finding that the Y114H mutation does not  drastically impair the RBPTTR interaction suggests  that His114 is not protonated in the proteinprotein  complex.
  Modeling of the interactions of piscine TTR and  RBP with protein counterparts within the  TTRRBPFab complex  
The observation that human TTR and RBP are bound  in the TTRRBPFab complex without undergoing significant conformational changes compared to the uncomplexed proteins prompted us to assess the ability of  the two proteins from fish, which are unable to interact  with each other [27], to fit within the structure of the  TTRRBPFab complex by replacing the corresponding human proteins present in the complex.
The structure of sea bream (Sparus aurata) TTR is known [27],  whereas no structure for a fish RBP is available to date.
  Therefore, only a theoretical model for the structure of  sea bream RBP could be obtained with the SwissModel server [41].
The structure of sea bream TTR was  superimposed on that of human TTR present in the  TTRRBPFab complex, giving rise to a hypothetical  model of the mixed piscine TTRhuman RBP complex  (Fig. 4).
The most relevant difference can be observed  for loop 98102 of all the subunits of TTR, especially  for subunits A and C, due to some remarkable mutations affecting interacting residues (Table 3 and  Fig. 2B).
The conformation of loop 8085 of piscine  TTR also changes slightly (Fig. 4), possibly due to  relevant mutations in this area (Table 3 and Fig. 2B).
  The same holds for a model in which the human RBP  structure is also replaced by a theoretical sea bream  RBP structure, giving rise to a hypothetical piscine  RBPTTR complex (Fig. 4).
Conformational differences for TTR along with point mutations that have no  effect on TTR structure (Fig. 2B) may account for the  experimentally determined lack of binding affinity  between piscine TTR and RBP, as well as between  piscine TTR and human RBP [27].
Only limited conformational differences between piscine and human RBP  are found.
Accordingly, the degree of conservation of  the putative interacting residues is remarkably higher in  piscine RBP than in piscine TTR; the only significant  amino acid difference in piscine RBP compared to  human RBP is K99T (Fig. 2A).
These features may  explain the existence of an affinity, albeit weak,  between piscine RBP and human TTR [27,42].
  Discussion  The human holoRBPTTR complex is relatively weak,  being characterized by a dissociation constant of  approximately 0.35 lm (Table 3). It has been suggested  that this feature may be correlated with the need for  the presence in plasma of a small but significant  amount of uncomplexed holoRBP, which can thus  leave the circulation more easily to deliver the retinol  to the target tissues [7].
A limited number of residues  and retinol itself are mainly responsible for the relatively weak RBPTTR interaction.
An important role  played by the retinol hydroxyl end group in the  interaction is consistent with the low binding affinity  of apoRBP compared to that of holoRBP for TTR  [16,17] and with the drastic interference with the  interaction between the two proteins by RBP-bound  fenretinide, a retinoid that bears a bulky end group in  place of the retinol hydroxyl group [43,44].

  Transthyretinretinol-binding protein interactions G. Zanotti et al.  5848 FEBS Journal 275 (2008) 58415854  2008 The Authors Journal compilation  2008 FEBSsurrounding the opening of the b-barrel (in particular,  residues Leu35 and Phe36) in apo-RBP compared to  holoRBP [30,31] is likely to contribute to the weakening of the interaction of apoRBP with TTR due to the  involvement of such a loop in RBPTTR recognition.
  Despite a few exceptions, the substitutions of hydrophilic for hydrophobic side chains in TTR contact  regions generally have a rather pronounced dissociating effect on the RBPTTR complex, consistent with  the important role played by interfacial apolar interactions.
In general, the changes in the TTR molecule  induced by amyloidogenic mutations do not interfere  with the interactions between RBP and TTR, unless  the mutations are located in contact areas.
The amyloidogenic mutations V30M, L55P, L58H and T60A have  a limited effect on the binding affinity between RBP  and TTR (Table 3), in accordance with the lack of the  replaced residues in contact areas; moreover, it can be  inferred that such amyloidogenic mutations do not  cause large conformational changes in the TTR molecule that might affect indirectly the RBPTTR recognition.
Conversely, the amyloidogenic I84S mutation,  which affects a residue that is crucial for proteinprotein interactions, causes the lack of recognition  between RBP and TTR and an altered plasma transport of RBP by TTR [37,38].
It might be hypothesized  that the ability of RBP to interact well with relevant  amyloidogenic TTR variants, such as V30M, L55P,  L58H and T60A, can protect them from amyloid  aggregation.
However, it should be noted that the  plasma concentration of TTR is significantly higher  than that of RBP [7], so that a protective effect of  RBP on TTR can only be limited.
  Despite the high symmetry of TTR, which is a homotetramer with virtually four identical binding sites for  RBP, a 1 : 1 TTR : RBP complex is believed to be  present in plasma due to the excess of TTR over RBP  [7].
Binding data obtained in solution [17,37,45] and  structural data [35,36] have shown that a maximum of  two RBP molecules can be bound by one TTR tetramer.
The binding of two RBP molecules to an uncomplexed TTR tetramer partially hinders the potential  binding of two nearby RBP molecules, thereby limiting  the possible interactions with tetrameric TTR to two  RBP molecules [35,36].
However, two distinct macromolecular organizations, both accounting for the 1 : 2  TTR : RBP stoichiometry, have been described for  the heterologous and the homologous RBPTTR  complexes [35,36].
The crystal structure of the TTR  tetramer is characterized by 222 symmetry.
One of the  three orthogonal two-fold axes runs through the  central channel harboring the two thyroid hormone  binding sites.
In the heterologous chicken RBPhuman  TTR complex, the two TTR-bound RBP molecules are  related by one of the two available two-fold axes that  are perpendicular to the central channel of TTR [35].
  Instead, in the homologous human RBPhuman TTR  complex, as well as in the case of our structure of the  TTRRBPFab complex, the two TTR-bound RBP  molecules are related by the two-fold axis running  through the central channel of TTR [36] (Fig. 1A).
  Because the two situations are chemically equivalent, a  possible explanation for the observed different assembly is that, in solution, both modes of assembly can be  present and that the crystallization process selects one  of them according to the best packing.
  By comparing the structure of the human TTR  human RBP complex bound to Fab with those of the  heterologous human TTRchicken RBP complex [35]  and of the homologous human TTRhuman RBP  complex [36], a good correspondence between these  structures with regard to interacting surfaces of TTR  and RBP has been found.
In the case of the human  TTRhuman RBP complex, however, it should be  noted that one of the two TTR-bound RBP molecules  has been reported to participate in the interaction with  the last C-terminal amino acid residues (especially  Leu182 and Leu183), thereby generating an asymmetry  within the complex [36].
At variance with this observation, our TTRRBPFab structure does not reveal the  presence of interactions between the carboxy terminus  of RBP and TTR.
On the other hand, it should be  noted that chicken RBP, in which eight C-terminal residues are missing compared to human RBP (Fig. 2A),  binds to human TTR with an affinity similar to that  exhibited by human RBP [40; C. Folli and R. Berni,  unpublished data], which suggests that the carboxy  terminus of human RBP is not so crucial for the interaction with TTR.
  The RBPTTR complex is normally isolated from  the serum of terrestrial vertebrates, such as mammals  and birds [7].
Moreover, purified human and chicken  RBP and TTR have been found to cross-interact [40].
  By contrast, RBP could be isolated from the serum of  different fish species only as uncomplexed protein  [27,42,46], suggesting that, in fish, it is present in the  circulation as an uncomplexed protein without affinity  for TTR.
In accordance with this observation, the lack  of binding affinity between purified piscine RBP and  TTR has been established [27].
The comparison of the  amino acid sequences of piscine RBPs and TTRs with  those of the same proteins from terrestrial vertebrates  reveals the presence of remarkable differences in  regions involved in proteinprotein interactions for  TTR, whereas only limited differences are present in  the case of RBP (Fig. 2A,B).
In particular, the amino  G. Zanotti et al. Transthyretinretinol-binding protein interactions  FEBS Journal 275 (2008) 58415854  2008 The Authors Journal compilation  2008 FEBS 5849acid replacements at positions 82, 84, 99 and 100 in  piscine TTR compared to the human and chicken proteins are drastic and are present at positions critical  for the interaction between RBP and TTR (Table 1  and Fig. 2B), and some of them (I84S, D99A and  S100E) are shown in the present study to impair or  abolish proteinprotein recognition (Table 3 and  Fig. 3A).
The results obtained are consistent with the  notion that evolutionary changes affecting a limited  number of surface-exposed residues led to the appearance in terrestrial vertebrates of the TTR function of  cotransport of retinol through the interaction with  holoRBP in plasma, in addition to that of the distribution of thyroid hormones in the extracellular fluids.
  Experimental procedures  Materials  HoloRBP was purified from human plasma as reported  previously [17].
Recombinant wild-type human TTR and  TTR variants I84S and I84A were prepared and quantified  as described previously [39].
All chemicals were of analytical  grade.
  Site-directed mutagenesis, bacterial expression  and purification of human TTR variants  The recombinant human TTR variants V20S, L55P, L58H,  T60A, S85A, D99A, S100E, Y114F and Y114H were prepared by PCR using the plasmid pET11b-human TTR [39]  as template, a high-fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase  (Pfu Ultra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase; Stratagene, La  Jolla, CA, USA) and mutagenic primers complementary to  opposite strands.
For each mutation, the product of reaction was treated with DpnI (New England Biolabs, Beverly,  MA, USA) to digest the parental DNA template.
This procedure allowed us to select the newly synthesized and  potentially mutated plasmids.
The products of each digestion were used to transform Escherichia coli XL1 Blue cells.
  Single clones were then sequenced to confirm the occurrence of the desired mutation.
Finally, mutant plasmids  were electroporated into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells.
The  expression of TTR variants was induced by 1 mm isopropyl  thio-b-d-galactoside and, after incubation for 4 h at 30 C,  cells were disrupted by sonication.
TTR variants were purified as described for wild-type TTR [39].
  Determination of the amino acid sequences of  anti-RBP Fab variable domains  Total RNA obtained from the cell line producing the antiRBP murine monoclonal antibody A8P3 [47] was subjected  to retrotranscription into cDNA employing the Superscript  Preamplification System (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
  The cDNA sequences encoding for the variable domains of  the H and L chains of the monoclonal antibody A8P3 were  PCR amplified using a mixture of 18 5 primer VKBACK  mix and a mixture of five 3 primer VKFOR for the VK  gene and 20 5 primer VHBACK mix and a mixture of five  3 primer VHFOR mix for the VH gene [48].
Each domain  was cloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,  CA, USA) and sequenced using an automated model 377  sequenator (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
  The amino acid sequences of the variable domains of L and  H chains of the antibody A8P3 are provided in Fig. S1.
  Binding assay for the interaction between  holoRBP and TTR variants  To study the in vitro interaction of holoRBP with TTR  variants, the highly fluorescent RBP-bound retinol provides  an intense signal which is suitable for fluorescence polarization measurements [40].
The intensities of the vertical (I ||)  and horizontal (I^) components of the fluorescence of  RBP-bound retinol (excitation at 330 nm and emission at  460 nm) were recorded at an angle of 90 to the vertically  polarized excitation beam.
A correction factor, G, equal to  I^ I|| (where the primes indicate excitation polarized in a  perpendicular direction) was used to correct for the unequal  transmission of differently polarized light.
Fluorescence  anisotropy (A) was determined according to the equation:  A = (I|| ) GI^)(I|| + 2GI^).
Human holoRBP (0.7  3.0 lm) in 0.05 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 0.15 m  NaCl, at 20 C, was titrated by adding aliquots of concentrated solutions of human TTR (wild-type or mutant  forms) to the RBP-containing cuvette and the increase in  fluorescence anisotropy of the RBP-bound retinol upon  complex formation was monitored.
The fraction of RBP  bound by TTR (a) was calculated for every point of the  titration curves using the equation: a = (A ) Ao)  (Amax ) Ao), where A represents the fluorescence anisotropy  value of RBP-bound retinol for a certain molar concentration of TTR, and Amax and Ao are the two limiting  anisotropy values (i.e. in the presence of an excess saturating TTR and in the absence of TTR, respectively).
Binding  data were analyzed as described [12].
Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out with a LS-50B spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
  Crystallization, data collection, structure  determination and refinement for the  TTRRBPFab complex and the V20S and  Y114 TTR variants  Crystallization and preliminary X-ray data for the macromolecular complex formed by human transthyretin, human  holoRBP and a murine anti-RBP Fab have been reported  Transthyretinretinol-binding protein interactions G. Zanotti et al.  5850 FEBS Journal 275 (2008) 58415854  2008 The Authors Journal compilation  2008 FEBSpreviously [49].
The structure has been solved by molecular  replacement, using the models of the single components of  the complex as templates (for RBP, PDB: 1RBP; for TTR,  PDB: 1F41; for Fab, a model was obtained with the server  EXPASY) [41].
The crystallographic refinement was carried  on using the software cns [50], imposing noncrystallographic symmetry restraints throughout all cycles.
Three  hundred and thirty-four water molecules were added in the  last cycles of the refinement.
The addition of these water  molecules caused 0.02 and 0.01 unit reductions, respectively, of R and Rfree factors.
A relatively high R factor of  0.239, with an Rfree of 0.312, for the final model of the  TTRRBPFab complex is justified by the quite small size  of the crystals and the large dimensions of the asymmetric  unit, which contains one molecule of the complex, accounting for a total of 10 polypeptide chains (one TTR tetramer,  two RBP and two Fab) and a molecular mass of approximately 200 kDa.
However, the stereochemical parameters  for the RBP and TTR components of the complex are quite  good for this resolution.
Moreover, the Rfree for the TTR  RBPFab complex (0.312) appears to be significantly better  than that (0.403) obtained for the crystals of the human  TTRBRP complex [36].
Crystals of the V20S TTR variant  were obtained at 295 K by the vapor diffusion method,  using 0.066 m CaCl2, 19% (w  v) poly(ethyelene glycol)-400  and 0.13 m sodium Hepes (pH 7.5) as precipitant reservoir  solution.
Crystals of the Y114H variant were grown at  pH 5.6 in 100 mm Na citrate buffer, using 2 m ammonium  sulfate as precipitant.
The crystals were frozen at 100 K  and the data collected at the X-ray diffraction beam-line  ID29 of the ESRF synchrotron (Grenoble, France).
  Because the crystals were isomorphous with the wild-type  protein, the molecular model of the latter (PDB: 1F41) was  subjected to a rigid-body refinement, followed by some  cycles of restrained least-squares with the software refmac  [51] or cns [50] and by visual inspection and manual  rebuilding with the program coot [52].
The R factor for  the final model is 0.209 (with an Rfree of 0.229) for the  V20S TTR variant and 0.218 (and an Rfree of 0.281) for  Y114H TTR variant.
Both models present a good stereochemistry, as assessed by the program procheck [53].
The  overall final statistics for the structures of the TTRRBP  Fab complex and the V20S and Y114H TTR variants are  provided in Tables 4 and 5.
Calculations of the areas  buried following complex formation were performed using  the software areaimol with a probe radius of 1.4 A [54].
