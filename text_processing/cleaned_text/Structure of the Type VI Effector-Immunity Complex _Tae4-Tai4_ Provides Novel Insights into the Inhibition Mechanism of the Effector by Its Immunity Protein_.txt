  Results: Tae4 displays a papain-like fold, and Tai4 dimer is responsible for inhibiting Tae4 activity.
  Conclusion: The inactivation of Tae4 is required by collaboration of both subunits of Tai4 dimer.
  Significance: Our results add new insights into the effector-immunity interaction module.
  The type VI secretion system (T6SS), a multisubunit needle-like apparatus, has recently been found to play a role in  interspecies interactions.
The Gram-negative bacteria harboring T6SS (donor) deliver the effectors into their neighboring cells (recipient) to kill them.
Meanwhile, the cognate  immunity proteins were employed to protect the donor cells  against the toxic effectors.
Tae4 (type VI amidase effector 4)  and Tai4 (type VI amidase immunity 4) are newly identified  T6SS effector-immunity pairs.
Here, we report the crystal  structures of Tae4 from Enterobacter cloacae and Tae4-Tai4  complexes from both E. cloacae and Salmonella typhimurium.
Tae4 acts as a DL-endopeptidase and displays a typical  N1pC/P60 domain.
Unlike Tsi1 (type VI secretion immunity  1), Tai4 is an all-helical protein and forms a dimer in solution.
  The small angle x-ray scattering study combined with the  analytical ultracentrifugation reveal that the Tae4-Tai4 complex is a compact heterotetramer that consists of a Tai4 dimer  and two Tae4 molecules in solution.
Structure-based mutational analysis of the Tae4-Tai4 interface shows that a helix  (3) of one subunit in dimeric Tai4 plays a major role in binding of Tae4, whereas a protruding loop (L4) in the other subunit is mainly responsible for inhibiting Tae4 activity.
The  inhibition process requires collaboration between the Tai4  dimer.
These results reveal a novel and unique inhibition  mechanism in effector-immunity pairs and suggest a new  strategy to develop antipathogen drugs.
  The type VI secretion system (T6SS),4 initially studied in the  context of pathogenic bacteria-host interactions, is a complex  and widely distributed needle-like protein export machine in  Gram-negative bacteria (1).
Recently, it has been shown that  the T6SS has roles in interspecies interactions by injecting  effector proteins into the periplasmic compartment of the  recipient cells (2, 3).
The T6SS from the opportunistic pathogen  Pseudomonas aeruginosa targets at least three effector proteins,  namely Tse1, Tse2, and Tse3, to recipient cells.
Tse1 has peptidoglycan (PG) amidase activity that hydrolyzes the peptide  bond between -D-Glu and meso-diaminopimelic acid  (mDAP), and Tse3 acts as a muramidase cleaving the -1,4  linkage between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine.
The target of Tse2 remains unknown (4, 5).
Specific  cognate immunity proteins, Tsi1 and Tsi3 from P. aeruginosa,  are secreted into the periplasmic space to protect the target cell.
  These proteins bind and neutralize the activities of Tse1 and  Tse3, respectively (3).
The effectors and its immunity proteins  define a new toxin-antitoxin module.
  In 2012, Russell et al. identified new PG peptidase effectors of  Gram-negative bacteria that fall into four highly divergent families (Tae1, Tae2, Tae3, and Tae4) on the basis of sequence  homology and different substrate specificities (6).
Effector and  its cognate immunity proteins are often characterized as operons, suggesting that the self-protection is a general feature in  Gram-negative bacteria possessing the T6SS.
Tse1 and Tsi1  were renamed to Tae1 (type VI amidase effector) and Tai1 (type  VI amidase immunity).
Tae2 and Tae3 are responsible for the  cleavage of a mDAP-D-Ala bond.
The opposing cognate immunity proteins, Tai2 and Tai3, inactivate the amidase activities of  Tae2 and Tae3.
Similar to Tae1, Tae4 can hydrolyze the D-Glu-  * This work was supported by National Basic Research Program of China  Grant 2012CB917203 and National Natural Science Foundation of China  Grants 10979005 and 31200552.

However, it targets the acceptor stem rather than  the donor stem.
  Our group and others have solved the crystal structures Tae1  and its complex with Tai1 from P. aeruginosa and revealed the  structural mechanisms for the inhibition of Tae1 by Tai1  (710). But so far the structure of Tae4 has not been reported.
  Both Tae4 and Tai4 bear very low sequence homology with  Tae1 and Tai1, and the effectors have different substrate specificities.
Therefore, the substrate recognition and catalysis by  Tae4 may be different from that of Tae1.
The mechanism of  how Tai4 specifically inactivates Tae4 remains unknown.
  Structural exploration of Tae4 and the Tae4-Tai4 complex will  aid the development of new antibacterial agents and our understanding of the role of T6SS in interspecies competition.
  In this paper, we have determined the crystal structure of  Tae4 from Enterobacter cloacae.
The Tae4-Tai4 structures  from E. cloacae and Salmonella typhimurium were also solved  by x-ray crystallography.
Tae4 displays several distinct features  different from its structural homologues.
A flexible loop may  contribute to substrate specificity based on structural and  mutagenesis analysis.
The Tae4-Tai4 complex forms a heterotetramer that is closely linked to the biological function.
A biochemical approach was used to reveal the species specificity of  the Tae4 effector recognized by Tai4, and the common nature  of the effector inhibited by an immunity protein through binding to a lid loop represents a characteristic toxin-antitoxin  interaction model.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Cloning, Expression, and PurificationThe genes encoding  full-length EcTae4 and truncated EcTai4 (residues 19117  without the N-terminal 18-residue signal peptide) were amplified from the E. cloacae genomic DNA.
The PCR products were  digested and then cloned into the pET28at-plus vector (11),  introducing an N-terminal His tag followed by a tobacco etch  virus cleavage site.
These expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia colistrain BL21 (DE3).
EcTae4 was also  ligated into the pET21b vector (Novagen) between the NheI  and XhoI sites.
The two recombinant plasmids (pET21b-EcTae4 and pET28at-plus-EcTai4) were co-transformed into  BL21 (DE3) cells for co-expression.
The genes encoding fulllength StTae4 and truncated StTai4 (without the N-terminal  24-residue signal peptide) were PCR-amplified from S. typhimurium LT2 genomic DNA and cloned using the same procedure as above.
  Recombinant proteins were purified as described previously  (10).
Briefly, the protein expression was induced by adding 0.5  mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside at 289 K. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2-ml Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with buffer B (25 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5% v/v glycerol) containing 250 mM  imidazole.
The proteins were further purified by ion-exchange  chromatography and subsequent gel-filtration chromatography.
All the mutants were generated by the overlap PCR  method.
  CrystallizationEcTae4 and the Tae4-Tai4 complex were  concentrated to 20 mg/ml using Millipore Amicon Ultra 10  KD.
Crystallization screens were performed with Hampton  Research and Qiagen kits using sitting-drop vapor-diffusion  method at 293 K. EcTae4 crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction  grew from 0.5 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate, pH 5.6, 1.0 M lithium sulfate monohydrate.
  Tae4-Tai4 from E. cloacae were crystallized using 0.2 M sodium  chloride, 0.1 M sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 25% (w/v)  PEG1000.
The SeMet S. typhimurium Tae4-Tai4 crystal was  obtained in the mixture solution of 0.2 M ammonium acetate,  0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, pH 5.6, and 30% v/v  (/) -2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol in 23 days.
  Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement  All of the data were collected on the beamline 3W1A at BSRF  (Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility) with a mounted MAR165 CCD detector.
Before data collection, the crystals were  soaked in the reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v)  glycerol for a few seconds and then flash-frozen in liquid  nitrogen.
  All the data were processed by HKL2000 (12).
The SeMet  crystal structure of the Tae4-Tai4 complex from S. typhimurium was determined by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method.
The selenium atoms were located by the program Shelxd (13) and then used to calculate the initial phases in  Shelxe.
The phases from Shelxe were improved in Resolve (14)  and then used in Buccaneer (15) for model building.
Coot (16)  and Phenix.refine (17) were used for manually building and  refinement, respectively.
The Tae4 and Tae4-Tai4 complex  structures from E. cloacae were determined by molecular  replacement using the program Phaser (18) with the SeMet one  as the searching model.
All of the structures were validated by  Molprobity (19).
  Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and Low Resolution  Model BuildingSAXS data were collected on the beamline  station 1W2A in BSRF using a MARCCD165 detector.
The  scattering was recorded in the range of the momentum transfer  0.023  s  0.22 1  , in which s  (4sin)/, 2 represents  the scattering angle, and the x-ray wavelength  is 1.54 . The  measurements were performed in a cuvette (100 l) with exposure time of 100 s to diminish the parasitic scattering.
  The PRIMUS program was used to process the scattering  curves (20).
The sample was measured at different protein concentrations (1, 3, and 5 mg/ml for S. typhimurium Tae4-Tai4  proteins; 2, 4, and 6 mg/ml for E. cloacae Tae4-Tai4 proteins) to  exclude concentration dependence.
The distance distribution  functions p (r) was computed with experimental data by the  program GNOM (21).
The theoretical curves were calculated  by the program CRYSOL (22).
  The program GASBOR was used to build the ab initio low  resolution shapes of the complex in solution (23).
The protein  structure is represented by an ensemble of dummy residues.
  Analytical UltracentrifugationThe sedimentation velocity  measurements were carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-I  analytical ultracentrifugation (Beckman-Coulter Instruments)  with a Ti rotor at 293 K. Both the Tae4-Tai4 proteins were  diluted to an A280 of 0.8.
The SEDFIT program was used to  analyze the sedimentation coefficient (24).
  Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) ExperimentsThe interactions between EcTae4 and EcTai4 were explored using a  BIAcore 3000 instrument at 298 K. EcTae4 (2 g/ml) was  Crystal and Solution Structures of Tae4-Tai4 Complex  FEBRUARY 22, 2013VOLUME 288NUMBER 8 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 5929   at Univ of New England (CAUL) on June 10, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from coupled to a CM5 sensor chip in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5,  using the amine coupling kit.
EcTai4, and its mutants were  injected at a flow rate of 40 l/min for 90 s, followed by washing  with running buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and  0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) for 10 min.
The CM5 surface was  regenerated with 100 mM phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 40  l/min for 50 s. The kinetic parameters were modeled with the  BIAevaluation 4.1 software.
  Ligand-Protein DockingL-Ala-D-Glu-mDAP was docked  into the EcTae4 structure by the AutoDock 4.2 program (25).
  Docking studies were carried out using a Lamarckian genetic  algorithm with 25,000 energy evaluations.
The grid maps contained 50  50  50 points with a grid points spacing of 0.375   in each dimension.
Cys-46 and His-128 were treated as flexible  residues in the process of modeling.
The model with the lowest  binding energy was selected for analysis.
  Cell Toxicity AssayTae4/Tai4 mutants from E. cloacae  were subcloned into the pET22b/pET26b vectors containing  signal peptide sequences.
A single colony harboring the  expressing plasmid was grown in LB medium at 310 K. After  overnight culture, the cells were serially diluted in 10-fold steps  and plated onto the LB agar supplemented with antibiotic and  isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside.
The plates were prepared  for pictures after an additional 20 h growth at 310 K.  Protein Pulldown AssayTobacco etch virus was used to  remove the His tag of the EcTae4 proteins.
His-tag EcTai4 and  its variant proteins were treated with nickel beads at 277 K for  10 min.
Subsequently, the prey proteins were loaded into the  beads.
After extensive washing with 20 mM imidazole, the proteins were eluted with 250 mM imidazole and analyzed by SDSPAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.
  RESULTS  Overall Structure of Tae4The crystal structure of Tae4  from E. cloacae (EcTae4) has been determined at a resolution of  2.0 . Residues 145148 could not be seen because of the poor  electron density (Fig. 1A).
Tae4 crystallizes in the space group  P3221 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Table 1).
  The overall structure of Tae4 demonstrates a common architecture of the NlpC/P60 domain (2628), arranged in an   topology.
In the present structure, Tae4  can be divided into two subdomains (N-terminal and C-terminal) connected by loop 7 (residues 9397).
The N-terminal  subdomain is composed of an antiparallel -sheet flanked by a  short -helix.
The C-terminal subdomain is formed by five  -helices and a -hairpin (Fig. 1, A and B).
According to previous studies, the substrate binding sites are located in a concave  between these two subdomains (6, 27) (see Fig. 3A).
The Dali  server was used to find the structural neighbors to Tae4 (29).
  There are two CHAP (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidase) family functional proteins with Z-scores  greater than 5, including endopeptidase YkfC from Bacillus  cereus (PDB ID code 3H41) (30) and bacteriolytic effector Tae1  (Tse1) from P. aeruginosa (PDB ID code 4F0V) (10).
Despite the  low sequence similarity, superpositions of Tae4 with the two  proteins give r.m.s.d. values of 2.720 and 3.068 , respectively,  suggesting that these structures share the same fold (31) (Fig. 2,  A and B).
  The Potential Active Sites in Tae4Tae4 hydrolyzes the  D-Glu-mDAP bond in the same manner as Tae1.
However,  unlike Tae1, Tae4 is specific for the non-cross-linked tetrapeptide substrate (6).
We have so far been unable to obtain the  crystal structure of Tae4 with its substrate.
Therefore, molecular docking was employed to investigate the potential binding  sites.
In the ligand binding model, mDAP forms a hydrogen  bond with Asn-19 and is stabilized further by interactions with  Asp-139 and Asp-140 at the S1 site (32).
The S1 pocket is  shaped by Asn-44, Ala-45 Cys-46, Arg-49, and His-128, where  the D-Glu is located (Fig. 3A).
In YkfC, Trp-228 is proposed to  occupy both S2 and S1 binding sites (30).
A similar geometry is  also found in Tae4, and the equivalent position is replaced by  Lys-43.
Sequence alignment of Tae4 with its homologues indicates that most of conserved residues are concentrated around  the active cleft (33) (Fig. 1B), especially the S1 and S1 sites.
  Among CHAP family members, the strictly conserved residues cysteine, histidine, and a variable polar residue define the  catalytic triad (34).
In the case of Tae4, Cys-46 resides in the  N-terminal subdomain, whereas His-128 and Asp-139 are  located within the C-terminal subdomain (Fig. 1B).
Residues  clustered around the triad make up a negatively charged patch  on the surface of Tae4, although the protein has a predominantly positively charged surface (Fig. 3A, above).
To test the  role of these residues in substrate recognition, we exploited  site-directed mutagenesis and cell growth assay.
We discovered  that mutants C46A and H128A corresponding to dyad disrupted the amidase activity (Fig. 3B).
The third catalytic residue, Cys-110 in Tae1, is not essential for the cleavage of the  D-Glu-mDAP bond (8, 9).
However, the Asp-139 of Tae4, which  is equivalent to the third active site, appears to affect enzyme  activity.
Therefore, the details of the catalytic mechanism of  Tae4 are different from Tae1.
  Unlike Tae1 and YkfC, a winding loop (loop 11), rather than  the -sheet, harbors the third catalytic residue in Tae4 (Fig. 2, A  and B).
This winding loop is linked via the Cys-137Cys-141  disulfide bond (Fig. 1A).
Note that Tae4 is located in the  periplasmic space providing an oxidizing environment favorable for the formation of the disulfide bridge.
As reported previously, the disulfide bond is observed in Tae1 and provides  structural stability (7, 10).
This disulfide bridge is also found in  the Tae4-Tai4 complex.
We tested the activity of C137A and  C141A mutant variants.
The results showed that the enzymatic  activity is significantly reduced in the absence of disulfide bond  (Fig. 3B).
It is likely that the disulfide bond plays a role in orienting Asp-139 and stabilizing the S1 binding site.
  Intriguingly, part of the winding loop is folded into a shorter  turn compared with YkfC and Tae1 in a vertical aspect (Fig. 2, A  and B).
Taking into consideration that this segment is a spatial  neighbor of the active site, we propose that this disordered loop  may be relevant to the substrate recognition.
  Oligomeric State of the Tae4-Tai4 ComplexThe crystal  structure of Tae4 in complex with Tai4 from E. cloacae  (EcTae4-Tai4) was solved at 2.1  resolution and belonged to  theC121 space group.
There are four molecules in an asymmetric unit.
However, the Tae4-Tai4 complex from S. typhimurium  (StTae4-Tai4) was crystallized in the P6i  22 space group and  Crystal and Solution Structures of Tae4-Tai4 Complex  5930 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 288NUMBER 8FEBRUARY 22, 2013   at Univ of New England (CAUL) on June 10, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from diffracted to 2.4  resolution (Table 1).
The asymmetric unit is  composed of two molecules.
  Both Tae4-Tai4 proteins migrated on size-exclusion chromatography with a molecular mass of 49 kDa compared with  its calculated heterodimer molecular mass of 31 kDa (Fig. 4A,  StTae4-Tai4 data not shown).
Analytical ultracentrifugation  was performed to evaluate the oligomeric state of the complex.
  The Ec- and St-complex proteins showed a sedimenting boundary at 60.3 and 61.7 kDa, which corresponds to the sedimentation coefficients of 4.12 and 4.19, respectively (Fig. 4B).
The  result is consistent with the SAXS data.
The data in Fig. 4C  demonstrate that the experimental SAXS curves are more in  agreement with the heterotetramer theoretical curves than the  heterodimer curves (data not shown).
The ab initio models  were carried out to characterize the Tae4-Tai4 complex  shape in solution.
The available heterotetramer Tae4-Tai4  structures fit well into their respective SAXS-derived low  resolution envelopes (Fig. 4C, right upper).
Thus, we can  conclude that the Tae4-Tai4 complex is a heterotetramer in  solution.

  Crystal and Solution Structures of Tae4-Tai4 Complex  FEBRUARY 22, 2013VOLUME 288NUMBER 8 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 5931   at Univ of New England (CAUL) on June 10, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from The StTae4-Tai4 heterotetramer is generated by crystal  packing with symmetry-related molecules (symmetry mate x,  x-y, -z1/6).
These two complexes from E. cloacae and S. typhimurium showed a high degree of sequence identity (44%).
  Superposition of these two structures results in an r.m.s.d.
value  of 3.256  (see Discussion), suggesting that they share a similar architecture.
Consequently, the EcTae4-Tai4 complex is  chosen for discussion henceforth, unless otherwise stated.
  Dimerization of Tai4Tai4 is composed of six -helices,  whereas Tai1 displays an all  fold (7, 9).
The Tai4 dimerization  occurs mainly through the interaction of 2, 3, and 5 of both  monomers (Fig. 5A).
The conserved residue Asp-54 is involved  in extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions with the main  chain atoms of Tyr-96, Gln-97, Ile-98, and Leu-99.
These are  side chain side chain hydrogen bonds in both monomers  between Gln-38 and Gln-38, Ser-48 and Asp-47 (Fig. 5B).
In  addition, there are indirect interactions of several residues such  as Asp-47 and Ser-50, Asp-54 and His-95, Asn-106 and Gln-31,  via well ordered water molecules by their side chains.
The  dimer interface is extensive with a buried surface area of 1446  2  , which is 22.7% of the total surface area per monomer (6346  2  ).
In addition, Tai4 behaves as a dimer on the gel filtration  column (Fig. 4A), suggesting that Tai4 is a dimer in solution.
  When mapping the sequence homology onto the Tai4 structure, the most invariant residues are concentrated at the dimer  interface, which means that the dimer interactions are conserved across the Tai4 family (Fig. 5C).
The Tai4 model was  submitted to the Dali server to search against the PDB for its  structural homologues (29).
The closest structural homologue  (the Z-score is 5.4) is Tel2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

However, significant differences between these two  proteins were observed, such as the oligomeric state, molecular  mass, and the arrangement of the helix-turn-helix repeats.
  Despite low sequence identities, the arrangement of Tai4 is  similar to Tsi2 (Fig. 5D).
We used a mutagenesis approach to  identify the residues important for the dimerization.
Like Tsi2,  the Tai4 mutant variants have no effects on the dimerization or  lead to protein precipitation (4, 5).
We postulate that the  dimerization is important for the physiological functions, such  as inhibition of Tae4.
  The Interaction between Tae4 and Tai4The homodimer of  Tai4 can be specified as subunit I (green), which interacts with  the N-terminal subdomain of Tae4; and subunit II (blue), which  interacts with the C-terminal subdomain of Tae4 (Fig. 6, A and  B).
The total buried surface area at the interface of the Tai4  dimer with one Tae4 monomer is 966 2  .
The interactions of  two helices (3 and 5) from Tae4 with 3 and 4 from the  Tai4 subunit I account for the majority of the interface (668  2  ).
The small interface (298 2  ) is created by loops 10 and  11 from Tae4 interacting with loop 4 from the neighboring  Tai4 molecule (subunit II).
Moreover, there are up to five  well ordered water molecules located at the interface which  further stabilize the complex.
  The helix 3 of Tae4 is oriented toward subunit I and interacts with Arg-40 and Glu-74 through hydrogen and salt bonds  (Figs. 1C and 6CIII).
To validate the interactions at the interface, we introduced point mutations and used SPR to identify  the residues required for stable interactions (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. 1).
Substitutions R40A and E74A disrupted  binding affinity compared with the wild-type Tai4 (WtTai4).
  The results are in agreement with extensive interactions  between the 3 of Tae4 and Tai4.
As shown in Fig. 2, A and B,  two insertions (2 and 3) protrude from the N-terminal subdomain compared with Tae1 and YkfC. Although these helices  in the apo-Tae4 structure have a high B-factor value, they are  well ordered in the holo form (Fig. 7).
Furthermore, alignment  of these regions results in a higher r.m.s.d. value.
These residues  involved in the 3 of Tae4 and Tai4 interface are nonconserved  (Figs. 1B and 5C).
Taken together, the insertions tend to correlate with the species specificity during the Tae4 inhibition by  Tai4.
  Notably, the residues from Leu-63 to Asn-67 located in 3  and the following loop of Tai4 subunit I form a number of  hydrogen bonds with Tae4.
The amino group in the main chain  of Lys-83 in the 5 from Tae4 directly interacts with hydroxy  groups of Glu-64Asn-67 of Tai4 subunit I (Fig. 6CII).
Similarly, the conserved residue Arg-81 of Tae4 forms hydrogen  bonds with the main chain atoms of Leu-63 and Leu-68 in Tai4.
  Additional interactions are found between the strictly conserved residues Val-82 and Glu-64.
Substitutions S66A, N67A,  and L68A exhibit affinity to Tae4 equal to that of the WtTai4  protein.
However, the E64A variant causes a 10-fold reduction in affinity, and the Kd value is affected significantly (140-  fold reduction) by the alanine substitution for leucine at residue  63.
This observation indicates that these two residues are  important for Tai4-Tae4 recognition.
Intriguingly, the equivalent helix of Tsi2 is a crucial segment responsible for binding  Tse2 (4).
Along with the sequence conservation of these residues in Tae4 and Tai4 (Figs. 1B and 5C), these observations  support the idea that the 3 of Tai4 is a major determinant of  the Tae4 interaction.
  A protruding loop (loop 4) in the Tai4 subunit II also contributes to the hydrogen-bonding network, thereby stabilizing  the heterotetramer.
The residues Leu-123 and Asp-124 in loop  10, and Ser-151 in the winding loop from Tae4 make direct  interactions with Gly-89, Thr-91, and Gly-90 of the protruding  loop, respectively (Fig. 6CI).
In addition, Gly-89 interacts indirectly with Gly-121 in loop 10 via a water molecule (W145).
  Because loops 10 and 11 are involved in the formation of the  Tae4 catalytic sites, the protruding loop of Tai4 may be closely  associated with inhibiting Tae4 enzyme activity.
  The Mechanism of Tai4 Inhibits Tae4The structure of  Tae4 in Tae4-Tai4 complex (holo-Tae4) is basically identical to  the apo-Tae4 structure (Fig. 8A).
Structural alignments of apoTae4 with holo-EcTae4 and holo-StTae4 structures give an  r.m.s.d. of 0.371 and 0.807 , respectively.
However, there are  clear differences in the C-terminal subdomain (Fig. 8B).
The  first divergent region is the winding loop, which can be characterized as two clips (Fig. 1C).
Clip I, which includes residues  from 134 to 144, adopts the same structure in the three forms of  Tae4.
Residues 145153 form clip II that folds over the catalytic  core.
The dominant feature of the winding loop in apo-Tae4 is  the second clip portion that is shifted by 1.7 and 6.2  compared with holo-EcTae4 and holo-StTae4, respectively (Fig.  8B).
As mentioned above, part of this clip could not be traced in  apo-Tae4 and holo-StTae4 structures because of the higher  B-factor (Fig. 9, A and B).
Furthermore, Asn-149 in the missing  loop is invariant among Tae4 sequences.
There is reason to  believe that the conformational flexibility of the loop is connected to enzyme activity.
  Structural alignment of the three Tae4 structures shows that  the most prominent difference between apo- and holo-structures is the lid loop (loop 10).
Evidently, the lid loop adopts  FIGURE 3.

In Tae1, Tyr-89 is hypothesized to regulate substrate  recognition (9, 10).
Asp-124, which is located in the lid loop of  Tae4, lies in a similar orientation to Tyr-89 of Tae1, and the  carboxyl group of Asp-124 is positioned at the entrance of the  substrate binding cleft.
However, the D124A variant has no  significant effect on cell viability (Fig. 3B).
  It is conceivable that the inhibition of Tae4 by Tai4 is not  through binding Asp-124 but through a conformational change  in the lid loop.
Compared with the apo-Tae4 structure, the  active pocket is covered by the closed lid loop in both holo  structures.
Conversely, a positively charged patch in the protruding loop of Tai4 extends from Lys-87 to Thr-91, and could  shield the negatively charged patch of the active sites of Tae4.
A  variant (8691) lacking 6 residues (Gln-86Thr-91) of Tai4  was created to investigate its influence on the inhibition of  Tae4.
In the assays examining cell viability, cells can be rescued  by the induced expression of Tai4.
As expected, the variant  8691 is not capable of inhibiting amidase activity (Fig. 8C).
  To further understand the nature of Tae4 inhibition by Tai4, we  FIGURE 4.

Our results  showed that the deletion mutant can still bind to Tae4 (Fig. 8D),  excluding the possibility that the heterotetramer disruption  impedes the inhibition of Tae4 by Tai4.
Further, the tip of the  protruding loop is located near the catalytic triad and can make  contact with the active site histidine via a water molecule (Fig. 6,  A and B).
In summary, the inhibition is achieved through insertion of the protruding loop into the pocket and induction of the  closed conformation of the lid loop.
As a result, the access to the  catalytic sites is blocked.
  DISCUSSION  The bacteria utilize T6SS and effectors to kill the rival cells.
  The effector Tae4 is present in the periplasmic space and catalyzes the hydrolysis of PG.
Tae4 adopts a canonical papain-like  / fold and belongs to the N1pC/P60 superfamily of cell wall  cysteine peptidases, which are associated with the cell wall  hydrolysis and recycling (36, 37).
These cell wall peptidases,  widely distributed in bacteria, are often characterized by the  presence of the auxiliary domain, which functions mainly as  a scaffold mediating protein localization (26, 30).
The D-glutamyl-L-diamino acid endopeptidase YkfC, for instance,  contains two additional SH3b domains (30).
However, a single domain is present in Tae1 and Tae4.
Gel filtration experiments also revealed that Tae4 behaves as a monomer in  solution (Fig. 4A).
The characteristic configuration endows  Tae1 and Tae4 with extensive and accessible substrate binding surface (Figs. 7, A and B, and 8B) (13).
In addition, the  effectors can switch one target to another quickly and efficiently due to the loss of the localization process.
As a result,  FIGURE 5.

  Although the Tae4 structure is broadly similar to Tae1 structure, Tae4 exhibits two unique features.
The first difference is a  winding loop, which is involved in substrate binding and  hydrolysis.
The cleavage of the PG is independent of the third  catalytic residue Cys-110, which is buried in the interior of  Tae1.
However, Asp-139, located in Tae4 winding loop, is  solvent-exposed and makes close contacts with His-128  (2.7 and 3.0 ).
Asp-139 can be available to stabilize the  oxyanion hole.
Consistent with these, we found that Asp-139  is an indispensable catalytic residue for the enzyme activity  (Fig. 3B).
Furthermore, the intact catalytic triad confers  higher activities on Tae4 (6, 8).
Two helix insertions are the  other characteristic profile.
Based on structural analysis, the  insertions are responsible for defining the species specificity  of Tai4 binding to Tae4.
In total, the structural variability in  Tae1 and Tae4 results from the evolution and renders divergence in substrate recognition.

  Crystal and Solution Structures of Tae4-Tai4 Complex  5936 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 288NUMBER 8FEBRUARY 22, 2013   at Univ of New England (CAUL) on June 10, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Tai1 is an all -sheet protein, whereas Tai4 adopts a superhelical conformation and shows remarkable similarity to the  immunity protein Tsi2 from P. aeruginosa (4, 5).
The Tae1-  Tai1 complex is a heterodimer, but the Tae4-Tai4 complex  forms a compact heterotetramer that comprises one Tai4  homodimer binding two Tae4 molecules.
The inhibitory mechanism for Tae1 by Tai1 includes a localization event where five  - loops (c-d, e-f, h-i, j-k, and l-m) of Tai1  interact with Tae1 (PDB ID code 3VPJ) (Fig. 9A).
Previous studies have shown that the insertion of h-i loop into the catalytic  cleft is critical for inhibition (7, 9).
The substrate binding sites  are occupied by the h-i loop, Ser-107 of which shows a  remarkable binding affinity to Tae1.
Apart from these, Ser-109  lactated in the h-i loop makes direct interaction with the  active site His-91 (Fig. 9B).
Although both Tae1 and Tae4 are  DL-endopeptidases, their immunity proteins work differently  from each other.
These - loops facilitate accurate positioning  of Tai1 and match well with the narrow and extended cleft of  Tae1.
However, the helices of one Tai4 subunit are involved in  the Tai4 orientation, and the deep V-shaped groove of Tae4 is  not fully occupied by the protruding loop of the other Tai4  subunit.
The lid loop of Tae4 serves as a molecular switch to  control the PG access to the catalytic pocket.
When the protruding loop of Tai4 gets stuck in Tae4, the lid loop is closed,  and amidase activity is suppressed.
Conversely, the lid loop  adopts an open conformation, and Tae4 can reactivate in the  absence of the protruding loop.
It is worthy to note that the  protruding loop of Tai4 participates in both the interaction  with the lid loop of Tae4 and the formation of the Tai4 dimer  (Figs. 5B and 6C).
This protruding loop further contributes to  the Tai4 dimer interface through the interaction between Gln97, Tyr-96, and Asp-54 of both subunits.
In other words, the  dimerization of Tai4 is required for the protruding loop orientation.
As mentioned above, the interaction between Tae4 and  Tai4 subunit I is primarily responsible for their interaction.
We  conclude that the inhibition requires both Tai4 monomers.
The  FIGURE 8.

It is also suggested that the  organisms carrying the Tae1-Tai1 pair compete with that harboring the Tae4-Tai4 pair in nature (6).
These hypotheses  should be tested in the following studies.
  Our studies reveal a novel mechanism of the inhibition of the  amidase effector by its cognate immunity protein.
To our  knowledge, this inhibition mode is first discovered in effectorimmunity pairs.
These findings will improve our understanding  of the T6SS role in interspecies competition and toxin-antitoxin interactions.
The significant toxicity of Tae4 and the close  relationship between Gram-negative bacteria and pathogenicity make it an attractive target for the antipathogen therapy.
We  can also develop some small molecule inhibitors or small peptides that bind to Tai4 and inhibit the binding of Tai4 to Tae4  competitively.
Without the protection of immunity proteins,  the bacteria would suffer toxic effects.
The chemical modification of the substrate may be another way for drug discovery.
