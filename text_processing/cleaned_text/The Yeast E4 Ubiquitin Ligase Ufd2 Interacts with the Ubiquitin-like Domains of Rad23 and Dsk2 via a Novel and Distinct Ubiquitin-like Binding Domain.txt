M110.112532  Petra Hanzelmann1, Julian Stingele1, Kay Hofmann  , Hermann Schindelin2, and Shahri Raasi3  From the   Rudolf Virchow Center for Experimental Biomedicine, University of Wurzburg, Josef-Schneider-Strasse 2,  97080 Wurzburg, the   Laboratory of Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Biology, University of Konstanz, 78457 Konstanz,  and the   Bioinformatics Group, Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Friedrich-Ebert-Strasse 68, 51429 Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany  Proteins containing ubiquitin-like (UBL) and ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains interact with various binding partners  and function as hubs during ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.
A common interaction of the budding yeast UBL-UBA  proteins Rad23 and Dsk2 with the E4 ubiquitin ligase Ufd2 has  been described in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation among other pathways.
The UBL domains of Rad23 and  Dsk2 play a prominent role in this process by interacting with  Ufd2 and different subunits of the 26 S proteasome.
Here, we  report crystal structures of Ufd2 in complex with the UBL  domains of Rad23 and Dsk2.
The N-terminal UBL-interacting  region of Ufd2 exhibits a unique sequence pattern, which is distinct from any known ubiquitin- or UBL-binding domain identified so far.
Residue-specific differences exist in the interactions of these UBL domains with Ufd2, which are coupled to  subtle differences in their binding affinities.
The molecular  details of their differential interactions point to a role for adaptive evolution in shaping these interfaces.
  The ubiquitin proteasome system regulates diverse cellular  processes including cell cycle progression, immune response,  neurodegenerative diseases, and protein quality control (1 4).
  Ubiquitin-like (UBL)4 domains and ubiquitin- or UBL-binding  domains (UBD) (5) are small and highly diversified domains  that occur as integral parts of larger proteins (69).
Integral  UBLs display a similar fold as ubiquitin (Ub) and like Ub are  described as protein-protein interaction modules without the  modifier function of Ub (5, 10).
So far more than 20 different  classes of UBDs have been reported with a wide range of Ub  binding specificities (11, 12).
The ubiquitin-associated (UBA)  domain was the first identified UBD, which exhibits the highest  representation of all UBDs in the eukaryotic genome (13) with  diverse Ub and Ub chain binding properties (14, 15).
Although  the source of this binding diversity in vivo remained elusive so  far, remarkable structural studies have recently unraveled the  unique poly-Ub binding mode of a few other UBDs (1620) and  contributed further to the understanding of how UBDs might  have acquired their respective ligand specificity.
  UBL-UBA proteins contain both a UBL domain and at least  one UBA domain.
Via these domains they interact simultaneously with ubiquitylated substrates and 26 S proteasome,  thereby delivering substrates to the proteasome for degradation  (21).
Interestingly, UBL-UBA proteins are also binding partners  of other proteins (2225).
For instance, the budding yeast UBLUBA proteins Rad23 and Dsk2 can interact with the E4 ligase  Ufd2 via their UBL domains (22, 26, 27).
A common involvement of Ufd2, Rad23, and Dsk2 has been described in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, ubiquitin fusion  degradation, and OLE-1 gene induction pathway (22, 2830),  where the UBL-Ufd2 interaction is indispensable.
The association of UBL-UBA proteins with Ub ligases, their reported substrate specificity (31, 32), and the inhibitory effect of UBL-UBA  proteins on Ub chain disassembly (33, 34) support the idea that  UBL-UBA proteins might function as important regulatory and  specificity factors in Ub-mediated cellular proteolysis (21).
  Therefore, understanding the binding behavior of the UBL  domains of UBL-UBA proteins with their various interacting  proteins will shed light on the regulatory role of these proteins.
  Despite the identification of a large number of UBDs, structural  details of integral UBL-binding domains are limited.
In some  cases, the intra- and intermolecular interactions between these  UBLs with known UBDs such as UBA or the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) have been demonstrated by solution NMR  (3538).
  Here, we are reporting crystal structures of budding yeast  Ufd2 in complex with the UBL domains of Rad23 and Dsk2 and  the molecular details of their interaction interfaces.
We identify  a novel sequence pattern in the N-terminal UBL-binding region  of budding yeast Ufd2, which is conserved in lower eukaryotes  and is distinct from any known UBD identified so far.

Mutational analyses of  the binding surface of the UBL domains and a closer inspection  of the thermodynamic contributions of those residues point to  adaptive evolution as a factor shaping these interfaces.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, protein expression, and  purification are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures.
  Crystallization of Ufd2Rad23-UBL and Ufd2Dsk2-UBL  For crystallization of the Ufd2Rad23-UBL and Ufd2Dsk2-UBL  complexes, Ufd2 was incubated with Rad23-UBL or Dsk2-UBL  at a molar ratio of 1:1.5 (77 M Ufd2 and 115.5 M UBL) for 1 h  at 4 C in the presence of 2 mM dithiothreitol.
Crystals were  grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops containing equal  volumes of protein in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and  2 mM dithiothreitol and a reservoir solution consisting of  1618% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3500 and 200 mM K3-citrate,  pH 8.3, equilibrated against the reservoir solution.
Crystals  were cryo-protected by soaking in mother liquor containing  1520% (v/v) glycerol.
They belong to space group P212121 with  approximate cell dimensions of a  65 , b  126 , and c   181  with one complex per asymmetric unit.
  Data Collection and Structure DeterminationCrystals were  flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen, and data collection was performed at 100 K. Data were collected at beamlines ID14 4  (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble,  France) and BL 14.1 (Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft fur Synchrotronstrahlung (BESSY), Berlin, Germany)  and processed using Mosflm and Scala (39, 40).
Data collection  statistics are summarized in supplemental Table S1.
For subsequent calculations, the CCP4 suite was utilized (41) with exceptions as indicated.
The Ufd2 structure was solved by molecular  replacement using Phaser (42) with Protein Data Bank (PDB)  entry 2QIZ as search model. Because Phaser could not find a  solution for the UBL domain with different search models, this  domain was fitted manually into the electron density using  human ubiquilin 3 (PDB entry 1YQB) for the Ufd2Rad23-UBL  complex and the Dsk2-UBL domain (PDB entry 2BWF) for the  Ufd2Dsk2-UBL complex as a model.
The structures were  refined with Phenix (43) and REFMAC5 incorporating translation, libration, screw-rotation (TLS) refinement in all cycles  (44, 45).
Solvent molecules were automatically added with Coot  (46).
The figures were produced with PyMOL (65).
  In Vitro Binding AssaysFor pulldown assays, GST-tagged  Ufd2 and variants were immobilized on glutathione (GSH)  beads.
In all experiments, 20 l of GSH beads were incubated  with 0.95 M purified Ufd2 in 400 l of phosphate-buffered  saline buffer with 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.1% (v/v) Triton  X-100 at 4 C for 1 h.WT-Ufd2 and GST alone were included as  controls.
After centrifugation (1250  g, 30 s), beads were  washed five times with 400 l of binding buffer.
Purified UBL  proteins (0.95 M) in a total volume of 400 l of binding buffer  were added to immobilized Ufd2 and treated in the same way as  in the first step.
Immobilized proteins were analyzed by 17%  (v/v) SDS-PAGE or by immunoblotting with an anti-His  antibody.
  Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)Proteins were  extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline buffer  (pH 7.4, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol) followed by degassing.
In all  experiments, 75150 M Rad23- and Dsk2-UBL proteins were  titrated as the ligand into the sample cell containing 510 M  Ufd2.
A volume of 10 l of ligand was added at a time with a  total number of 30 injections, resulting in a final molar ratio of  ligand-to-protein varying between 3:1 and 4:1.
All experiments  were performed using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal, GE  Healthcare) at 25 C.
Buffer-to-buffer, buffer-to-Ufd2, as well  as Rad23-UBL/Dsk2-UBL-to-buffer titrations were performed  as described above.
Corrected data were analyzed with a singlesite binding model using software supplied by the ITC manufacturer and non-linear least squares fitting to calculate the  dissociation constant (Kd).
  Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) MeasurementsSPR  binding assays were performed alternatively on BIAcore X or  BIAcore T100 instruments (GE Healthcare) at 25 C in 10 mM  HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 50 M EDTA, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20.
100 response units  of His-tagged Rad23- or Dsk2-UBL were captured on a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) sensor chip.
GST-tagged Ufd2  for comparative binding assays and untagged Ufd2 for affinity analysis were applied to the UBL surfaces in random  duplicates at a flow rate of 50 l/min.
After each cycle, the  surface was regenerated using 350 mM EDTA in running  buffer to remove bound Ni2 and captured proteins.
The  BIAcore T100 evaluation software was used to calculate the  steady state affinity constants.
Data were plotted using  GraphPad Prism.
For comparative assays, the relative binding responses of the mutants to WT proteins were determined by obtaining the maximum response for each interaction at the end of each injection.
  RESULTS  Ufd2 Binds the UBL Domains of Rad23 and Dsk2 with High  AffinityAlthough Rad23 and Dsk2 interact with Ufd2 via  their UBL domains (22, 26), yeast two hybrid assays could only  identify the isolated N-terminal fragment (residues 1380) of  Ufd2 as its UBL-interacting region (26).
Additional details  regarding the Ufd2-UBL interactions have not been unraveled  so far.
To further characterize the interactions of Ufd2 with the  UBLs of Rad23 and Dsk2, we performed GST pulldown assays  with GST-tagged full-length Ufd2 and C-terminally His-tagged  UBLs (Fig. 1A).
Both UBLs were readily captured using immobilized GST-Ufd2.
In contrast, the UBL domain of Ddi1, a third  UBL-UBA protein, does not interact with Ufd2 (Fig. 1A) (22).
  The differential binding of the Rad23- and Dsk2-UBLs to the  proteasomal subunits Rpn1 and Rpn10 has been described (25,  47, 48).
Hence, we used SPR interaction analysis to search for  quantitative differences in their interactions.
Steady state affinity analysis of Ufd2 on both Rad23-UBL (Fig. 1B, left panel, and  1C) and Dsk2-UBL surfaces (Fig. 1B, right panel, and 1C) provided a Kd of 55  3 nM for the interaction of Rad23-UBL and a  lower affinity for Dsk2-UBL with a Kd of 418  56 nM.  UBL-binding Domain of Ufd2  JUNE 25, 2010VOLUME 285NUMBER 26 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 20391   at York University - OCUL on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from The binding of the UBLs of Rad23 and Dsk2 to Ufd2 was also  analyzed by ITC to allow for a complete thermodynamic characterization (Fig. 1D).
These studies resulted in a Kd of 70  6  nM for the interaction of Rad23-UBL with Ufd2 and for the  binding of Dsk2-UBL to Ufd2 in a 23-fold higher Kd of 175   19 nM. Although there is an excellent agreement between SPR  and ITC for the Rad23-Ufd2 interaction, the two methods show  an 2-fold difference for the Dsk2-Ufd2 interaction.
More  importantly, the enthalpic and entropic components to the free  energy are highly different between the two UBLs.
The interaction of Rad23-UBL and Ufd2 is more exothermic (H  17.3  kcal/mol) when compared with Dsk2-UBL (H  10.1 kcal/  mol).
However, this is offset by a substantial decrease in entropy  for Rad23-UBL (TS  7.4 kcal/mol), whereas the entropic  contribution is minimal for the Dsk2-UBL interaction  (TS  0.8 kcal/mol).
  Crystal Structures of Ufd2 in Complex with Rad23- and  Dsk2-UBLWe solved the structures of Ufd2 in complex with  Rad23-UBL carrying either an N-terminal or a C-terminal His  tag, which showed no significant structural differences.
Due to  better data quality, the structure of Ufd2 with a C-terminal  His-tagged UBL is presented here.
The Ufd2Rad23-UBL complex was refined at 2.4  resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.3% and a free R-factor of 25.7% (Table 1).
As described  previously (49), Ufd2 is composed of an N-terminal variable  domain, a core domain, and a C-terminal U-box domain with a  fold similar to that of RING (really interesting new gene)  domains, which are present in certain Ub ligases (Fig. 2A).
  Despite some conformational variability of the U-box domain,  our Ufd2 structure in the complex is quite similar (1.5  root  mean square (r.m.s.) deviation for 954 C atoms) to the published Ufd2 structure (49).
  The N-terminal variable region of Ufd2 that binds to the UBL  domain consists of eight -helices.
Helices 1 to 4 are  arranged in a four-helix bundle, whereas helices 5 and 6  interact with 3 and 4 through hydrophobic contacts that are  partly mediated by their connecting loops (Fig. 2B).
The structure of Rad23-UBL is comprised of a five-stranded -sheet, one  -helix, and one 310-helix (Fig. 2B).
It displays a high degree of  similarity with Ub (PDB entry 1UBQ, 1.1  r.m.s.
deviation for  72 C atoms, z-score 14, 25% sequence identity) and the UBL  domain of hHR23A (PDB entry 1P98, 1.6  r.m.s. deviation for  FIGURE 1.

  UBL-binding Domain of Ufd2  20392 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285NUMBER 26JUNE 25, 2010   at York University - OCUL on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from 72 C atoms, z-score 11.3, 26% sequence identity), one of the  two human homologs of budding yeast Rad23.
  Subsequently, we solved the structure of Ufd2 with Dsk2-  UBL by molecular replacement.
The UBL domain in the  Ufd2Dsk2-UBL complex exhibits increased flexibility; in particular, with a C-terminally tagged UBL domain, the first 30  amino acids of this domain were largely disordered (data not  shown).
With an N-terminally tagged protein, the Ufd2Dsk2-  UBL structure was refined at 2.4  resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 21.0% and a free R-factor of 27.0% (Table 1).
  Both Rad23-UBL and Dsk2-UBL structures can be superimposed with an r.m.s.
deviation of 1.1  for 71 aligned residues  (z-score 13.6, 30% sequence identity).
  Analysis of the Ufd2Rad23-UBL InterfaceThe Ufd2UBL  interface in the structure of the complex buries a total molecular surface of about 1260 2  , which is comprised to 590 2 of  the molecular surface of Ufd2 (1.3% of the total surface area)  and 670 2 from UBL (14.6% of the total surface area).
This  interface is composed of almost equal parts of non-polar residues (38%), polar residues (33%), and charged residues (29%);  however, there are only one salt bridge (UBL-Lys-10 NUfd2-  Glu-49 O1 with a distance of 2.6 ) and two direct hydrogen  bonds (UBL-Ser-47 OUfd2-Arg-92 N2, UBL-Gln-52 N2  Ufd2-Glu-141 O at distances of 2.3 and 3.2 , respectively)  present (Fig. 3A).
  Three UBL segments are contacting Ufd2 (Fig. 3A).
Segment  I is located in the loop connecting -strands one and two, segment II involves -strands three and four, and segment III is  located in -strand five.
Ufd2 residues from helix 2 and 4 as  well as the loop connecting 4 with 5 contribute to the  Ufd2UBL interface.
These residues contact the hydrophobic  surface of the UBL -sheet in the region of -strands 3, 4, and 5.
  Participating residues from Ufd2 include Leu-44, Tyr-97, Val100, and Trp-107, which are located in the hydrophobic UBL  pocket formed by residues Phe-9, Ile-45, Val-50, Val-69, and  Met-71 of Rad23 (Fig. 3, A and B).
  For comparison, the principal recognition determinants in  Ub are: 1) the hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of  Leu-8 (Phe-9 in Rad23), Ile-44 (Ile-45 in Rad23), His-68 (Val-69  in Rad23), and Val-70 (Met-71 in Rad23) and 2) the main chain  amide group of Gly-47 (Gly-48 in Rad23), which is involved in  hydrogen bonding (50).
Although the hydrophobic patch of  Rad23-UBL is also crucial for its interaction with Ufd2, the  main chain of Gly-48 does not form a hydrogen bond.
Instead,  the -turn (Ser47Gly48) connecting -strands 3 and 4 is stabilized by the aforementioned strong hydrogen bond between  Ufd2-Arg-92 and UBL-Ser-47, whereas Ufd2-Gly-96 and Ufd2-  Tyr-97 contact UBL-Gly-48 (Fig. 3A).
The aromatic ring of  Ufd2-Tyr-97 is involved in a stacking interaction with the peptide bond between UBL residues 47 and 48 in this -turn.
  Probing the Ufd2Rad23-UBL InterfaceThe importance of  interface residues was analyzed by mutagenesis experiments.
  Eleven residues from Ufd2 and nine from Rad23-UBL were  each replaced with Ala. With the exception of the Rad23-UBLG48A variant that showed a reduced expression, all Ufd2 and  Rad23-UBL variants behaved like the WT protein during and  after purification, indicating that they were correctly folded  (data not shown).
Initially, the contribution of these residues  was studied by GST pulldown and comparative SPR binding  assays (Table 2,supplemental Figs. S1 and S2A).
In SPR studies,  the relative binding responses of mutants to WT proteins were  determined and compared.
The majority of Rad23-UBL single  mutants revealed reduced binding to Ufd2 with Rad23-UBLI45A displaying the most prominent binding defect.
The contribution of the remaining residues to the interaction is augmented in double mutants (supplemental Fig. S1C).
Analysis of  the Ufd2 variants by SPR showed a largely reduced binding of  the residues located in the hydrophobic region of the UBLbinding pocket (Leu-44, Tyr-97, Val-100, and Phe-107) and  Asp-40 (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S2A).
  ITC studies confirmed these results and allowed for a  quantitative analysis (Table 2, supplemental Fig. S3 and  supplemental Table S2).
The most significant effect for Ufd2  was observed for all residues located in the hydrophobic UBL  pocket.
Mutation of Val-100 and Phe-107 to Ala completely  abolished binding, the Y97A variant strongly reduced binding  (1900-fold), and the I104A and L44A variants showed significantly decreased affinities (20- and 120-fold, respectively).
  Although not directly involved in complex formation (Fig. 3A),  the Ufd2-D40A variant showed a 110-fold reduced affinity  (Table 2), which probably is the result of the missing intramolecular hydrogen bond between Ufd2-Asp-40 and Ufd2-Tyr-97  (O2OH 2.5 ).
This hydrogen bond seems to be crucial for  proper positioning of the aromatic side chain of Tyr-97 in the  interface region and might be important to align helices 2 and  4 for interaction with the Rad23-UBL.

UBL-binding Domain of Ufd2  JUNE 25, 2010VOLUME 285NUMBER 26 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 20393   at York University - OCUL on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from In Rad23-UBL, Ile-45 was shown to be integral for binding to  Ufd2 by the detrimental effect (130-fold decrease) after  exchange to Ala (Table 2).
Mutation of Phe-9, Val-50, and Val69, residues adjacent to Ile-45 in the hydrophobic patch, also  decreased the affinity of Rad23-UBL 57-fold.
Ser-47, which is  in hydrogen-bonding distance to Ufd2-Arg-92 and next to  UBL-Gly-48, showed a 9-fold reduced affinity.
In Ub and in the  human Rad23 homolog hHR23A, Ser-47 is replaced by Ala.  Charged residues found in the interface (Ufd2, Glu-26, Glu-49,  and Arg-92; UBL, Lys-10) do not contribute significantly to the  interaction.
In summary, our data indicate that the most prominent contact between Ufd2 and Rad23-UBL is the strong  hydrophobic interaction between UBL-Ile-45 and Ufd2-Val100 as well as Ufd2-Phe-107, which defines the core of the UBLinteracting region of Ufd2.
  Molecular Discrimination between Rad23 and Dsk2Despite a similar fold, the UBL domains of Rad23 and Dsk2 display  only 30% sequence identity, which could give rise to differences  in their interactions.
A superposition of the bound Rad23-UBL  and Dsk2-UBL in the two complex structures showed significant changes (Fig. 3C).
Of the three UBL segments involved in  the Ufd2 interaction (Fig. 3A), segment II including Ile-45  (Ile-44 in Ub) is highly conserved, and there are no conformational changes in both UBL structures, whereas segments I and  III are not conserved and display structural changes (Fig. 3C).
  The loop, connecting -strands one and two, adopts different  conformations, and -strand five shows a displacement that  might affect binding (Fig. 3C).
  Segment I includes Phe-9 in Rad23-UBL, corresponding to  Leu-8 in Ub, where this residue is also involved in Ub recognition by UBDs (50, 51).
Phe-9 is replaced by Gly-10 in Dsk2-UBL,  and there is no corresponding hydrophobic interacting residue  (supplemental Fig. S4A).
Dsk2 residues Gly-10 and Gln-11  adopt different conformations when compared with Leu-8/  Thr-9 of Ub and Phe-9/Lys-10 of Rad23-UBL.
In the  Ufd2Dsk2-UBL structure, the Ufd2Rad23-UBL salt bridge  (Lys-10/Glu-49) is missing due to the Lys-10 to Gln-11  exchange, with the latter side chain no longer being located in  the protein interface (supplemental Fig. S4A).
The missing  interaction from segment I in Dsk2 might be compensated by  the displacement of -strand five toward Ufd2 and a replacement of Val-69 to His-69 found in segment III resulting in a  more pronounced interaction in this region when compared  with Rad23-UBL (supplemental Fig. S4A).
The presence of the  salt bridge seems to be the reason for the more exothermic  character of the Ufd2Rad23-UBL interaction, a view that is also  supported by the corresponding Ufd2-E49A and Rad23-K10A  variants, which both display binding enthalpies similar to the  FIGURE 3.

  UBL-binding Domain of Ufd2  20394 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285NUMBER 26JUNE 25, 2010   at York University - OCUL on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Ufd2Dsk2-UBL complex (supplemental Table S2).
At the same  time, the absence of the salt bridge in both mutants is accompanied by a more favorable entropic contribution, which is on a  level similar to the Ufd2Dsk2-UBL complex.
  To identify residues important for the subtle molecular discrimination between the UBL domains of Rad23 and Dsk2, the  interaction of Dsk2-UBL with Ufd2 mutants was analyzed by  GST pulldown assays (data not shown), SPR, and ITC (Table 2,  supplemental Figs. S2B and S3C).
Quantitative ITC analysis  showed reduced binding of Dsk2 to Ufd2 mutants Y97A (470-  fold), V100A (22-fold), I104A (6-fold), and F107A (20-fold)  (Table 2).
However, binding of the V100A and F107A variants is  not completely abolished, and when compared with Rad23-  UBL, the binding affinities are less affected by a factor of about  37 in most of the mutants analyzed.
In addition, the L44A  mutant, which has a 120-fold reduced affinity with Rad23-UBL,  is only three times reduced in the case of Dsk2-UBL.
  In general agreement with the ITC affinity data, the comparative SPR binding assay revealed significant differences in the  association of Ufd2 variants Y97A, V100A, I104A, and F107A  with Rad23- and Dsk2-UBL surfaces (supplemental Fig. S4B).
  The observed SPR decrease for the binding of the T48A and  E49A variants of Ufd2 to Dsk2-UBL seems to be compensated  by slower dissociations, thus explaining why these mutants  show no significant defect in the ITC analysis.
  To further analyze the contribution of segments I and III to  complex formation, a G10F/Q11K/S67Q/H69V/V71M quintuple Dsk2-UBL mutant was generated, where key residues in  binding segments I and III were replaced with the corresponding residues from Rad23-UBL.
Comparative binding as well as  steady state affinity analysis by SPR revealed only a small  increase (Kd  348 nM) in binding affinity for Ufd2 when compared with WT-Dsk2-UBL (Kd  418 nM) (data not shown and  Fig. 1C).
In addition, neither a crystal structure of the quintuple  Ufd2Dsk2-UBL complex (data not shown) nor the KD of 240  nM deduced by ITC revealed significant differences from  WT-Dsk2-UBL (Kd  175 nM).
The ITC analysis did, however,  reveal that the binding is now driven by an increase in entropy  (TS  6.5 kcal/mol versus 0.8 and 7.4 kcal/mol for  WT-Dsk2-UBL and -Rad23-UBL, respectively), whereas the  binding enthalpy is reduced to only 2.5 kcal/mol when compared with 10.1 and 17.3 kcal/mol (supplemental Table S2).
  Interestingly, SPR and ITC analysis of a G10F/Q11K/I50V/  K52Q/S67Q/H69V/V71M septuple Dsk2-UBL mutant, which  has the additional I50V and K52Q substitutions in segment II,  showed an even lower affinity (SPR,Kd 648 nM; ITC,Kd 875  nM) to Ufd2 when compared with WT-Dsk2-UBL (Fig. 1C).
  The N Terminus of Ufd2 Represents a Unique and Conserved  UBL-binding DomainA multiple sequence alignment of Ufd2  from different yeast species displays a distinct pattern of conserved residues involved in UBL binding (Fig. 4A).
Among the  available yeast genomes, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe  sequence is most similar to those from higher eukaryotes; thus  we isolated cDNA fragments for the coding region of the UBL  domains of Rad23 and Dsk2 and full-length Ufd2 from this  organism and examined their interactions by GST pulldown  assays (Fig. 4B) as well as SPR (data not shown).
We could show  that SpUfd2 interacts strongly with the UBL domains of  SpRad23 and SpDsk2 as well as with the UBL domains of  ScRad23 and ScDsk2 and vice versa.
This cross species interaction, despite the diversified UBL and Ufd2 amino acid  sequences, indicates that the identified sequence pattern represents a real UBL-interacting domain.
A surface representation  of this motif is shown in Fig. 4C.
  The N terminus of budding yeast Ufd2 displays only limited  sequence homology with the human Ufd2s, E4A and E4B  (supplemental Fig. S5) and other Ufd2s from higher eukaryotes.
  In agreement with this finding, there are no reports that  hHR23A/B interacts with either of the human homologs of  Ufd2.
Interestingly, our SPR studies showed that the UBL  domain of hHR23A interacts with ScUfd2, albeit with lower  affinity (data not shown).
Apparently, the high affinity interaction of the UBL domains of Rad23 and Dsk2 has been lost during the evolution of this domain.
The absence of conservation  of the Ufd2-UBL interface could potentially be used for therapeutic interventions against pathogenic yeasts such as Candida  albicans by designing low molecular weight compounds that  disrupt this interface.
However, further functional studies in  pathogenic yeasts are required to examine the suitability of this  surface as a drug target.

  UBL-binding Domain of Ufd2  JUNE 25, 2010VOLUME 285NUMBER 26 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 20395   at York University - OCUL on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from DISCUSSION  Families and superfamilies of protein domains or folds have  evolved through a process of homologous recombination and  gene duplication (52) followed by sequence divergence.
Members of different classes of UBDs such as UBA or UBL domains  result from these processes.
For instance, the UBL domains of  Rad23 and Dsk2 display only 30% sequence identity but adopt  the same fold and utilize the same binding surface to recognize  a common UBL-binding domain of Ufd2 to form complexes  that display similarly high affinity.
Nevertheless, not all interacting residues are conserved; in particular, there is sequence  diversity in binding segments I and III of UBLs.
Our attempts to  interconvert the UBL domains by altering non-conserved interfacial residues were not successful, thus suggesting that additional elements exist and play a role in the respective Ufd2-UBL  interaction.
Interestingly, these results resemble earlier studies  onWW domains (53, 54), where a statistical analysis of multiple  sequence alignments was utilized to identify co-evolving residues.
The authors demonstrated that not only interfacial residues but also buried residues distal to the interface co-evolved  with interfacial residues and contribute significantly to the  interactions.
They concluded that certain sequence patterns in  interacting domains are due to adaptive evolution.
In agreement with these findings, our data prove that substitution of  key interfacial residues of Dsk2-UBL has no significant effect on  its overall binding affinity to Ufd2.
In case of the septuple  mutant, we even observed a decrease in binding affinity, which  could be due to the imposed disorder into the evolutionary  inter-residue relations within the UBL fold.
This is supported  by the fact that when compared with Dsk2-UBL and in particular Rad23-UBL, the binding of the quintuple Dsk2-UBL  mutant is driven strongly by entropy.
These findings indicate  that binding interfaces can be modulated by changes in residues  that affect either the binding enthalpy or the entropy, thus providing additional freedom to maintain an interaction during the  course of evolution, an effect that has been described previously  as entropy/enthalpy compensation (55, 56).
  Our studies suggest that UBL domains have co-evolved with  Ufd2 to reach optimal binding affinities by altering specific residue-to-residue interactions (co-evolution at the residue level)  (57), while at the same time, all functional aspects of Rad23 or  Dsk2 are preserved.
Therefore, the primary sequence degenerFIGURE 4.

This further suggests that differential binding  properties observed for the interactions of Ufd2 with UBLs (this  study) or for the interactions of UBAs with Ub and Ub chains  (14) can arise not necessarily due to their interaction with different ligands but can also result from the adaptive co-evolution  of these domains with the same interacting partners.
Seemingly, these interfacial domains have evolved to hold proteinprotein interactions in a suitable form within multicomponent  complexes until they are challenged by downstream events.
  Numerous structures of Ub receptors in complex with their  respective Ub/UBL-binding domains have been reported.
The  so far characterized Ub receptors of the 26 S proteasome in  budding yeast encompass the two proteasomal subunits Rpn10  (S5a in humans) and Rpn13 and the three UBL-UBA proteins  Rad23, Dsk2, and Ddi1, which associate with the proteasome  and function as shuttle factors (21).
Experimental evidence for  the existence of additional candidates exist (21, 58).
Rad23 and  Dsk2 interact with the proteasomal subunit Rpn1 via their UBL  domains (21, 47).
Aside from their known interactions with Ub,  Rpn13 and Rpn10/S5a alternatively interact with UBL-UBA  proteins (21, 35, 37, 38, 48, 51, 59).
For instance, the preferential  association of Rpn1 with Rad23 and Rpn10 with Dsk2 has been  reported (25, 38, 47, 48).
Based on the binding of hpLIC2 (Dsk2  homolog) with Rpn13, an interaction of Dsk2 with Rpn13 has been  proposed (51, 59).
  Although the aforementioned  examples engage essentially the  same surface of Ub/UBL, they  diverge in both structure and patterns of Ub/UBL recognition (Fig.  5).
For instance, hRpn10/S5a recognizes the UBL domain of hHR23A,  one of the two human homologs of  Rad23, via a Ub-interacting motif,  which consists of a single -helix  (35, 37).
Rpn13 binds Ub via a pleckstrin homology domain, which is a  seven-stranded -sandwich capped  by an -helix (51).
The Ub-binding  surface of Rpn13 is formed by  three loops that bridge -strands.
  Another Ub-binding element is the  UBA domain found for example in  Dsk2 (60).
The UBA domain is composed of a three-helix bundle.
With  the exception of Rpn13, which  exclusively binds via loops, it seems  that the majority of Ub/UBL-binding domains fold into -helical  structures including the known  UBDs, UIM, and UBA, and the  UBL-binding domain of Ufd2 identified in this study.
Despite the predominant interaction involving  -helices as Ub/UBL-binding elements, the three-dimensional  structure of the UBL-binding domain of Ufd2 differs from other  known examples, hence providing the first structural description for how Ufd2 acts as a UBL receptor while at the same time  further enhancing the diversity of UBDs in general.
