F., & Vallee, B. L. (1987) Proc.

Each of the six arginines within or near angiogenins catalytic or   cell-binding sites-Le., those at positions 5,31,32,33,66, and 70-was therefore mutated to alanine.
Two   of these residues, Arg-5 and Arg-33, indeed play a role, albeit noncrucial, in enzymatic activity, although   neither one is implicated in the abolition of activity by arginine reagents.
R5A-angiogenin, while nearly   fully active toward dinucleotides, is one-fourth as active as angiogenin toward tRNA, suggesting that Arg-5   may participate in the binding of peripheral components of the substrate.
In contrast, the activity of   R33A-angiogenin toward both polynucleotide and dinucleotide substrates is reduced similarly, reflecting   a decrease in kcat.
These results, together with its position in the calculated three-dimensional structure   of angiogenin, imply an indirect role for Arg-33 in catalysis.
Three arginines are important for   angiogenesis: mutation of Arg-5, Arg-3 3, or Arg-66 dramatically reduces the angiogenic potency of angiogenin   on the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane.
Arg-66 lies within a segment previously proposed to be   part of a cell-surface receptor binding site.
Arg-5 and Arg-33 are outside of this site as defined at present,   and the decreased angiogenicity of R5A- and R33A-angiogenin may be a consequence of their reduced   ribonucleolytic activities.
Arginines are also important for the interaction of angiogenin with human placental   angiogenin/ribonuclease inhibitor, since mutation of Arg-5 and Arg-32 increases Ki by 50-fold and 4-fold,   respectively, largely reflecting an increased rate of dissociation of the complex.
  Human angiogenin induces neovascularization in the   chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and the   rabbit cornea and meniscus (Fett et al., 1985; King & Vallee,   1991).
Its sequence homology to the pancreatic RNase   superfamily (Strydom et al., 1985; Kurachi et al., 1985) led   to the recognition of its unusual ribonucleolytic activity   (Shapiro et al., 1986b) and suggested an approach to the   study of its structure-function relationships based on the   methods employed previously with bovine RNase A [see   Richards and Wyckoff (1971) and Blackburn and Moore   (1982)l.
Thus, the chemical modifications which had demonstrated His- 12, His-1 19, and Lys-41 of RNase to be critical   for enzymatic activity were applied to angiogenin (Shapiro et   al., 1986b, 1987).
Bromoacetateat pH 5.5 was found to react   specifically with His-13 and His-1 14 (Shapiro et al., 1988b),   residues analogous to the two active-site histidines in RNase   A. Indeed, the simultaneous decrease in both ribonucleolytic   and angiogenic activities accompanying this modification was   the first evidence that both of these depend minimally on the   integrity of the catalytic apparatus known for RNases.
This   has been confirmed by several subsequent investigations   (Shapiro & Vallee, 1987, 1989; Shapiro et al., 1989).
  Chemical modification of lysines also abolishes the enzymatic   activity of angiogenin (Shapiro et al., 1987), and in this case,   the crucial residue was identified by site-directed mutagenesis   as Lys-40, corresponding to Lys-41 of RNase A (Shapiro et   al., 1989).
  Chemical modification also implicated Arg-39 and Arg-85   in the catalytic activity of RNase A (Takahashi, 1968).
  However, in contrast with the active-site histidines and lysine,   neither one of these is present in angiogenin.
Quite the same,   chemical modifications with arginine reagents pointed to 1 or   more of the 13 arginines in human angiogenin as essential for   ribonucleolytic activity (Shapiro et al., 1987), although lack   of reagent specificity precluded identification of any particular   critical residue(s).
Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis has   again been employed for this purpose.
  The selection of residues for mutation was based on the   three-dimensional structure of angiogenin calculated from   the X-ray coordinates of RNase A (Palmer et al., 1986).

All of these are also of interest   in relation to other aspects of angiogenins function: Arg-66   the proposed cell-surface receptor binding   in or near a region that interacts with human placental RNase   inhibitor (PRI), a tight-binding inhibitor of angiogenin   (Shapiro & Vallee, 1987; Lee et al., 1989b; Lee & Vaiiee,   1 9gga).
The present report examines the effects of mutating   each of these six arginines to alanine in termsof ribonucleolytic   and angiogenic activities, and PRI binding.

Dr. M. D. Bond kindly provided the human   angiogenin/bovine RNase A hybrid protein ARH-I11 (Bond   & Vallee, 1990a) and bovine angiogenin.
The latter was   isolated from serum as described (Bond & Vallee, 1988) except   that an additional chromatography on UTP-agarose was   introduced in order to remove all traces of extraneous RNases.

  Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis.
Genes encoding   Met-(-1) R3 1A and Met-(-1) R33A mutant angiogenins were   prepared by the method of Kunkel (1985) as described   (Shapiro et al., 1988a).
The mutagenic oligonucleotides were   pTCGATTATGGCACGCCGTGGG (R3 1A) and PATGAGACGC-XGTTAACT (R33A).
Mutant genes   were excised from double-stranded M 13mpl8 with KpnI and   EcoRI and inserted into KpnIIEcoRI-digested expression   vector pAng2 (Shapiro et al., 1988a) by standard procedures.
  Genes encoding R5A, R32A, R66A, and R70A were obtained   by the PCR-based method of Ho et al. (1989) as described   (Hallahan et al., 1992).
The complementary mutagenic   primers were pAGGACAACTCGmTATACACATT   and pAATGTGTATAmCGAGTTGTCCT (R5A), pCGATTATGAGAGCCCGTGGGTTAA and pTTAACCATEEAAACCTGC and pGCAGGTTTTCmAGCAAGTC and pGACTTGCTGATmCmGTTTTCG (R70A).
The 5-flanking primer in all instances was   pAACTAGTACGCAAGTTCA, corresponding to a sequence   Met-(-1) angiogenin is equivalent to the natural <Glu-1 protein   with respect toangiogenic activity on theCAM and ribonucleolytic activity   toward tRNA, dinucleotides, and 28s and 18s rRNA (Shapiro et al.,   1988a).

  The 3-flanking primer was pTCGACGGATCCCCGGGAATTC, corresponding to a sequence in the 3-noncoding   region of pAng2 that contains the EcoRI site.
The template   for the first round of PCR extension was the plasmid pAng3,   which is identical to pAng2 except that the initiator methionine   codon has been replaced by a DNA sequence encoding the E.   coli phoA signal peptide (GTGAAACAAAGCACTATTGCACTGGCACTATTACCGTTACTGTTTACCCCTGTG   ACAAAAGCC) (Dodt et al., 1986).
The final PCR product   was digested with KpnI and EcoRI and inserted into KpnI/   EcoRI-digested plasmid pAngl (Shapiro et al., 1988a) by   standard procedures.
The DNA for each of the six mutants   was sequenced in its entirety in order to rule out any spurious   mutations.
  Expression and Isolation of Mutant Proteins.
Met-(-1)   R31A and Met-(-1) R33A were expressed and purified to   homogeneity as described (Shapiro et al., 1988a).
The   remaining mutant proteins were obtained from a modified   expression system utilizing the vector pAng3, which produces   the <Glu- 1 protein.
Three-milliliter cultures of E. coli W3 1 10   harboring the expression plasmid were grown in LB broth   containing 50 pg/mL ampicillin at 37 OC until 4500 > 2.0   (usually -8 h).
Each culture was then added to 1 L of M9   medium (Sambrook et al., 1989) supplemented with 0.4%   casamino acids, 0.4% glucose, 50 pg/mL ampicillin, and 20   pg/mL indole-3-acrylic acid and grown overnight with shaking   at 37 OC.
Fresh glucose, casamino acids, and indoleacrylic   acid were then added to final concentrations of 0.2%, 0.256,   and 20 pg/mL, respectively, and the cultures were incubated   at 37 C for an additional 2 h. Cells were collected,   resuspended, and treated with lysozyme as described (Shapiro   et al., 1988a) except that the resuspension buffer was 20 mM   Tris, pH 9.0, containing 10% sucrose, 2.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM o-phenanthroline (Sigma),   and 0.25 mM benzamidine (Sigma).
The mixuture was   sonicated at 4 C for 2 cycles of 15 s each with a Branson   Model 350 sonifier, power setting 7 on pulse (70% on per   second), and centrifuged at 35000g for 20 min at 4 OC.
The   supernatant was loaded onto a column of S-Sepharose (50 Functional Arginines in Angiogenin   mL/L of culture) which had been equilibrated with 50 mM   Tris/ 100 mM NaC1, pH 8.0, at 4 OC, and theresin was washed   with the same buffer until A280 < 0.05.
Bound material was   eluted with 50 mM Tris/ 1 M NaC1, pH 8.0, then concentrated   by ultrafiltration, and chromatographed on a Mono S cationexchange column as described (Shapiro et al., 1986b, 1988a).
  Fractions containing angiogenin derivatives were diluted with   an equal volume of 0.4 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.2,   incubated for 20 h at 37 OC to convert the N-terminal   glutamine to pyroglutamic acid, and then chromatographed   on a Synchropak C18 HPLC column (Shapiroet al., 1988a).
  Peak fractions were diluted 1:l with water, lyophilized, and   reconstituted in water.
Precautions were taken to ensure that   preparations were not contaminated by unmodified angiogenin   (Shapiro & Vallee, 1989).
  Structural Characterization.
Amino acid analyses and   N-terminal sequencing were performed as described (Strydom   et al., 1985).
Tryptic digests of native proteins (Shapiro et   al., 1988a) were chromatographed on a Synchropak RP-P   C18 HPLC column, and the unretained fraction was rechromatographed on a Beckman Ultrasphere C18 column (Hallahan et al., 1992).
  Angiogenesis Assays.
Angiogenic activity was assessed on   the chick embryo CAM (Knighton et al., 1977; Fett et al.,   1985).
The numbers of positive and negative responses for   each sample from multiple sets of assays were combined, and   x2 were calculated from an outcome contingency table by   comparing the test sample with a water control; the associated   probabilities, p, were then obtained.
A value of p < 0.05   identifies a sample as active (Fett et al., 1985).
  Chemical Modification and Assay of Ribonucleolytic   Activity.
Reactions of angiogenin or angiogenin mutants (24   pM) with 10 mM p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal were performed in   the dark at 27 OC in 0.1 M Hepes, pH 8.0.
At various times,   5- or 10-pL aliquots were added to 235 or 230 pL, respectively,   of 40 mM Hepes/40 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, containing 100 pg   of RNase-free bovine serum albumin (Worthington) at 4 OC.
  After the last aliquot had been taken, 60 pL of 10 mg/mL   tRNA was added to each tube, and the mixtures were   incubated at 37 OC for 4 h. Perchloric acid precipitations and   absorbance measurements at 260 nm were performed as   described (Shapiro et al., 1987).
Activity was quantitated by   comparison with standard curves obtained using 0.1,0.2,0.4,   0.6, and 1 .O pg of unmodified angiogenin, R3 1 A, R32A, R66A,   and R70A; 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 3.0 pg of R5A; or 0.7, 1.4,   2.8, 4.2, and 7.0 pg of R33A.
Absorbance readings were   corrected for any contribution of the modification reagent.
  The activity of modified angiogenin (2.4 pM) toward CpA   was measured by HPLC quantitation of substrate and products   after 4 h at 37 OC in 33 mM Mes/33 mM NaC1, pH 5.9, as   described (Shapiro et al., 1986a,b).
  Interaction of Angiogenin Derivatives with Human PRI.
  Apparent second-order rate constants for association were   determined by a competition assay (Lee et al., 1989a) as   described previously (Shapiro et al., 1989).
Briefly, RNase   A (6.8 nM) was mixed with 0.6-2.2 equiv of angiogenin   derivative, PRI (6.8 nM) was added, and after 15 s, the   concentration of free RNase A was quantitated by adding the   dinucleotide CpG and measuring its rate of cleavage spectrophotometrically.
Rate constants for dissociation of the   complexes of PRI with mutant angiogenins were measured by   HPLC quantitation of the free derivative at various times   after addition of RNase A to act as a scavenger for free PRI   (Lee et al., 1989b; Shapiro et al., 1989).
Aliquots were   chromatographed after 1 min and 22,3 1,46,7 1, and 94 h for   Biochemistry, Vol. 31, No. 49, 1992 12479   R5A and after 1-5 min and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 days for the   remaining samples.
Dissociation of all complexes was biphasic,   with a relatively rapid release of up to 25% of the mutant   protein followed by a slower dissociation of the remainder.
  Similar biphasic dissociation has been noted previously for   the complexes of PRI with other angiogenin mutants (Shapiro   et al., 1989; Shapiro & Vallee, 1989), and was observed for   the PRImangiogenin complex in a parallel experiment. [See   Shapiro and Vallee (1991) for a discussion of possible   explanations of this phenomenon.] Rate constants were   calculated by treating the slower phase as a first-order process.
  The concentrations of angiogenin derivative in control samples   lacking PRI did not change significantly over the course of   the experiment.
Incubation mixtures lacking scavenger   contained no free mutant protein after 6 days.
  RESULTS   Expression of thephoA Signal Peptide-Angiogenin Fusion   Protein.
The bacterial expression system employed previously   for the preparation of angiogenin and its mutant derivatives   (Shapiro et al., 1988a) produces the Met-(-1) protein as   cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which are solubilized under   reducing conditions and reoxidized to the folded product.
This   procedure routinely generates 1-2 mg of angiogenin/L of   culture, but the yields of mutant derivatives are highly   variable: in earlier studies, they ranged from 5 mg/L for   K40Q-angiogenin (Shapiro et al., 1989) to as little as 20 pg/L   for D116H-angiogenin (Harper & Vallee, 1988).
Indeed,   repeated attempts to produce R5A for the present work by   this method were unsuccessful: expression was undetectable   by immunoblotting, and <2 pg of product could be isolated   per liter.
A modified expression system was therefore devised   in which the E. coli phoA signal sequence was appended to   the protein N-terminus.
This should allow the product to be   secreted into the periplasm in soluble form, minimizing contact   with cytoplasmic proteases and bypassing the lengthy and   potentially inefficient refolding steps required previously.
  This system was first tested for expression of the natural   protein in E. coli harboring the altered expression plasmid   pAng 3: several milligrams per liter of angiogenin was   produced as assessed by immunoblots.
Despite the periplasmic   targeting sequence, less than 5% of the protein was released   from the cells after disruption of the outer membrane by   standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989).
Following   complete cell lysis, however, virtually all of it was present in   the soluble fraction which therefore served as the starting   material for the isolation of angiogenin.
S-Sepharose, Mono   S, and C18 chromatography and phosphate treatment gave   a final product (1.5 mg/L) that comigrated with the native   protein during SDS-PAGE.
The product was refractory to   Edman degradation, indicating that the N-terminal glutamine   had cyclized to the pyroglutamic acid characteristic of   authentic angiogenin.
The ribonucleolytic and angiogenic   activities of the final preparation were indistinguishable from   those of native angiogenin, as was its amino acid composition.
  Preparation of Angiogenin Mutants.
Genes encoding   Arg-Ala mutants were prepared by two different methods   of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (see Experimental   Procedures).
Four mutant derivatives, R5A, R32A, R66A,   and R70A, were expressed as chimeric proteins carrying the   phoA signal sequence and purified from the soluble fraction   as the <Glu-1 form, in each case with a yield of - 1 mg/L.   Two others, R31A and R33A, were expressed as Met-(-1)   derivatives and purified from inclusion bodies with yields of   - 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively.

The amino acid composition   of each of the six mutant proteins demonstrates the alanine   replacement but no other changes (Table I).
Tryptic peptide   maps differ from that of angiogenin only with respect to those   peptides containing the mutated residues [see Strydom et al.   (1985) for a description of angiogenin tryptic peptides].
  Peptides T1 (residues 1-5) and T7 (residues 6-21) are absent   from the map for R5A, and a new peptide eluting between   T10 and T11 has the amino acid composition expected for   residues 1-21 (Table 11).
Peptide T9 (amino acids 22-31   linked by a disulfide bond to amino acids 74-82) is absent   from the tryptic map for R31A, and the height of the first   peak of the peptide T10 doublet is increased.

A new   peptide eluting between T5 and T6 has the amino acid   composition expected for residues 67-73 (Table 11).
  Enzymatic Activity.
R33A is one-seventh as active toward   tRNA as angiogenin, measured at substrate concentrations   of both 2 (Figure 2) and 0.4 mg/mL. The former concentration is equal to or above and the latter is well below the   apparent K, value (Lee & Vallee, 1989b).
The activity of   R5A toward tRNA is also decreased, albeit less substantially   (4-fold).
The activities of the remaining four derivatives are   more comparable to that of angiogenin [92% (R3 1 A), 130%   (R32A), 76% (R66A), and 83% (R70A)l.
  The activity of the mutant proteins toward the dinucleotides   CpA, UpA, and CpG was also examined (Table 111).

Activities are listed as v/vc X 100, where   v and uc are reaction velocities in the presence and absence of modification reagent, respectively, and were determined with tRNA as substrate as   described (ShaDiro et al.. 1987).
  activity of R33A toward each of these substrates again is   markedly lower than that of angiogenin; the extent of the   decrease in all instances is similar to that observed with tRNA.
  Activities of the other five mutant proteins including R5A do   not differ appreciably from that of native angiogenin.
  Chemical Modification.
Treatment of angiogenin with 10   mM p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal at pH 8.0 for 90 min at 27 OC   reduces the activity toward tRNA by >98% (Shapiro et al.,   1987).
In order to ascertain whether or not any of the six   arginines mutated are involved in this loss of activity, the rate   of inactivation of each derivative by this reagent was measured   (Table IV).
R5A, R33A, R66A, and R70A are all inactivated   at virtually the same rate as is angiogenin.
The initial rate   for R31A is similar, but decreases markedly after 30 min.
  Inactivation of R32A is slower throughout.
  The effects of p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal on bovine angiogenin   and the human angiogenin/bovine RNase A hybrid protein   ARH-I11 were also determined (data not shown).
Bovine   angiogenin, like the human protein, contains 13 arginines,   but only 6 are at corresponding positions [5, 21, 33, 66, 70,   and 101 (Bond & Strydom, 1989)l. It is inactivated - 2.5-   fold more slowly than its human counterpart.
In ARH-I11   (Bond & Vallee, 1990a), angiogenin residues 8-22 are replaced   with the RNase segment 7-21, thereby substituting Arg-21   by Ala. The rate of inactivation of this derivative is identical   to that of human angiogenin.
  In previous studies, only polynucleotide substrates have been   used to monitor the effect ofp-hydroxyphenylglyoxal treatment   (Shapiro et al., 1987); a comparable rate and degree of   inactivation was observed with each of them.
To determine   whether cleavage of small substrates is affected similarly,   aliquots of a reaction mixture were assayed simultaneously   with both tRNA and the dinucleotide CpA. Remarkably,   when the level of activity measured with the polynucleotide   substrate is virtually undetectable (< 1 %), the modified protein   exhibits 58% of native activity toward CpA.   Mutant   angiogenins were tested for angiogenic activity at a dose of   10 ng/egg (Table V).
R5A, R33A, and R66A are substantially less active than angiogenin, with a response statistically   indistinguishable from that for control samples lacking   angiogenin.
However, R32A and R70A retain activities   similar to that of angiogenin.
Finally, R31A gives a highly   significant positive response (p = 0.0006 compared to negative   controls), but it is less active than the unmodified protein.

  Interactionof Mutant Angiogenins with PRI.
Theapparent   second-order rate constants for association, ka, of the various   arginine mutants with PRI, measured indirectly by competition   with RNase A for PRI, do not differ markedly from that for   angiogenin (Table VI).
The largest change is seen with R5A   where k, is 40% lower.
The k, values of the two mutants   prepared as Met-(-1) derivatives are higher than those of the   four obtained in the natural CGlu-1 form, consistent with the   earlier finding that N-terminal extension of angiogenin by 12482 Biochemistry, Vol. 31, No. 49, I992 Shapiro and Vallee   is absent rather than blocked through chemical modification   with a structurally disruptive, bulky group.
  Selection of Residues for Mutation Based on the DualSite Model.
Six arginines in angiogenin-at positions 5,3 1,   32, 33, 66, and 70-were designated for mutation owing to   their calculated positions in the three-dimensional structure   of the protein (Figure 1; Palmer et al., 1986) relative to the   two regions that are required for angiogenic activity.
One of   these regions is the catalytic site capable of cleaving RNA or   some related substrate, and the other is the noncatalytic site   thought to bind to a cell-surface receptor (Hallahan et al.,   199 1, 1992).
The former contains His- 13, Lys-40, and His114 analogous to the active site of RNase A; mutation of any   of these three abolishes both ribonucleolytic and angiogenic   activities (Shapiro et al., 1989; Shapiro & Vallee, 1989).
The   cell-binding site includes the loops encompassing residues 60-   68 (Hallahan et al., 1991) and 107-110 (Hallahan et al.,   1992).
A number of changes within these loops, including   deamidations of Asn-61 and - 109 and proteolytic cleavages   at Lys-60 and/or Glu-67, markedly diminish angiogenic   activity but have no appreciable effect on enzymatic activity   or specificity.
Although this region does not appear to play   a ribonucleolytic role in angiogenin, the corresponding one of   RNase A is thought to be involved in substrate binding by   forming multiple H-bonds with the purine ring of substrates   suchasCpA(Richards & Wyckoff, 1973; Wodaketal., 1977).
  In the calculated angiogenin Structure, four arginines-Arg5, -31, -32, and -33-are near the enzymatic site.
None of   them would be expected to form direct contacts either with   dinucleotide substrates or with the catalytic histidines or lysine   (Richards & Wyckoff, 1973; Wodaket al., 1977).
However,   any of them could potentially be a component of an extended   binding domain for larger substrates, not yet defined crystallographically in RNase.
In addition, the guanidino group   of Arg-33 is <4 A from Gln-12 (backbone carbonyl) and   Phe-45 (phenyl ring),3 both residues which may influence   activity.
Gln-12 is adjacent to the essential His-13 residue   and corresponds to Gln- 1 1 of RNase A which may hydrogenbond to the substrate phosphate group (Wodak et al., 1977).
  Phe-45 follows Thr-44, which plays an important role in   substrate binding (T. P. Curran, personal communication).
  Two of the arginines are located within the receptor-binding   region.
Arg-66 is part of the proposed cell-binding loop 60-   68 (Hallahan et al., 1991), and Arg-70 is within hydrogenbonding distance of both Asn-61 and Glu-67.
The former   residue has been identified as an essential component of this   site (Hallahan et al., 1992).
  The balance of the arginines (Le., Arg-21, -24, -51, -95,   -101, -121, and -122) is predicted to be too far away from   either site to be critical.
The first five are > 16 A from His13, Lys-40, and His-114 in the enzymatic site and >23 A   from Asn-61 in the cell-binding site.
Arg-121 and -122   comprise part of a C-terminal extension which is nonexistent   in RNase A, and their positions were not included in the   calculated structure.
It seems unlikely, however, that they   would approach the enzymatic site since the computed   C-terminus (Ile-119) is >14 A from the catalytic residues   and the succeeding amino acids should be even further away,   in view of the direction of polypeptide chain growth at this   point.
  Four of the residues selected for mutation are preserved   (Arg-5, -33, and -70) or replaced conservatively by lysine   50 100   TIME (hours)   FIGURE 3: Dissociation of the PRI-R5A-angiogenin complex (a).
R5A-angiogenin was incubated with 1.5 equiv of PRI for 20 min at   25 OC, followed by addition of 250 equiv of RNase A. Release of   freeR5A-angiogenin was thenmeasured by HPLC (Leeetal., 1989b).
Results obtained simultaneously for the PRI-angiogenin complex   (A) are also shown.
  one methionine doubles the rate of association with PRI   (Shapiro et al., 1989).
  The rate constants for dissociation, kd, of the mutant   proteinaPR1 complexes were measured by first forming the   complex, then adding a large excess of RNase A as scavenger   for free PRI, and finally quantitating the angiogenin derivative   released after various times by HPLC (Table VI).
The   complexes with R3 1 A, R33A, R66A, and R70A dissociate at   rates similar to that measured with the native protein.
The   PRImR32A complex dissociates 6-fold faster.
The PRbR5A   complex is considerably less stable (Figure 3), with a kd of 3.9   X 10 s-l compared to 1.3 X lo- s-l for the angiogenin   complex.
These values correspond to half-lives of 2 days and   2 months, respectively.
  DISCUSSION   Chemical modification of human angiogenin with arginine   reagents rapidly abolishes its enzymatic activity toward   polynucleotide substrates (Shapiro et al., 1987).
This inactivation, inconstrast with that accompanying lysineor histidine   modification of angiogenin, cannot be assigned to specific   residues based on precedents with RNase A. Although a   number of arginine reagents decrease the activity of RNase   A (Takahashi, 1968; Yankeelov, 1970; Patthy & Smith, 1975;   Iijima et al., 1977; Yamasaki et al., 1980), their effect on this   enzyme is less dramatic than that with angiogenin (Shapiro   et al., 1987).
Moreover, the loss of activity in RNase was   attributed to modification of Arg-39 and perhaps Arg-85   (Takahashi, 1968; Patthy & Smith, 1975; Iijimaet al., 1977),   neither of which has a counterpart in angiogenin: Arg-39 is   either deleted or replaced by a proline, depending on the   sequence alignment chosen, and lysine substitutes for Arg85.
Indeed, in angiogenin only one of the four arginines of   RNase A, Le., Arg-33, is maintained, and this residue is   unreactive in RNase A. Thus, the basis for the response of   the two proteins to arginine reagents is completely different.
  Owing to the lack of specificity of the reaction, it has been   difficult to identify the arginines in angiogenin whose modification abolishes activity: about seven residues react under   conditions that inactivate it by 92% (Shapiro et al., 1987).
  Such lack of specificity is common for modification reactions,   but this problem can sometimes be addressed by the use of   competitive inhibitors to selectively block the active site.
For   angiogenin, however, poly(G) is the only inhibitor demonstrated so far to protect against inactivation (Shapiro et ai.,   1987), and it prevents modification of -4 residues (unpublished results).
Hence, site-directed mutagenesis seemed to   be a more promising experimental alternative.
In addition to   being highly specific, it allows more precise assignment of   function to the residue(s) altered since the guanidino moiety   The distance between atoms 1 and 2 {=[(XI - x2)2 + (YI -yd2 + (21   - Z~)~]I/~) was calculated from the atomic coordinates of the energyminimized structure (provided by Dr. K. A. Palmer).
Functional Arginines in Angiogenin   (Arg-31) in the other angiogenins sequenced to date [i.e.,   bovine, mouse, pig, and rabbit (Bond & Strydom, 1989; Bond   & Vallee, 1990b; Bond et al., 1992)].
The other two are not:   asparagine and glutamine substitute for Arg-32 in the bovine   and porcine proteins, respectively, and asparagine and glycine   for Arg-66 in porcine and rabbit angiogenin, respectively.
  Arg-21 and -101, two additional arginines that are constant   in all five angiogenins, were not mutated owing to their distance   from both of the critical regions.
Alanine substituted for each   of the six arginine residues selected in order to assess the   magnitude of their contributions to ribonucleolytic and   angiogenic activity.
  Effect of Mutations on Enzymatic Activity.
R33A displays   the most striking change in enzymatic activity, a 7-fold   decrease.
This effect is independent of substrate concentration,   indicating that kcat rather than K, is altered, and is similar   for large and small substrates.
The mutant protein has the   same preference as angiogenin for cytidine over uridine at   position N and for adenosine over guanosine at position N   in NpN dinucleotide substrates.
These results are consistent   with the location of this residue in the three-dimensional   structure, and suggest that Arg-33 does not make a significant   contribution to substrate binding but may influence the   reactivity of catalytic residues.
Replacement of Arg-5 also   diminishes activity, though less markedly than that of Arg33.
In this instance, the decrease is greater when tRNA is   the substrate than when dinucleotides are, perhaps indicating   a role for this residue in binding peripheral substrate   components.
Mutation of the remaining four residues does   not affect enzymatic activity appreciably.
  Comparison of Chemical Modification and Mutagenesis.
  The effects of arginine mutations on the ribonucleolytic activity   of angiogenin are not comparable to those of chemical   modification and underscore the problems inherent in the use   of these techniques, particularly the latter, for the attribution   of function to structure in proteins.
The complete loss of   activity toward polynucleotides following treatment with   p- hydroxyphenylglyoxal, phenylglyoxal, or camphorquinone10-sulfonic acid (Shapiro et al., 1987) had suggested that   arginines in angiogenin are catalytically e~sential.~ However,   mutation of each of the arginines likely to be near the enzymatic   site demonstrates that in fact no one of them is indispensable   for activity.
Although it is always possible that an arginine   that was not mutated plays such a role, their locations argue   strongly against it.
Arg-21 is particularly unlikely to becritical   as it is absent from ARH-I11 which is as active as angiogenin   (Bond & Vallee, 1990a).
  How then are the dramatic effects of chemical modification   to be understood?
The p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal reaction   typically adds two reagent molecules per guanidino group   (Yamasaki et al., 1980).
Modification of a functional but   noncritical amino acid such as Arg-5 or -33 might therefore   have an effect disproportionate to the residues importance in   the native enzyme.
Neither of these arginines, however,   appears to be involved in the decrease of activity since the   reagent inactivates both R5A and R33A at the same rate as   angiogenin.
Moreover, mutation of Arg-33 to alanine is   presumably less disruptive than attachment of the bulky   p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal groups and yet diminishes activity   toward CpA more markedly than does the chemical modification.
Modifications of arginines-21, -66, and -70 are also   unlikely to underlie the activity loss since ARH-111, R66A,   Biochemistry, Vol. 31, No. 49, 1992 12483   and R70A areagain affected by the reagent in the same manner   as angiogenin.
Twoof the mutants, R3 1 Aand R32A, however,   are inactivated more slowly than angiogenin, indicating that   modification of Arg-31 and -32 contributes to the activity   decrease, albeit indirectly.
Simultaneous modifications of both   of these residues might then act synergistically and abolish   activity toward large substrates altogether.
Bovine angiogenin,   which lacks these residues, is inactivated much more slowly   than the human protein despite the presence of additional   arginines at positions 38 and 43 near the catalytic site.
  Effect of Mutationson Bindingto PRI.
Both the enzymatic   and angiogenic activities of angiogenin are abolished by PRI   (Shapiro & Vallee, 1987), a 50-kDa cytoplasmic protein that   binds tightly to all members of the pancreatic RNase   superfamily examined thus far (Blackburn et al., 1977; Shapiro   et al., 1986a; Shapiro & Vallee, 1991).
The dissociation   constant for the PRI-angiogenin complex is 0.7 fM (Lee et   al., 1989b).
Previous mapping of the PRI-binding site on   angiogenin has demonstrated that Lys-40 is an important   contact point: its mutation to glutamine lowers affinity by a   factor of 1300 (Lee & Vallee, 1989a), and even its replacement   by arginine has a 100-fold effect (Shapiro et al., 1989).
His114 may likely play a minor role since its substitution by   alanine weakens binding by - 3-fold (Shapiro & Vallee, 1989).
  The fluorescence of Trp-89 increases dramatically upon   complex formation, suggesting that this residue is within the   angiogenimPR1 contact region (Lee et al., 1989a).
Trp-89   does not, however, seem to engage in a specific interaction   since neither its oxidation to oxindolylalanine (Lee & Vallee,   1989a) nor its mutation to methionine (E. A. Fox, personal   communication) affects Ki significantly.
Other amino acids   examined-His-1 3 (Shapiro & Vallee, 1989), Lys-50 and Lys60 (Lee & Vallee, 1989a), and Asn-61 and Asn-109 (T. W.   Hallahan and R. Shapiro, unpublished results)-are not   important for binding, nor in fact is the entire segment   containing residues 58-70 (Harper & Vallee, 1989).
  Ionic interactions make a substantial overall contribution   to PRI-binding strength, as indicated by the increase in Ki of   more than 6 orders of magnitude as the NaCl concentration   is raised from 0.1 to 1.0 M (Lee et al., 1989b).
The changes   in both association and dissociation rate constants that   accompany butanedione treatment of angiogenin (Lee &   Vallee, 1989a) suggest that its arginines participate in these   interactions.
Since mutation of Arg-31, -33, -66, and -70 to   Ala does not influence Ki, these can be excluded.
However,   Arg-32, the immediate neighbor of Arg-3 1 and -33, does play   a role since the alanine mutation increases Ki by about 4-fold.
  Arg-5 is a major contact point.
Its substitution by alanine   increases Ki by 50-fold, largely reflecting an accelerated rate   of complex dissociation.
This residue does not fall within the   PRI interaction region defined previously: its inclusion would   thus extend this site some distance along the angiogenin   surface-Arg-5 is about 15 8, from Lys-40, 9 8, from His1 14, and 29 8, from Trp-89 in the calculated structure (Figure   Both of the PRI contact residues identified in this study are   replaced nonconservatively in RNase A, which binds 60-fold   lessavidly thanangiogenin (Leeet al., 1989b).
Indeed,RNase   A contains an alanine at the position corresponding to Arg-5,   and this single substitution may therefore account for a large   fraction of the difference in binding strength.
It should be   noted, however, that Arg-5 in human placental RNase is   substituted by a posttranslationally modified tryptophan, as   yet uncharacterized; nonetheless, this protein binds as tightly   to PRI as does angiogenin (Shapiro & Vallee, 1991).
If the   1)
.
  4 Inactivation by these reagents is not due to lysine modification   (Shapiro et al., 1987).
12484 Biochemistry, Vol. 31, No. 49, 1992   modified tryptophan is unable to substitute functionally for   the arginine, as seems likely, this would then imply either that   the placental RNase contains an additional, compensating   contact point absent from angiogenin or that some of the   interactions common to both proteins are stronger for the   RNase.
  Effect of Mutations on Angiogenic Activity.
Three of the   mutants-RSA, R33A, and R66A-are angiogenically inactive on the CAM at a dose of 10 ng/egg, indicating a decrease   of potency >20-fold since 0.5 ng of unmodified angiogenin is   sufficient to produce a positive response (Fett et al., 1985).
  For R5A and R33A, this loss may reflect their decreased   ribonucleolytic activities.
Although the loss in angiogenic   activity appears to be more extensive, the mutations may affect   cleavage of some, as yet unidentified, in vivo substrate more   dramatically than activity toward the substrates employed in   the present work.
Alternatively, the cell-binding site on   angiogenin may include Arg-5 and -33, although they are   relatively far from the residues proposed to be part of this site.
  Arg-66, the third residue important for angiogenic activity,   is in precisely this region of the molecule.
Since this amino   acid is not conserved in porcine and rabbit angiogenins (Bond   et al., 1992), it is unclear whether it plays a direct role; this   would then need to be adopted by a different residue in the   other proteins.
Alternatively, the mutation might perturb   critical residues nearby.
A more precise understanding of the   structural basis for the effects of all three arginine mutations   that attenuate angiogenic activity must await X-ray crystallographic or NMR studies.
  Summary and Conclusions.
Earlier chemical modifications   suggested that arginines are important for the ribonucleolytic   activity of angiogenin.
The present mutagenic study establishes that two arginines, at positions 5 and 33, indeed play   a role in activity.
Neither residue by itself, however, is crucial,   and neither one is implicated in the abolition of enzymatic   activity by arginine reagents.
Mutations of the four additional   arginines, at positions 3 1, 32, 66, and 70, predicted to lie in   the same region of the molecule as the active center, do not   significantly impact catalysis.
The basis for the effects of   chemical modification therefore remains unclear.
Inactivation   may be a consequence of structural perturbations arising from   concurrent modifications of multiple residues which of   themselves have no direct functional importance.
  In addition to their role in the ribonucleolytic activity of   angiogenin, arginines are important both for the binding of   angiogenin to PRI and for angiogenic activity.
Mutations of   Arg-5 and -32 to alanine weaken PRI binding by 50-fold and   4-fold, respectively.
Among the numerous angiogenin residues   examined to date, the importance of Arg-5 is second only to   that of Lys-40.
If the contributions of the various contact   residues identified (Arg-5, Arg-32, Lys-40, and His-1 14) are   independent and additive, then about 6 orders of magnitude   of the Ki value of - 10-15 M can now be accounted for.
The   sources of the remainder of the binding strength, whether   individual strong contacts, as with Arg-5 and Lys-40, or   relatively weak interactions, as with Arg-32, His-1 14, and   perhaps Trp-89, remain to be elucidated.
  Finally, arginines appear to play a critical role in angiogenic   activity: mutations of three of the six residues examined   markedly reduce biological potency.
One of these amino acids,   Arg-66, lies within the putative cell-binding region.
Since   R66A is almost fully active enzymatically, this finding lends   further support to the dual-site model for the action of   angiogenin proposed previously, and provides yet additional   evidence of the separability of the enzymatic and angiogenic   Shapiro and Vallee   activities of the protein.
The other two arginines, at positions   5 and 33, whose mutations reduce angiogenic activity, are not   in this cell-binding site as it is now defined, and the decreased   angiogenicity of R5A and R33A may be associated with the   changes in ribonucleolytic activity which also accompany the   amino acid substitutions.
