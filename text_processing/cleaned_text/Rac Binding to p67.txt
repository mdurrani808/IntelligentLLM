Herein, the interaction between Rac and p67phox is explored using functional and physical methods.
Mutually facilitated binding (EC50) of Rac1 and p67phox within the NADPH  oxidase complex was demonstrated using steady state  kinetic methods measuring NADPH-dependent superoxide generation.
Direct binding of Rac1 and Rac2 to  p67phox was shown using a fluorescent analog of GTP  (methylanthraniloyl guanosine-5*-[b,g-imido]triphosphate) bound to Rac as a reporter group.
An increase in  the methylanthraniloyl fluorescence was seen with  added p67phox but not p47phox, and the emission maximum shifted from 445 to 440 nm.
Rac1 and Rac2 bound to  p67phox with a 1:1 stoichiometry and with Kd values of  120 and 60 nM, respectively.
Mutational studies (Freeman, J., Kreck, M., Uhlinger, D. J., and Lambeth, J. D.  (1994) Biochemistry 33, 1343113435; Freeman, J. L., Abo,  A., and Lambeth, J. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19794  19801) previously identified two regions in Rac1 that are  important for activity: the effector region (residues  2645) and the insert region (residues 124135).
Proteins mutated in the effector region (Rac1(N26H),  Rac1(I33N), and Rac1(D38N)) showed a marked increase  in both the Kd and the EC50, indicating that mutations in  this region affect activity by inhibiting Rac binding to  p67phox.
Insert region mutations (Rac1(K132E) and  L134R), while showing markedly elevated EC50 values,  bound with normal affinity to p67phox.
The structure of  Rac1 determined by x-ray crystallography reveals that  the effector region and the insert region are located in  defined sectors on the surface of Rac1.
A model is discussed in which the Rac1 effector region binds to  p67phox, the C terminus binds to the membrane, and the  insert region interacts with a different protein component, possibly cytochrome b558.
  Neutrophils and macrophages reduce molecular oxygen with  NADPH to produce superoxide (O2  .
  ) and secondarily derived  reactive oxygen species (H2O2, HOCl, OHz), which function to  kill phagocytosed microorganisms (14).
Superoxide generation is catalyzed by an NADPH oxidase (also called the respiratory burst oxidase), which is dormant in resting cells but  becomes active upon exposure to bacteria or to a variety of  soluble stimuli.
The enzyme consists of both cytosolic and  plasma membrane-associated protein factors.
Flavocytochrome  b558 is a membrane-associated heterodimer (57) that contains  putative binding sites for NADPH, FAD, and heme (811) and  therefore represents the enzymatic component of the NADPH  oxidase.
Three cytosolic components (p47phox, p67phox, and a  small molecular weight GTP-binding protein, Rac), activate  superoxide generation and can be considered to be regulatory  subunits of the flavocytochrome.
p47phox, while not essential for  activity, functions as a regulated adaptor protein that increases the binding of p67phox to the oxidase 100-fold (12).
  p47phox appears to act by coupling p67phox to the 22-kDa subunit of the flavocytochrome b558 (1315).
p47phox and p67phox  exist in the cytosol of resting cells as a complex along with a  third component, p40phox (16, 17), which may function as an  inhibitory protein.
p47phox and p67phox translocate to the  plasma membrane (1821), and this correlates with cell activation.
In a cell-free system, p47phox and p67phox form a 1:1:1  complex with flavocytochrome b558 (22).
  The small molecular weight GTP-binding protein, Rac, occurs as two isoforms (Rac1 and Rac2) that are 92% identical in  amino acid sequence (23).
The two isoforms differ primarily in  their C termini; Rac1 but not Rac2 contains a polybasic C  terminus.
In resting cells, Rac is located in a cytosolic complex  with an inhibitory protein, RhoGDI (2427).
Upon cell activation, Rac2, the more abundant isoform in neutrophils (2830),  becomes associated with the plasma membrane (28), and translocation correlates with NADPH oxidase activity (28, 30, 31).1  Translocation of Rac requires neither p47phox nor p67phox and  occurs with different kinetics than these other cytosolic components (3437), suggesting that the binding of Rac to the  plasma membrane is regulated by mechanisms that are distinct from those that regulate p47phox/p67phox assembly.
In  their isoprenylated forms, both Rac1 and Rac2 can activate  superoxide generation in a cell-free system (3840).
Kinetic  characterization and binding studies are complicated by the  presence of the isoprenyl group, which limits the solubility and  requires the presence of a detergent.
The proteins in their  nonisoprenylated forms can be expressed in and purified from  bacteria.
However, in their nonisoprenylated forms, only Rac1  activates efficiently.
This is because membrane association is  essential for optimal function of Rac, and nonisoprenylated  * Supported by National Institutes of Health Grant AI22809.

Bacterially expressed versions of Rac1 have  therefore been used for most of the studies described herein.
  We have previously characterized two regions on Rac1 that  are important for its ability to activate the NADPH oxidase.
  These are the effector region (within the range of residues  2645) and the insert region (residues 124135).
The effector  region shows homology to a region on Ras that has been characterized as mediating the GTP-dependent binding to the Ras  effector Raf-1, a member of the MAP kinase cascade (42, 43).
  The effector region of Ras includes residues the conformation of  which changes significantly depending on whether GTP or  GDP is bound.
The insert region on Rac has no counterpart in  Ras.
Mutation of residues in both the effector region and the  insert region of Rac1 results in a marked decrease in the ability  to support cell-free superoxide generation (4446), and the  primary effect was decreased affinity of Rac1, based upon an  increase in the EC50 (44, 47).
  Rac1 has been shown to bind to immobilized p67phox (48, 49),  and the interaction has been demonstrated using yeast twohybrid analysis, but it is not clear whether Rac also interacts  with other targets.
In addition, no quantitative information on  Rac binding to p67phox is available (e.g. affinity, stoichiometry).
  Herein, steady state kinetic analysis was used to demonstrate  the functional linkage between Rac and p67phox.
In addition,  Rac binding to p67phox was measured directly, making use of a  fluorescent GTP analog that binds tightly to Rac as a reporter  group.
The Rac-associated analog undergoes an increase in  fluorescence upon interaction of Rac with p67phox, and this  fluorescence change was used to quantify the Rac binding to  p67phox.
This method, used in conjunction with mutational  analysis, reveals that the effector region participates in binding  to p67phox, while the insert region does not.
Mapping of residues the mutation of which lowers activity onto the structure of  Rac1 (recently determined by x-ray crystallography; Ref. 50)  reveals that the effector region and the insert region are located in distinct sectors of the protein, consistent with a model  in which these two regions bind to distinct targets within the  NADPH oxidase complex.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  MaterialsCytochrome c (type VI), NADPH, n-octyl glucoside, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and N-a-tosylL-lysine chloromethylketone were from Sigma.
GTPgS was purchased  from Boehringer Mannheim.
HESPAN (6% hetastarch in 0.9% NaCl)  was from American Hospital Supply Corp., and lymphocyte separation  medium (6.2% Ficoll, 9.4% sodium diatrizoate) was obtained from Organon Tekniker.
Superoxide dismutase and dithiothreitol were from  Wako Pure Chemical Co. Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, DEAE-Sepharose  CL-6B, CM-Sepharose CL-6B, v-aminooctyl-agarose, and glutathioneSepharose were purchased from Pharmacia LKB.
L-a-phosphatidylcholine (bovine brain), L-a-phosphatidylethanolamine (bovine brain), L-aphosphatidylinositol (bovine brain), and sphingomyelin (bovine  erythrocyte) were from Sigma.
All other reagents were of the highest  grade available commercially.
Methyl isotoic anhydride was purchased  from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and mant-GppNHp2 was synthesized as described previously (51).
  Preparation of Recombinant ProteinsRecombinant p67phox was expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Hi5 insect cells as described (22, 31).
Wild type and mutant Rac1 were expressed in Escherichia coli as the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, purified  using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and cleaved from the glutathione  S-transferase domain with thrombin (52).
All recombinant proteins  were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity.
  Isolation of Human Neutrophils and Plasma Membrane PreparationHuman neutrophils were obtained from peripheral blood of normal healthy donors after obtaining informed consent.
Erythrocytes  were sedimented with HESPAN, and the mononuclear cells were removed from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation through lymphocyte separation medium (53).
The resulting cells were greater than  95% neutrophilic granulocytes.
Neutrophils were resuspended in cavitation buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 100 mM KCl, 3 mM  NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 6 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin).
  Cells (6 3 109  ) in 20 ml of ice-cold buffer were disrupted by nitrogen  cavitation after being pressurized at 500 p.s.i. for 20 min at 4 C, and  plasma membranes were prepared as described (54).
  Purification and Reconstitution of Flavin-depleted Cytochrome b558  with FADPlasma membrane was solubilized in the presence of 40 mM  octyl glucoside and 0.5% sodium cholate (11).
Detergent-solubilized  cytochrome b558 was purified as described previously (9) with some  modifications (11).
Purified FAD-depleted cytochrome b558 (15.6 nmol of  heme/mg of protein) was incubated in 50 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH  7.45, containing 5 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM  EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin (buffer B), and phospholipids (L-a-phosphatidylcholine/L-a-phosphatidylethanolamine/L-a-phosphatidylinositol/sphingomyelin/cholesterol 5 4:2:1:3:3 (w/w/w/w/w); lipid/protein 5 100, w/w)  were added along with a 10-fold excess of FAD over heme.
After incubating at 4 C for 2 h, the mixture was dialyzed against two changes of  buffer B to remove free FAD.
The FAD-reconstituted material typically  contained a FAD:heme ratio of 0.40.5 (11).
  Spectrophotometric AssayThe heme content of cytochrome b558 reconstituted with FAD and phospholipids was determined by reduced  minus oxidized difference spectroscopy at 424440 nm using an extinction coefficient of 161 mM21  zcm21 (55).
The flavin content of FADreconstituted cytochrome b558 was estimated by the fluorimetric  method (11).
Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Hitachi model  F-3000 spectrofluorimeter, and routine fluorescence measurements  were made with a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B spectrofluorimeter.
Samples  (mant-GppNHp, Rac 1, cytochrome b558, and cytosolic factors) were  incubated at 20 C in 0.3 ml of 20 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.45,  containing 3 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, and 0.1 mM MgCl2.
Preloading of  Racs with mant-GppNHp was carried out for 1520 min, at which point  the fluorescence change due to the guanine nucleotide binding was  stable.
Low MgCl2 concentration was essential to facilitate complete  guanine nucleotide exchange.
Titrations were carried out by adding  p67phox and recording fluorescence readings until three successive stable readings, at least 45 s apart, were obtained.
Fluorescence changes  induced by p67phox occurred rapidly (within 12 min) and did not  change further with prolonged incubation.
Spectral resolution was 5 nm  for both the excitation and emission paths, respectively.
  Assay of Cell-free Superoxide GenerationSuperoxide generation  was measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c as described previously (54) using a Thermomax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA).
Rac, preloaded  with a 5-fold molar excess of GTPgS for 15 min at 25 C in the absence  of MgCl2 (52), was combined with p47phox, p67phox, 10 nM cytochrome  b558, and 1 mM FAD followed by activation with 40 mM arachidonate in  50 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM EGTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, as  described (56).
The mixture was incubated at 25 C for 5 min followed  by the addition of 200 mM NADPH and 200 mM cytochrome c. An  extinction coefficient at 550 nm of 21 mM21 cm21 was used to calculate  the quantity of cytochrome c reduced (57).
  Data Fitting and Calculation of Kd ValuesThe theoretical lines  through the data shown in Figs. 1 and 2 were calculated using a  nonlinear least squares fit of the data using the Michaelis-Menten  equation and were plotted using Sigma Plot.
Kinetic constants are  reported as Vmax and EC50 (effective concentration at 50% of Vmax).
  Fluorescence titrations were fit to a single site binding equation as  described previously (58) as follows,  DF 5 DFmax~~Kd 1 LT 1 RT! 2 ~~Kd 1 LT 1 RT!
  2 2 4 LTRT!  1/2/2RT! (Eq. 1)  where DF is the fluorescence change after each addition of p67phox,  DFmax is the maximal fluorescence change at infinite (extrapolated)  p67phox, Kd is the dissociation constant, LT is the concentration of  p67phox, and RT is the total concentration of Rac(mant-GppNHp).
Sigma  plot was used to generate a nonlinear least squares fit of the data,  solving for Kd and DFmax, constraining the fit to the actual concentration of Rac(mant-GppNHp) used in the experiment.
For the Rac(D38N)  mutation, it was necessary to assume the DFmax to be the same as that  of the wild type, since binding was weak and it was not feasible to  approach saturation.
  2 The abbreviations used are: mant-GppNHp, methylanthraniloyl  guanosine-59-[b,g-imido] triphosphate; GTPgS, guanosine 59-3-O-(thio)  triphosphate; mant, methylanthraniloyl.
  Rac-p67phox Complex 18835   at HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY on March 6, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from RESULTS  Mutually Facilitated Binding of Rac and p67phox in the  NADPH Oxidase Complex, Demonstrated by Steady State KineticsWe previously showed that a functional interaction  between p67phox and p47phox, which are known to form a complex, can be demonstrated using steady state kinetics assaying  superoxide generation; in the presence of the other required  components, the EC50 for each protein was found to vary inversely with the concentration of the partner protein (59).
This  result indicates a thermodynamic linkage between the binding  of the two proteins within the NADPH oxidase complex and is  consistent with a complex between the partner proteins.
This  approach was tried with p67phox and Rac1 under conventional  assay conditions (in the presence of p47phox), but effects of  varying the concentration of one protein on the EC50 of the  other protein were not seen.
We attribute this to the already  high affinity of both components in the oxidase complex, which  makes it difficult to observe further decreases in their EC50  values, and to the presence of multiple binding interactions for  each of the proteins, which may obscure observation of such  interactions.
However, the system can be simplified, since  p47phox need not be present to observe high activity when high  concentrations of p67phox and Rac1 are used (12).
The omission  of p47phox simplifies the kinetic analysis; the 50100-fold  weaker binding of Rac1 and p67phox makes any decreases in  EC50 values easy to detect, and p47phox is ruled out as a mediator of any observed kinetic linkage that must therefore be due  to direct interactions among the remaining components (Rac1,  p67phox, cytochrome b558).
Under these conditions, the EC50 for  Rac1 decreased at increasing concentrations of p67phox (Fig.  1A).
Likewise, at increasing concentrations of Rac1, the EC50  for p67phox decreased (Fig. 1B).
A 6-fold increase in the concentration of p67phox resulted in a roughly 5-fold decrease in the  EC50 for Rac, while a 10-fold increase in Rac concentration  resulted in a .2-fold decrease in the EC50 for p67phox.
These  data imply a functional interaction between p67phox and Rac1,  consistent with a complex between these two proteins.
  Characterization of the Binding of Mant-GppNHp, a Fluorescent Derivative of GTP, to Rac1We previously showed that  mant-GppNHp binding to Rac1 is accompanied by an increase  in fluorescence at 445 nm, the emission peak of the mant  moiety, and we have used this increased fluorescence to quantify the binding of mant-GppNHp to Rac1 and point-mutated  types of Rac1 (47).
We used this fluorescence increase in the  present studies to verify that Rac1, Rac2, Rac1(N26H),  Rac1(I33N), Rac1(D38N), Rac1(M45T), Rac1(K132E), and  Rac1(L134R) all bind mant-GppNHp tightly and achieve maximal binding within the same time period.
Quantifying binding  as described previously, all of these recombinant forms of Rac  bound the guanine nucleotide with an approximate 1:1 stoichiometry and with apparent Kd values in the 120 nM range.
In  addition, all had achieved maximal fluorescence change by  about 5 min, well within the 1520 min incubation period used  for preloading of Rac1 with the nucleotide.
Examination of the  Rac1 structure (50) shows that the side chains of these mutants  do not directly interact with the nucleotide, are relatively exposed, and can accommodate the respective mutations without  altering the overall fold of the protein.
As a control, Rac(T17N),  a mutation that in Ras renders this GTPase incapable of binding guanine nucleotide, did not produce any fluorescence  change when added to mant-GppNHp.
Thus, by preincubating  mant-GppNHp in the presence of a slight excess of Rac or Rac  mutants, a fully associated complex between the fluorescent  nucleotide and Rac was formed.
The ability of mant-GppNHp to  produce an active conformation of representative versions of  Rac1 was also investigated.
Mant-GppNHp was compared with  GTPgS (0.5 mM each) in their abilities to support NADPH-dependent superoxide generation, using purified oxidase components in the cell-free system.
Using wild type Rac1 (Fig. 2), the  mant-GppNHp supported superoxide generation to about 60%  of the level seen with GTPgS. For representative point-mutated forms (Rac1(N26H) and Rac1(D38N)) that have a reduced  ability to stimulate superoxide generation (44), the mantGppNHp worked nearly as well as GTPgS.  Effects of NADPH Oxidase Components on the Fluorescence  of Mant-GppNHpFig. 3A (solid line) shows the emission spectrum for mant-GppNHp free in solution.
Upon addition of Rac1,  there was a small increase in fluorescence (about 5%), as was  described previously (dotted line).
When p67phox was added,  there was a further increase in the mant fluorescence, and the  emission maximum was blue-shifted about 5 nm (Fig. 3A,  dashed line).
This was not due to any direct effect of p67phox on  the free mant-GppNHp, since p67phox had no effect on its fluFIG.

A, data are plotted  in Lineweaver-Burk format.
Each point represents the average of at  least three determinations.
The concentration of Rac was varied as  indicated in the presence of 3 mM p67phox (triangles), 1.5 mM p67phox  (filled circles), or 0.5 mM p67phox (open circles) and 10 nM cytochrome  b558, which had been reconstituted with FAD and phospholipid.
p47phox  was not present in the incubation.
Superoxide generation was quantified by cytochrome c reduction, as described under Experimental Procedures.
 B, the concentration of p67phox was varied as indicated in the  presence of 2 mM Rac (triangles), 0.5 mM Rac (filled circles), or 0.2 mM Rac  (open circles), and the assay for superoxide generation was carried out  as in A.  FIG. 2.
Comparison of mant-GppNHp and GTPgS in the activation of superoxide generation by Rac1 and point-mutated  Rac1.
An aliquot of cytochrome b558 (10 nM final concentration) reconstituted with phospholipid and FAD was preincubated at 25 C with  0.25 mM arachidonate, recombinant p47phox (0.2 mM), p67phox (0.1 mM),  and Rac or the indicated point-mutated Rac (0.5 mM), which had been  preloaded with either GTPgS (solid bars) or mant-GppNHp (hatched  bars).

  Rac-p67phox 18836 Complex   at HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY on March 6, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from orescence in the absence of Rac1 (Fig. 3C).
In Fig. 3B, p47phox  was added to the mant-GppNHpzRac complex.
In contrast to  p67phox, there was no increase in the fluorescence intensity  upon the addition of p47phox (compare solid and superimposed  dotted lines).
When both p47phox and p67phox were added to the  Rac(mant-GppNHp) complex (dashed line), the fluorescence  increase was essentially the same as that produced by p67phox  alone.
Furthermore, the addition of 0.25 mM arachidonate  caused no significant effect on the fluorescence enhancement  due to the binding of p67phox to Rac(mant-GppNHp), indicating  that the guanine nucleotide-dependent binding of Rac1 to  p67phox occurs whether or not arachidonate is present.
  The increase in fluorescence of Rac(mant-GppNHp) was used  to quantify the strength of binding of Rac to p67phox.
Fig. 4  shows the titration of Rac1(mant-GppNHp) with p67phox and  p47phox.
As above, p47phox had no effect on the fluorescence of  Rac(mant-GppNHp), while p67phox produced a saturable increase in the fluorescence.
The increase in fluorescence fit a  theoretical curve (Fig. 4, solid line) for single site binding of  p67phox to Rac (i.e. no cooperativity was detected).
In the experiment shown, the apparent binding constant was 170 nM,  somewhat weaker than published values for the EC50 (#50 nM)  for Rac in cell-free superoxide generation assays (47).
The  average of 11 such titrations gave an value of 124 6 15 nM, as  TABLE I  Comparison of binding affinity of native and point-mutated forms of  Rac(Mant-GppNHp) for p67phox with kinetically determined EC50  values for Rac activation of superoxide generation  Kd values were obtained as described under Experimental Procedures using data from experiments such as those shown in Figs. 3, 4,  and 5.
EC50 values were obtained as described previously (44) in experiments using recombinant p47phox, p67phox, and Rac (or Rac mutants)  along with plasma membrane as a source of cytochrome b558, using  Michaelis-Menten steady state kinetic analysis of superoxide generation, which was quantified using cytochrome c reduction as in Fig. 1.

Effect of p67phox on the fluorescence of the mantGppNHpzRac complex.
A, the solid line shows the fluorescence emission spectrum (excitation wavelength, 355 nm) of mant-GppNHp (0.12  mM) in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.45, containing 3 mM NaCl, 50 mM  KCl, and 0.1 mM MgCl2 (solid line).
After adding 0.25 mM Rac 1 and  incubating for 20 min at 20 C, the fluorescence spectrum was recorded  (dotted line, middle spectrum).
Fifteen minutes after the addition of  0.30 mM p67phox the emission spectrum (broken line, upper spectrum)  was recorded.
B, after recording a spectrum of the Rac(mant-GppNHp)  complex (solid line), 0.30 mM p47phox was incubated with the mixture for  20 min, and then the spectrum (dotted line, no change from solid line)  was recorded.
p67phox (0.30 mM) was then added, and the emission  spectrum (broken line) was recorded as above.
C, the solid line shows  the emission spectrum of mant-GppNHp (0.12 mM) in the absence of  added Rac1.
The superimposed dotted line shows the spectrum 20 min  after the addition of p67phox (0.3 mM), again in the absence of Rac1.
  FIG. 4.
Quantitation of p67phox binding to Rac1 using the increase in fluorescence of mant-GppNHp bound to Rac1.
Rac1 (1.2  mM) was preincubated with 0.85 mM mant-GppNHp for 1520 min as  above to form the Raczmant-GppNHp complex.
This was then titrated  with either p67phox (filled circles) or p47phox (filled triangles), and the  fluorescence was recorded after each addition (excitation and emission  wavelengths were 355 and 440 nm, respectively) until a stable value  was achieved (about 3 min).
The increase in fluorescence intensity is  shown as a function of the concentration of the added component.
The  observed fluorescence was corrected for volume changes.
The line  shown is a theoretical fit of the data, calculated as described under  Experimental Procedures. The Kd value describing the theoretical line  is 0.17 mM.

The binding experiment was also carried out in the presence of p47phox (see Table I, titration not  shown).
p47phox did not affect the ability of Rac1 to bind to  p67phox.
In addition, the binding experiment was also carried  out in the presence of arachidonate.
Although this did not  appear to affect binding in a significant way, increased light  scattering prevented detailed quantitative analysis and did not  permit us to carry out binding and activity experiments under  identical conditions.
  Comparison of the Binding of Rac1, Rac2, and Mutants of  Rac1 to p67phoxTitrations of mant-GppNHp complexes of  Rac1 and Rac2 with p67phox are shown in Fig. 5.
Binding of  p67phox to Rac2(mant-GppNHp) gave a somewhat smaller maximal fluorescence yield, but the calculated Kd value was 2-fold  lower than that using Rac1(mant-GppNHp), as summarized in  Table I. This slightly higher affinity of Rac2 is consistent with  studies using the yeast two-hybrid system to detect the interaction of Rac1 and Rac2 with p67phox (49).
While quantitation  is not possible using this method, the use of the Rac2 hybrid  yielded a more intense blue color in the two-hybrid assay,  suggesting enhanced binding.
In contrast to the increased binding of Rac2 to p67phox, the EC50 for Rac2 was markedly elevated  compared with Rac1 in the cell-free NADPH-superoxide generation assay (Table I).
  Point mutations of Rac1 were previously characterized (44)  and shown to produce large changes in the EC50 for Rac1 in the  cell-free NADPH-superoxide generation assay.
Previous published values as well as unpublished experiments were averaged to obtain the EC50 values (Table I).
The binding of these  mutated Rac1 forms was quantified using mant fluorescence as  above.
Results are shown in Fig. 5, and averages of Kd values  obtained in several independent experiments are summarized  in Table I. Representative mutations in both the effector region  and the insert region were investigated.
While native Rac1  bound tightly to p67phox, mutations in the effector region weakened the binding.
In particular, the mutations at the 33- and  38-positions showed large effects on binding, while those at the  more extreme ends of the effector region (positions 26 and 45)  produced smaller but reproducible effects.
Thus, decreased  binding to p67phox accounts for the decreased ability of effector  region mutants to support superoxide generation.
In contrast,  mutations in the insert region of Rac1 produced large effects on  the EC50 for superoxide generation in the cell-free system but  showed no effect on the Kd for Rac1 binding to p67phox.
Thus,  Rac1 does not appear to utilize its insert region to bind to  p67phox.
  Finally, an additional region on Rac C-terminal to residue  143 for interaction with p67phox has been postulated, based on  the inability of a Rac143Rho chimera (N-terminal 143 residues  from Rac1, with the rest from RhoA) to bind to p67phox using  overlay blotting methods (60).
Using this chimera, we confirmed that the chimera was inactive in supporting superoxide  generation and that it failed to bind significantly to p67phox  (Table I).
  DISCUSSION  Binding of Rac1 to p67phoxDirect demonstration of a stoichiometric complex between Rac1 and p67phox has proven to be  difficult, presumably due to the kinetic and or thermodynamic  lability of the complex.
We previously attempted to demonstrate interaction using gel filtration but were unable to detect  a stable complex.3 Binding of Rac isoforms to p67phox has been  demonstrated using p67phox (or a p67phox-GST fusion protein)  immobilized on glutathione beads (46) or on a nitrocellulose  filter (48, 60) and also by yeast two-hybrid analysis (49).
However, a large excess of Rac was used in the first two cases, and  the percentage of binding was low compared with that predicted for a 1:1 complex.
Using both methods, effector region  3 D. J. Uhlinger and J. D. Lambeth, unpublished data.
  FIG. 5.
Comparison of binding of Rac1, Rac2, and Rac1 point mutants to p67phox.
Titrations were carried out as in Fig. 4.
The  concentration of Rac or Rac mutants in various experiments shown ranged from 0.25 to 0.6 mM, and the corresponding concentration of  mant-GppNHp was 70% of the Rac concentration.
The Rac form used is indicated in each panel.
The lines shown are derived from theoretical fits  of the data, as described under Experimental Procedures. The arrowheads on the y axes indicate the maximal fluorescence change, which was  obtained either by extrapolation according to Equation 1 (top panels and lower right panel) or in a parallel titration using Rac1 (remaining panels)
  in cases where an accurate DFmax could not be obtained by extrapolation.
Kd values obtained in these and other titrations are shown in Table I.  Rac-p67phox 18838 Complex   at HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY on March 6, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from mutations disrupted the interactions, suggesting that the Racp67phox binding is relevant to regulation of the NADPH oxidase.
While informative, neither of these methods is quantitative, and neither can be used to obtain direct measures of  binding affinity or stoichiometry.
In the present studies, a  fluorescent derivative of GTP has proven to be effective for this  purpose.
The mant is bound through the 39-hydroxyl group of  the ribose ring.
O39 is exposed to solvent, making only a weak  hydrogen bond with E31 (50).
The mant-GppNHp should bind  to Rac1 without altering the basic interactions between the  nucleotide and the protein, thus serving as a good reporter for  binding.
The quantum yields of mant guanine nucleotides  shows high sensitivity to solvent polarity and to small changes  in protein environment (51), and mant-modified nucleotides  have been used to demonstrate both binding of nucleotides to  their binding proteins (47, 63, 64) and the interaction of the  guanine nucleotide-protein complex with a second protein (58).
  In the latter study, the complex between RhoGDI and Cdc42Hs  has been demonstrated, based on quenching of the fluorescence  of the Cdc42Hs(mant-GDP) complex upon interaction with  RhoGDI.
  A requirement for the use of this method is that the fluorescent group must bind tightly to one of the interacting proteins  and that it should induce an active conformation of the protein.
  The complex between mant-GppNHp and Rac1 was therefore  initially characterized.
As is shown in Fig. 3, complex formation was accompanied by a small increase in the fluorescence of  the mant moiety.
As was shown previously, this fluorescence  change was used to quantify the binding of mant-GppNHp to  Rac1 (47).
In agreement with earlier studies, the complexes  show high affinity, with apparent Kd values ranging from 1 to  20 nM for native and point mutated forms of Rac.
Mutant forms  TABLE II  Summary of effects of point mutations on binding of Rac to p67phox  Since numbers reported for activities in various studies are not directly comparable and since overlay blots could not be quantified in  published studies, relative ability to activate is indicated by 1, and  binding to p67phox is indicated as either normal or weak.

Structural considerations for effector and insert region  mutations.
A, ribbon diagram indication of mutations in Rac1 affecting cell-free NADPH oxidase activity (taken from Table I).
Residues the  mutation of which affects activity are indicated, with effector region  mutations in brown and insert region mutations in green.
Representative mutations were tested for their ability to bind to p67phox.
Mutations  that weaken the binding of p67phox to Rac (present studies) are indicated by a star, while mutations that failed to affect binding to p67phox  are indicated by a filled circle.
Residues that are not indicated by either  symbol were not investigated in the present studies in the binding  assay.
B, the structure has been rotated approximately 90 degrees  counterclockwise around a vertical axis compared with A. The CPK  diagram shows effector loop residues in brown (residues 2640) and  insert region residues (124135) in green.
Residue 45 was omitted in  this representation because of its relatively small effect on binding to  p67phox.
Residue 181 (the last C terminus residue that can be seen in the  x-ray structure) is also indicated as C-Terminus.
The GppNHp is shown  in violet, with the phosphate-containing region shown in a lighter  shade.
  Rac-p67phox Complex 18839   at HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY on March 6, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from of Rac showing elevated Kd values for guanine nucleotide binding (including Rac1(A59T) and Rac1(T75K)) were eliminated  from consideration in this study.
The mant-GppNHp generates  an active conformation of Rac1, albeit somewhat less active  than that produced by GTPgS. We presume that the binding  affinities generally reflect those that occur in the active complex with nonfluorescent nucleotide, but it is possible that  these are perturbed in subtle ways due to the presence of the  fluorescent group.
  Using the fluorescence method we find that Rac(mantGppNHp) binds to p67phox with a Kd of 110 nM. While this is a  moderately high affinity, it is considerably weaker than the  binding of many signaling complexes, perhaps accounting for  the instability of this complex to gel filtration chromatography  and the low stoichiometry of binding found using other methods.
The EC50 for Rac1 in activating superoxide generation is  #60 nM (the actual EC50 is probably less, since this represents  an upper limit value; see Ref. 47).
The most likely explanation  for the lower value for the EC50 is that other binding interactions in addition to p67phox participate in Rac binding within  the NADPH oxidase complex.
  Structural Considerations and Rationale for the Effects of  Point Mutations on Binding and ActivityTable II lists most of  the point mutations that have been characterized either in our  own laboratory or in those of other labs and depicts effects on  activity and on binding to p67phox.
Because the methodologies  used and the expression of data are not directly comparable,  the relative activity is indicated by addition symbols (1), with  1111 representing normal activity, and binding is summarized as either normal or weak.
 Inspection of Table II reveals two regions, the effector region and the insert region, that  have large effects on activity and reveals additional regions  (e.g. residues in the range of residues 61105) that have small  or no effects.
The effector region has been studied extensively  by several groups, and a large number of mutations have been  made.
Except for conservative replacements (e.g. Rac1(I33V)),  most changes in this region have large effects on the ability of  Rac1 and Rac2 to activate cell-free superoxide generation.
The  structure of Rac1-GppNHp was recently determined by x-ray  crystallography (50) and is shown in Fig. 6A, with the guanine  nucleotide indicated in violet.
The overall fold of the protein is  very similar to that of Ras except for two regions.
The insert  region, which forms a well defined, exposed, helical domain,  and residues 2838, which are very flexible and are less defined in the x-ray structure (see Ref.
50 for a discussion of these  two regions).
Effector region mutations summarized in Table II  are indicated in maroon, and insert region mutations are in  green.
As shown in Fig. 6B, the effector region and the insert  region represent distinct regions on Rac1.
Each can be envisioned as forming a surface for interaction of partner proteins  within the NADPH oxidase complex.
Except for position 45,  which is slightly more distant, all of the effector region mutations cluster closely to form a single surface.
Other possible  exceptions within the effector region may include threonine 35,  which coordinates the magnesium, which is involved in guanine nucleotide binding (50).
Other residues within this region  are exposed on the surface as part of the effector loop, and  mutations of these residues are unlikely to produce a long  range effect on the structure of Rac1.
Representative mutations  (indicated by stars in Fig. 6A) within this region were investigated for their effects on binding to p67phox.
These mutations  resulted in effects, some quite large, on binding to p67phox.
All  effector region mutations also affected the EC50 for Rac1 in the  cell-free assay.
Quantitatively, the magnitude of the effects on  binding paralleled the effects on the EC50 for mutations at  residues 33 and 38, but the effects on binding were smaller  than the effects on EC50 for mutations at positions 26 and 45.
  This may indicate that the presence of other protein component  within the NADPH oxidase complex perturbs the binding of  Rac1 to p67phox, particularly at the periphery of the effector  region, or that the different assay conditions perturbed the  binding energies.
The fact that all of the mutations produced  effects on both activity and binding argues strongly that the  effector region is utilized within the NADPH oxidase complex  for binding to p67phox.
  4  In contrast to the effector region, representative activityaffecting mutations in the insert region (K132E and L134R in  Fig. 6A) had no effect on the binding to p67phox.
These residues are largely exposed on the surface of the insert region,  and mutations are unlikely to produce structural perturbations outside of the effector region.
In addition, the mutated  residues do not directly contact the guanine nucleotide, consistent with a lack of effect on guanine nucleotide binding or  hydrolysis.
Thus, the most likely explanation for the effects of  insert region mutations on the EC50 for Rac1 is that these  residues participate in binding to another component within  the NADPH oxidase complex.
We have previously shown that  the association of the polybasic C terminus of (nonisoprenylated) Rac1 with the membrane is essential for optimal activity and that this does not occur with nonisoprenylated  Rac2 (41).
The insert region lies at the opposite pole from the  C terminus (Fig. 6B), making unlikely that both regions  interact with the membrane.
Thus, the data are most consistent with the insert region interacting with a distinct  protein component of the NADPH oxidase rather than with  the membrane.
Since insert region mutations reduce relative  activity regardless of whether p47phox is present (data not  shown), we speculate that the insert region binds directly to  cytochrome b558.
We propose a model in which a minimum of  three interaction regions on Rac are important for reconstituting cell-free NADPH oxidase activity.
The C terminus  anchors the Rac to the membrane, while the effector region  and the insert region bind, respectively, to p67phox and to  another component of the oxidase, possibly cytochrome b558.

Chem. 271, 2257822582  4 It is not clear from the Rac structure whether the poor binding of  p67phox by the Rac143Rho chimera reflects an additional binding surface  for p67phox within the 143175 range.
A peptide within this range  centered around 163169 is inhibitory (65), but its mechanism of inhibition has not been reported.
In addition, this region contains relatively  buried a-helix, and it is difficult to envision this helix acting as a  binding surface.
Much of the 143175 range also is buried and provides  a structural foundation for part of the effector loop.
This region differs  in 20 of 33 residues between Rac1 and RhoA, and it seems possible that  such changes may perturb binding indirectly via effects on the Rac  effector loop.
Thus, while it is conceivable that this region contains an  additional binding site, an indirect effect cannot be ruled out.
