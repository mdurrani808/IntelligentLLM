Molecular Recognition in the HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin  A Complex  Sanghee Yoo1  , David G. Myszka2  , Chin-yah Yeh1  , Maureen McMurray1  Christopher P. Hill1 and Wesley I. Sundquist  1  *  1  Departments of Biochemistry  2  Oncological Sciences  University of Utah, Salt Lake  City, UT 84132, USA  The HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) makes an essential interaction with the  human peptidyl prolyl isomerase, cyclophilin A (CypA), that results in  packaging of CypA into the virion at a CA to CypA stoichiometry of  10:1.
The 231 amino acid residue capsid protein is composed of an  amino-terminal CypA binding domain (1 to 151; CA151) and a carboxylterminal dimerization domain (151 to 231).
We nd that CypA binds  dimeric CA and monomeric CA151 with identical intrinsic afnities  (Kd  16(4) mM).
This result demonstrates that capsid dimerization and  cyclophilin A binding are not thermodynamically coupled and suggests  that the substoichiometric ratio of CypA in the HIV-1 virion results from  the intrinsic stability of the CA/CypA complex.
In the known co-crystal  structure of the CA151/CypA complex, CypA binding is mediated exclusively by an exposed capsid loop that spans residues Pro85 to Pro93.
The  energetic contributions to CypA binding were quantied for each residue  in this loop, and the results demonstrate that the Gly89-Pro90 dipeptide  is the primary cyclophilin A recognition motif, with Pro85, Val86, His87,  Ala88, and Pro93 also making energetically favorable contacts.
These studies reveal that the active site of CypA, which can catalyze the isomerization of proline residues in vitro, also functions as a sequence-specic,  protein-binding motif in HIV-1 replication.

It is now known that at  least one of these essential packaged factors is a  cellular protein, the abundant cytoplasmic proline isomerase, cyclophilin A (CypA: Luban et al.,  1993; Franke et al., 1994b; Thali et al., 1994).
  CypA binds to the central ``capsid'' domain of  Gag and is thereby packaged at a virion stoichiometry of 2000 CA:  200 CypA (Franke  et al., 1994b; Thali et al., 1994; Franke & Luban,  1995; Ott et al., 1995).
As the immature virion  buds, the 55 kDa Gag polyprotein (residues 1 to  499) is cleaved by the viral protease to produce  three new proteins, matrix (MA, residues 1 to  132), capsid (CA, 133 to 363) and nucleocapsid  (NC, 378 to 432), as well as three smaller polypeptides (p6, p2 and p1: Di Marzo Veronese  et al., 1988; Henderson et al., 1992).
Following  cleavage, the capsid protein rearranges into the  characteristic cone-shaped core structure that  surrounds the RNA genome at the center of the  virion.
CypA then appears to exert its essential  function on capsid immediately following the  infection of a new cell, possibly helping to disassemble the capsid core structure (Braaten et al.,  1996a,c; Gamble et al., 1996).
  Cyclophilin A is the founding member of what  is now a large family of proteins that are ubiquitous in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes  (Handschumacher et al., 1984; Fischer et al., 1989;  Takahashi et al., 1989; Schreiber & Crabtree, 1992;  sundquist@medschool.med.utah.edu  Abbreviations used: CA, MA and NC HIV-1 capsid,  matrix and nucleocapsid proteins; Cyp, cyclophilin; Rh,  rhodopsin; ITC, isothermal titration microcalorimetry;  SPR, surface plasmon resonance; GST, glutathione-Stransferase; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; EDC, N-ethylN0  -(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; RU, response  units.

CypA is an abundant cytoplasmic protein, but other cyclophilin family members exhibit  tissue-specic and organelle-specic expression  patterns, and function as subdomains of larger proteins.
Various cyclophilin family members have  been reported to play roles in such diverse and important cellular functions as the heat-shock response (Sykes et al., 1993), cell-surface recognition  (Anderson et al., 1993; Friedman et al., 1993), protein folding and trafcking (Colley et al., 1991;  Lodish & Kong, 1991;
Helekar et al., 1994; Ferreira  et al., 1996), lactate metabolism (Davis et al., 1992),  and various intracellular signaling pathways (Xu  et al., 1992; Ratajczak et al., 1993; Bram & Crabtree,  1994; Cardenas et al., 1994; Chang & Lindquist,  1994; Duina et al., 1996; Freeman et al., 1996;  Weisman et al., 1996).
  Despite extensive study, it is not yet clear precisely what cyclophilins do in the cell.
The broad  spectrum of biological pathways in which they  appear suggests a role for cyclophilins in protein  folding and, indeed, two distinct roles for cyclophilins in the folding process have been proposed.
  First, the rotamase activity of cyclophilins may  allow them to play a general role in accelerating  protein folding.
Proline isomerization is the ratelimiting step for the folding of many proteins  in vitro (e.g. see Brandts et al., 1975; Schmid &  Baldwin, 1978; Jackson & Ferscht, 1991; Schmid,  1993) and CypA accelerates the overall folding  rates of a number of such proteins (reviewed by  Schmid, 1993).
A second role for cyclophilins in  protein folding is suggested by the fact that CypA  can act as a molecular chaperone in vitro, increasing the yield of correctly folded protein by suppressing off-pathway folding reactions and  preventing the aggregation of proteins in their unfolded states (Freskgard et al., 1992; Lilie et al.,  1993; Freeman et al., 1996).
Intriguingly, this chaperone activity appears independent of the enzyme's rotamase activity.
Although the rotamase and  chaperone activities of cyclophilins have been well  documented in vitro, the roles of these two activities in vivo are not fully understood.
  A second major unanswered question in cyclophilin biology is whether or not cyclophilins typically bind specically to their target proteins.
On  the one hand, if cyclophilins normally function as  general prolyl isomerases, they might be expected  to exhibit little sequence specicity.
This model is  consistent with the reported lack of CypA substrate discrimination across a series of different  proline-containing model peptide sequences  (Harrison & Stein, 1990).
However, at least a subset  of cyclophilins seem to bind specically to target  proteins in order to perform their essential functions.
The best-characterized example of this is  NinaA, a cyclophilin of the Drosophila eye, which  forms a specic complex with rhodopsin 1 (Rh1:  Schneuwly et al., 1989; Shieh et al., 1989; Baker et al.,  1994).
NinaA is essential for translocation of Rh1  from the endoplasmic reticulum, through the  secretory pathway, and into the rhabdomere where  phototransduction occurs (Colley et al., 1991).
  Although the Rh1/NinaA interaction is not understood in detail, loss of function mutations cluster  about the ninaA active site, suggesting that the  active site mediates Rh1 binding (Ondek et al.,  1992).
Other examples in which cyclophilins appear to form specic complexes with their target  proteins include CypB binding to the calcium-signaling protein CAML (Bram & Crabtree, 1994),  and CypC binding to the cell-surface protein  CyCAP (Friedman et al., 1993).
It therefore appears  that sequence-specic protein binding may prove a  recurring theme in cyclophilin function.
  In addition to its importance in HIV-1 replication, the HIV-1 CA/CypA interaction may serve as  a paradigm for understanding how cyclophilins  achieve sequence-specic protein binding.
Like  NinaA, the CypA active site appears to participate  in capsid binding, since CA/CypA complex formation is competitively inhibited by the rotamase  inhibitor cyclosporine and its analogues (Luban  et al., 1993; Franke et al., 1994b; Thali et al., 1994;  Billich et al., 1995).
Moreover, mutation of a single  capsid proline residue, Pro90, abolishes CypA  binding, packaging, and viral replication (Franke  et al., 1994 b).
In principle, however, binding speci-  city in the CA/CypA complex could either be  achieved entirely within the CypA binding site or  through additional protein-protein interactions that  extend beyond the active site.
The latter model is  supported by the report that high-afnity cyclophilin A binding requires dimerization of the target  Gag (or capsid) protein (Colgan et al., 1996).
This  observation suggests either that capsid dimerization creates a high-afnity cyclophilin A binding  surface or that distal CypA-CypA interactions  allow CypA to bind cooperatively to the capsid  dimer.
  Several recent experiments suggest an alternative  model, however, in which the CypA active site itself discriminates between proline residues embedded in different local sequence contexts.
For  example, Luban and co-workers have shown that  HIV-1 CA residue Gly89, as well as Pro90, is essential for CypA binding and viral packaging (Braaten  et al., 1996b).
Similarly, our recent CA151/CypA  co-crystal structure revealed that capsid residues  85 to 93 make a series of favorable contacts in the  CypA active site, with no other signicant CypACA or CypA-CypA interaction (Gamble et al.,  1996).
  In order to determine precisely how cyclophilin  A recognizes the HIV-1 capsid protein, we have  examined various aspects of CA/CypA complex  formation in solution.
These experiments reveal the  thermodynamics and energetic determinants of cyclophilin A binding, and demonstrate that the cyclophilin A active site itself acts as a sequencespecic, protein-binding motif.
  HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 781Results  Recombinant capsid proteins  Primary sequences and labeling schemes for the  HIV-1 capsid and human cyclophilin A proteins  are shown in Figure 1(a) and (b), respectively.
The  crystallographically dened interaction between  cyclophilin A and the amino-terminal domain of  the capsid is shown in Figure 1(c) (Gamble et al.,  1996).
As shown in Figure 2, efcient systems have  been developed for expressing and purifying large  quantities of the full-length HIV-1 capsid protein  (CA; Figure 2(a)), the amino-terminal capsid domain (CA151; Figure 2(b)), and human cyclophilin  A (CypA; Figure 2(c)).
Both capsid proteins are  ideally suited for biophysical and structural studies, since they are highly soluble (>50 mg/ml)  and can be efciently isolated in high yields  (>30 mg/l Escherichia coli culture).
  Self-association of capsid proteins  Several groups have reported that HIV-1 capsid  proteins dimerize in vitro (Ehrlich et al., 1992, 1994;  Rose et al., 1992; Brooks et al., 1994).

  782 HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interactionrecombinant capsid protein (25.6 kDa) is also predominantly dimeric at a concentration of 200 mM  as analyzed by dynamic light-scattering  (Mest  51(2) kDa).
The CA monomer-dimer equilibrium was quantied by analytical ultracentrifugation, yielding an estimated dissociation constant  of 18(1) mM (Figure 3(a)).
This value agrees well  with previous measurements of the capsid Kd,  which ranged between 10 and 30 mM (Rose et al.,  1992; Brooks et al., 1994).
  In order to test the inuence of capsid dimerization on cyclophilin A binding, it was necessary to  create a monomeric capsid protein.
Partial proteolysis and NMR structural studies have indicated  that capsid residues 1 to 151 (CA151) form an independently folded domain that is monomeric at low  millimolar concentrations (Gitti et al., 1996).
This  observation was conrmed by equilibrium sedimentation and dynamic light-scattering analyses of  CA151.
Sedimentation distributions of three different CA151 concentrations were globally t to a  simple monomer model (Figure 3(b)), yielding a  shape-independent estimated particle mass of  16.4(0.3) kDa, in agreement with the calculated  mass of the CA151 monomer (16.7 kDa).
Similarly,  CA151 appeared monomeric as measured by dynamic light-scattering (Mest  18.1(0.1) kDa;  158 mM).
  Calorimetric quantification of the capsid/  cyclophilin A interaction  Isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) was  used to measure dissociation constants for the CA/  CypA and CA151/CypA complexes.
This method  has the advantage of allowing rigorous quanti-  cation of the stoichiometry, energy and enthalpy of  complex formation in solution, but requires multimilligram quantities of pure proteins (Brandts et al.,  1990; Bundle & Sigurskjold, 1994; Fisher & Singh,  1995).
The titration of CA151 into cyclophilin A is  shown in Figure 4(a).
Raw calorimetric data were  corrected by subtraction of the appropriate blank  titrations (negligible), and the integrated binding  isotherm (Figure 4(b)) was successfully t to a  single-site binding model, yielding a CA151 to  CypA binding ratio of 1.13(0.05), Kd  16(4)  mM, and H   9.5(0.6) kcal/mol.
  The analogous titration of cyclophilin A into  full-length capsid protein (CA) is shown in  Figure 4(c).
Raw titration data were again corrected by subtracting the appropriate blank  titrations.
In this case the blank titration of  buffer into capsid resulted in signicant heat absorbance, presumably owing to dissociation of  dimeric CA upon dilution.
Nevertheless, the corrected binding isotherm (Figure 4(d)) again t a  single-site binding model, yielding a CypA to CA  stoichiometry of 1.01(0.04), Kd  16(3) mM, and  H   9.5(0.6) kcal/mol.
These experiments deFigure 3.

  HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 783monstrate that capsid dimerization and CypA  binding are not coupled equilibria, since the  measured stoichiometry, equilibrium binding constants and enthalpies for CypA binding to CA151  and CA are indistinguishable, even though the  CA/CypA titration was performed at an initial  capsid concentration of 59 mM, where >50% of the  CA molecules were dimeric.
  Surface plasmon resonance measurement of  the CA/CypA affinity  The large quantities of pure proteins required for  ITC measurements made this method impractical  for a comprehensive mutational analysis of the  CA/CypA interaction.
Surface plasmon resonance  (SPR) spectroscopic methods were therefore also  used to quantify the interaction.
SPR has distinct  advantages over ITC in speed, sensitivity and  scale, but requires independent validation to ensure that binding equilibria are not altered by surface effects (Jonsson et al., 1991; Malmqvist, 1993;  Morton et al., 1995; O'Shannessy & Winzor, 1996).
  Initial experiments examined the binding of pure,  monomeric CA151 to a pure, immobilized glutathione-S-transferase-CypA fusion protein (GSTCypA).
GST-CypA was captured on the sensor surface by an anti-GST antibody covalently linked to  the carboxymethyl dextran layer (Jonsson et al.,  1991), providing a homogeneous surface of unperturbed CypA binding sites.
CA151 binding was  then quantied by changes in the surface refractive  index.
A correction for refractive index changes  due to bulk solvent and non-specic background  binding was performed simultaneously in a separate ow-cell derivatized with the anti-GST antibody binding to GST alone.
  As shown in Figure 5(a)
, binding responses were  highly reproducible in repeated measurements  across a concentration range of 0 to 57 mM CA151.
  The sensorgrams revealed that equilibrium was  achieved rapidly.
Furthermore, the binding responses returned to baseline levels very quickly  after washing with buffer, indicating that the complex has a very high dissociation rate.
The magnitudes of equilibrium binding responses at different  CA151 concentrations were used to determine the  dissociation constant for CA151/CypA complex by  non-linear least-squares tting to a simple one-toone interaction model.
Equivalent dissociation constants were obtained for measurements made at  two different CypA surface derivatization levels  and the data from the two surfaces were averaged  to give the normalized binding data shown in  Figure 5(c).
The t provides an estimated dissociation constant of 18(2) mM, in good agreement with the CA151/CypA dissociation constant  measured under the same conditions by isothermal  titration microcalorimetry (see Table 1).
  Subsequent experiments measured CypA binding to the intact capsid protein.
In this case, the  GST-CA fusion protein was captured directly from  the soluble fraction of crude E. coli extracts following induction of protein expression.
Capture of  GST-CA directly onto the sensor surface was  highly specic, since non-specic protein binding  in control extracts lacking GST-CA was negligible  (not shown).
CypA dissociation constants were  again obtained by tting binding data (Figure 5(b))  from two different CA surface derivatization levels  to a single-site binding model (Figure 5(c)).
Nine  independent repetitions of this experiment yielded  a mean dissociation constant of 15 mM, with a standard deviation of 5 mM (Table 1).
The excellent  agreement between all of the ITC and SPR  measurements validates the SPR method, and  further supports the conclusion that the carboxylterminal dimerization domain of HIV-1 CA does  not inuence the afnity of CypA binding.

  784 HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A InteractionImportance of other Gag domains for  CypA binding  Since cyclophilin A is initially packaged by the  HIV-1 Gag polyprotein, we considered the possibility that the amino-terminal matrix or the carboxyl-terminal nucleocapsid domains of Gag might  participate in CypA binding.
CypA binding to immobilized GST-MA-CA (Gag residues 1 to 363)  and to GST-CA-NC-p6 (Gag residues 133 to 432)  was therefore examined.
As shown in Table 1,  measured dissociation constants for CypA binding were 12(1) mM (MA-CA) and 14(2) mM (CANC).
In a parallel control experiment, the  measured dissociation constant for the CA/CypA  complex was 12.0(0.4) mM. We therefore conclude  that the CypA binding afnity is not signicantly  affected by Gag residues outside the central capsid  domain.
  Mutational analysis of the cyclophilin A  binding site on HIV-1 CA  The biochemical experiments described above,  together with the CA151/CypA co-crystal structure  (Gamble et al., 1996), indicate that CA/CypA complex formation is mediated entirely by the contiguous capsid loop sequence Pro85 to Pro93 binding  in the active site of cyclophilin A (see Figures 1(c)  and 6(a)).
To determine the relative importance of  individual capsid residues in sequence-specic cyclophilin A binding, each CA binding loop residue  was mutated and the effect of the mutation on  CypA binding energy was measured (Table 2 and  Figure 6(b)).
Mutations were made in the context  of the full-length capsid protein, and afnity binding measurements were performed by SPR spectroscopy as described above.
To keep the  mutagenesis as unbiased as possible, each CA loop  residue was initially mutated to alanine, except for  Ala88 and Ala92, which were mutated to both Gly  and Val.
Additional point mutations were subsequently used to test specic aspects of CypA recognition.
Overall, the mutational analysis revealed  that capsid residues Gly89 and Pro90 are the key  determinants for cyclophilin A recognition, while  the anking residues Pro85, Val86, His87, Ala88,  Ala92 and Pro93 also make favorable contributions  to the afnity of the CA/CypA complex.
As described below in detail, these results are in excellent agreement with the CA151/CypA co-crystal  structure.
  The CA151/CypA co-crystal structure indicated  that CA Pro90 should be a major determinant of  CypA binding, because the proline ring is buried  in a deep hydrophobic pocket formed by CypA residues Phe60, Met61, Phe113 and Leu122.
Analogous binding of proline residues has been  observed in a number of cyclophilin A peptide  complexes (Kallen & Walkinshaw, 1992; Ke et al.,  1993; Zhao & Ke, 1996a,b).
Detailed examination of  the structure suggested that an Ala90 side-chain  could be accommodated in the CypA binding  pocket, albeit with the loss of favorable binding  interactions at the Pro90 Cg and Cd positions,  whereas any larger side-chain should clash with  the sides of the proline binding pocket.
For  example, a b-branched side-chain at CA residue 90  is predicted to clash with the CypA Leu122 sidechain.
Consistent with this analysis, mutation of  CA Pro90 to Ala reduced the CypA binding af-  nity by 2.1 kcal/mol, while mutation of Pro90 to  Val resulted in immeasurably low (>3 kcal/mol reduced) CypA binding afnity.
  The mutational analyses further revealed that  CA Gly89 is also a major determinant of CypA recognition, since mutation of Gly89 to Ala or Val reduced the CypA binding by 2.0 and 2.9 kcal/mol,  respectively.
The CA151/CypA co-crystal structure  shows that Gly89 contributes to CypA binding af-  nity in two different ways.
First, Gly89 adopts  phi/psi angles (148/155) that are less favored for  non-glycine residues.
Moreover, the lack of a sidechain at Gly89 allows this residue to t snugly  against the CypA active site, whereas a b-carbon  atom at this position would exhibit steric clash  with CypA Arg55 NZ2 and Gln63 Od1  .
The unusual  torsion angles and tight t of Gly89 in the CypA  active site appear critically important, because they  allow the Gly89-Pro90 peptide bond to adopt an  unprecedented trans conformation.
This is in contrast to all previously characterized model peptide  complexes with CypA, in which the peptide proTable 1.

  The trans-Pro90 conformation, in turn, orients the  preceding capsid residues down into the CypA active site groove, where they make a series of favorable contacts (Figure 6(a)).
The structure therefore  clearly rationalizes why adding steric bulk to the  Gly89 side-chain is energetically unfavorable.
  A third determinant of CypA binding specicity  is His87, which contributes to CypA binding by  forming a van der Waals interaction (CA His87 Ce  Figure 6.
Molecular recognition in the capsid/cyclophilin A complex.
(a) Stereoview of HIV-1 capsid protein binding  interactions in the cyclophilin A active site.
The CA loop sequence Pro85 to Pro93 (stick bonds) is shown bound in  the active site groove of CypA (space-lling model).
Color coding is as follows: CA carbon, white; CypA carbon, yellow; oxygen, red; nitrogen, blue; sulfur, green; bound water molecule, pink.
Broken lines represent intermolecular  hydrogen bonds.
(b) Free energy changes in cyclophilin A binding to mutant HIV-1 capsid proteins.
Free energy  changes are shown relative to CypA binding to wild-type CA.
Mutated binding site residues are labeled below and  the specic point mutations are indicated above.
The broken lines above the Pro90 to Val mutation indicate that the  change in free energy of CypA binding is greater than 3.0 kcal/mol for this mutant.
  786 HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interactionto CypA Thr73 Cg  ) and an intermolecular hydrogen bond (CA His87 Nd to CypA Asn71 O) across  the CA/CypA interface.
Mutation of His87 to Ala  removes these interactions and decreases the binding afnity by 0.9 kcal/mol.
The pH-dependence  of the CA/CypA dissociation constant was tested,  since the observed intermolecular hydrogen bonding of His87 Nd suggested that the complex should  be less stable at higher pH. As shown in Table 1,  we nd that the complex stability does exhibit a  measurable pH-dependence and is approximately  twofold more stable at pH 6.5 than at either pH 8.5  or 5.5.  Unlike Pro90 and Gly89, CA His87 is not exceptionally conserved in different HIV-1 strains  (Myers et al., 1995).
Although the majority (77) of  95 collected HIV-1 sequences have His at capsid  position 87, Gln (17) and Arg (1) are also represented at this position (this analysis excludes the  group O viruses, discussed below).
It seemed possible that these rather conservative changes might  retain some of the favorable interactions of His87.
  We found, however, that mutation of His87 to Gln  or Arg diminished CypA binding by 0.9 and  1.2 kcal/mol, respectively.
This observation  suggests that that the virus may not be under  strong selective pressure to maximize CypA packaging levels (although residue 87 may, of course,  perform additional role(s) in HIV-1 replication that  inuence its mutational spectrum).
  The CA151/CypA structure exhibits other van  der Waals interactions between CypA and CA  side-chains that could contribute to binding speci-  city.
For example, the CA Ala88 methyl group  makes van der Waals interactions with CypA  Gln111, Ala101, Asn102 and Ala103.
The CA Ala88  to Gly mutation removes these interactions and decreases the CypA binding afnity by 2.2 kcal/mol.
  In contrast, the favorable van der Waals interactions at the Cb position are presumably maintained in an Ala88 to Val mutation, since this  mutation reduces CypA binding by only 0.6 kcal/  mol.
A similar, but less dramatic effect is seen at  position 92, where the Ala92 methyl group interacts with CypA Phe60 and the CA Ala92 to Gly  and Val mutations reduce CypA binding afnity  by 0.5 and 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively.
Finally, the  energetic contributions of other side-chain positions that make van der Waals interactions with  CypA, Pro85 Cd  , Val86 Cg  , and Pro93 Cg  , were  tested with alanine mutations.
These mutations reduced the CypA binding afnity by 0.6, 0.6 and  0.3 kcal/mol, respectively.
In summary, every  single intermolecular interaction made by a CA  side-chain in the crystal structure of the CA151/  CypA complex was removed by mutagenesis and  found to contribute to CypA binding afnity in  solution.
  Uniquely, mutations at the CA Ile91 residue had  no measurable effect on the energy of CypA binding.
Consistent with this observation, Ile91 is the  only capsid residue in the CypA binding loop  whose side-chain projects directly out of the CypA  active site and makes no intermolecular contact  (see Figure 6(a)).
An initial measurement suggested  that the Ile91 to Ala mutation mutation might actually increase the CypA binding energy slightly, but  this observation proved statistically insignicant  (see Table 2).
Similarly, a CA Ile91 to Val mutation  had no effect on CypA binding.
  Cyclophilin A binding to type O HIV-1  capsid proteins  The group O viruses are apparently unique  amongst HIV-1 strains, in that they package cyclophilin A, but do not require the protein to replicate  (Braaten et al., 1996b).
Moreover, the CypA binding  loop sequences of the group O viruses, while retaining the central GlyPro binding dipeptide sequence, are otherwise signicantly diverged from  the far more prevalent group M viruses.
For  example, the residues surrounding the CypA binding loop in the group O, HIV-1MVP5180 capsid protein (83THPPAMGPLPPGQI96) differs from the  group M consensus sequence (83LHPVHAGPIAPGQM96) at seven different positions, ve of  which occur within the CypA binding loop itself.
It  was therefore of interest to quantify how tightly  CypA binds to the HIV-1MVP5180 loop sequence.

GST-CA proteins were afnity-puried directly  from soluble expression extracts onto anti-GST mAb-derivatized sensor chips.
Binding experiments were subsequently performed with pure CypA in the mobile phase.
a Fold decrease is the decrease in CypA binding afnity relative to a control wild-type GST-CA/CypA binding experiment(s) performed in parallel.
Kd measurements for nine  independent control reactions varied over a range of  15(5) mM. b Numbers in parentheses represent estimated errors of one  standard deviation in the nal digit(s) and were derived from  the ts of a single binding experiment.
c Binding of CypA to the immobilized GST-CA P90V mutant  was too low to quantify accurately.
d Kd for three independent measurements with error given at  one standard deviation.
  HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 787This was done by creating and expressing a  chimeric GST-CA protein that contained the  HIV-1MVP5180 binding loop sequence in the context  of an otherwise wild-type GST-CANL4-3 capsid  protein.
The chimeric capsid protein was immobilized and cyclophilin A binding was quantied by  SPR spectroscopy as described above.
  Although CypA bound somewhat less tightly to  the chimeric capsid protein (Kd  42(1) mM,  Table 2) as compared to the wild-type CANL4-3 protein, the increase in dissociation constant was modest (2.5-fold).
This result demonstrates that  although sequences surrounding the central GlyPro sequence can and do modulate CypA binding,  the cyclophilin A active site can tolerate signicant  sequence variability without dramatic loss of binding afnity.
Indeed, it is even possible that while  some of the changes in the HIV-1MVP5180 binding  loop sequence presumably reduce CypA binding  afnity (e.g. His87 in HIV-1NL4-3 to Ala87 in HIV1MVP5180 capsid), other changes in the loop sequence may compensate by actually increasing the  binding energy.
  Discussion  Capsid dimerization  Equilibrium sedimentation analyses demonstrate  that the carboxyl-terminal 80 amino acid residues  of the HIV-1 capsid protein (residues 152 to 231)  are essential for full afnity dimerization.
Together  with previous proteolytic mapping and NMR studies (Gitti et al., 1996), these experiments demonstrate that the HIV-1 capsid protein is composed of  two domains, an amino-terminal core domain that  binds cyclophilin A, and a carboxyl-terminal assembly domain that mediates the highest afnity  capsid-capsid interaction.
Division of capsid into  two distinct functional domains is supported by  genetic studies that reveal that deleterious mutations in the carboxyl-terminal third of the protein  generally prevent Gag assembly and particle release (Jowett et al., 1992; Hong & Boulanger, 1993;  von Poblotzki et al., 1993; Chazal et al., 1994;  Dorfman et al., 1994; Franke et al., 1994a;  Mammano et al., 1994; Zhao et al., 1994; Carriere  et al., 1995; Reicin et al., 1995; Srinivasakumar et al.,  1995; Zhang et al., 1996).
In contrast, deleterious  mutations in the amino-terminal two-thirds of capsid typically give rise to assembled, but non-infectious virions that frequently fail to form the mature  capsid core structure (Wang & Barklis, 1993;  Dorfman et al., 1994; Reicin et al., 1995).
  Two different co-crystal structures of HIV-1 capsid proteins bound to other proteins have recently  been reported (Gamble et al., 1996; Momany et al.,  1996).
In the structure of CA151 bound to CypA  (Gamble et al., 1996), the capsid fragment is missing residues 152 to 231 and therefore cannot reconstitute the entire dimer interface formed by the  intact capsid protein.
Consistent with this model,  we have recently crystallized and determined the  structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of capsid  (CA151-231; unpublished results).
As expected,  CA151-231 forms a dimer.
  The crystal structure of full-length HIV-1 CA in  complex with an anti-CA Fab fragment has been  reported (Momany et al., 1996).
In this structure,  the carboxyl-terminal domains of adjacent CA molecules are distant from one another and lack de-  ned electron density.
We therefore conclude that  antibody binding has disrupted the high-afnity  CA-CA interface formed between the carboxylterminal domains, and that this crystal lattice is  dominated by Fab packing interactions.
This interpretation is consistent with the fact that identical  crystalline lattices form in both the presence and  absence of the capsid protein.
  Viral packaging of cyclophilin A  Our binding measurements have revealed the  stoichiometry and thermodynamics of the cyclophilin A/capsid interaction.
Formation of the CA/  CypA complex is enthalpically driven, with a dissociation constant, Kd, of 16 mM. Although cyclophilin A is initially packaged by the intact Gag  polyprotein, fusing the capsid domain to either the  amino-terminal matrix domain or the carboxylterminal NC and p6 domains has no effect on  CypA binding afnity.
The simplest interpretation  of these data is that the capsid domain alone mediates CypA binding (although the experiments do  not formally rule out the possibility that CypA  binding could somehow be modulated by contacts  created in the assembled Gag particle that are not  mimicked in our fusion proteins).
  The micromolar dissociation constant observed  for the CA/CypA complex suggests that simple  mass action may determine the substoichiometric  level of viral CypA packaging.
Given a Kd for the  CA/CypA complex of 16 mM, the 10:1 ratio of  capsid to cyclophilin A in the HIV-1 virion would  be achieved at a free cytoplasmic cyclophilin A  protein concentration of 1.6 mM. Although intracellular levels of cyclophilin A have not been quantied precisely, a micromolar CypA concentration  appears reasonable, since the protein is highly  abundant (Koletsky et al., 1986) and approximately  3 mM concentrations of cyclosporine or its analogues are required to achieve full stoichiometric  inhibition (Franke et al., 1994a; Thali et al., 1994).
  Our experiments demonstrate that capsid dimerization and cyclophilin A binding are thermodynamically independent.
This conclusion contradicts a  recent report that Gag (or capsid) dimerization is  required for CypA binding (Colgan et al., 1996).
A  possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the  previous investigations examined capsid binding  to immobilized GST-CypA. In this conguration,  dimerization of Gag (or capsid) molecules would  increase the apparent cyclophilin binding afnity if  the capsid dimers bound bivalently to immobilized  CypA (the chelate effect).
In contrast, our microcalorimetry experiments were performed in solution  788 HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interactionand are therefore not subject to the chelate effect.
  Importantly, our experiments are likely to reect  the biological situation in which soluble, monomeric CypA molecules bind to the assembling Gag  molecules.
  The observation that CA dimerization and cyclophilin A binding are independent agrees well with  the CA151/CypA co-crystal structure.
CypA binds  CA151 30 A away from the C-terminal dimerization domain and it is therefore difcult to rationalize how cyclophilin A binding could directly affect  formation of the primary capsid dimer interface.
  Moreover, there is no signicant CypA-CypA  interaction in the co-crystal structure that would  account for cooperative binding of CypA to the  CA dimer.
(Gamble et al., 1996).
Taken together, all  of these data indicate that cyclophilin A packaging  is mediated entirely by contacts between the CypA  active site and the exposed capsid loop sequence  spanning residues Pro85 to Pro93.
  Molecular recognition in the CA/CypA complex  Our mutational analyses reveal that the cyclophilin A active site can strongly discriminate between proline residues in different sequence  contexts.
The key to sequence-specic binding in  the CA/CypA complex is the presence of a glycine  residue (Gly89) preceding the target proline residue (Pro90).
Glycine apparently allows the CypA  active site to accommodate the CA Pro90 peptide  bond in a trans conformation, thereby directing the  capsid target sequence to form a series of favorable  interactions along the CypA active site cleft.
Hence  it appears that the Gly-Pro dipeptide, rather than  proline alone, forms the fundamental recognition  site for cyclophilin A. The importance of this recognition motif for HIV-1 replication has been demonstrated by Luban and co-workers, who have  shown that mutation of either Gly89 or Pro90 to  Ala blocks both cyclophilin A packaging and viral  replication (Franke et al., 1994b; Braaten et al.,  1996a).
Our mutational analyses demonstrate that  sequences anking the Gly-Pro binding motif can  also contribute signicantly to CypA recognition.
  For example, we nd that the CA Ala88 to Gly  mutation decreases the CypA binding afnity  more than 44-fold, and might also be expected to  inhibit viral packaging of cyclophilin A and block  HIV-1 replication.
  Cyclophilin A and HIV-1 replication  Although the precise role of cyclophilin A in  HIV-1 replication remains uncertain, the protein  appears to perform its essential function early in  the viral life-cycle (Steinkasserer et al., 1995;  Braaten et al., 1996a).
Luban and co-workers have  reported that CypA-decient virions assemble, mature and fuse with their target cells normally, but  that the virus fails to initiate reverse transcription  (Braaten et al., 1996a).
This does not seem to reect  a direct effect of CypA on reverse transcriptase,  since the endogenous reverse transcription activity  in detergent-permeabilized, CypA-decient virions  is normal (Braaten et al., 1996a).
Instead, genetic  analyses indicate that the capsid is both the CypA  binding partner and the functional target of CypA  (Aberham et al., 1996; Braaten et al., 1996a;  Dorfman & Gottlinger, 1996).
These observations  lead to the hypothesis that cyclophilin A may act  to facilitate rearrangement or uncoating of the capsid core structure upon infection.
  Although cyclophilin A binding does not affect  formation of the highest afnity CA dimer interface, CypA could still affect higher order capsid assembly or disassembly by altering one of the other,  lower afnity CA-CA interfaces involving the  amino-terminal capsid domain.
In the CA151/  CypA co-crystal structure, CA151 molecules associate via two distinct interfaces to form long planar  strips.
We envision that the surface of the viral capsid core could assemble by side to side packing of  these capsid strips.
In the crystal, close packing of  the capsid strips is prevented by stoichiometric  binding of cyclophilin A molecules along the outer  edges of the strips.
In the virion, however, the substoichiometric levels of CypA could simply serve  to destabilize the cooperative interactions between  associated capsid strips.
Thus, we hypothesize that  the function of cyclophilin A in HIV-1 replication  may be to weaken the capsid core and thereby promote its dissociation upon infection.
  Other cyclophilins  Our studies demonstrate that the CypA active  site binds specically to the HIV-1 capsid protein,  providing the rst well-characterized biological  function for a cyclophilin active site.
This observation again raises the possibility, rst suggested  by Schreiber & Crabtree (1992), that proline isomerization may not be the primary function of cyclophilins in vivo.
As has been pointed out by  Harrison & Stein (1990), the modest kc/KM for cyclophilin A binding to small model peptides  suggests that rate enhancements for non-specic  proline isomerization will be quite modest at  physiological CypA concentrations.
Instead, it appears that other cyclophilins may function in analogy to the model that we propose for CypA in  HIV-1, i.e. by binding target proteins with some  level of sequence discrimination and functioning  by modulating or preventing protein-protein interactions.
This model does not, of course rule out the  possibility that proline isomerase activity may also  be important in vivo.
  Since the cyclophilin active site is largely conserved in eukaryotic cyclophilins (Stamnes et al.,  1992), we speculate that Gly-Pro dipeptides will  form the basic recognition motif for other cyclophilins.
We envisage that different cyclophilins may  discriminate between their target proteins by makHIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 789ing complementary interactions with sequences  anking the Gly-Pro recognition element.
The GlyPro motif forms a convenient binding ``handle'',  since this particular dipeptide is very likely to reside in an exposed loop in a folded target protein.
  Indeed, since Gly-Pro sequences are likely to end  up in exposed loops and not in integral secondary  structures, it even seems possible that some cyclophilins may act as chaperones by transiently associating with the Gly-Pro sequences of folding  proteins and promoting their intramolecular folding by shielding one face of the unfolded protein  against intermolecular aggregation.
  In summary, we have demonstrated that the cyclophilin A active site mediates sequence-specic  binding of the HIV-1 capsid protein, recognizing  an exposed capsid loop sequence that spans residues Pro85 to Pro93.
The capsid dipeptide, Gly89-  Pro90, forms the core recognition motif, with adjacent residues making a series of additional energetically signicant interactions along the CypA  active site groove.
We speculate that the HIV-1  CA/CypA interaction may serve as a paradigm for  sequence-specic protein recognition within the cyclophilin family, with Gly-Pro forming a general  cyclophilin recognition motif.
  Materials and Methods  HIV-1 capsid protein expression and purification  Procedures used to express and purify the intact (CA)  and truncated (CA151) capsid proteins were similar and  are therefore described in detail only for the full-length  protein.
The HIV-1NL4-3 capsid gene was amplied from  proviral pNL4-3 DNA (Adachi et al., 1986; Myers et al.,  1995) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
PCR  primers were designed to introduce NdeI and BamHI  cloning sites, a stop codon, and optimized E. coli codons  for the rst three amino acid residues (Sambrook et al.,  1989).
The amplied gene was subcloned into the phage  T7 RNA polymerase-based expression vector, pET3a  (Studier et al., 1990) and the resulting plasmid (WISP93-  73) was conrmed by DNA sequencing.
The expression  vector for the truncated CA151 protein (WISP95-69) was  constructed by introducing oligonuclotides encoding a  stop codon immediately following CA amino acid codon  151 and subcloning the coding region into pET11a.
  Protein expression levels and fully puried samples of  the HIV-1 capsid and CA151 proteins are shown in  Figure 2(a) and (b), respectively.
BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells  harboring the expression plasmids were grown in LB  medium and capsid protein expression was induced late  in log-phase growth (A600 0.8; lane 1) by the addition  of isoproyl-b,D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a nal  concentration of 0.4 mM (1 mM for the pET11a expression constructs).
Soluble capsid protein accumulated  to very high levels during the four hour incubation  period (Figure 2(a), lane 2).
All steps in the protein puri-  cation were performed at 4C. The cells were lysed in a  French press and the supernatant sonicated to reduce  viscosity.
Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 g for one hour and the CA protein was  concentrated by precipitation from 20% saturated ammonium sulfate.
CA was redissolved in a buffer of  25 mM KMops (pH 6.9)/5 mM b-mercaptoethanol and  puried by cation-exchange chromatography on SSepharose (Pharmacia).
The protein eluted at 300 mM  NaCl during a 250 ml 0 to 1 M linear salt gradient.
This  procedure typically yielded >30 mg of pure capsid protein per liter of E. coli culture.
The recombinant protein  was characterized by N-terminal amino acid sequencing  (NH3-P-I-V), amino acid analysis, and electrospray mass  spectrometry (Mcalc25,603 g/mol, Mobs25,602(2) g/  mol).
A non-native N-terminal methionine residue was  quantitatively (>97%) removed during protein expression and the primary sequence of the puried recombinant protein was therefore identical with the  authentic HIV-1 capsid protein.
The protein exhibits a  single major isoform in isoelectric focusing experiments  (pI  7.05).
CA151 was also processed during expression  to produce a native N terminus, as analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry  (Mcalc  16,701 g/mol, Mobs  16,700(4) g/mol).
  DNA encoding HIV-1NL4-3 CA (encoding Gag residues 133 to 363), MA-CA (1 to 363), and CA-NC (133  to 499) was also subcloned into a pGEX2T (Pharmacia)  vector that was modied to contain an in-frame NdeI  restriction site immediately downstream of the glutathione-S-transferase gene (WISP94-18).
The CA construct was subsequently used as a template for PCRbased or Muta-Gene Phagemid (Biorad) mutagenesis  (Kunkel et al., 1987), to produce the 17 mutant capsid  proteins used to examine the determinants of CypA  binding specicity.
  Human cyclophilin A expression and purification  The human CypA gene was amplied in a PCR from  a HeLa cDNA pool (Stratagene).
The amplied DNA  fragment was subcloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of  pET3a (Studier et al., 1990) to create WISP94-1 (encoding  native CypA) and into the same sites in WISP94-18 to  create WISP94-57 (encoding GST-CypA).
The cloned  human CypA genes were sequenced and corresponded  exactly to the published cDNA sequence of human T-cell  CypA (Haendler et al., 1987).
  The induction and purication of recombinant CypA  is shown in Figure 2(c).
CypA expression was induced  late in log phase (lane 1) and the protein was allowed to  accumulate for four hours (lane 2).
Soluble human CypA  was puried to homogeneity by sequential ammonium  sulfate fractionation, cation-exchange and hydrophobic  chromatographies following a published procedure (Liu  et al., 1990).
The puried protein was isolated in reasonable yields (typically 25 mg/l cells) and was characterized by N-terminal amino acid sequencing (NH3-  (M)VNP), amino acid analysis, and mass spectrometry  (Mcalc  18,013 g/mol; Mobs  18,012(1) g/mol).
Approximately 15% of the protein molecules were missing  their N-terminal methionine residue (M  17,881(1) g/  mol), in good agreement with a previous report (Liu  et al., 1990).
  The GST-CypA fusion protein produced from the expression vector WISP94-57 was puried by glutathione  afnity chromatography on G-Sepharose (Pharmacia).
  The protein eluted at a glutathione concentration of  6 mM from a linear gradient of 0 to 10 mM glutathione  in 100 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).
The protein was  subsequently dialyzed extensively to remove bound glutathione and puried to homogeneity by cation-exchange  chromatography on S-Sepharose (Pharmacia).
The protein eluted at 400 mM NaCl from a linear gradient of 0  790 HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interactionto 1 M NaCl in 250 ml of 25 mM KMops (pH 6.9), 5 mM  b-mercaptoethanol).
  Dynamic light-scattering spectroscopy  Dynamic light-scattering was performed to determine  the oligomeric states of the CA and CA151 proteins using  a Dynapro-801 light-scattering instrument (Protein Solutions Inc.).
Proteins were dissolved in 10 mM potassium  phosphate (pH 6.5), 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol at concentrations of 200 mM CA and 158 mM CA151.
At least eight  measurements were made and averaged for each sample.
  Protein molecular masses were estimated by assuming  globular protein structures and errors are reported as the  standard deviation between the independent measurements.
  Equilibrium sedimentation  Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to quantify  the oligomerization of CA and CA151.
Centrifugation experiments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-A  ultracentrifuge operating at rotor speeds of 20,000 (CA)  or 25,000 (CA151) rpm.
The proteins were centrifuged at  20C in 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 100 mM  NaCl, 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol.
Absorbance proles  were measured at 280 nm and were collected every four  hours until protein distributions had reached equilibrium.
After 24 hours, eight scans along the cell radius  were collected with a step size of 0.003 cm, averaged,  and corrected for background absorbance against a buffer blank.
  Equilibrium distributions were t to the single homogeneous species model or to a monomer-dimer model as  described (McRorie & Voelker, 1993), using the Microcalorigin non-linear least-squares tting algorithm provided within the XL-A data analysis software.
A solvent  density of 1.0052 g ml1 was used and partial specic volume estimates of 0.737 ml g1 (CA) and 0.740 ml g1  (CA151) were derived from the amino acid compositions  of the two proteins (Laue et al., 1992).
  Titration calorimetry  Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed  at 20.0C using a MicroCal Omega titration calorimeter.
  Two different titrations were performed: (1) 632 mM  CA151 was titrated into 59 mM CypA; and (2) 661 mM  CypA was titrated into 59 mM CA.
Each titration consisted of 15 injections of 20 ml, made every ve minutes,  into a reaction cell volume of 1.296 ml.
All proteins were  dissolved in buffered solutions of 100 mM KCl, 25 mM  KPO4 (pH 6.5), 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol.
Reaction heats  were baseline-corrected manually using the Origin TC  software, corrected by subtraction of the appropriate  blank titrations, and integrated.
Thermodynamic parameters for the binding reactions were derived by tting  the corrected binding isotherms to single-site binding  models as described (Wiseman et al., 1989), with stoichiometries (n), enthalpies (H), and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) allowed to oat during nonlinear least-squares ts of the data.
Titrations were performed under conditions where the product of the binding constant and the reservoir macromolecule  concentration (c) was approximately 4, and can therefore  be expected to provide reasonable estimates of the binding equilibria.
  Surface plasmon resonance measurements  SPR measurements were performed on a BIACORE  2000 biosensor, with CM5 research-grade chips, NHS/  EDC coupling reagents, ethanolamine, anti-GST monoclonal antibody and P20 from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden).
The binding assays were performed by capturing  either GST-CypA or GST-CA onto the chip surfaces and  measuring the interaction with either CA151 or CypA in  solution.
A monoclonal antibody against GST (anti-GST)  was immobilized on the sensor surface using a standard  amine coupling procedure (Lofa s & Johnsson, 1990).
The  carboxymethyl dextran surface was activated with a  seven minute injection of a mixture of NHS/EDC (each  at 0.1 M in water).
The antibody was immobilized at the  same level (5000 RU) on different ow-cells by exposing the activated surfaces to a 10 mg/ml sample in  10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) for 300 seconds.
After  the coupling step, the remaining activated groups were  blocked with a seven minute wash of 1 M ethanolamine  (pH 8.2), followed by several ten second washes with  glycine (pH 2.0) to remove non-covalently bound  protein.
  All subsequent binding experiments were performed  in buffer containing 100 mM sodium chloride, 25 mM  potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol,  and 0.005% (v/v) P20 at pH 6.5, unless otherwise indicated. Puried GST-CypA was captured onto anti-GST  surfaces at two different densities by injecting supernatant containing GST-CypA for varying lengths of time  at a ow-rate of 5 ml/minute.
Equal quantities of recombinant GST alone were captured onto control surfaces.
  To perform the kinetic measurements for CA151 binding,  the ow-path was changed to include all four ow-cells  and the ow-rate was increased to 50 ml/minute: 22 ml of  CA151 at concentrations of 57, 19, 6.3 and 2.1 mM along  with a buffer blank were injected over all four ow-cells  in series.
Since the response returned rapidly to baseline,  no regeneration step was required between CA151 injections.
Each binding experiment was repeated two or  three times in random order.
Analogous experiments  were performed at pH 5.5, 7.5 and 8.5.
  Similar binding experiments were performed for the  GST-CA constructs by capturing these proteins onto the  sensor surface and monitoring the interaction with CypA  in solution.
In this case, native and mutant GST-CA proteins were captured directly from crude E. coli supernatants.
To examine CypA binding, 30 ml of CypA  solution was injected at concentrations of 114, 38, 12 and  4.2 mM, along with a buffer blank.
Each CypA injection  was repeated three times in random order over two  different densities of GST-CA.
Control experiments were  performed using a recombinant GST to ensure that  CypA did not interact with this protein or the anti-GST  antibody on the sensor surface.
  To analyze the interactions recorded on the biosensor, the raw response data collected from the individual ow-cells were baseline-corrected by subtracting  the average of the response over 60 seconds prior to  sample injection.
To correct for refractive index  change and non-specic binding, the response collected over a blank surface was subtracted from the  ow-cell containing the GST-fusion protein.
The response at equilibrium, which represents the level of  CA/CypA complex formation, was determined by  averaging the signal obtained over ve to ten seconds  after the start of the injection.
Equilibrium dissociation  constants (Kd) for each interaction were determined  from non-linear least-squares curve tting of the data  HIV-1 Capsid/Cyclophilin A Interaction 791to a single-site binding model as described in the  BIACORE manual.
