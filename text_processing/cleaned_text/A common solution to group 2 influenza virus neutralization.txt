Only  one human bnAb (CR8020) specifically recognizing group 2 influenza A viruses has been previously characterized that binds to  a highly conserved epitope at the base of the hemagglutinin (HA)  stem and has neutralizing activity against H3, H7, and H10  viruses.
Here, we report a second group 2 bnAb, CR8043, which  was derived from a different germ-line gene encoding a highly  divergent amino acid sequence.
CR8043 has in vitro neutralizing  activity against H3 and H10 viruses and protects mice against  challenge with a lethal dose of H3N2 and H7N7 viruses.
The crystal  structure and EM reconstructions of the CR8043-H3 HA complex  revealed that CR8043 binds to a site similar to the CR8020 epitope  but uses an alternative angle of approach and a distinct set of  interactions.
The identification of another antibody against the  group 2 stem epitope suggests that this conserved site of vulnerability has great potential for design of therapeutics and vaccines.
  antibody recognition | X-ray crystallography | electron microscopy  I  nfluenza viruses are a significant and persistent threat to human health worldwide.
Annual epidemics cause 35 million  cases of severe illness and up to 0.5 million deaths (1), and periodic influenza pandemics have the potential to kill millions (2).
  Inhibitors against the viral surface glycoprotein neuraminidase  are widely used for the treatment of influenza infections, but  their efficacy is being compromised by the emergence of drugresistant viral strains (3).
Vaccination remains the most effective  strategy to prevent influenza virus infection.
However, protective  efficacy is suboptimal in the highest risk groups: infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised (1).
Furthermore, because  immunity after vaccination is typically strain-specific and influenza  viruses evolve rapidly, vaccines must be updated almost annually.
  The antigenic composition of the vaccine is based on a prediction of  strains likely to circulate in the coming year, therefore, mismatches  between vaccine strains and circulating strains occur that can render the vaccine less effective (4).
Consequently, there is an urgent  need for new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions that provide broad protection against influenza.
  Immunity against influenza viruses is largely mediated by  neutralizing antibodies that target the major surface glycoprotein  hemagglutinin (HA) (5, 6).
Identification of antigenic sites on  HA indicates that influenza antibodies are primarily directed  against the immunodominant HA head region (7), which mediates endosomal uptake of the virus into host cells by binding to  sialic acid receptors (8). Because of high mutation rates in the  HA head region and its tolerance for antigenic changes, antibodies that target the HA head are typically only effective  against strains closely related to the strain(s) by which they were  elicited, although several receptor binding site-targeting antibodies with greater breadth have been structurally characterized  (915).
In contrast, antibodies that bind to the membrane-proximal  HA stem region tend to exhibit much broader neutralizing activity and can target strains within entire subtypes and groups  (1625) as well as across influenza types (24).
These stem-directed  antibodies inhibit major structural rearrangements in HA that are  required for the fusion of viral and host endosomal membranes  and thus, prevent the release of viral contents into the cell (8).
The  stem region is less permissive for mutations than the head and  relatively well-conserved across divergent influenza subtypes.
  Anti-stem antibodies are elicited in some, but not all, individuals during influenza infection or vaccination (20, 26) and  Significance  The HA surface glycoprotein on influenza A viruses mediates  viral entry into host cells.
HA is highly variable and classified  into 18 divergent subtypes, which cluster into two major  phylogenetic groups.
Antibody CR8043 has heterosubtypic  neutralizing activity against group 2 viruses, including H3  viruses that currently circulate in humans.
X-ray and EM  structures of CR8043 Fab in complex with H3 HAs reveal that  the antibody targets a conserved epitope on the HA stem.
  Compared with CR8020, the only other structurally characterized group 2 neutralizing antibody, CR8043 binds to HA  with a different approach angle using different contact residues.
The epitopes of both antibodies are very similar, which  suggests that this conserved stem epitope has great potential for design of therapeutics and vaccines.

The majority of the known heterosubtypic  stem binding antibodies neutralize influenza A virus subtypes  belonging to group 1 (1720, 23, 25).
Furthermore, two antibodies  that target a similar epitope in the HA stem, like most heterosubtypic group 1 antibodies, are able to more broadly recognize  both group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses (22) or influenza A and B  viruses (24).
Strikingly, group 2-specific broadly neutralizing Abs  (bnAbs) seem to be rare, because only one has been reported to  date (21).
CR8020 uniquely targets a distinct epitope in the stem  in close proximity to the viral membrane at the HA base and binds  lower down the stem than any other influenza HA antibody (21).
  In the discovery process that led to the isolation of bnAb  CR8020, we recovered additional group 2-specific bnAbs.
Here,  we describe one such bnAb, CR8043, which recognizes a similar  but nonidentical footprint on the HA as CR8020 and approaches  the HA from a different angle.
Furthermore, these two bnAbs  are derived from different germ-line genes and, consequently,  use distinct sets of interactions for HA recognition.
Thus, the  human immune system is able to recognize this highly conserved  epitope in different ways using different germ-line genes.
Hence,  this valuable information can be used for the design of therapeutics and vaccines targeting this site of vulnerability in group 2  influenza A viruses that include the pandemic H3N2 subtype.
  Results  Identification of bnAbs Against Group 2 Influenza A Viruses.
Memory  B cells from donors vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccine  were immortalized to generate stable B-cell receptor-positive,  antibody-producing memory B cells (30).
We enriched for B cells  that bound to recombinant H3 HA and then screened culture  supernatants of reactive clones for binding to recombinant H3  HA by ELISA, which yielded 31 clones that secreted H3 HAreactive antibodies.
Among these H3-positive clones, 11 unique  clones produced antibodies that neutralized A/Wisconsin/67/2005  (H3N2) in an in vitro virus neutralization assay (VNA), and for  all but one, their activity was recapitulated when reformatted to  recombinant IgG1 (SI Appendix, Table S1).
Sequence analysis of  the H3N2 neutralizing mAbs revealed that two pairs of antibodies use identical germ-line genes (CR8020 and CR8041;  CR8021 and CR8038), whereas the others (including CR8043)  use unique VH and VL genes (SI Appendix, Table S1).
Three clones  possessed heterosubtypic neutralizing activity in an in vitro VNA  against H7 and/or H10 subtypes within the group 2 influenza A  viruses.
These antibodies include CR8020 (21) and its somatic  variant CR8041 as well as CR8043.
Interestingly, these three  bnAbs were isolated from the same donor (SI Appendix, Table S1).
  Because CR8020 and CR8041 are somatic variants (SI Appendix,  Fig. S1), we confined additional investigation to CR8043.
  In Vitro and in Vivo Activity of CR8043 Against Group 2 Influenza  Viruses.
To investigate the breadth of CR8043, we tested its  binding to a panel of group 2 HAs.
CR8043 Fab binds with high  affinity to H3 and H10 HA subtypes (mean Kd  7 nM) and  accommodates 50 y of antigenic drift from avian (1963) to  human (19682011) H3N2 viruses, whereas its affinity for other  group 2 subtypes (H4, H7, H14, and H15) is considerably lower  (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2).
Accordingly, CR8043 IgG potently neutralizes H3 and H10 viruses in vitro, whereas it has no in vitro  neutralizing activity against H7 viruses or group 1 H1 viruses that  were included as a control (Fig. 1B).
  Next, we assessed the prophylactic efficacy of CR8043 against  H3N2 and H7N7 viruses using mouse challenge models.
Groups  of mice were challenged with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted  virus 1 d after administration of varying doses of CR8043 IgG.  Administration of 3 mg/kg CR8043 fully protected mice from  death after H3N2 challenge with increased body weight at the  end of the study (Fig. 1C).
Despite the lack of in vitro neutralizing activity against H7 viruses, a dose of 30 mg/kg CR8043  protected all mice against lethal H7N7 challenge, and a dose  of 10 mg/kg was partially protective (Fig. 1D).

  CR8043 Binds a Conserved Epitope in the HA Stem.
To investigate the  structural basis of antibody recognition, the crystal structure of  CR8043 Fab in complex with the H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/1968  (HK68/H3) HA was determined at 4  resolution (SI Appendix,  Table S2).
Initial phases were obtained from the high-resolution  starting models of HK68/H3 HA at 1.90  resolution (10) and  CR8043 Fab, which was determined at 2.65  resolution (SI  Appendix, Table S2).
The asymmetric unit consists of an HA  trimer liganded by three Fabs, which bind near the bottom of the  HA stem (Fig. 3A).
Furthermore, negative stain EM reconstructions of the Fab in complex with HK68/H3 HA at 21   (Fig. 3B) as well as A/Bangkok/1/1979 (H3N2) HA at 23  (SI  Appendix, Fig. S2) also showed that CR8043 binds at the base of  the HA stem.
These findings are consistent with the observation  that CR8043 does not inhibit agglutination of red blood cells by  the viruses that it neutralizes (SI Appendix, Table S3), and that  CR8043 competes with CR8020 for binding to H3 HA but not  with the anti-head mAb CR8057 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
CR8043  targets a highly conserved epitope in the HA stem that consists  of the fusion peptide and the -sheet of HA2 preceding the A  helix (Fig. 3 C and D and SI Appendix, Table S4).
On average,  a total of 1,056 2 is buried at the interface (506 2 on HA and 550  2 on the Fab), where the heavy and light chains contribute to  74% and 26% of the Fab buried surface area, respectively.
Despite the moderate resolution, the main chains for each component were clearly observed and could be traced in the electron  density (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
  CR8043 Binding Specificities and Structural Comparison with CR8020.
  Mutants that escaped from neutralization by CR8043 harbored  mutations at the base of the HA stem (Arg25Met and Gln34Arg  on HA2) near the central region of the epitope (SI Appendix,  Table S5).
These mutations, along with the natural variant  Gln34Thr, severely weaken the interaction (Fig. 2), and hence,  the specific residue at position 34 in HA2 seems to clearly separate binders (Gln34) from nonbinders (Thr34).
Accordingly,  Thr34 is conserved in >98% of strains from the H4, H7, H14,  and H15 subtypes and thus, likely accounts for the reduced efficacy of CR8043 against these subtypes.
In addition, although  the Thr32Arg mutation found in recent H3N2 strains slightly  decreases binding (10-fold) by CR8043 Fab (Fig. 2), these  viruses are still potently neutralized by CR8043 (Fig. 1B).
  Although the binding sites of CR8043 and CR8020 overlap  considerably (Fig. 4A), their sensitivities to epitope mutations  are distinct, supporting the notion that the bnAbs have unique  modes of binding.
For instance, the Arg25Met mutation that  escapes CR8043 has no effect on the in vitro neutralizing activity  of CR8020, whereas the Gln34Arg mutation allows viruses to  escape from both bnAbs (SI Appendix, Table S5).
In addition,  viruses containing the mutations Asp19Asn or Gly33Glu are not  neutralized by CR8020 but are still neutralized by CR8043, albeit  somewhat less potently (SI Appendix, Table S5).
  The differing sensitivity of CR8043 and CR8020 to epitope  mutations can be explained, in part, by a 33 rotation in the  antibody approach angles to the HA surface (Fig. 4B) and may  also be a consequence of a six-residue insertion in light chain  complementarity-determining region 1 (LCDR1) in CR8043,  which is derived from the VK401 germ-line gene (vs. VK320 for  CR8020).
Furthermore, CR8043 and CR8020 are derived from  Fig. 2.

However, some  structural similarities can be observed between CR8043 and  CR8020, such as close overlap and identity of the contact residues of their heavy chain complementarity determining region  1 (HCDR1) loops (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A), as well as overlap of  HCDR3 residues TrpH98 of CR8043 with the hydrophobic  ProH97 and LeuH98 of CR8020 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B).
In addition, LCDR1 TyrL32 of CR8043 has a similar aromatic interaction with the HA as LCDR2 TyrL49 of CR8020 (SI Appendix,  Fig. S5C).
  CR8043 Prevents HA Conformational Changes and HA Maturation.
  Because CR8043 and CR8020 target a similar epitope, we hypothesized that CR8043 has a similar mechanism of action as  CR8020 and stabilizes the pre-fusion HA conformation.
We  analyzed binding of CR8043 to different HA forms and assessed  if CR8043 could prevent the major conformational rearrangements of the fusion machinery that are triggered at low pH.  CR8043 bound to both the uncleaved precursor (HA0) and  mature (HA) forms of the surface-expressed H3 HAs of A/Hong  Kong/1/1968, A/Hong Kong/24/1985, and A/Wisconsin/67/2005  (Fig. 5A).
However, the antibody did not bind to the low pH,  post-fusion conformation (Fig. 5A), indicating that CR8043  recognizes a native pre-fusion epitope and not the rearranged  conformation that arises during the fusion process.
In contrast,  binding of CR8057 to the HA head of the 2005 H3 strain was  only lost after DTT-mediated dissociation of HA1 from HA2  (Fig. 5A).
When CR8043 was bound to mature HA before low  pH treatment, the antibody remained bound after exposure to low  pH (Fig. 5B), indicating that CR8043 inhibits the pH-dependent  HA rearrangements that trigger fusion.
In addition, pre-binding of  CR8043 prevents reduction of the HA and the subsequent dissociation of HA1 from HA2, because CR8057 binding was preserved after DTT treatment (Fig. 5B).
  In addition to inhibiting conformational changes in HA that  are required for membrane fusion, some influenza antibodies can  neutralize infection by preventing cleavage of immature HA0 into  HA1 and HA2 (21, 22) Indeed, CR8043, but not CR8057, prevented proteolytic activation of HA0 (Fig. 5C), thereby blocking  the progression of influenza infection.
  Discussion  The discovery of human bnAbs that recognize nearly invariant  epitopes of influenza A viruses has provided new tools and opportunities for the development of therapies or vaccines.
Although  several heterosubtypic group 1 influenza A anti-stem antibodies  have been characterized (1620, 23, 25) as well as antibodies that  cross the groups 1 and 2 barrier (22, 24), heterosubtypic group 2  antibodies have been less common, and only bnAb CR8020 has  been structurally characterized to date (21).
In this study, we have  Fig. 3.

Surprisingly, the antibodies are  derived from different germ lines [
CR8043 and CR8020 derive  from VH13 and VH118 germ-line genes, respectively, which are  each estimated to be present in 6% of the human antibody repertoire (31)].
However, these antibodies contact similar epitopes  at the base of the HA stem.
Moreover, they both interfere with  virus infectivity by inhibiting HA0 maturation as well as the pHtriggered conformational rearrangements in HA that are required  for membrane fusion.
  CR8043 protects mice against lethal challenge with H3 and  H7 viruses but does not neutralize H7 viruses in vitro.
This  paradoxical effect has also been observed with bnAb CR9114,  which protects mice against lethal challenge with influenza B  viruses, despite a lack of in vitro neutralizing activity against this  genus (24).
Presumably, in both cases, antibody effector functions  mediated by the antibody Fc domain, such as antibody-dependent  cellular cytotoxicity for bnAb FI6 (22) or complement-dependent  cytotoxicity, contribute to protection (32).
  The results presented here show that CR8043 uses a unique  paratope and angle of approach to target a highly conserved  epitope on the stem of group 2 influenza HAs that is overlapping  but not identical to the CR8020 epitope.
A similar trend in HA  recognition by heterosubtypic group 1 bnAbs, which bind to  a highly conserved epitope higher up on the HA stem (18, 19), is  also developing.
Although several of these group 1 bnAbs initially came from the VH169 family, human and mouse antibodies  from other germ-line families also target a similar but not identical  stem epitope (22, 25).
Comparisons of their crystal structures have  identified some similarities in their binding interactions, such as  conservation in aromatic interactions, despite using different CDR  loops and completely different angles of approach (25).
In addition, access to a conserved epitope using different modes of  binding and varied angles of approach is an emerging theme for  glycan-dependent antibody recognition of HIV-1 Env (33) and has  defined a supersite of vulnerability on HIV-1.
This concept is  Fig. 5.

PNAS | January 7, 2014 | vol. 111 | no. 1 | 449  MICROBIOLOGYemulated here for influenza virus, where stem antibodies approach  the epitope in different ways and use distinct interactions but have  functionally similar modes of neutralization, as also observed for  bnAbs to the HA receptor binding site (911, 1315).
  Group 2-specific bnAbs may be therefore more robustly elicited than previously assumed (34), and it remains to be seen if  additional group 2 bnAbs target the same epitope (35).
As such,  these findings stress the importance of the CR8043/CR8020  epitope for neutralization of group 2 influenza A viruses and as  an emerging target to guide the development of broader spectrum influenza therapies and vaccines.
Although the epitopes of  both antibodies are largely overlapping, from the vaccine design  perspective, the CR8043 epitope may be more attractive than the  CR8020 epitope, because it is mostly contained within a linear  stretch of HA2 amino acids 1538. It may be possible to mimic  the optimal conformation for presentation by a protein scaffold,  such as with the recent, successful grafting of the CD4 binding site  from gp120 onto an unrelated protein scaffold (36, 37).
Thus,  CR8043 sheds light on the potential rational design of broader  spectrum influenza vaccines.
  Materials and Methods  Influenza A group 2 neutralizing antibodies were isolated from healthy  donors 7 d after vaccination with a seasonal influenza vaccine.
B-cell receptorpositive memory B cells were immortalized and selected for binding to  recombinant Allophycocyanin-labeled H3 HA.
B-cell supernatants were then  tested for HA binding by ELISA and in vitro neutralizing activity against  H3N2 by VNA.
H3N2-neutralizing antibodies were subsequently reformatted  into human IgG1 and evaluated for binding against H1, H3, and H7 HA by  ELISA and FACS as well as in vitro neutralizing activity against several influenza A viruses by VNA.
Prophylactic efficacy studies of CR8043 in female SPF  129 X1/SvJ or BALB/c mice were performed by i.v.
injecting varying concentrations of CR8043 1 d before intranasal lethal challenge with H3N2 or H7N7  viruses, respectively.
Animals were monitored for survival and weighed  daily.
Recombinant CR8043 Fab and HA were generated in baculovirus for  binding studies and X-ray and EM structural studies.
Kd values were determined by biolayer interferometry using an Octet RED instrument (ForteBio) by immobilizing biotinylated HA on streptavidin biosensors and then  dipping into varying concentrations of CR8043 Fab.
CR8043 Fab was added  to HK68/H3 in a 3.2:1 molar excess to achieve three Fabs per trimer, and the  complex was purified from unbound Fab by gel filtration.
Crystals were  grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion, and crystals were cryoprotected and  flash cooled in liquid nitrogen.
Diffraction data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), and the structures were determined by molecular replacement.
Reconstructions of CR8043-HA complexes  were determined by negative stain EM.
