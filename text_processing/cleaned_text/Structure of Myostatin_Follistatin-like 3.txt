  Results: Follistatin-like 3, a myostatin inhibitor, interacts uniquely with myostatin as compared with other ligands through its  N-terminal domain.
  Conclusion: The N-terminal domains of follistatin-type molecules may be specificity determinants in ligand binding.
  Significance: Follistatin-type molecules form unique, specific interactions with different TGF- family ligands.
  TGF- family ligands are involved in a variety of critical physiological processes.
For instance, the TGF- ligand myostatin is a  staunch negative regulator of muscle growth and a therapeutic target for muscle-wasting disorders.
Therefore, it is important to  understand the molecular mechanisms of TGF- family regulation.
One form of regulation is through inhibition by extracellular  antagonists such as the follistatin (Fst)-type proteins.
Myostatin is  tightly controlled by Fst-like 3 (Fstl3), which is the only Fst-type  molecule that has beenidentifiedin the serum bound tomyostatin.
  Here, we present the crystal structure ofmyostatinin complex with  Fstl3.
The structure reveals that the N-terminal domain (ND) of  Fstl3interacts uniquely withmyostatin as compared with activin A,  because it utilizes different surfaces on the ligand.
This results in  conformational differences in the ND of Fstl3 that alter its position  in the type I receptor-binding site of the ligand.
We also show that  single point mutations in the ND of Fstl3 are detrimental to ligand  binding, whereas corresponding mutations in Fst have little effect.
  Overall, we have shown that the NDs of Fst-type molecules exhibit  distinctive modes of ligand binding, which may affect overall affinity of ligandFst-type protein complexes.
  The follistatin (Fst)-type3 family contains members such as  Fst-like 3 (Fstl3) and Fst, multi-domain proteins that are robust  inhibitors of select TGF- family ligands.
Fstl3 was initially discovered as a molecule involved in leukemia (1), whereas Fst,  including isoforms Fst288 and Fst315, was originally identified  as an inhibitor of follicle-stimulating hormone release (2).
  Proper control of TGF- family ligands by Fst-type molecules is  significant to life, because Fst-deficient mice exhibit a multitude of defects and die within hours of birth (3).
Fstl3 knock-out  in mice is not lethal but leads to a variety of metabolic phenotypes (4).
More recently, Fstl3 expression in cardiac myocytes  has been shown to be necessary for the full development of  cardiac hypertrophy (5).
The severity of the effects of these  Fst-type molecule deletions seems to inversely correlate with  the specificity of the molecule deleted, because Fst is a more  broad antagonist, whereas Fstl3 is narrower in scope and binds  relatively fewer TGF- family ligands (6).
For these reasons, it is  important to resolve the mechanisms of inhibition and elucidate how Fst-type antagonists similarly and differentially regulate ligands.
  The TGF- family of extracellular signaling molecules can  generally be subdivided into three classes: bone morphogenetic  protein (BMP)/growth and differentiation factor, activin/inhibin, and TGF- (7).
These ligands exhibit a common fold  consisting of two monomers coming together in an anti-parallel fashion to form a disulfide-linked dimer with four distinct  surfaces: two convex type II receptor-binding sites on the   sheet or finger region and two concave type I receptor-binding sites composed of the fingertip and major helix or wrist  region (Fig. 1A).
This surface also contains the prehelix loop, a  structural feature important for type I receptor specificity  (812).
Ligands initiate signaling by binding two type I and two  type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors at the  cell surface.
Signaling is controlled in the extracellular space by  a variety of antagonists.
Activin class ligands are tightly regulated by Fst-type molecules and include the structurally related  * This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health  Grant GM084186 (to T. B. T.).

287, NO. 2, pp. 10431053, January 6, 2012  Published in the U.S.A.  JANUARY 6, 2012VOLUME 287NUMBER 2 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 1043   at Harvard Libraries on June 5, 2014 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from activin A and myostatin (40% sequence identity).
Activin A is  important to a variety of physiological processes including  reproduction, metabolism, and immunity (Ref. 13; reviewed in  Ref. 14).
Myostatin, also known as growth and differentiation  factor-8, is a highly conserved, strong inhibitor of muscle  growth (Ref. 15; reviewed in Ref. 16).
As such, it is an attractive  target for the rational development of therapeutics for the  treatment of muscle-wasting diseases (reviewed in Ref. 17),  including muscular dystrophy, sarcopenia, and cachexia (18  20).
One such means of targeting has been through the use of  modified Fst proteins (21, 22).
  Fst-type proteins have distinct domain layouts (Fig. 1B).
Fst  contains an N-terminal domain (ND) followed by three follistatin domains (FSD13), as well as a heparin-binding sequence  located in FSD1 (23).
Here, Fst will refer to the isoform Fst288  unless otherwise noted.
Fstl3 has a similar domain layout but  lacks FSD3 and heparin binding (24).
Comparing Fst and Fstl3,  there is 48% sequence identity between FSD1 and FSD2 and  24% between the ND (25).
Serum availability of Fst-type proteins inversely correlates with strength of heparin binding, and  myostatinFstl3 is the only myostatinFst-type complex that has  been identified in serum (26).
We have previously shown that  binding to myostatin greatly increases the affinity of Fst for  heparin (12), suggesting that once Fst is bound to myostatin, it  may tightly bind to cell surface-bound heparan.
Structural  studies have determined that, to antagonize signaling, two Fsttype molecules surround one ligand, effectively blocking all  four receptor-binding sites (Fig. 1C) (12, 25, 2729).
With Fst,  there are also additional contacts between the ND of one molecule and FSD3 of the other (28).
  Fst-type molecules differentially bind classes of TGF-  ligands; Fst binds well (low nanomolar KD) to the activin class  and moderately to certain BMP class members, whereas Fstl3  binds well to the activin class only (6, 30).
Several studies have  investigated this divergence and the importance of different  domains to ligand binding, sometimes with conflicting results  on which domains are necessary or sufficient for antagonism  (29, 3134).
Although variability in results could be due to assay  limitations and whether experiments were analytical or biological in context, altogether the data demonstrate that the details  of Fst antagonism are complex and likely cannot be pinpointed  exclusively to one domain over another.
Additionally, few of  these studies have been done with myostatin, and to our knowledge, no similar studies have been carried out with Fstl3.
This  reveals the need for more comprehensive biochemical studies  directed by structural data to further probe the molecular  details of these interactions.
These studies are necessary to fully  understand which features are important for both general  ligand inhibition and specificity in ligand antagonism.
More  recently, significant gaps in this knowledge have been filled by  the structural data of multiple ligandFst-type protein complexes (12, 25, 2729).
These data have allowed comparisons of  different complexes to elucidate sources of specificity in binding.
Here, we impart a more complete analysis by presenting the  structure of myostatinFstl3.
  Our study has focused on the importance of the ND to ligand  antagonism and the diversity that occurs at this interface.
The  Fstl3 ND interacts uniquely with myostatin as compared with  activin A, because it utilizes different surfaces on the ligand and  exhibits a tilt in the main binding helix, altering its placement in  the type I receptor-binding site.
Additionally, point mutation to  glutamate or alanine of single hydrophobic residues in the ND  of Fstl3 successfully disrupts ligand binding, whereas corresponding mutations in the Fst ND have little effect.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  ConstructsHuman Fst and Fstl3 were cloned into the  pcDNA3.1/myc-His expression vector (Invitrogen) as  described previously (32, 34) and subsequently used as templates for site-directed mutagenesis to generate point mutants.
  For crystallization, a truncated Fstl3 construct containing residues 10218 was generated.
The Fst signal sequence was  cloned into the pcDNA3.1/myc-His vector encoding Fstl3 (25),  leading to the shortened N-terminal Gly-Val-Cys sequence  identical to Fst.
At the C terminus, FSD2 was followed directly  by the thrombin site and the myc-His sequence, omitting the  acidic 19-residue C-terminal extension.
  Protein Purification and Complex FormationCHO cells  overexpressing myostatin (15, 35) were kindly provided by Dr.  Se-Jin Lee and used to make conditioned medium.
Myostatin  was purified as previously described (36).Wild-type and altered  myc-His-tagged Fst-type proteins were produced and purified  as previously described (25).
For crystallization, thrombin was  used to remove the tag from the truncated Fstl3 construct.
  Activin A was produced and purified as previously described  (28, 37).
The myostatinFstl3 complex was formed by adding  FIGURE 1.TGF-and Fst-type protein family architecture andinteraction.

Complex was purified on a Superdex 200  column (Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer of 20 mM HEPES,  pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl.
The column was run at 1 ml/min, and  samples were pooled from a peak with an elution position midway between 171 and 67 kDa.
Tagged Fst-type proteins were  quantified by a C-terminal myc tag solution phase assay (34).
  MyostatinFstl3 Complex Crystal Structure Determination  The purified complex of myostatinFstl3 in 20 mM HEPES, pH  7.5, 150 mM NaCl was concentrated to 2.9 mg/ml and mixed 1:1  in a hanging drop experiment with a well solution containing  127.5 mM potassium thiocyanate and 12.5% PEG 3350.
Crystals  were frozen in mother liquor increased to 40% PEG 3350 plus  100 mM malonate.
Diffraction experiments were performed at  the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source  GM/CA-CAT 23ID beamline.
The data were integrated and  scaled to 2.4  resolution using HKL2000 (38).
Molecular  replacement using PHASER (39) and one myostatin monomer  (Protein Data Bank code 3HH2) and one Fstl3 molecule (Protein Data Bank code 3B4V) as search models were used to locate  the position of one half complex of myostatinFstl3 in the asymmetric unit.
Myostatin residues 2632 and Fstl3 residues  49 65 were removed from the initial search model to avoid  bias in these areas.
The atomic coordinates were refined using  REFMAC (40) along with repeated rounds of model building  with COOT (41).
Positional displacement of each chain was  described by one (myostatin monomer) and three (Fstl3) translation/libration/screw groups that were identified by the  TLSMD server (42).
The data collection and refinement statistics are shown in supplemental Table S1.
An example of the  electron density showing the Fstl3 ND helix region is presented  in supplemental Fig. S1.
Structural alignments and root mean  square deviation calculations were performed using COOT.
  The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in  the Protein Data Bank with the identifier 3SEK.
Buried surface  area calculations were done using the Monster webserver (43).
  Shape complementarity was calculated using the program SC  (44).
Ramachandran plot statistics were calculated using MolProbity (45).
Structure figures were rendered using PyMOL  (46).
  Generation of a HEK293 (CAGA)12 Stable Cell LineA plasmid containing a PGK-neomycin cassette inserted into the  pGL3-(CAGA)12-luciferase reporter construct (47) in the same  orientation as the promoter using SalI/XhoI was generously  provided by Dr. Alexandra McPherron.
This construct was  digested with SalI, gel-purified, and transfected into HEK293  cells that were 50% confluent in a 6-well plate using TransITLT1 transfection reagent (Mirus).
Clonal selection was carried  out in DMEM plus Pen-Strep, 10% FBS, and 100 g/ml G418.
A  stable cell line (HEK293-CAGA) was derived by selecting the  best clone based on the highest response to 0.8 ng of activin A in  a 96-well plate (protocol below).
  Luciferase Reporter AssaysHEK293-CAGA cells were  plated at 0.2  106 cells/well on a poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well  plate (Greiner) and grown 24 h. Growth medium was  removed, and 100 l of complex preformed in serum-free  medium was added and incubated for 18 h. Activin A or myostatin (R & D Systems) was used at 1.6 ng/well.
The medium  was then removed, and the cells were lysed in 20 l of passive  lysis buffer (Promega).
The lysates were transferred to 96-well  IsoPlates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and mixed with 40 l of  luciferase assay substrate (Promega), and luminescence was  recorded immediately in an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).
  Radiolabel Binding AssaysBinding of altered Fst-type proteins to labeled activin A was determined by competition assay  as described (48).
Relative potencies were calculated by comparison of half-maximal inhibition of labeled activin A binding  by altered and wild-type Fstl3 or Fst.
The experimental binding  data are shown in supplemental Fig. S2.
  Surface Plasmon ResonanceSurface plasmon resonance  (SPR) measurements were carried out in HBS-EP buffer (10 mM  HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% P-20 surfactant (BIAcore AB)) on a BIAcore 3000 optical biosensor system operated with BIAevaluation 4.1 software.
Activin A and  myostatin ligands were immobilized on a CM4 research grade  sensor chip (BIAcore AB) by amine coupling chemistry using  the manufacturers protocol at 25 C (333 response units for  activin A and 366 RU for myostatin).
For myostatinFstl3 experiments, myostatin was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by  amine coupling chemistry at 25 C to enhance the signal to  noise (2785 RU).
For kinetic measurements, Fst, Fstl3, and their  mutants (analytes) were dissolved in HBS-EP buffer in 2-fold  dilution series and applied to the immobilized ligands at a flow  rate of 20l/min.
Protein was injected for an association time of  3 min, and then dissociation was monitored for 20 min.
After  each measurement, the chip surface was typically regenerated  with four 15-l pulses of 2 M guanidine HCl at a flow rate of 100  l/min.
SPR sensorgrams were globally analyzed using a distribution model for continuous affinity and rate constant analysis  with the program EVILFIT (50).
For the activin A-Fst interactions, to describe the data with limited mass transport, the  kinetic traces were globally fitted with a distribution model  combined with a two-compartment approximation of mass  transport (51, 52).
  RESULTS  Structure of the MyostatinFstl3 ComplexThe structure of  the myostatinFstl3 complex has been determined to 2.4  resolution.
The asymmetric unit consisted of one half of the full  complex centered on a 2-fold crystallographic axis.
A disulfide bond with a symmetry mate creates the biological unit.
  For complex crystallization, an Fstl3 construct containing  residues 10218 was used, because N- and C-terminal residues outside this range were not observed in the activin  AFstl3 structure, presumably because of the flexibility of  these regions.
This aided crystallization, and the truncated  version was shown to be fully active in a luciferase reporter  assay (data not shown).
Overall, the structure reveals that the  myostatin dimer is bound by two Fstl3 molecules, similar to  previously determined Fst-type complexes, burying a total of  2832 2 at the interface (Fig. 2A) (12, 25, 2729).
FSD1 and  FSD2 of one Fstl3 molecule contact one monomer of myostatin and cover the convex type II receptor-binding site  (type II site), whereas the ND contacts both monomers and  plugs the concave type I receptor-binding site (type I site).
  Structure of MyostatinFollistatin-like 3  JANUARY 6, 2012VOLUME 287NUMBER 2 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 1045   at Harvard Libraries on June 5, 2014 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Because the overall mode of antagonist binding is similar to  other Fst-type structures, it is best to describe the  myostatinFstl3 complex through cross-comparison with the  previously reported structures of activin AFstl3, activin  AFst, and myostatinFst (12, 25, 28).
We have also compared  myostatin in this Fstl3 complex with that in the Fst complex,  the only other available myostatin structure (12).
  Changes in the Overall Myostatin Structure and Dimer  InterfaceAlthough all TGF- family ligands have exhibited  the common familial architecture, differences in overall conformation have been observed when comparing the same ligand in  different structures (25, 2729, 37, 53, 54).
Myostatin also displays differences in dimer conformation when bound to either  Fstl3 or Fst.
Overall, myostatin in the Fstl3 complex exhibits a  less compressed shape as compared with the Fst complex, with  907 2 versus 1005 2  , respectively, buried on each monomer at  the myostatin dimer interface (Fig. 2B, monomer A) (12).
The  ligand fingertip extends in the Fstl3 complex, creating a more  open type I site and exposing residues on the fingertip and wrist  helix (Fig. 2, B and C).
A major difference is in the side chain of  Phe-27, which adopts an alternate rotamer and points toward  instead of away from Trp-29 (Fig. 2C).
The fingertip extension  could best be described as an uncurling of the fingertips,  because the rest of the monomer remains relatively unchanged  (Figs. 2B, monomer B, and 3B, curved arrows).
This uncurling  results in an overall dimer extension of 4.3  when measuring  the distance between the C of Lys-90 on monomer A to that  on monomer B and comparing the difference between the two  FIGURE 2.

  Structure of MyostatinFollistatin-like 3  1046 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287NUMBER 2JANUARY 6, 2012   at Harvard Libraries on June 5, 2014 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from dimers (Fig. 2B).
This difference appears to be due to the unique  positioning of the ND of Fstl3.
  The N-terminal Domains of Fst-type Molecules Form Alternate Interactions with LigandsThe ND of Fstl3 binds the type  I site of myostatin, interacting with both myostatin monomers  through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions.
Historically, the greatest differences in comparing Fst-type complexes have been seen at this interface (12, 25, 27, 28).
The same  holds true for the myostatinFstl3 complex.
In addition to the  fingertip and wrist regions, the ND also interacts with the prehelix loop of myostatin, forming a hydrophobic interface (supplemental Fig. S3).
This interaction is not observed in the  activin AFstl3 complex, because the prehelix loop is disordered  (25).
  The Fstl3 differences between the myostatin and activin A  complexes can easily be seen by aligning FSD1 and FSD2 (Fig.  3A).
This shows a large change in the position of the main ND  helix.
These changes are not so much due to a hinge region  following the ND as is seen in Fst (12) but more due to a conformational change in the ND and a resulting shift in the tilt of  the ND helix.
Superimposing the C atoms of the ND of Fstl3 in  the two complexes results in an root mean square deviation of  1.5 as compared with 1.1 for the ND of Fst in the corresponding  complexes.
  Not only is the conformation of the Fstl3 ND different when  bound to each ligand, but the position of the ND relative to  ligand is also distinctive.
In fact, the position of the ND and the  main helix that interacts with ligand is quite unique when comparing all four Fst-type complexes (Fig. 3, BE, and supplemental Fig. S4).
Previous structures have shown differences in the  inward shift of the Fst ND and helix geometry altered to a more  tightly wound state (Fig. 3, D and E, arrows) (Ref. 25; detailed in  Ref.
12).
However, the positional change in the myostatinFstl3  ND helix is more drastic (Fig. 3, B and C, arrows, and supplemental Fig. S4B).
Compared with Fstl3 in the activin A complex, the N-terminal end of the helix swings away from the  fingertip and inward to interact with the wrist region of myostatin (Figs. 3C and 4, A and B).
This results in a change of 21  in the tilt of the helix (measured from the positional change of  the center of mass of the helix using C of Leu-61 as a static  reference point).
Interestingly, there is a highly conserved  hydrogen bond between ligand Tyr-86/Tyr-93 and the backbone of Fstl3 Leu-61 that seems to act as a pivot point in this  interface (Fig. 4, A and B, schematic).
Hydrogen bonding  between the N terminus of the ND helix (Asn-53 and Asn-56)  and the myostatin wrist helix (His-59) and prehelix loop (Tyr55), respectively, lock in this distinctly angled position (Fig. 4A).
  In contrast, in the activin AFstl3 complex, there is no interaction with the wrist helix, because Fstl3 Asn-53 adopts an alternate rotamer to hydrogen bond with Trp-25 of the activin A  fingertip.
There are instead more interactions with the activin  A finger and fingertip region (Fig. 4B).
This is similar to the  myostatinFst complex where the ND helix only interacts with  the fingertip region, with the hydrogen bond pivot point  between myostatin Tyr-86 and Fst Phe-52 conserved (Fig. 4C).
  Here, Fst Asn-44 forms a hydrogen bond with Gly-28 of the  myostatin fingertip instead of interacting with the wrist helix as  seen with Asn-53 of Fstl3 (Fig. 4, A and C).
It is interesting to  note that the greatest difference in ND helix placement is  observed when comparing the activin AFst and myostatinFstl3  complexes, whereas the most similar placement is seen in the  activin AFstl3 and myostatinFst complexes (supplemental Fig.  S4).
  The above comparisons indicate that the Fstl3 ND does not  seem to be more suited to bind one ligand over the other.
In  further support of this, the shape complementarity value of the  ligand-ND interface is 0.67 for the myostatin complex and 0.69  FIGURE 3.

  Structure of MyostatinFollistatin-like 3  JANUARY 6, 2012VOLUME 287NUMBER 2 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 1047   at Harvard Libraries on June 5, 2014 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from for the activin A complex, indicating that the goodness of fit  between the ND and ligand in the two complexes is approximately equal (Fig. 4,Aand B) (44).
This is in stark contrast to the  Fst complexes where the corresponding shape complementarity values for myostatin and activin A are 0.75 and 0.5, respectively, indicating that the ND of Fst interacts much more advantageously with myostatin than activin A (12).
  Point Mutations in the N-terminal Domain Are More Detrimental to Fstl3 than FstExtensive structural data suggest that  the substantial hydrophobic interface between ligand and the  ND of Fst-type molecules (supplemental Fig. S3) is important to  binding.
In fact, 58% of the total buried surface area on the  ND in each complex is contributed by hydrophobic residues  (supplemental Fig. S5).
Despite this observation, few biochemical data exist on how important this hydrophobic interface is to  binding, particularly with respect to either myostatin or Fstl3.
  The importance of this interface is partially supported in that  removing the ND from Fst reduces ligand binding to 5% (33,  34) and that point mutation of some hydrophobic residues can  interfere with binding to activin A (34).
Contrary to this, mutation of select hydrophobic activin A residues in the type I receptor-binding site was shown not to significantly alter Fst binding  (31).
To begin to more thoroughly investigate this question  with regards to Fst and Fstl3 and their interaction with myostatin and activin A, we created a series of point mutations in  hydrophobic ND residues of Fst-type molecules and tested  ligand binding and activity.
Although several residues appear to  be important to binding, we specifically focused on those that  appear to be equally important for binding to both myostatin  and activin A and that are in similar positions in the Fst and  Fstl3 complexes.
Selection criteria included hydrophobic residues that are buried by 50100 2  /residue in both complexes  for each Fst-type protein.
A comparison of the buried surface  area on each ND residue is provided in supplemental Fig. S5.
  Also, structural comparisons have shown that Phe-60 (Fstl3)  and Phe-47 (Fst) mimic Phe-85 of the type I BMP receptor IA in  FIGURE 4.

The conserved interaction (with the exception of activin A-Fst) between ligand Tyr-86/Tyr-93 and the backbone of Fst-type  molecule Leu-61/Phe-52 is shown.
This acts as a pivot point for Fstl3, allowing the N-terminal end of the ND helix to swing toward the wrist helix of myostatin  or fingertip of activin A. This is illustrated schematically in the upper right corners of A and B.

  Four hydrophobic residues that correspond between Fst and  Fstl3 were chosen for mutation (Fig. 5A).
In attempt to disrupt  binding of the ND helix, we mutated these select residues to  glutamates.
Replacing key hydrophobic residues with charged  residues at interaction interfaces has previously been shown to  be an effective method for disrupting protein-protein interactions (49, 55, 56).
  As shown in Table 1, results from our radiolabeled activin A  competition binding assay (48) demonstrate that Fstl3 point  mutations are more detrimental to activin A binding than those  in Fst.
Mutants L57E and L61E bind with an 2030-fold  decrease in activin A affinity.
F60E showed an 6.5-fold  decrease, whereas L24E was similar to wild type.
In contrast,  ND point mutations in Fst had much less of an effect with most  potencies comparable with wild type.
Therefore, although we  were successful in disrupting the ligand-ND interface with  Fstl3, Fst remained unaffected.
  To further investigate ND susceptibility in a more biological  context, we tested these point mutants (Fig. 5A) in a luciferase  reporter assay with both activin A and myostatin.
We enhanced  the reproducibility and sensitivity of the assay to effectively test  activin class ligand inhibition by antagonists (47).
The assay  shows an 150-fold response to activin A with a Z-score of 0.76  (when performed as described under Experimental Procedures).
The results of the luciferase reporter assay corroborated the activin A binding assay, and trends were similar  between activin A and myostatin.
As shown in Fig. 5 (B and C),  Fstl3 point mutations L57E and L61E greatly reduce antagonist  activity, especially with regards to myostatin inhibition.
In fact,  FIGURE 5.

F60E has a moderate effect on inhibition, whereas L24E is again similar to wild  type.
In comparison, corresponding mutations in Fst have  much less of an effect on ligand inhibition (Fig. 5, D and E).
As  with Fstl3, Fst ND point mutations affect myostatin more than  activin A binding.
This is shown in that point mutant IC50 values are increased to a greater extent for myostatin than activin  A (Fig. 5, D and E, dotted lines).
These results demonstrate that  single point mutations in the ND can decrease the biological  activity of Fstl3 but have little effect on Fst.
  Analysis of Fst-type Molecule Affinities for Ligands Using Surface Plasmon ResonanceEquilibrium dissociation constant  (KD) values for wild-type and point mutant Fst-type proteins  were determined using SPR kinetic analysis (Fig. 6, Table 2, and  supplemental Figs. S6S9).
Importantly, to ensure consistency,  experiments comparing binding of a particular Fst-type construct and its mutants to a particular ligand were performed on  the same SPR chip.
Therefore, the KD fold over wild type is  internally controlled with respect to ligand coupling.
As shown  in Table 2, the KD values of Fstl3 glutamate mutants L57E,  F60E, and L61E binding to either myostatin or activin A are  significantly increased by 2 orders of magnitude or more.
This  result correlates well with both our radiolabeled activin A binding and luciferase assays.
In fact, it is apparent by visual inspection  of the SPR sensorgrams that the dissociation rates of Fstl3mutants  from ligands are significantly increased as compared with wild  type (Fig. 6 and supplemental Figs. S6S9).
In contrast, corresponding mutations in Fst had little effect on ligand binding,  although myostatin binding was somewhat more affected than  that of activin A, which corroborates our luciferase assays.
This is  also readily apparent by examination of the dissociation phase on  the SPR sensorgrams, which show that Fst mutant dissociation  from ligand remains exceptionally slow.

  Structure of MyostatinFollistatin-like 3  1050 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287NUMBER 2JANUARY 6, 2012   at Harvard Libraries on June 5, 2014 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Our mutagenesis data up to this point support that Fstl3 ND  point mutations L57E, F60E, and L61E disrupt ligand binding,  whereas corresponding Fst mutations have little effect.
It is possible that glutamate mutations are only detrimental to Fstl3  binding because of an unexpected electrostatic interaction.
  Although unlikely because each residue is buried inside the  hydrophobic interface, we addressed this possibility by making  the corresponding alanine mutations in both Fst and Fstl3.
In  agreement with the Fstl3 glutamate mutants, the Fstl3 alanine  mutants are also negatively affected in ligand binding, albeit  usually to a lesser degree (Table 2).
Again, Fst binding was relatively unaffected by alanine mutations.
This demonstrates that  point mutations in the ND of Fstl3 are detrimental to binding,  whereas Fst is able to accommodate residues of different sizes  as well as negative charge substitutions.
  DISCUSSION  In this study, we determined the structure of myostatinFstl3  and found that the Fstl3 ND forms distinctive interactions with  myostatin.
We show that point mutations in the ND of Fstl3 are  more detrimental to function than corresponding Fst mutations.
Altogether, this work has led to further insights into the  importance of the NDs of Fst-type molecules and the molecular  details of how ligand inhibition is achieved.
  Multi-structure analysis of Fst-type complexes has shown  both how two different antagonists bind a particular ligand and  how a particular antagonist can bind two different ligands (12,  25).
Our study presented here allowed a more extensive crosscomparison of ligandFst-type protein complexes, revealing  how Fst-type molecules can use alternate modes of interaction  through their NDs to inhibit activin class ligands.
This showed  that there are differences in how Fst and Fstl3 are able to bind  different ligands.
As compared with activin A, when Fst binds  myostatin, there is a conformational difference and a simple  inward shift of the ND helix, as well as additional interactions  that are formed (Fig. 3D, arrow) (12).
In contrast, when Fstl3  binds myostatin, there is no change in the helix conformation  but a major shift in the tilt of the ND helix, forming interactions  with myostatin through its wrist and prehelix loop and activin A  through its fingertip region (Figs. 3, A and C, arrow, and 4, A  and B).
These observations, along with similar shape complementarity values, imply that the ND of Fstl3 is not particularly  suited to bind one ligand over the other yet forms a specialized  interaction with each.
Multi-ligand binding by Fst is accomplished through a different mechanism, because ND helix flexibility allows rearrangements and a better fit with myostatin.
  Although it is possible that crystal contacts may influence the  apparent molecular models of these complexes, it is difficult to  assess their effects because only one structure of each complex  has been determined.
However, our biochemical data presented here support the findings from our analysis of the  structures.
  Our structural findings show that the ND, particularly the  helix region, of Fstl3 forms unique interactions with ligands.
  Despite this, residues of the Fstl3 ND helix are in relatively the  same position on the helix in each complex (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S10).
This is in contrast to the Fst ND helix,  where residues undergo rearrangement upon binding to either  ligand (12).
This implies that Fst may be able to accommodate  residue changes more readily than Fstl3, in which the unaltered  conformation of the ND helix suggests a nonaccommodating  nature.
This hypothesis is supported by our findings that point  mutations in the Fstl3 ND are debilitating to Fstl3 but have little  effect on Fst antagonism (Fig. 5, AC and Tables 1 and 2).
Furthermore, rigidity of the Fstl3 ND helix may explain the lower  affinity of Fstl3 for myostatin as compared with activin A.  Because activin A is more flexible (25, 2729, 37, 54), it may  better accommodate the rigid Fstl3 ND, whereas binding an  inflexible myostatin may be less favorable.
In fact, BMPs, which  are also inflexible, may not be able to accommodate the rigid  Fstl3 ND helix at all, possibly explaining why Fstl3 has little to  no affinity for the BMP class.
Alternatively, it could simply be  due to a difference in interactions at that interface.
It would be  interesting to determine the structure of a BMPFst-type complex for comparison, because it is difficult to predict what the  ligand-ND interface would resemble because of the variability  of Fst-type molecules at this interface.
  Numerous studies have investigated the importance of Fst  domains to ligand antagonism, some with discrepant results  (29, 3134).
Our finding here that the ND of Fst is relatively  resistant to point mutations is supported in that mutating  activin A residues at the type I site has little effect on Fst binding  (31).
Although the overall effect of mutations is minimal, myostatin seems to be more affected by Fst ND point mutations  than activin A. This suggests that it is more important to myostatin inhibition and also fits well with our previous study showing that the ND of Fst forms more extensive contacts with myostatin than activin A (12).
One possible reason for the relative  resistance of Fst to ND point mutations is that the hinge region  following the ND in Fst (12) may allow movements and repositioning of the ND in the type I receptor-binding site to accommodate these changes.
Additionally, resistance could also be a  result of interactions across Fst molecules where the FSD3 of  one Fst interacts with the ND of the other, because this likely  contributes to increased binding affinity for Fst and possibly  provides cooperativity to the interaction (Fig. 1).
Fst antagonism and binding of the ND involves two interaction surfaces as  TABLE 2  Binding constants for Fst-type molecules to ligands determined  through SPR  Surface  Analyte  Fstl3 KD  -Fold over  WT Fst KD  -Fold over  WT  nM nM  Myostatin WT 1.3 1.0 WT 6.3 1.0  L24E 170 131 V15E 20 3.2  L57E 2400 1846 F47E 21 3.3  F60E 2400 1846 I51E 27 4.3  L61E 1600 1231 F52E 25 4.0  L57A 120 92 F47A 59 9.4  F60A 56 43 I51A 21 3.3  L61A 410 315 F52A 54 8.6  Activin A WT 0.14 1.0 WT 0.02 1.0  L24E 0.56 4.0 V15E 0.02 1.0  L57E 150 1071 F47E 0.04 2.0  F60E 98 700 I51E 0.03 1.5  L61E 140 1000 F52E 0.02 1.0  L57A 59 421 F47A 0.05 2.5  F60A 93 664 I51A 0.02 1.0  L61A 43 307 F52A 0.02 1.0  Structure of MyostatinFollistatin-like 3  JANUARY 6, 2012VOLUME 287NUMBER 2 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 1051   at Harvard Libraries on June 5, 2014 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from compared with only one for Fstl3.
Thus, disrupting only one of  the surfaces might not significantly impact Fst affinity for  ligand.
Fstl3 would not have this advantage because it lacks the  third FSD required for this interaction.
  Understanding the molecular mechanisms of TGF- family  ligand regulation by Fst-type molecules is a significant step  toward engineering molecules with altered specificity and affinity toward different ligands.
This is especially the case for myostatin, which predominantly negatively regulates muscle  growth.
Rationally designed myostatin inhibitors could be an  effective treatment for muscle wasting diseases such as muscular dystrophy, because myostatin inhibitors are already in clinical trials for this purpose.
However, it has been difficult to  specifically target myostatin over other activin-like ligands.
  Efforts aimed at altering naturally occurring antagonists to  make them specific myostatin inhibitors thus far have focused  on Fst.
In fact, a construct containing Fst ND-FSD1-FSD1 has  shown strong specificity for myostatin over activin A (21, 22).
  However, because Fstl3 is already a more specific antagonist, it  may be a better molecule to redesign for specific myostatin  antagonism.
Because the interactions at the ligand-Fstl3 ND  interface are very different between myostatin and activin A,  this should be a hot spot for altering antagonist specificity.
  Studies such as the one presented here will facilitate this rational design by revealing the molecular details that confer ligand  specificity.
