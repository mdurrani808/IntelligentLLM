However, experimental generation  of such landscapes is a tedious task due to a large  number of possible mutations.
Here, we use a simple  computational protocol to map the binding landscape for two homologous high-affinity complexes,  involving a snake toxin fasciculin and acetylcholinesterase from two different species.
To verify our  computational predictions, we experimentally measure binding between 25 Fas mutants and the 2  enzymes.
Both computational and experimental results demonstrate that the Fas sequence is close to  the optimum when interacting with its targets, yet a  few mutations could further improve Kd, kon, and  koff.
Our computational predictions agree well with  experimental results and generate distributions  similar to those observed in other high-affinity PPIs,  demonstrating the potential of simple computational  protocols in capturing realistic binding landscapes.
  INTRODUCTION  Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial for all cellular  pathways, including signal transduction, DNA replication, transcription/translation, and multicomponent protein assemblies.
  Hence, understanding and manipulating PPIs is of high interest  for both basic biology and applied research, such as synthetic  biology and drug design.
In the past decade, large effort has  been dedicated to characterizing PPIs at different levels.
Highthroughput studies mapped all PPIs in several organisms,  accumulating extensive information on the architecture of PPI  networks and identifying new pairs of interacting proteins (Ito  et al., 2001; Uetz et al., 2000;
Gavin et al., 2002; Giot et al.,  2003; Ho et al., 2002; Stelzl et al., 2005; Rual et al., 2005).
  Constantly appearing high-resolution structures of protein-protein complexes facilitated atomic-level analysis of various binding interfaces (Kastritis et al., 2011).
Advances in molecular  biology allowed determination of single residue contribution to  the binding energetics (Pal et al., 2006).
In spite of all this progress, our comprehension of the precise molecular forces that  govern binding affinity and binding specificity in PPIs remains  incomplete, impeding rational design of novel PPIs (Fleishman  et al., 2011a, 2011b).
  A considerable number of experimental studies report  changes in free energy of binding (DDGbind) due to mutations.
  However, the majority of such data involves substitutions to  Ala that destroy existing interactions, leading in most cases to  a decrease in PPI affinity (Cunningham and Wells, 1989, 1993;  Delano, 2002; Pal et al., 2005; Skelton et al., 2003; Yang et al.,  2003; Zhang and Palzkill, 2003) and providing no insight on  how to enhance binding affinity.
In addition, mutations to Ala  rarely occur in nature and hence present marginal interest  when studying protein evolution.
To obtain a more comprehensive picture of binding interface evolution and architecture, one  should analyze changes in binding affinity due to all possible single mutations, thereby generating a PPI binding landscape.
Such  landscapes can be used to estimate the degree of binding interface sequence optimality and to identify affinity-enhancing  mutations that are important for various biotechnological applications (Pal et al., 2006).
However, experimental generation of  binding landscapes is a tedious task due to the large number  of mutants that need to be constructed and assessed for binding  affinity.
Hence, generation of binding landscapes through computational means presents an attractive alternative to lengthy  experiments.
Recent successes in predicting affinity-enhancing  mutations in various PPIs through structure-based computational methods (Selzer et al., 2000; Sammond et al., 2007; Haidar  et al., 2009; Reynolds et al., 2008; Hao et al., 2008; Lippow et al.,  2007) indicate that computational binding landscapes might provide a good approximation to reality.
  In this study, our goal was to generate a binding landscape for  a representative high-affinity PPI.
Among various PPIs, highaffinity PPIs are of particular interest because they are commonly  responsible for life and death decisions in the cell (such as, for  example, in immunity proteins-collicin interactions; Papadakos  et al., 2012).
On the other hand, high-affinity PPIs are attractive  systems for computational biologists because they could be  used to learn about the nature of nearly optimal intermolecular interactions such as packing, electrostatics, and hydrogen bond  Structure 22, 110, April 8, 2014 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1  Please cite this article in press as: Aizner et al., Mapping of the Binding Landscape for a Picomolar Protein-Protein Complex through Computation and  Experiment, Structure (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2014.01.012patterns.
We expect that binding interface sequences of highaffinity PPIs have evolved to perfection; hence, the majority of  mutations would lead to a decrease in binding affinity, whereas  beneficial mutations in the direct binding interface are rare,  making our task of finding such mutations a challenge.
  As our model system, we picked a complex between an  essential synaptic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and a  polypeptide toxin present in the venom of the green mamba  snake, fasciculin-2 (Fas).
AChE terminates impulse transmission  at cholinergic synapses by rapid hydrolysis of a neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (Zimmerman and Soreq, 2006).
Fas is a  very powerful inhibitor of AChE, whose application leads to  muscle fasciculation and paralysis (Karlsson et al., 1985).
High  affinity of the Fas-AChE complex (Kd of 10121010 M; Weiner  et al., 2009; Radic et al., 1994; Eastman et al., 1995) is essential  for the snakes ability to kill its prey.
  Fas belongs to a three-finger toxin family that shares a common b sheet fold with three protruding loops or fingers. Four  disulfide bonds supply proteins in this family with very high stability (Kini, 2002).
The high-resolution structures of Fas are available in complex with three different species of AChE: Mouse  (mAChE), Torpedo californica (tAChE), and Human (hAChE)  (Bourne et al., 1995; Harel et al., 1995; Kryger et al., 2000).
All  three structures show a very similar binding mode where Fas  binds at the surface of the enzyme, sealing the access to the  AChE active site, which is buried in the middle of the enzyme  (Figure 1A).
The tight binding between the two proteins has  been attributed to several factors, including high surface  complementarity, large hydrophobic surface burial, intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and extremely optimized electrostatic  interactions between cationic residues on Fas and anionic residues on AChE (Harel et al., 1995; Radic et al., 1997).
  In a previous study, we designed a quintuple Fas mutant with  the intention of improving its affinity to tAChE. Unfortunately, this  Fas mutant showed reduced affinity to the enzyme when  measured experimentally (Sharabi et al., 2009).
Nevertheless,  we demonstrated that the decrease in affinity was mostly due  to one unsuccessfully predicted mutation, removal of which resulted in slightly improved binding to the enzyme.
To eliminate  the effect of error accumulation when dealing with multiple  Figure 1.

  mutations, here we test our ability to predict the effect of single mutations at the  Fas binding interface.
We first generate  a computational binding landscape for Fas interacting with  AChE from two species, tAChE and hAChE. We then construct  a considerable number of Fas mutants experimentally and measure their binding affinities to both enzymes.
We show that our  predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results  and demonstrate that whereas most mutations on the Fas binding interface lead to substantial reduction in affinity, a few mutations result in significant affinity improvement.
  RESULTS  Computational Saturated Mutagenesis of the Fas  Binding Interface  To determine how various mutations on Fas affect its binding  affinity to tAChE and hAChE, we performed computational saturated mutagenesis (Sharabi et al., 2013) of the Fas binding interface using the framework of the ORBIT protein design software  (Dahiyat and Mayo, 1997).
Starting from the crystal structures  of Fas bound to tAChE and to hAChE, we considered 17 natural  amino acids at each of the Fas binding interface positions.
We  did not consider mutations to Pro, Gly, and Cys because introduction of Pro and Gly is likely to change Fas backbone conformation, while Cys would interfere with the correct disulphide  bond formation of the protein.
After each mutation was introduced into Fas, we calculated the intermolecular energy DEinter  by subtracting the energies of the unbound chains from that of  the Fas-AChE complex.
DDGbind was calculated as the difference between DEinter of the mutant and that of the wild-type  (WT) complex.
In our calculations, we did not model backbone  flexibility, assuming that single mutations in Fas do not change  its fold significantly.
Side chain flexibility was modeled by repacking side chains in the immediate vicinity of the mutation  site for the complex structure only.
For the unbound chains,  side chain conformations were frozen in the conformation  determined for the complex structure (see Experimental Procedures for more details).
  The results of the computational saturated mutagenesis are  summarized in Figure 1B.
Our results show that relatively few  mutations are predicted to improve Fas affinity to tAChE and  even fewer mutations to hAChE. This is consistent with our  Structure  Binding Landscapes of High-Affinity PPIs  2 Structure 22, 110, April 8, 2014 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved  Please cite this article in press as: Aizner et al., Mapping of the Binding Landscape for a Picomolar Protein-Protein Complex through Computation and  Experiment, Structure (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2014.01.012expectations that the two interactions are already evolutionary  optimized.
For some of the mutations, improvement in intermolecular energy was coupled to significant destabilization of Fas  in the unbound form (Table S1 available online).
We thought  that such Fas mutants are unlikely to show improved binding  in reality, but chose three of these mutants for experimental  validation.
  Overall, we selected 23 Fas single mutants (Figure 1B) and two  double mutants incorporating mutations at positions 8 and 9 for  testing.
Among the 25 mutants, six were predicted to significantly improve Fas affinity for tAChE and/or hAChE, and five  were predicted to significantly decrease affinity to both enzymes.
Eleven of the selected mutants were predicted to  improve binding specificity toward one of the enzymes.
The  number of Fas mutants being tested was limited by a relatively  tedious procedure for expression of this protein.
Fas is a difficult  protein to express due to its small size and the presence of four  disulfide bonds.
Indeed, when expressed in Escherichia coli and  in yeast (Pichia pastoris) using various protocols, no active protein was obtained.
In our previous work however, we reported  an efficient protocol for Fas refolding after its expression in  E. coli (Sharabi et al., 2009).
We used the same protocol for  expression and refolding of all the Fas mutants considered in  this work.
The majority of the Fas mutants were refolded  correctly using a protocol designed for WT Fas.
However, three  Fas mutants (M33W, V34N, and L35R) remained unfolded and  were hence excluded from further experiments (Figure S1).
  To measure binding between the Fas mutants and tAChE/  hAChE, we used an enzyme activity assay that is based on colorimetric detection of the AChE catalysis product.
Very tight affinities of Fas mutants to the enzyme could be measured using this  method due to high sensitivity of the assay.
Moreover, the  enzyme-activity-based method allowed us to determine not  only the equilibrium binding affinities (Kd), but also the kinetic  rates, kon and koff (Figure S2).
  Figure 2.
Changes in Binding Free Energy,  Kinetic Rates, and Binding Specificity due  to Mutations on Fas  Parameters for interactions between Fas mutants  and tAChE are shown as gray bars and between  Fas mutants and hAChE are shown as black bars.
  (A) Changes in DDGbind relative to WT Fas.
Horizontal lines at  0.4 kcal/mol distinguish mutations  with significant changes in DDGbind from those  with small changes in DDGbind.  (B) Enhancement in kon relative to WT Fas.
  (C) Enhancement in koff relative to WT Fas.
It was  not possible to obtain kinetic data for interactions  between tAChE and several mutants (T9N, R27M,  R27F, and R27Y) due to very fast association and  dissociation phases.
  (D) Binding specificity of a particular Fas mutant to  tAChE (gray bars) and to hAChE (black bars).
  Binding specificity is calculated as a ratio of Kd for  one enzyme species versus another.
  Using the above assay, we explored  the binding landscape of the Fas-AChE  interaction at physiological ionic strength  (I = 0.15 M).
Fas WT binds to tAChE and  hAChE with 370 pM and 90 pM affinities, preferring the Human  enzyme by about a factor of four.
Figure 2A summarizes our  binding experiments where affinities between Fas mutants and  both tAChE and hAChE were measured.
We assigned our experimental DDGbind data to three different groups: mutations that  exhibit significant enhancement in affinity to one or both enzymes (DDGbind < 0.4 kcal/mol), mutations that nearly do not  change affinity (0.4 < DDGbind < 0.4 kcal/mol), and mutations  that significantly destabilize the complex between the Fas  mutant and either enzyme (DDGbind > 0.4 kcal/mol).
We identified  five data points with significant enhancement in DDGbind.
These  points belong to two Fas mutants H29R and H29K that show  improvement in affinity to both tAChE and hAChE and N47R  that shows improvement in affinity to only tAChE (Figure 2A  and Table 1).
Our best affinity-improving mutation H29R, shows  12-fold affinity enhancement to 30 pM for tAChE while the second best mutation, H29K, shows 4.5-fold affinity improvement  to 21 pM for hAChE. Ten data points fell in the neutral zone,  showing slight changes in binding affinity to one or both  enzymes, corresponding to mutants T8V/T9I, T8V/T9N, T9I,  K32R, N47W, N47F, and N47R.
The remaining 29 data points  correspond to Fas mutations that significantly destabilize its  binding to one or both species of AChE.  We next examined how each of the tested Fas mutations  affects kinetic rates of binding.
Interestingly, Fas binds to tAChE  and hAChE with different kinetics.
The association rate of  WT Fas to tAChE is faster than its association to hAChE (6.8 3  107 M1 s1 and 5.1 3 106 M1 s1  , respectively).
However,  the dissociation rate of WT Fas is also faster for tAChE compared  to hAChE (2.5 3102 s1 and 4.8 3 104 s1  , respectively), thus  resulting in a 4-fold tighter Kd of WT Fas to hAChE. Analysis of kon  data shows that it is significantly improved for two Fas mutants  (H29K and H29R) when binding to tAChE and for only one mutation H29K when binding to hAChE (Figure 2B).

Analysis of the koff data showed larger changes in  this parameter compared to changes in kon.
Eight mutations  were found to enhance koff for tAChE (T8V/T9I, T9I, H29R,  M33L, M33Q, N47F, N47W, and N47R) and two mutations for  hAChE (H29K and H29R; Figure 2C).
On the other hand, for  several mutants, koff for hAChE was more than 50-fold faster  (worse) compared to WT Fas (T8V/T9N, T9N, R27F, R27Y, and  M33L).
  We also examined whether some of the selected Fas mutants  display high specificity for one species of AChE over the other  species (e.g., at least 10-fold difference in binding affinity to  tAChE versus hAChE).
As we mentioned before, WT Fas prefers  hAChE to tAChE by approximately a factor of four.
Figure 2D  shows that two Fas mutants (T9N and T8V/T9N) exhibit reverse  binding specificity, binding to tAChE with 15- and 10-fold higher  affinity compared to hAChE. However, for both mutants the  specificity enhancement is achieved at the expense of reduced  binding affinity to both enzymes.
In addition, we found four Fas  mutants (R27M, M33Y, K32R, and N47F) that show considerable  (>10-fold) preference for hAChE over tAChE. These results  demonstrate that in spite of very similar binding epitopes of  tAChE and hAChE, it is possible to find single and double Fas  mutants that show considerable preference toward one species  of the enzyme.
  We next decided to investigate whether the Fas-AChE binding  landscape changes at low ionic strength where electrostatic interactions are enhanced.
At low ionic strength of I = 0.057 M,  binding affinity of WT Fas for both enzymes is reduced to  94 pM and 35 pM for tAChE and hAChE, respectively, in agreement with previous experiments (Radic et al., 1997).
Similarly,  affinities of all the tested Fas mutants are enhanced at low ionic  strength in comparison to physiological ionic strength (Table S2).
  The increase in binding affinity at lower ionic strength comes  solely from an increase in kon, while koff remains virtually unchanged in agreement with previous results on the Fas-mAChE  complex (Radic et al., 1997).
The same data points, corresponding to mutations H29R and H29K, exhibit significant enhancement in binding affinity to both enzymes in comparison to WT  Fas.
On average, we observed that DDGbind values at low ionic  strength were similar to those at physiological ionic strength,  thus indicating that the binding landscapes do not change  substantially.
  Finally, to examine the accuracy of our computational protocol  for DDGbind predictions, we plotted all the experimentally  measured values of DDGbind versus computationally predicted  values and calculated the correlation between the two.
For  measurements performed at physiological ionic strength, we  observed a correlation coefficient R = 0.70 between our predictions and experimental results, attesting to the good accuracy of  our computational protocol that models only minimum flexibility  (Figure 3).
A slightly worse correlation (R = 0.66) was observed  when comparing our predictions to experimental values obtained at low ionic strength (Figure S3A).
Interestingly, our predictions of DDGbind correlate much better with kon compared  to koff (R values of 0.61 and 0.15, respectively), indicating that  the success of DDGbind prediction comes mostly from the success in predicting kon.
We further compared our computational  results to those obtained by a more sophisticated method for  DDGbind prediction, CC/PBSA, that models backbone flexibility  by constructing a large ensemble of PPI structures and averaging the DDGbind over the ensemble (Benedix et al., 2009).
  The CC/PBSA calculations resulted in a considerably worse correlation with our experimental results (R = 0.45) while requiring  significantly longer time for completion (Figure S3B).
In addition,  the CC/PBSA method did not predict enhancement in binding  affinity for any of the Fas mutants that showed significant affinity  enhancement experimentally.
  DISCUSSION  Optimality of the Fas Binding Interface and Interfaces of  Other High-Affinity PPIs  We expected that the Fas-AChE interface is already evolutionary  optimized, with its WT amino acid sequence lying near the optimum of the fitness landscape.
Thus, the majority of mutations in  this interface should lead to large destabilization of the complex,  while neutral and beneficial mutations in the direct binding  interface should be rare, making our task of finding such  mutations a challenge.
Previous mutational studies on Fas in  complex with murine AChE (mAChE) demonstrated that very  Table 1.

  Structure  Binding Landscapes of High-Affinity PPIs  Structure 22, 110, April 8, 2014 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 5  Please cite this article in press as: Aizner et al., Mapping of the Binding Landscape for a Picomolar Protein-Protein Complex through Computation and  Experiment, Structure (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2014.01.012large destabilization of the complex could be achieved by  mutating only one or a few key residues on the AChE side  (DDGbind of 35 kcal/mol for single mutants and 11 kcal/mol for  a triple mutant; Radic et al., 1994).
Our experimental results  also show destabilization of more than 2 kcal/mol for 7 data  points and more than 1 kcal/mol for 21 of 44 measured data  points, revealing the steepness of the fitness landscape in the  vicinity of the WT Fas sequence.
  To make a more general comparison of the Fas-AChE binding  landscape with binding landscapes of other high-affinity PPIs,  we turned to the SKEMPI database that contains more than  3,000 binding affinity measurements for various PPI mutants  (Moal and Fernandez-Recio, 2012).
Using this database, we  constructed a histogram for experimentally measured DDGbind  values for single mutants in high-affinity PPIs (Kd < 1 nM; 1,205  data points), thus exploring various single moves in the sequence space starting from the WT binding interface sequence  of high-affinity complexes (Figure 4).
We generated a similar histogram using our computational predictions of DDGbind values in  the Fas-t/hAChE complexes and another histogram for experimentally measured DDGbind values at the physiological ionic  strength reported in this work (Figure 4).
Figure 4 shows that  the distribution of DDGbind values for various high-affinity PPIs  is not symmetrical, revealing a much higher probability of finding  a deleterious mutation at the binding interface compared to  a beneficial mutation.
This distribution exhibits a mean of  1.45 kcal/mol, an SD of 1.97 kcal/mol, and a long righthand  side tail corresponding to mutations that substantially decrease  affinity.
Yet, affinity-enhancing mutations are not extremely rare  for high-affinity PPIs with 20% of all mutations exhibiting  DDGbind < 0 kcal/mol and 9% of mutations exhibiting DDGbind <  0.5 kcal/mol.
A histogram resulting from our predictions of  DDGbind values in the Fas-t/hAChE interactions is very similar  to that observed for various high-affinity PPIs with a mean of  1.58 kcal/mol and an SD of 2.25 kcal/mol.
Among Fas mutations,  17% are predicted to result in DDGbind < 0 kcal/mol and 7% of  mutations to result in DDGbind < 0.5 kcal/mol.
The histogram  of experimentally measured DDGbind values for the Fas-t/hAChE  interactions includes only a subset of all possible mutations, yet  covers almost the full range of computationally predicted values  with 16% of mutations resulting in DDGbind < 0 kcal/mol and 8%  of mutations resulting in DDGbind < 0.5 kcal/mol.
In summary,  the above results show that the Fas binding landscape is similar  to binding landscapes of other high-affinity PPIs where the  majority of point mutations in the binding interface lead to  moderate destabilization of the complex, a considerable amount  of mutations lead to high destabilization of the complex, and  the minority of mutations lead to moderate stabilization of the  complex.
  Computational binding landscapes are not only helpful for  understanding evolution of the whole binding interface, but  also reveal a degree of optimality at different binding interface  positions.
Our analysis shows that many of the Fas positions  are already occupied by the best amino acid choice.
This is  especially true for hAChE, which exhibits higher affinity to Fas  compared to tAChE. For example, no better amino acid  (compared to WT) could be found at 7 of 13 positions when interacting with hAChE (Figure 1B).
Nevertheless, our computational  scan also revealed that a few positions at the Fas binding  interface are less optimized than others, such as positions 29  and 47 (Figure 1B), where further improvement is possible  through a number of mutations.
Indeed, at these positions,  affinity-enhancing mutations were found experimentally.
This  finding suggests that more permissive positions in any PPI are  Figure 3.
Correlation between the Experimental and the Calculated  DDGbind for Fas Mutant-t/hAChE Interactions  Experimental measurements were performed at ionic strength of 0.15 M. The  calculated values of DDGbind were obtained using a computational saturated  mutagenesis protocol that models only side chain flexibility as described in the  Experimental Procedures.
The data are fitted to a linear equation Y = 0.29 +  0.72 X, with an R value of 0.70.

  Structure  Binding Landscapes of High-Affinity PPIs  6 Structure 22, 110, April 8, 2014 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved  Please cite this article in press as: Aizner et al., Mapping of the Binding Landscape for a Picomolar Protein-Protein Complex through Computation and  Experiment, Structure (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2014.01.012good targets for engineering affinity-enhancing mutations either  through computational or combinatorial means.
  Among a large but not exhaustive number of experimentally  tested mutations we found three, H29R, H29K, and N47R, that  significantly improve binding affinity to either both or one enzyme  and three mutations that slightly improve affinity to one enzyme  (T9I, N47W, and N47F).
The three mutations with significantly  improved affinity are polar and positively charged.
This is in  contrast to most of the previous design studies that focused  on finding hydrophobic affinity-enhancing mutations (Sammond  et al., 2007; Haidar et al., 2009).
The improvement in affinity for  H29R and H29K is due to improvement in both kon and koff.
  Structural analysis showed that the WT His at position 29 does  not participate in any intermolecular interactions with tAChE/  hAChE. Mutation of His to either R or K improves electrostatic  interaction with the enzyme (resulting in kon enhancement) and  creates direct hydrogen bonds with the enzyme.
Interestingly,  the two very similar mutations prefer different enzyme species.
  Whereas K at this position is more optimal for interaction with  hAChE, R at the same position makes better contacts with  tAChE (Figures 5A and 5B).
The third affinity-improving mutation,  N47R, also occurs at a position where WT Asn is too far to participate in any intermolecular interactions.
Mutating it to Arg introduces a new salt bridge to Glu 247 on tAChE (Figure 5C).
  The magnitude of the affinity enhancement reported here for  single mutations is larger than that obtained in a similar study  for a picomolar antibody-antigen complex (Lippow et al.,  2007).
The small number of identified affinity-enhancing mutations for the Fas-AChE PPI is not surprising because the Fas  interface is very small, consisting of only 13 positions.
Large interfaces, such as those of antibody-antigen complexes, have a  potential for greater number of affinity-enhancing mutations,  combination of which could lead to several orders of magnitude  enhancement in affinity.

H29R and H29K and their interactions with  tAChE (A) and with hAChE (B) according to our  modeling.
Whereas WT His at position 29 does not  make any contacts with either tAChE or hAChE  (left panels), Arg at this position forms two  hydrogen bonds with either Asp 285 on tAChE or  Glu 292 on hAChE (middle panels).
The hydrogen  bonds are predicted to be more energetically  favorable for tAChE compared to hAChE. Lys29  forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of  tAChE and forms two hydrogen bonds with side  chains of Glu 292 and Gln 291 on hAChE (right  panels).
  (C) N47R and its interactions with tAChE. Whereas  WT Asn at position 47 is too far to form any intermolecular interactions (left panel), upon mutation  to Arg, a new salt bridge with Glu 247 on tAChE is  created (middle panel).
  Three of the tested Fas mutants failed  to refold using the standard refolding  protocol (M33W, V34N, and L35R).
For  all three mutants, the predicted negative  DDGbind was coupled to high destabilization of the Fas chain  in the unbound form (Table S1).
These results demonstrate  that a certain percentage of single mutations are not compatible  with folded proteins and hence cannot be used for generation of  binding landscapes.
Indeed, some experimental binding affinity  measurements with high positive DDGbind values might correspond to instances where the protein mutant is mostly unfolded.
  Hence, the criteria for designing affinity-enhancing mutations  should be based not only on negative DDGbind, but also on  neutral or stabilizing effect of the mutation on the unbound  chain.
  Kinetics of Binding and Its Evolutionary Consequences  Our measurements revealed substantial differences in association and dissociation rates between Fas and the two enzyme  species, demonstrating that high affinity could be achieved  through different kinetics.
While both association and dissociation is fast for tAChE, both processes are slower for hAChE.  These differences in kinetics might be due to slight variation  in the enzyme interface composition.
hAChE contains more  hydrophobic and aromatic residues compared to that of  tAChE (with eight hydrophobic and seven aromatic residues  on hAChE versus six hydrophobic and five aromatic residues  on tAChE).
On the contrary, the tAChE binding interface is  more charged relative to that of hAChE (five negatively charged  and one positively charged residue for tAChE versus three  negatively charged residues and two positively charged for  hAChE).
The more polar and charged nature of the tAChE  interface could explain faster association driven by long-range  electrostatics and faster dissociation due to fewer hydrophobic  contacts.
Interestingly, the hAChE binding interface is very  similar to that of mAChE (90% sequence identity), which is  Fas target in nature (because Green Mamba snakes prey on  rodents).
The kinetic rates of the Fas-mAChE interactions at  Structure  Binding Landscapes of High-Affinity PPIs  Structure 22, 110, April 8, 2014 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 7  Please cite this article in press as: Aizner et al., Mapping of the Binding Landscape for a Picomolar Protein-Protein Complex through Computation and  Experiment, Structure (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2014.01.012the same conditions were estimated to be 8 3 106 M1 s1  and 1 3 104 s1 (Radic et al., 1997), respectively, similar  to those of the Fas-hAChE interactions.
Slower association  and dissociation rates of Fas to mAChE and hAChE result  in longer inhibition of the enzyme and greater physiological  consequences.
  Compared to other high-affinity PPIs, Fas-AChE interactions  are characterized by optimal kon but mediocre koff.
Indeed,  kon of the Fas-tAChE interactions is higher than that of most  other high-affinity PPIs (Table 2), whereas kon of the Fas  H29R mutant toward tAChE is the same as that of one of  the fastest PPIs in nature, the barnace/barstar complex.
On  the other hand, koff of Fas interactions with hAChE and particularly with tAChE is much worse than those of other highaffinity complexes and can be compared only to that of the  interleukin 4/interleukin 4 receptor complex.
Interestingly, koff  of the trypsin/BPTI complex, which is also a complex between  an enzyme and a small disulfide-bonded inhibitor, is several  orders of magnitude slower than that of the Fas-AChE  interactions.
  Despite these results, we found that both kon and koff of FasAChE interactions could be further enhanced through mutations  with equal probability.
However, sometimes enhancement in one  parameter leads to a compromise in the other, resulting in no  improvement in Kd.
Mutations that were identified here to  improve kon were all polar in nature and improve long-range electrostatics as in some previous design studies (Selzer et al., 2000).
  Both polar and hydrophobic mutations were identified to  improve koff, resulting in larger burial of the hydrophobic surface  area and creation of new hydrogen bonds.
  In conclusion, we explored binding landscapes of two homologous high-affinity complexes using both computational and  experimental means and demonstrated that the two landscapes  are typical for high-affinity PPIs.
We showed that the sequence  of one binding partner (Fas) is close to optimum when interacting with its targets (tAChE and especially hAChE).
However,  mutations at positions that presently are not involved in  intermolecular interactions resulted in further improvement of  fitness.
We showed that kinetics of binding could be quite  different for two homologous PPIs, and both association and  dissociation rates could be further enhanced through mutations.
  Last of all, we demonstrated that binding landscapes in PPIs  could be well approximated by computational landscapes produced by a simple protocol for the DDGbind prediction presented  in this work.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  In Silico Saturated Mutagenesis of the Fas-AChE Interface  The residues on Fas that are within 4 A of tAChE/hAChE in the Fas-tAChE/FashAChE complex structures (Kryger et al., 2000; Harel et al., 1995) were defined  as Fas binding interface (positions 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 27, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 47, and  61).
For each of the binding interface position, we define a set of shell positions  including the residues on tAChE/hAChE that are within 4 A from the considered  Fas position and the residues on Fas that are within 3 A from the considered  position.
For each binding interface position, we then perform 18 calculations,  when the considered position on Fas is either kept WT or is replaced with  another amino acid, all except for Pro, Cys, and Gly.
During the calculation,  the shell and the interface residues are repacked, and the energy of the FasAChE complex is calculated for the WT and for the mutated complex.
We  then separate the two chains and calculate the energy of each unbound chain  separately either without further repacking of the side chains or with repacking  (as stated in the text).
The intermolecular energy was calculated by subtracting  the energies of the single chains (Fas and AChE) from the total energy of the  complex.
DDGbind is calculated as the intermolecular energy of the mutant  subtracted by the intermolecular energy of the WT complex.
Finally, the obtained DDGbind was normalized according to a linear equation obtained in  our previous work where the correlation between various experimental and  computed DDGbind values were tested (see Figure 3F in Sharabi et al.,  2011).
Rotamer libraries used for design were based on the backbone-dependent library of Dunbrack and Karplus (Dunbrack and Karplus, 1993) with  additional rotamers expanded by 1 SD around their mean c1 and c2 values.
  For the calculations, we used ORBIT software with the energy function  optimized by our group for design of protein-protein interactions (Sharabi  et al., 2011).
The lowest-energy rotameric conformation of each mutant was  found using the Dead-End Elimination theorem (Desmet et al., 1992; Gordon  et al., 2003).
All optimizations were performed using a cluster of Xeon  computers.
  Fas Mutant Construction  Gene constructs for Fas mutants were constructed from the WT Fas gene  using either the standard site-directed mutagenesis procedure or the  Transfer-PCR (TPCR) procedure (Erijman et al., 2011).
WT Fas and mutants  were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and refolded from inclusion bodies using  a protocol reported in our previous work (Sharabi et al., 2009).
The success of  refolding was verified by checking the concentration of free thiols, by gel filtration chromatography, and for some mutants by performing Circular Dichroism  measurements (see Figure S1 for details).
  Enzyme Preparations  Both enzymes tAChE and hAChE were gifts form Prof. Israel Silman. Whereas  tAChE was purified from the electric organ tissue of T. californica (Sussman  et al., 1988), hAChE was expressed recombinantly.
  Measurement of the Kinetic and Thermodynamic Parameters for  Fas-AChE Interactions  The equilibrium binding affinity and kinetic rates between Fas mutants and  t/hAChE were measured by performing the enzyme activity assay using the  colorimetric detection of AChE product in the presence and the absence of  Fas inhibitor at conditions where binding between the two proteins approaches equilibrium (Sharabi et al., 2009).
For this purpose, mixtures of  AChE at 0.02 nM and of a Fas variant in at least 10-fold excess over the  AChE concentration were pre-incubated with 0.6 mM of 5,50  -dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) for a variable period of time in a 50 mM phosphate  buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 0.025% NaN3 at pH 8.0 (ionic strength  of 0.15 M) and for low ionic strength experiments in the 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 0.025% NaN3 at pH 8.0 (ionic  strength of 0.057 M).
AChE enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition  of the AChE substrate acetylthiocholine iodide (ATC) at 1 mM. When ATC is  cleaved by AChE, it reacts with DTNB, producing absorbance at 412 nm.
  Hence, AChE activity was measured by monitoring the absorbance increase  at 412 nm over 1 min.
The percent of AChE activity for the sample pre-incubated with Fas for a certain time was calculated by dividing the measured  AChE activity of the sample by that of the sample containing AChE in the  Table 2.

  Analysis of Mutational Effects on Binding in Various High-Affinity  PPIs  Mutational data for high-affinity complexes were downloaded from the  SKEMPI database.
The data set incorporated single mutations in the following  Protein Data Bank (PDB) numbers: 1CSE, 1ACB, 1TM1, 1SIC, 1IAR, 1EMV,  1BRS, 1JTG, 2O3B, 2J0T, 1MAH, 1EAW, 3BN9, 3NPS, 2FTL, 1Z7X, 1A4Y,  1DAN, 3HFM, 1CHO, 1PPF, 1R0R, and 3SGB.
The data contained 1,205  mutations, 17% (205) of which were mutations to Ala. DDGbind values were  calculated from the Kds of the mutant and WT proteins and a histogram of  these values was plotted on Figure 4.
Due to uncertainties in measuring and  predicting very large destabilizing DDGbind values, we introduced a cutoff of  6 kcal/mol for both experimental and computational data.
