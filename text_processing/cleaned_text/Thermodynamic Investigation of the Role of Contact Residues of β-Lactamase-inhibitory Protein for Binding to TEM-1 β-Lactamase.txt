M611548200  Jihong Wang  , Zhen Zhang  , Timothy Palzkill  , and Dar-Chone Chow1  From the   Department of Chemistry, University of Houston, Houston, Texas 77204-5003 and the   Structural and Computational  Biology and Molecular Biophysics Program,   Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and   Department of  Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030  We have determined the thermodynamics of binding for the  interaction between TEM-1 -lactamase and a set of alanine substituted contact residuemutants of-lactamase-inhibitory protein  (BLIP) using isothermal titration calorimetry.
The binding enthalpies for these interactions are highly temperature dependent, with  negative binding heat capacity changes ranging from 800 to  271 cal mol1 K1  .
The isoenthalpic temperatures (at which the  binding enthalpy is zero) of these interactions range from 5 to  38 C.
The changes in isoenthalpic temperature were used as an  indicator of the changes in enthalpy and entropy driving forces,  which in turn are related to hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions.
A contact residue of BLIP is categorized as a canonical residue if its alanine substitution mutant exhibits a change of  isoenthalpic temperature matching the change of hydrophobicity  because of the mutation.
A contact position exhibiting a change in  isoenthalpic temperature that does notmatch the changein hydrophobicity is categorized as an anti-canonical residue.
Our experimental results reveal that the majority of residues where alanine  substitution results in a loss of affinity are canonical (7 of 10), and  about half of the residues where alanine substitutions have a minor  effect are canonical.
Theinteractions between TEM-1-lactamase  and BLIP canonical contact residues contribute directly to binding  free energy, suggesting potential anchoring sites for binding partners.
The anti-canonical behavior of certain residues may be the  result of mutation-induced modifications such as structural rearrangements affecting contact residue configurations.
Structural  inspection of BLIP suggests that the Lys74 side chain electrostatically holds BLIP loop 2 in position to bind to TEM-1 -lactamase,  explaining a large loss of entropy-driven binding energy of the  K74A mutant and the resulting anti-canonical behavior.
The anticanonical behavior of theW150A mutant may also be due to structural rearrangements.
Finally, the affinity enhancing effect of the  contact residue mutant Y50A may be due to energetic coupling  interactions between Asp49 and His41.
  Protein-protein interactions are critical for any living organism.
Their roles are vital in most biological processes, including metabolism, immune responses, signal transduction, gene  regulation, and enzymatic regulation.
Most noncovalent protein-protein interactions involve many contacts and interactions, which in turn combine into a macromolecular binding  interaction with the needed specificity and affinity.
Understanding the principles behind the affinities and specificities of  protein-protein interactions will provide leads in developing  new methods and reagents for protein-protein interactions.
  Recent advances in the structural biology of protein-protein  interactions have revealed the complexity of structure-function  relationships (1).
  In general, a protein-protein binding interaction involves a  relatively planar interface with a large contact interface area  (typically 1000 2  ) and a large number of contact residues  (10) (2 4).
With a maximal contribution of 120 cal/(mol 2  ),  the typical interaction strength of 13 kcal/mol is only a fraction of the maximum available (5).
One major consistent observation of many studies is the presence of so-called hotspots in  protein-protein interactions (69).
Among all of the contact  residues, only a small subset (called hotspot residues) contributes the majority of the binding free energy (9).
The alanine  substitution of any of these hotspot contact residues results in a  significant loss of binding free energy, whereas the alanine substitution of other contact residues does not change the binding  free energy.
  Based on simple physical considerations, the side chain of a  contact residue could contribute to the binding energy of a  complex either directly or indirectly or in both ways (1012).
  Direct contributions are the result of the favorable interactions  between the side chain and the interacting protein partner.
  Indirect contributions result from the enhancement by the contact residue to other contact residues (energetic coupling)  and/or the alteration of contact interactions due to structural  rearrangements.
With limited structural and binding information, predicting the direct and indirect contributions from a  contact residue is difficult.
In this study, the binding thermodynamics (binding enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity change in  addition to binding free energy) of alanine substitutions of contact residues was determined to assess how individual contact  residue contribute to the final binding free energy.
The binding  thermodynamics of the mutants not only describe the changes  in binding affinity but also changes in the nature of the driving  * This work was supported by Scientist Development Grant 0435186N from  the American Heart Association and startup funding from the University of  Houston and the Institute for Molecular Design (to D.

282, NO. 24, pp. 17676 17684, June 15, 2007   2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

For instance, a mutation that decreases  the binding free energy could do so either via changes in the  enthalpy or entropy driving forces or a combination of both.
  For residues in which side chains contribute directly to binding  through interaction with the target protein, the changes in  binding thermodynamics should approximately correlate with  the expected changes in the physiochemical nature of mutation  (e.g. a polar to nonpolar mutation should increase entropy driving forces).
We have categorized the contact residues with  mutations that exhibit this correlation as canonical residues.
  For residues that make an indirect contribution to binding, the  thermodynamics may not correlate with the physiochemical  nature of the mutation.
For example, an alanine substitution  that decreases residue hydrophicity but exhibits changes in the  enthalpy rather than the entropy driving forces may be the  result of a change in the positioning of a neighboring polar  residue due to the mutation of the residue under study.
These  contact residues are categorized as anti-canonical.
The scenario of the structural rearrangement can be established with  detailed structural information.
The analysis of thermodynamic and structural information could provide detailed information of the role of interface residues for binding interactions,  and this information could be used in the future design of tight  binding peptides or small molecules that could serve as inhibitors of -lactamase.
  -Lactam-based antibiotics specifically inactivate glycopeptide transpeptidases to prevent the formation of bacterial cell  walls thereby leading to the lysis of the bacteria.
This group of  antibiotics is currently among the most widely used antimicrobial therapeutics.
-Lactamases provide for resistance to these  antibiotics by selectively cleaving the amide bond in the -lactam ring.
There are four major classes of -lactamases (AD)  (14).
Class A -lactamases are prevalent in the clinical setting  and confer infectious bacteria with resistance to -lactambased antibiotics.
Among the class A -lactamases, TEM-1  -lactamase is the most prevalent among Gram-negative bacteria and has been a subject of concern because of its ability to  hydrolyze a range of -lactam-based antibiotics (15).
  BLIP2 is a 165-amino acid protein produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus, which potently inhibits the  TEM-1 -lactamase (16).
BLIP has a tandem repeat structure of  a 76-amino acid  domain (17).
These two tandem domains  form a -saddle with a relatively hydrophobic concave surface.
  The saddle-like concave surface of BLIP binds on the loop-helix  region of TEM-1 and extends two loops around the edge of the  loop-helix section into the substrate binding pocket of the  TEM-1.
The Asp49 residue of BLIP on one of the loops (loop 1)  occupies the catalytic site of TEM-1 -lactamase (17).
  The BLIP system is a protein-protein interaction model for  which a relatively complete set of data of alanine-scanning  experiments exists (18).
Alanine-scanning analysis has revealed  that: 1) there are two hotspots on the interacting surface of  BLIP, and 2) one mutation (Y50A) actually increases binding  affinity for TEM-1 -lactamase by 50-fold (8).
Several weak  binding peptide inhibitors for TEM-1 have been generated,  among which two are the TEM-1-contacting fragments of BLIP  (19, 20).
The contacts of these peptides potentially can be  strengthened to create tight binding inhibitors with appropriate enhancement of binding forces.
  This study provides a detailed thermodynamic characterization of the interactions between TEM-1 -lactamase and the  BLIP alanine-scanning mutants.
The measurements and analysis have categorized the BLIP contact residues into four types:  canonical hotspot, canonical non-hotspot, anti-canonical  hotspot, or anti-canonical non-hotspot residues.
The information generated here provides insight into the determinants of  molecular recognition between BLIP and -lactamase that  should be useful in the design of BLIP derivatives with altered  binding specificity.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  MaterialsTalon resin was purchased from Clontech  (Mountain View, CA).
Ion exchange media and columns  (Mono Q 5/50 GL, HighTrap Q, Q Sepharose Fast Flow) and  sizing columns (Superdex 75 10/300, Superdex 75 prep grade)  were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.
All other  reagents are reagent grade from Sigma.
  Protein Expression and PurificationAll expression DNA  clones were constructed previously (8), and the proteins were  expressed and purified using a previously described procedure  with minor modifications.
Briefly, Escherichia coli bacteria  (strain RB791) containing BLIP mutant expression plasmid  were grown in LB medium containing 17.5 g/ml chloramphenicol at 37 C from a single clone and induced with 2 mM  lactose and 1% glycerol instead of isopropyl 1-thio--D-galactopyranoside when theA600 nm was 1.2.
The culture was incubated at room temperature for 6 h and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 6 C.
The bacterial pellets were  resuspended in bacterial protein extraction solution (B-PER,  Pierce) or a prepared equivalent (1% Triton-X 100 in 10 mM  Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) at a ratio of 15 ml/1 g of bacterial pellet.
The resuspensions were vigorously shaken for 20  min at room temperature and then centrifuged at high speed  (15,000 rpm in a Beckman type 35 rotor) for 30 min.
The supernatants were mixed by stirring with Talon cobalt resin overnight.
The Talon cobalt resin was allowed to settle by gravity  and then collected and washed three times.
The bound BLIP  mutant proteins were eluted from the Talon cobalt resins using  150 mM imidazole in Tris-buffered saline.
The bacteria containing TEM-1 -lactamase expression plasmid DNA was grown at  37 C and induced at A600 nm 0.6 with 0.3 mM isopropyl  1-thio--D-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 C.
The expressed  periplasmic protein TEM-1 was extracted by osmotic shock in  which bacteria were soaked with 20% sucrose solution at room  temperature and then centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was  resuspended in 5 mM ice cold magnesium sulfate.
The osmotic  shock fluid was fractionated on a DEAE column in 10 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 7, with 100 mM NaCl.
Flow-through material  was diluted 10-fold with distilled water and refractionated on  the DEAE column.
TEM-1 -lactamase was eluted with a 02  M NaCl gradient in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0.
The protein was  further purified using a Superdex-75 sizing column in 50 mM  phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 150 mM NaCl.

  Energetic Combination in BLIP-TEM-1 Binding  JUNE 15, 2007VOLUME 282NUMBER 24 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 17677   by guest on June 18, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis.
Protein concentrations were determined using optical density measurements at 280 nm with 8 M guanidine HCl-denatured protein  based on the theoretically calculated extinction coefficients  according to the amino acid sequence.
  Isothermal Titration Calorimetric MeasurementThe binding enthalpy measurements were carried out using a VP-ITC  isothermal titration calorimeter from MicroCal LLC (Northampton, MA).
Data processing was performed using the manufacturer-supplied software package, Origin 7.0 (OriginLab  Corp., Northampton, MA) with an ITC add-on.
Typical titration experiments were carried out by titrating 40 M TEM-1  -lactamase into 4 M BLIP mutant in PBS (50 mM phosphate,  pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl).
To avoid inconsistencies in different  protein preparations, we pooled enough TEM-1 -lactamase  (60 mg) to titrate many BLIP mutants and enough wild type  BLIP (7 mg) to use as the reference for every mutant titration.
  For this purpose, about 70 mg of TEM-1 was made and stored in  PBS.
The proton linkage effect was tested by measuring the  binding enthalpies of some BLIP mutants and TEM-1 -lactamase in Tris buffer.
The binding enthalpy in Tris buffer was  identical to that in phosphate buffer, suggesting that there is a  minimal proton linkage effect for the determinations.
  ITC experiments of each BLIP mutant binding to TEM-1  -lactamase were done in no less than three different temperatures within the range of 6 to 30 C.
The typical injection volume  was 15 l with a 300-s gap between consecutive injections.
  Because of diffusion around the tip of the injection syringe during  the lengthy waiting time before a titration starts, the first injection  tends to have a lesser signal.
To minimize this effect and preserve  materials, we set the first injection volume to 3 l. During data  processing, the data points from the first injections were normally  removed.
Binding affinities could not be determined accurately by  standard ITC for mutants exhibiting a binding affinity to the  TEM-1 -lactamase higher than 108 M1  ; however their binding  enthalpies are still valid.
A displacement ITC was used to determine the values for high affinity binding mutants.
  Displacement titrations were used to determine the binding  affinities for the mutants having binding affinity to TEM-1 of  108 M1 or more.
For each tight binding mutant, we looked for  a proper low affinity mutant as the competitive displaced  mutant in order to adjust the overall binding constant value to  between 105 and 107 M1 with appropriate enthalpy signals.
  The tight binding affinity mutant was titrated into the preformed complex between TEM-1 and the lower binding affinity  mutant.
The resulting apparent K value and H were used to  calculate the K and H of the tight mutant.
The following equations were used to calculate K and H of the tight mutant provided the displacement ITC were competitive (21, 22):  Happarent  Htight  Hlow  Klowmutantlow  1  Klowmutantlow] (Eq. 1)  Kapparent  Ktight  1  Klowmutantlow] (Eq. 2)  where Happarent, Htight, andHlow are the apparent enthalpy  of the displacement ITC, the binding enthalpy of the tight  mutant, and the binding enthalpy of the low affinity mutant,  respectively.
Kapparent, Ktight, and Klow are the apparent K of the  displacement ITC, the K of the tight mutant, and the K of the  low affinity mutant, respectively.
All parameters except Ktight  are measured either from displacement ITC or standard  ITC.
The first equation (Equation 1) provides a convenient  diagnostic tool to confirm that the displacement ITC is competitive.
Only when the first equation (Equation 1) was satisfied by the results of our measurements from displacement  ITC and standard ITC were we confident that the displacement ITC was competitive and the Ktight could be estimated  correctly using the second equation (Equation 2).
We also  processed the displacement ITC data using the manufacturer-supplied subroutine that was incorporated into the program package, and we found the two results to be virtually  identical when the displacement was competitive (less than  5% difference).
  In several cases, the displacement ITC failed to show competitiveness between the high affinity mutant and the low affinity mutant for the binding of TEM-1.
We did not incorporate  those data in our analysis.
  Structure-based Estimation of Thermodynamic Parameters  The solvent-accessible surface areas of the protein complexes  of TEM-1 and BLIP mutants were calculated as follows.
The  structures of the complexes of TEM-1 and BLIP mutants were  modeled by simple mutation on Coot (23) with the most favorable rotamer.
The accessible surface areas were calculated from  these modeled structures and the wild type structure (Protein  Data Bank code 1JTG) using the program AREAIMOL from the  CCP4 suite of programs with a probe of 1.4  (24).
  Hydrophobicity Calculations of the MutantsThe hydrophobicity scale of the mutation was calculated according to the  scale reported by Black and Mould (25).
For each mutant, the  hydrophobicity change was calculated by the difference  between the hydrophobicity of the wild type amino acid and  that of alanine.
  RESULTS  Thermodynamics of Binding of TEM-1 -Lactamase and  Wild Type BLIPIsothermal titration calorimetric measurements of the binding of TEM-1 -lactamase to wild type BLIP  (Fig. 1A) were performed.
At 10 C, at which the binding  enthalpy is highly unfavorable (H  5.4   0.2 kcal mol1  ).
  The binding enthalpy is, however, strongly temperaturedependent.
For temperatures below 15 C, the binding enthalpy  is positive; however, at temperatures higher than 25 C, the  binding enthalpy becomes negative (H  3.9   0.1 kcal  mol1 at 25 C).
Based on these results, we determined that the  binding heat capacity change for this interaction (Cp) is  672   35 calmol1  K1  .
Using the results for the temperature dependence of the binding enthalpy of this interaction, we  extrapolated an isoenthalpic temperature (at which H  0) of  19   1 C for formation of a complex between TEM-1 -lactamase and wild type BLIP (Fig. 1B).
At temperatures near 19 C  (1522 C), we found that titrations are difficult to interpret  because of the low signal.
It was further found that standard  isothermal calorimetric measurements underestimated the  binding affinity of this interaction (K was determined to 108  Energetic Combination in BLIP-TEM-1 Binding  17678 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282NUMBER 24JUNE 15, 2007   by guest on June 18, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from M1  ).
The actual binding affinity is 2   109 M1 (26, 27);  because titration conditions limited the number of data points  that could be obtained in the transition region, the accuracy of  the curve fitting used to obtain a binding affinity was also limited.
This is a well documented limitation in ITC titration (K   109 M1  ) (28).
Because of the underestimation, the binding  entropy obtained from these standard ITC measurements is  unreliable.
The enthalpy measurements obtained, however, are  accurate.
  To determine the binding affinity more accurately, a displacement scheme was used (29).
For these experiments, a solution of known concentration of a complex of TEM-1 -lactamase and a low affinity BLIP mutant was placed in the sample  cell of the calorimeter and titrated  with wild type BLIP.
The injected  wild type BLIP displaced the lower  affinity BLIP mutant from the complex.
The observed calorimetric  enthalpy and K value were used to  calculate the K value of the binding  of wild type BLIP and TEM-1 -lactamase-based on competitive binding kinetics according to published  methods (21).
  Thermodynamics of Binding  between TEM-1 -Lactamase and  BLIP MutantsWe further carried  out systematic isothermal calorimetric determinations of the binding thermodynamics for the interaction of TEM-1 -lactamase with  20 alanine substitution mutants of  BLIP contact residues.
Fig. 2 shows  representative raw titration curves  of the binding interaction between a  low affinity BLIP mutant and  TEM-1 -lactamase.
The binding  thermodynamics of 20 contact residue mutants with TEM-1 are listed  in Table 1.
The binding thermodynamics of hotspot residue mutants  were determined by standard ITC  measurements.
The typical c values (defined as K multiplied by the  concentration of protein in the sample cell) of these mutants range from  100 to 300.
It has been suggested  that c values should range from 5 to  500 for accurate determination of K  values (30).
Based on this criterion,  the hotspot mutants are well within  the appropriate range for accurate  determination of binding thermodynamics (binding free energy,  enthalpy, and entropy).
For the high  affinity mutants (K  109 M1  ), the c  values are 2000 or higher, and the K  values determined by standard ITC  are highly inaccurate because of the limited number of data  points in the transition region of the binding curve.
The standard ITC-determinedKvalues for these high affinity mutants are  at least 10-fold less than expected from the reported Ki values  (8, 18).
As in case of wild type BLIP, the binding enthalpies of  these high affinity mutants are accurate using standard ITC  measurements.
  Displacement ITC MeasurementsFurther experiments  were performed to determine the K values of a selected group of  high affinity mutants using displacement ITC.
To confirm that  the displacement ITC method is applicable in this system, the  displacement ITC measurements were performed with several  combinations of high and low affinity mutants.

However, the transition regions of the  curves are sharp and narrow, giving erroneous K values.

  Energetic Combination in BLIP-TEM-1 Binding  JUNE 15, 2007VOLUME 282NUMBER 24 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 17679   by guest on June 18, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from results reported in Table 1 include the observation that BLIP  Y50A has higher affinity than wild type, Y51A has the most  negative binding heat capacity changes, and Y143A is an anticanonical residue (see Discussion).
Some anomalies were  observed in the displacement ITC experiments.
For example,  the titration of wild type BLIP into a mixture of the R160A  mutant and TEM-1 -lactamase failed to exhibit any signal at  temperatures below 25 C.
We hypothesized that this was due  to the slow off-rate of the R160A BLIP mutant.
Results from  noncompetitive displacement measurements were excluded  from consideration.
  Analysis of Binding Thermodynamic ParametersAt 15 C,  four hydrophobic hotspot residues, Phe36, Tyr53, Trp112, and  Phe142 lose their entropy driving forces when replaced with  alanine, whereas the charged hotspot residues Asp49and Arg160  lose their enthalpy driving forces when replaced with alanine  (Fig. 3).
In addition, both histidine hotspot residues, His41 and  His148, lose entropy driving forces at 15 C when replaced with  alanine.
Unexpectedly, the charged lysine hotspot residue,  Lys74, loses entropy driving forces but exhibits increased  enthalpy driving forces.
Furthermore, the hydrophobic hotspot  residue Trp150 loses enthalpy driving forces rather than entropy  driving forces.
The alanine substitution of three non-hotspot  contact residues, Tyr51, Ser113, Arg144, results in no change in  either the enthalpy or the entropy driving forces, whereas substitution of four non-hotspot contact residues, Ser39, Gly48,  Ser71, and Tyr143, results in loss of enthalpy driving forces; but  this loss is compensated by increased entropy driving forces.
  Substitution of three other non-hotspot contact residues,  Tyr50, Glu73, Gly141, results in loss  of entropy, but this is compensated by increases in the enthalpy  driving forces.
Finally, the  enhancement of binding observed  for the Y50A mutant is associated  with an increase in enthalpy driving  forces.
  DISCUSSION  The range of the binding enthalpies determined here are within the  normal range for protein-protein  interactions (from 9 to 10 kcal  mol1 over a temperature range of 5  to 30 C).
The values of the binding  heat capacity changes for these BLIP  mutants and TEM-1 -lactamase  range from 271 to 800 cal mol1  K1 (667 cal mol1 K1 for the  wild type BLIP).
The empirical formula Cp  0.45 ASAnp  0.21  ASAp (where ASA is accessible  surface area) was used to calculate  an expected binding heat capacity  change of the wild type complex of  336 cal mol1K1 (a value of 2636  2 was used (17) as the total buried  surface area with 55% nonpolar (np)  and 45% polar (p)).
This empirically calculated value is significantly lower than the experimentally determined value for the  wild type complex.
Similar observations have been made for a  number of protein-protein interaction systems in which the  experimental binding heat capacity changes are significantly  more negative than predicted by the empirical formula (for  example, human growth hormone and receptor binding has a  992 cal mol1 K1 experimental value and a 366 cal mol1  K1 empirically predicted value based on the structure) (13).
It  is noticeable that the empirically calculated value is closer to  that of two weak mutants (W150A and D49A).
Both the broad  range of the experimental values and the discrepancy with the  empirically predicted values show that the relationship  between binding heat capacity changes and that buried surface  area could be influenced by other factors such as affinities.
  More than half of the BLIP mutants have a TEM-1 binding  affinity higher than the limits of the standard ITC measurements.
Displacement ITC was used to determine some of those  binding affinities, and the values obtained match well with  reported inhibition Ki values (8, 18) confirming that binding  and inhibition are the same process.
Despite the fact that the  displacement ITC titrations have limited signal to noise, the  method provided affinities with reasonable accuracy.
Because  free energy is a logarithmic function of the affinity constant,  the resulting binding free energy appears to be well determined.
  Displacement ITC does, however, require more of the purified  proteins, and the calculated entropies do carry slightly higher  error.
However, even with the limitations on affinity determinations, the standard ITC does provide accurate measurements  FIGURE 2.

  Energetic Combination in BLIP-TEM-1 Binding  JUNE 15, 2007VOLUME 282NUMBER 24 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 17681   by guest on June 18, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from of the binding enthalpies and the binding heat capacity  changes.
  At least at 15 C, the alanine substitutions of the hotspot residues cause the loss of binding free energy either mainly from  entropy or from enthalpy components (see Fig. 3).
At the same  temperature, some of the non-hotspot contact residues change  their entropy driving forces when replaced with alanine, but  changes in enthalpy driving forces compensate to maintain the  same binding free energy.
The Y50A mutant exhibits an enthalpy  driving force change that increases binding free energy by about 2  kcal/mol.
One problem we encountered in using the changes in  the entropy and enthalpy driving forces to characterize mutations was that this characterization is temperature-dependent.
  For instance, R160A exhibited a loss of binding free energy that  was mainly due to the loss of enthalpy driving forces at 15 C,  but at 6 C the lost binding free energy was due to the loss of  both enthalpy and entropy driving forces.
This is because there  were large differences in the binding heat capacity changes  among different mutants.
  To incorporate the binding heat capacity changes (Cp) in  this characterization, the isoenthalpic temperature (TH) was  used as an indicator for hydrophobic driving forces.
Based on  the data, an increase of the enthalpy driving term is consistent  with a decrease in isoenthalpic temperature, whereas an  increase of the entropy driving term is consistent with an  increase of isoenthalpic temperature.
The change in hydrophobicity of a position was calculated as the difference between the  hydrophobic scale of the substituted residue side chain and the  wild type side chain according to Black and Mould (25).
A plot  of the changes in hydrophobicity due to alanine substitution  versus differences in isoenthalpic temperatures is shown in Fig.  4.
Within the relevant range of temperatures, a binding interaction that exhibits a higher isoenthalpic temperature will also  exhibit a higher entropy driving term contribution.
The square  symbols (Fig. 4) represent the mutations that show an approximate correlation with hydrophobicity changes and isoenthalpic  temperature; they reside in the lower left and upper right quadrants.
The triangle symbols (Fig. 4) are the mutations exhibiting  opposite trends in isoenthalpic temperature compared with  changes in hydrophobicity; they reside in the upper left and  lower right quadrants.
  Among the BLIP contact residues, nine are polar or charged  and reside in the upper half of the plot (Fig. 4).
The binding  thermodynamics of the alanine substitution of these positions  should result in increased entropy driving forces, i.e. the  isoenthalpic temperatures should increase.
Eleven BLIP contact residues are nonpolar and located in the lower half of the  plot (Fig. 4); the binding thermodynamics of their alanine substitutions should show increases in enthalpy driving forces if  alanine substitution is deemed to reduce hydrophobicity or  increases in entropy driving forces if alanine substitution is  deemed to strengthen hydrophobic interaction.
Fig. 4 shows  that five of the charged polar contact residues and two of the  nonpolar contact residues behave oppositely to what is  FIGURE 3.

The  hatched bars represent the difference in binding enthalpy (Hmut  Hwt).

The binding enthalpy at 15 C is calculated using the  isoenthalpic temperatures (TH) and the binding heat capacity changes (Cp)  from Table 1.
The binding entropy terms are calculated using TS  G   H. The positive values indicate the loss of driving forces.
For clarity, no error  bar is presented.

The  changes in hydrophobicity are the differences between the hydrophobicity  scale of the wild type amino acid and that of alanine.

The squares represent residues that exhibit properties that are canonical, and the triangles represent  residues with anti-canonical properties (see Discussion for definitions).
  Energetic Combination in BLIP-TEM-1 Binding  17682 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282NUMBER 24JUNE 15, 2007   by guest on June 18, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from expected based solely on hydrophobicity.
These contact residues are termed anti-canonical, whereas those contact residues  that behave as expected are termed canonical.
A graphical representation of the canonical and anti-canonical contact residues on BLIP is shown in Fig. 5.
  Canonical Contact ResiduesFive of the non-hotspot contact residues, Ser39, Gly48, Tyr51 Ser71, and Ser113, are canonical  residues (Fig. 4).
Their alanine substitutions show relatively  small changes in binding free energy, binding enthalpy, or binding entropy or in the isoenthalpic temperature (see Figs. 3 and  4).
The side chains of these residues contribute very limited  driving forces to the binding free energy or binding thermodynamics.
These facts suggest that the corresponding locations on  TEM-1 -lactamase are relatively inert for protein interactions.
  Seven of the hotspot residues, Phe36, His41, Asp49, Tyr53,  Trp112, Phe142, and Arg160, are canonical residues.
The side  chains of the hydrophobic residues (Phe36, Tyr53, Trp112, and  Phe142) provide relatively large entropy driving forces to the  binding free energy (Figs. 3 and Fig. 4).
Similarly, the side chains  of the charged residues (Asp49 and Arg160) provide relatively  large enthalpy driving forces toward the binding free energy  (Figs. 3 and 4).
These results suggest the interactions between  these side chains and TEM-1 -lactamase contribute directly to  the binding free energy.
The side chain of His41 provides a  slightly less distinctive division between entropy and enthalpy  driving forces.
This may be simply because of the ambidextrous  properties of the imidazole side chain.
The canonical nature of  these hotspot residues suggests that the corresponding locations on the TEM-1 -lactamase have the physiochemical  properties to interact with these side chains to provide strong  binding forces.
A short BLIP fragment peptide containing one  of these residues (Asp49) has been shown to bind and provide  inhibitory activity toward TEM-1 -lactamase (20).
  Another strongly canonical residue is the Tyr50 contact residue, in that the mutant Y50A shows a large decrease in  isoenthalpic temperature suggesting an increase in hydrophilic  interactions such as hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.
The increase in hydrophilic interactions increases the  binding free energy by more than 1.5 kcal (Fig. 3).
This suggests  that there is strong energetic coupling among the neighboring  residues.
The Tyr50 side chain collides with Val216, Met129, and  Pro107 of TEM-1.
The collision restricts the interactions  between BLIP Asp49 and TEM-1 and between BLIP His41 and  TEM-1 (see Fig. 6).
The increased strength of the interactions  involving Asp49 and His41 after removal of the Tyr50 side chain  is consistent with the increase in the enthalpy driving forces,  thereby generating the decrease in isoenthalpic temperature.
  Anti-canonical ResiduesThe Tyr143 contact residue is  characterized as anti-canonical because the Y143A mutant  shows a large increase in the isoenthalpic temperature.
The  Tyr143 side chain makes direct a contact with Glu104 of TEM-1  -lactamase and an intramolecular contact with BLIP Lys74.
  The loss of the Tyr143 side chain may allow better hydrophobic  interactions, such as between BLIP loop 2 and TEM-1.
  The negatively charged BLIP residue Glu73 is an anti-canonical residue.
As noted previously, glutamate 73 forms hydrogen  bonds with the backbone amino groups of Tyr105 and Ser106 of  TEM-1 (8).
The E73A mutant shows a small decrease in  isoenthalpic temperature, suggesting a slight increase in hydrophilic interactions.
This is unexpected because the mutant loses  the side chain responsible for hydrophilic interactions (31).
  One explanation is that the loss of the negatively charged side  chain of Glu73 may allow a better electrostatic interaction  between BLIP Lys74 and TEM-1 and/or elimination of van der  Waals repulsion between the side chain of Glu73 and the backbone of the TEM-1.
  Among the hotspot contact residues, two residues, Lys74 and  Trp150, demonstrate anti-canonical behavior.
Mutant K74A  displays a decrease in isoenthalpic temperature, suggesting that  the loss of the charged side chain actually results in a loss of  hydrophobic interactions rather than hydrophilic interactions.
  This suggests that the side chain of Lys74 may be involved in  intramolecular interactions that increase the entropy driving  forces for TEM-1 binding.
Inspection of the structure of the  complex indicates the Lys74 nitrogen interacts with the oxygen  FIGURE 5.

TEM-1 is represented as an orange molecular surface.
Despite the  indentation on TEM-1 to accommodate the Tyr50 side chain, the removal of  the side chain will allow even better interactions between Asp49 and His41  with TEM-1.
  Energetic Combination in BLIP-TEM-1 Binding  JUNE 15, 2007VOLUME 282NUMBER 24 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 17683   by guest on June 18, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from of the backbone carbonyl between Gly141 and Phe142 (Fig. 7).
  This intramolecular interaction appears to be holding the second loop (amino acids 136144) like a flap onto itself and the  TEM-1 surface.
This loop has three residues that contact  TEM-1: Phe142, Tyr143, and Arg144.
A recent report shows that  this loop can undergo large rearrangements depending upon the  binding target (32).
This suggests that Lys74 plays a role in  the flexibility and energetic coupling with loop 2.
Finally, the  W150A mutant exhibits an increase in the isoenthalpic temperature, suggesting that the loss of the hydrophobic portion of the  residue actually results in a loss of hydrophilic interactions.
  Future structural elucidation of this complex may reveal the  detailed mechanism of this interaction.
  Based on this analysis, we hypothesize that the interactions  between the canonical hotspot contact residues and the TEM-1  -lactamase target protein are energetically favorable interactions that provide direct contributions to the binding free  energy.
The anti-canonical contact residues may interact with  TEM-1 through a combination of energetic coupling with other  contact residues and possible structural modifications.
The  interpretation of these results is based largely on consideration  of BLIP alone.
We assume that TEM-1 -lactamase changes  little between binding wild type BLIP versus a mutant BLIP.
  However, we cannot rule out that the observed thermodynamics may be due to changes in both BLIP and TEM-1 in the  complex in response to the BLIP mutation.
Ultimately, these  possibilities must be examined by elucidating the structures of  the complexes of TEM-1 -lactamase and the BLIP mutants,  studies that are in progress.
  Finally, the information generated here will be useful as a  guide for future mutagenesis efforts to develop BLIP derivatives  with altered binding properties.
For example, it will be of interest to determine whether mutations in BLIP that alter its binding specificity occur preferentially at residues in the canonical  or the anti-canonical category.

Structural representation of interactions between loop 2 of  BLIP with BLIP residue Lys74 and with TEM-1-lactamase.
Three residues,  Gly141, Phe142, and Tyr143 of BLIP loop 2 and Lys74, are displayed as a CPK  (Corey-Pauling-Koltun) representation, and TEM-1 is depicted as an orange  molecular surface.
Note the closeness (2.94 ) between the nitrogen (blue) of  the Lys74 side chain and the oxygen (red) of the carbonyl of the loop 2 backbone.
This proximity could be important for guiding Phe142 and loop 2 into  the cleft of TEM-1.
