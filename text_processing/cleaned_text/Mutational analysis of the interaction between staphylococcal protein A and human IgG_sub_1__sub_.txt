Five single  amino acid substituted mutant forms of Z were constructed  at the gene level, produced intracellularly in Escherichia coli,  purified to homogeneity and characterized.
Four of these Z  variants, designated Z(L17D), Z(N28A), Z(I31A) and  Z(K35A), were mutated in residues suggested to be involved  in binding, based on the three-dimensional structure of the  complex between a one domain protein A molecule and Fct  [Deisenhofer, J. (1981) Biochemistry, 20, 2361-2370]. The  fifth mutant protein, Z(F30A), had a mutation in a  phenylalanine residue whkh was not expected to be involved  in the interaction.
Analysis by far UV circular dkhroism  spectroscopy suggests that all Z mutant proteins have similar  folds.
Their respective binding to human monoclonal IgGt  and to human recombinant Fcj were studied in a competitive  binding assay using radioactively labeled Z as a tracer,  demonstrating that the mutant proteins with a substitution  in the postulated binding surface showed a weakened binding  to both the full-length antibody and the recombinant Fc,.
  The affinity constants of the interactions as well as relative  binding free energies from the parent Z molecule were  calculated.
These values were similar for each Z variant to  both IgG] and Fc], suggesting that Fc and not Fab binding  was measured also for IgGt  .
However, the binding strengths  differ significantly, and these binding properties were used  to compare the contribution of each mutated amino add  residue in the Fc interaction.
Z(F30A) was shown to have  binding properties similar to the parent Z molecule.
However,  the substitution was shown to result in a dramatic effect on  conformational stability of the mutant protein.
  Key words: protein engineering/protein-protein interaction/  recombinant DNA/staphylococcal protein A  Introduction  Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) is a cell wall-associated protein  exposed on the surface of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.
  The protein is a pathogenicity factor and acts by binding to the  constant region of many classes and sub-classes of mammalian  antibodies.
This activity has made SpA one of the most utilized  tools in the detection and purification of imrnunoglobulins [for  a review see (Langone, 1982)].
  The biochemical properties of SpA have been thoroughly  studied through the years.
It has a repetitive structure of five  immunoglobulin binding domains (E, D, A, B and C), each  consisting of  58 amino acid residues (Uhle'n et al., 1984).
The  domains are on average ~ 80% homologous at die amino acid  level (Uhlen et al., 1984; Nilsson et al., 1987).
The complex  between human FC[ and a 58 amino acid fragment spanning die  B domain of SpA has been crystallized and the structure has been  solved from X-ray diffraction analysis (Deisenhofer, 1981).
The  three-dimensional structure of the complex reveals two antiparallel a-helices on domain B interacting with both the CH2  and CH3 domains of Fcj.
Eleven residues of the protein A  domain and nine residues of Fc were suggested to be involved  in binding (Deisenhofer, 1981).
Recently, die secondary structure  of domain B in solution was determined by NMR spectroscopy  and a third helix was observed in die structure.
This helix is  packed against the omer two forming an anti-parallel three helical  bundle (Gouda era/., 1992).
  Here, we have started to undertake a mutational approach to  study the interaction between SpA and human FC], and the study  was initiated for two main reasons: (i) by a strategic mutational  approach, the contribution of each amino acid residue on binding  to different classes and sub-classes of immunoglobulins can be  measured.
This detailed analysis can be used to dissect which  residues are important for affinity and specificity; and (ii) it was  recently shown for the human growth hormone complex that  almost half of die residues suggested by crystallography to be  involved in the binding surface could indeed be substituted for  alanine residues without any measurable effect on binding (de  Voss etal., 1992).
In contrast, all residues that had been  identified by mutagenesis were also found at die interface in the  crystallographic structure of the complex.
These results strongly  motivate a mutagenesis approach to verify the importance of  residues involved in the binding of a complex which have been  defined by X-ray crystallography.
  In this paper a functional analog of domain B, designated  domain Z (Nilsson et al., 1987), has been used to analyze its  binding to human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG,).
Five  amino acid substituted Z variants were constructed.
Four of these  had substitutions in residues proposed to be involved in binding  (Deisenhofer, 1981) and the fifth was substituted in a hydrophobic  residue on the second helix, but on the opposite side to the  residues suggested to be involved in binding (Deisenhofer, 1981).
  The different proteins were analyzed in a competitive binding  assay using radioactively labeled Z as a tracer.
The results  demonstrate that die four mutant proteins wim substituted residues  in the binding interface have a weakened binding to Fc^ while  the mutant protein with die amino acid substitution in the predicted  helix 2/helix 3 interface has identical binding strength to Fc as  the parent Z molecule.
However, the binding strengdis of the  different mutant Z molecules differed significantly, and these  results are discussed.

Materials and methods  DNA preparations, enzymes and bacterial strain  All basic recombinant DNA methods were essentially as  described (Maniatis etal., 1989).
Oligonucleotides were  synthesized on a Gene Assembler Plus (Pharmacia Biosystems,  Sweden).
Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, Klenow  polymerase, T4 DNA polymerase, Taq polymerase, T4  polynucleotide kinase and nucleotides (Pharmacia, Sweden and  Boeringer Mannheim, Germany) were used according to the  recommendations provided by the suppliers.
Escherichia coli  strains RR1AM15 (Bolivar etal., 1977) and RV3O8 (Maurer  et al., 1980) were used as hosts for the plasmid constructions  and production of proteins.
  DNA constructions and mutagenesis  The plasmid pRIT28NZZ is a plasmid vector where the ZZ  structural gene is inserted into pRIT28 (Hultman et al., 1988).
  The gene encoding ZZ was isolated using the primers RIT28  (5'-AAAGGGGGATGTGCTGCAAGGCG-3') and WAJO5  (5 '-CGGATCCATGGCAGGCCTTGCGCAACACGATGAAGCCGp with pEZZ318 (Nilsson et al., 1991) as a template.
The  plasmid pZ (Jansson et al., 1989), containing the gene coding  for the IgG binding domain Z followed by a TAG translational  stop codon, was restricted with Mlul and Kpnl.
The fragment  containing the 3' end of the Z structural gene was inserted into  pRIT28NZZ, resulting in the mutagenesis vector pRTT28NZ  containing the complete Z gene.
Site-specific mutagenesis was  performed using the solid phase in vitro mutagenesis method as  described by Hultman et al. (1990).
Streptavidin-coated magnetic  beads (Dynabeads M28O; Dynal A/S, Norway) were used to  immobilize DNA via an incorporated biotin.
Single-stranded  vector and insert fragments were obtained by elution with alkali.
  They were mixed to form a gap-duplex plasmid through  flanking, complementary double-stranded regions.
The insert  template, containing the Z gene, was generated using PCR with  two oligonucleotide primers, RIT28 and RIT29 (5'-biotinTGCTTCCGGCTCGTATGTTGTGTG-3').
The vector  fragment was obtained by site-specific restriction followed by  a fill-in reaction using biotin-16-dUTP (Boeringer Mannheim).
  Single-stranded inserts containing the desired mutations were  synthesized using one general oligonucleotide primer, RTT67 (5'-  AGCACTCCATTGTCATGGTTCAGGCTGCGC-3'), and five  primers introducing mutations. [For Z(L17D), 5'-TAGGTAAATGATCGATCTCATAG-3'; Z(N28A), 5'-GATGAAGGCGGCTCGTTGTTC-3'; Z(F30A), 5'-ACTTTGGATGGCGGCGTTTCG-3'; Z(D1A), 5'-TAAACTTTGGGCGAAGGCX}TT-3';  and Z(K35A), 5'-TGGGTCATCTGCTAAACTTTG-3'.] After  transformation, mutant genes were identified directly by DNA  sequencing using the dideoxy method (Sanger et al., 1977) on  double-stranded template or by solid phase sequencing (Hultman  et al., 1988).
The parent and mutated fragments of the Z gene  were cleaved out with Mlul and Kpnl and cloned into an  intracellular expression vector pHAZY:BPTI (Altman et al.,  1991) cleaved with the same enzymes.
The resulting plasmids  encode each Z variant, respectively, with eight amino acids from  the TrpLE peptide (MKAIFVLN) fused at the N-terminus.
  Transcription is under control by the E.coli trp promoter  (Yansura, 1990).
  Production and purification of proteins  Escherichia coli RV308 (Maurer et al., 1980) transformed with  the expression vectors, respectively, were grown at 37C  overnight in 2 (X) YT medium supplemented with 15 jig/ml  tetracycline (Tc).
The overnight cultures were diluted 1:25 in  M9 growth medium (Maniatis et al., 1989) supplemented with  0.5% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.01%  thiamine hydrochloride and 15
/xg/ml Tc.
Induction was  performed by addition of 25 /ig/ml /3-indole acrylic acid at midlog  growth phase.
The cells were grown for additionally 6 h and  subsequently harvested by centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 min.
  The cell pellet was resuspended in TST (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH  7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween) and subsequently disrupted  by sonication for 5 X 30 s using a Sonifer Cell Disruptor B15  (Branson, USA) equipped with a micro tip.
After centrifugation  at 10 000 g for 10 min, the supernatant was passed over an IgG  Sepharose FF (Pharmacia Biosystems, Sweden) column,  equilibrated with TST.
The column was washed with 10 column  vol of TST and two column vol of 0.5 mM ammonium acetate,  pH 5.5.
The protein was subsequently eluted with 0.3 M acetic  acid titrated to pH 3.2 using ammonium acetate.
Further  purification by ion exchange chromatography was performed on  a Mono S 10/10 column in the FPLC system (Pharmacia,  Sweden).
The column was eluted using buffers A (20 mM  ammonium acetate) and B (0.5 M ammonium acetate titrated to  pH 4.0 using acetic acid) by forming a linear gradient from 0  to 50% B in 20 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min.
  Analysis of mutant proteins  Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli,  1970) using the Phast system (Pharmacia Biosystems, Sweden).
  Amino acid compositions were determined by hydrolyzing each  peptide in 6 M HC1 at 155C for 45 min followed by separation  on an ion-exchange column and detection of amino acids by  ninhydrin.
The analysis was done on a Beckman 6300 amino acid  analyzer, equipped with System Gold data handling system  (Beckman, USA).
  Circular dichroism (CD) spectra, were collected in a J-720  spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Japan) at room temperature in  20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5.
The scanning speed was 10  nm/min and each spectrum was averaged from five subsequent  scans.
Cell path length was 1 mm and protein concentration was  0.1 mg/ml.
  Guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) denaturations at  equilibrium were measured at 23 C by CD at 222 nm using a  protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and cell path length of 1 mm.
  These data were used to calculate apparent fraction of unfolded  protein (F^. Equilibrium unfolding parameters were derived  by fitting the data to a two-state unfolding process (Hurle et al.,  1990), where F ~ = Kl{\ + K) and K is the equilibrium  constant in the unfolding process N ^ U, where N is the native  state and U is the unfolded state of the protein.
The change in  free energy, AG, will vary linearly with denaturant concentration  according to AG = AG-A(Gdn-HCl), where AG represents  the difference in free energy between N and U in the absence  of denaturant and/4 is a constant.
The midpoint of the transition  is calculated simply by setting AG = 0.
The change in  conformational free energy (AAG) caused by a mutation was  calculated by comparing with a reference molecule, here Z,  according to Cupo and Pace (1983).
  lodination of tracer  A monovalent domain Z protein, with a C-terminal extension  of 17 amino acids (DANSRGSVDLQPSLSK), was used as tracer  in the competitive binding assays.
The tracer was labelled with  125I using Bolton Hunter reagent (Amersham, UK) according to  the supplier's recommendations.
   l25I-labelled protein was  separated from glycine conjugate and hydrolysis products by gel  442   at Carleton University on June 15, 2014 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Mutatkinal analysis of SpA  filtration on NAP5 (Sephadex G-25) column (Pharmacia  Biosystems, Sweden).
  Immunoglobulins  Monoclonal human IgG[ and antibody MO61 from hybridoma  cells (Ohlin et al., 1991) was kindly provided by Carl Borrebaeck  (University of Lund, Sweden).
The antibody was affinity purified  from conditioned culture media using protein G Sepharose FF  (Pharmacia Biosystems, Sweden) using the procedures  recommended by the supplier.
Purified monoclonal antibody was  analyzed by reduced and non-reduced SDSPAGE (Laemmli,  1970) using the Phast system (Pharmacia Biosystems, Sweden).
  A fusion protein, composed of the two N-terminal Greek-key  domains from T cell surface antigen CD4 fused to the Fc part  of human monoclonal IgG, (Traunecker etai, 1989),  designated CIM-Fc^ was kindly provided by Dr Klaus  Karjalainen.
  Competitive binding assay  A competitive binding assay was used to study the different Z  variants' ability to compete in the binding with the   125I-labeled  Z tracer to immobilized human IgG[ and CD4-FC|.
Microtiter  plates were coated with 50 /tl of human IgG! (10 /ig/ml) or  CD4-Fci (10 /tg/ml) in a carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6.
  The plates were incubated for 3 h at room temperature, washed  twice with PBS (1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4,  140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KC1, pH 7.3) and finally with PBS  containing 1 % gelatin (Bethesda Research Laboratories, USA)  to block non-specific binding sites.
A fixed amount of   125Ilabeled tracer (3xl0~1 3   mol) was mixed with a serial dilution  of unlabeled Z proteins, from a 600-fold molar excess  (1.8x10-' mol).
All proteins were diluted in PBS containing  0.5% gelatin and added to the coated wells in a volume of 50 /tl.
  As a control, and as the reference point for inhibition, unlabeled  protein was omitted.
The plates were incubated at room  temperature for 3 h and washed twice with 0.5% gelatin in PBS,  and the c.p.m. for all samples were determined.
All competition  experiments were performed in duplicates at three separate  occasions.
  Calculation of affinity constants  Affinity constants (KJ were determined by computer analysis  of the data obtained in the competitive binding assay, using the  program LJGAND (Munson and Rodbard, 1980), revised version  2.3.11: May 1987.
Approximation by Cheng-Prusoff (Munson  and Rodbard, 1980) was used to calculate the affinity constant  for Z(L17D).
  Computer graphics  The computer graphics analysis was performed by displaying the  domain B-Fcj structure using the software INSIGHT II  (Biosym, USA) and the Ifc2 coordinates (Deisenhofer, 1981)  in the PDB Brookhaven database.
The three helix model of Z  was generated by adding a third helix to the two helical X-ray  structure.
The positioning of the helix was guided by the  positioning of the first two residues of helix 3 in the X-ray  structure, which have helical torsion angles.
The generated model  is consistent with the recently published solution structure of  domain B of SpA (Gouda et al., 1992).
  Results  Design and construction of mutants  Based on the X-ray structure of the co-crystal between domain  B of protein A and Fci (Deisenhofer, 1981), we designed single  amino acid substitutions in the Z domain derived from domain  B in staphylococcal protein A (Nilsson et al., 1987).
Deisenhofer  identified 11 amino acid residues on domain B and nine amino  acid residues on FC] that are possibly involved in the binding.
  The contact surface between the two molecules was calculated  to 1200 A2   (Deisenhofer, 1981).
  To study the importance of individual amino acid residues on  binding, five residues with potentially interesting interactions were  substituted in five separate Z variants.
Four amino acid  substitutions are in residues suggested to be on the binding  surface.
One residue is not expected to be involved in binding.
  Mutated residues are indicated in Figures 1 and 2.
  The amino acid residues that were mutated were analyzed by  computer graphics using the coordinates of the complex and the  following possible interactions were found.
  L17 is situated in helix 1 (Figures 1 and 2) of the protein A  domain and has been suggested to participate in Fc binding  (Deisenhofer, 1981).
L17 is possibly involved in hydrophobic  contacts with main chain (Ca and Cp) of Q311 and with the  imidazole ring of H435 on Fc.
L17 also makes an intramolecular  hydrophobic contact with Dl of helix 2.
L17 was substituted with  N28  K35 F5  Fig. 1.

The third helix was  built based on the secondary structure assignments from NMR spectroscopy  (Gouda et aL, 1992).
Non-hydrogen atoms of side-chains of residues,  displayed as ball-and-stkk models, have all, except F30, been suggested to  be involved in the Fc interaction (Deisenhofer, 1981).
Side-chains of  residues that were mutated in this study are displayed in grey and those that  were not mutated are shown in black.
The display was generated by the  program MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

Mutated residues, amino acid substitutions and designations of  mutant proteins are shown.
  aspartic acid.
By this mutation, the possible interaction with Q311  will be disrupted and the contact with the C{ methyl group of  131 will be removed.
  N28 is situated in helix 2 (Figures 1 and 2) of the protein A  domain and was shown to be involved in Fc interaction.
  N28 makes a possible hydrogen bond to the side-chain amide  group of Q311 on Fc.
N28 was changed into an alanine residue.
  This mutation will delete the possibility of forming this hydrogen  bond.
  D1 is situated in helix 2 (Figures 1 and 2) and was identified  to participate in Fc binding (Deisenhofer, 1981).
However, a  detailed analysis of the structure sugests that the side-chain of  131 is mainly involved in intramolecular hydrophobic contacts  with residues 116 (Cr2) and L17 (C$ and Cs) on helix 1.
There  is also a possible interaction with Fc on the aliphatic portion of  Q311 (Cp and Cy) but none of the distances between hydrogen  atoms on these carbon atoms and the closest hydrogen atoms on  131 (Cr2 and Ca) are within 2.5 A. 131 was substituted with an  alanine residue.
By this mutation, all of the mentioned possible  interactions by 131 will be removed.
  K35 is situated in helix 2 (Figures 1 and 2) and was identified  by Deisenhofer as a residue involved in Fc interaction.
However,  computer graphic analysis of the X-ray structure suggests that  the involvement of K35 is complicated and not obvious, in spite  of the fact that the K35 side-chain is pointing in the direction  of Fc.
In the X-ray structure, the charged side-chain interacts  with a possible sulfate group which may bridge over to K288  on Fc.
Also, the positively charged NH3 group on the lysine  side-chain is surprisingly close to one of the Cy methyl groups  of L309 on Fc.
In addition, the aliphatic side-chain of K35 may  participate in hydrophobic interactions with H310 and 1253 of  Fc.
K35 was substituted for an alanine residue.
By this mutation,  all possible interactions with L3O9 and H310 will be removed  and only a possible contact with 1253 will remain.
  F30 is situated in helix 2 (Figures 1 and 2) but is not involved  in binding.
In contrast, the side-chain is pointing in the opposite  direction to the residues involved in the binding (Deisenhofer,  1981).
It has recently been shown that the identified third helix  is packed against the other two to form a three-helix bundle  (Gouda et al., 1992).
In the solution structure of a protein A  domain, F30 is sandwiched between L44 and L51 on helix 3  (Gouda et al., 1992).
F30 was substituted with an alanine residue.

  Construction and production of Z variants  Solid phase in vitro mutagenesis was carried out without selection  or screening procedures and > 90% of the sequenced clones were  found to contain the desired mutation (data not shown).
The  mutant Z gene fragments were subsequently moved into the  efficient pHAZY:BPTI, an expression plasmid for intracellular  444   at Carleton University on June 15, 2014 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Mutational analysis of SpA  production Z fusion proteins in E.coli (Altman et al., 1991).
  Intracellular production levels of the single domain Z (Figure 3),  as well as the different mutant proteins (data not shown), were  found to be high.
The production level of soluble Z protein in  E.coli, grown in shaker flasks, was -200 mg/1 for all Z variants,  making the recombinant product the major component in the host  cell (Figure 3).
After cell disruption, all proteins were purified  by IgG affinity followed by cation exchange chromatography.
  The purification yield in the affinity chromatography step varied  for the different mutant proteins (data not shown), in correlation  with their relative binding strength (see below).
After purification,  the variants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (an example is shown  in Figure 3).
The purity was estimated to be >95%.
  Amino acid analysis of the mutated proteins  To determine the amino acid composition and concentration of  the Z variants, amino acid composition analyses were performed.
  The compositions were in good agreement with the calculated  ones derived from the putative amino acid sequences of each Z  protein.
Thus, compared to the parent Z protein, all mutant forms  were found to have elevated levels of the amino acid introduced,  an alanine residue or an aspartate residue respectively and lowered  levels of the amino acid substituted (data not shown).
  CD spectra of mutated Z proteins  To examine the relative secondary structure contents of the  mutated Z proteins, their CD spectra were collected (Figure 4).
  All spectra were found to be very similar to the spectrum for  the parent Z molecule.
They show minima at 208 and 222 nm  in combination with a maximum between 192 and 194 nm,  indicating a-helicity, which is in good agreement with that found  in the secondary structure assignments from NMR (Torigoe  et al., 1990).
Also, the amplitudes in the spectra are similar.
  However, there is a slight change in the 192 maximum for  Z(F30A) towards lower wavelength, but with maintained  amplitude relative to the parent Z molecule.
  Gdn-HCl unfolding equilibrium studies ofZ(F3QA)  Four of the five mutant proteins had amino acid substitutions in  residues suggested to be involved in Fc binding.
The fifth mutant  protein, Z(F30A), had a substitution in the hydrophobic residue  situated in the interior of the protein if the third helix (Torigoe  et al., 1990) is packed against the other two, as indicated in  Figure 1.
The conformational stability of Z(F30A) was compared  with the stability of the parent Z molecule and one of the surface  mutants, Z(N28A).
The fraction of unfolding as a function of  Gdn-HCl concentration is shown in Figure 5.
Z(N28A) shows  a similar unfolding curve to the parent Z molecule.
However,  Z(F30A) is significantly destabilized.
Calculated free energy  differences show that the Z(F30A) protein is destabilized by  3.5 kcal/mol compared with Z (Table I).
  Comparative binding studies ofZ and its mutants to lgGt   and Fcj  The relative binding characteristics of Z and the five mutants  to human IgGi and Fc! were determined in a competitive  binding assay using a l25I-labeled tracer.
The ability of a protein  to inhibit the binding of the labeled protein was measured for  different concentrations of the non-labeled protein.
The inhibition  curves show that we have, by introducing point mutations in  binding amino acids, reduced the inhibiting capacity of the Z  domain.
The immobilized protein was either human IgGi  (Figure 6) or the recombinant fusion protein CD4-Fci lacking  the Fab fragment of native IgGj (Figure 7).
The loss in  inhibiting capacity is most severe for Z(B1A), but there is also  - 40000-1  180 200 210 220 230  Wavalength[nm]  240 250  Fig. 4.

However, an affinity constants could not be  determined for Z(L17D) to either human IgG, or CD4-Fci  using the LIGAND software.
Instead, the Cheng-Prusoff correction was used to calculate the affinity constant from the ED^  value (Munson and Rodbard, 1980).
Based on the determined  affinity constants, the change in free energy in binding were  calculated for the mutants relative to that of the non-mutated Z,  as A AC (kcal/mol) in Table II.
  Discussion  In this paper we have analyzed the binding of a one domain  protein A analog to human IgG^ Five mutant proteins (Figures  1 and 2), based on a single domain protein A analog (NUsson  et al., 1987), were constructed, produced intracellularly in E.coli  and purified to homogeneity (Figure 3).
  The purified Z proteins were characterized by amino acid  composition analysis, confirming the absence of the mutated  residue and the appearance of the substitution, respectively (data  not shown).
The different Z variants were further analyzed by  CD spectroscopy (Figure 4), showing that all six spectra are  similar, both in position of minima and shoulders, as well as in  amplitudes.
The minor differences in amplitudes are within the  expected effect caused by the estimated 10% error in the analysis  of protein concentration.
These results indicate that all six purified  Z variants have similar folds.
  The binding properties of the six recombinant Z variants to  human IgG! were performed in a competition assay using  radioactively labelled Z as a tracer.
The labelling was performed  using the Bolton- Hunter method, reacting with primary amine  groups, since the more commonly utilized method of iodination,  reacting primarily with tyrosine side-chains, abolishes most of  the binding (Eliasson, 1990).
The binding studies were performed  with both IgGi and a CD4-Fci fusion protein (Traunecker et al.,  1989).
The CD4 moiety was earlier shown to possess no  detectable binding to protein A in a similar competition assay  Table II.

Indeed, calculated affinity constants to both  IgG, and CD4-Fc, are very similar for all six analyzed Z  variants (Table 2).
Therefore, we conclude that the determined  affinity constants are with Fc and not with Fab, to which SpA  has been shown to have a weak binding [for a review see Langone  (1982)].
  The results of the binding assays show that all four mutant  proteins with single amino acid substitutions in the proposed  binding region have weakened binding to Fc.
Leucine 17 makes  both an intermolecular contact with the aliphatic part of Q311  on Fc and an intramolecular contact with 131 on helix 2 of the  SpA domain.
By mutating this residue to an aspartic acid, the  binding constant is decreased by a factor of ~ 5, corresponding  to ~ 1 kcal/mol in binding free energy (Table IT).
Asparagine  28 makes a hydrogen bond to Q311. According to our result,  this hydrogen bond is rather weak, contributing a factor of two  in affinity constant, corresponding to 0.5 kcal/mol in binding free  energy (Table II).
Isoleucine 31 may be involved in  intramolecular contacts with helix 1 of die SpA domain  (Figure 1).
There is also a possible, but not obvious contact with  the aliphatic portion of the side-chain of Q311 on Fc.
The  competitive binding assay shows that Z(I31A) has an affinity  constant lower by a factor of 50 than Z, corresponding to  2.5 kcal/mol (Table II).
The long side-chain of L35 is sticking  out from helix 2 in the direction of Fc in the complex (Figure 1),  possibly interacting with L288 on Fc through a sulfate ion.
There  are no other obvious interactions at the molecular level widi Fc  in the co-crystal structure, even though the aliphatic part of K35  is within 3.5 A of 1253 and H310 of Fc.
The affinity constant  to Fc, of the Z(K35A) mutant is lowered by a factor of >5  compared with the parent Z molecule, corresponding to a lowered  binding free energy of 1.2 kcal/mol (Table II).
Therefore, we  conclude that K35 is indeed involved in binding, in spite of the  fact no sulfate was added to the buffers in the binding assays.
  The mutation of F30, which is pointing towards helix 3 in the  three-helix model of Z (Figure 1), does not affect binding strength  in a significant way.
Thus, Z(F30A) has an affinity constant to  both IgG! and Fc, which is similar to the parent Z molecule  (Table IT).
  The largest effect upon binding, of the characterized Z mutants,  is observed in Z(I31A).
This is somewhat surprising since, even  though the residue has been suggested to be part of the binding  surface (Deisenhofer, 1981), the side-chain is mainly packed in  the contact surface beween helices 1 and 2, and shows no clear  contact to Fc in the co-crystal structure.
It was recently proposed  that there is a structural change in the side-chain orientations in  the helix 1-helix 2 packing in this region of SpA (e.g. L17)  upon its binding to IgG (Gouda et al., 1992).
We suggest that  this structural change could also be an explanation for the large  effect upon binding observed in the Z(I31 A) mutant protein.
We  like to propose that 131 stabilizes the helix 1-helix 2 contact  in the bound state.
Thus, the unbound state of the Z domain is  stabilized relative to the bound state in Z(I31A), favoring the  free form of Z in the mutant protein.
Also, a similar mechanism  could apply for Z(L17D).
Presendy, we are analyzing the kinetics  of binding of the different mutant proteins where differences in  on-rates of binding to Fc would support the hypothesis that a  structural change upon binding is taking place.
Further, the  hypothesis could be tested by mutating more residues in the helix  1-helix 2 interface around L17 and 131.
  In the recendy described solution structure of Z, the phenyl  side-chain of F30 was shown to be sandwiched between L44 and  L51 on helix 3 (Gouda et al., 1992).
Our analysis would indicate  that this Phe packing stabilizes the Z domain by 3.5 kcal/mol.
  In a control experiment, Z(N28A), containing a surface mutation,  was not significantly affected in its conformational stability.
  Further, the Z(F30A) mutant protein shows a minor change in  one part of the CD spectrum compared with the spectra of die  other Z proteins; the maximum at ~ 190 nm is shifted to a slightly  lower wavelength than for the odier proteins, but widi maintained  amplitude (arrow in Figure 3).
Positive CD in this part of die  far UV CD spectrum is specific for a-helicity in a protein (Yang  etal., 1986; Johnson, 1990).
In fact, die Z domain contains  - 75 % helix (Gouda et al., 1992).
However, me reason for die  minor wavelength shift is not known.
This discrepancy becomes  even more interesting since the Z(F30A) mutation was shown  to decrease die conformational stability, as demonstrated by  equilibrium unfolding by Gdn-HCl (Figure 5 and Table I).
We  like to postulate diat die minor changes observed in CD spectrum  of Z(F30A), relative to die odier Z variants in this study, result  from a minor change in the packing of die diree helices, but widi  maintained a-helical content.
  The free energy of unfolding of Z was determined to be  6.6 kcal/mol (AG).
This is only about half of what has been  determined as die average maximum stability for one domain  proteins (Privalov and GUI, 1988).
In contrast, under these  conditions, the melting temperature of Z was determined to be  > 90C, as determined bodi by differential scanning calorimetry  and diermal denaturation measured by CD (unpublished results).
  These properties, of a radier limited conformational stability  combined wim high denaturation temperature, were recendy also  observed for a one domain variant based on an IgG-binding  domain of streptococcal protein G (Alexander etal., 1992),  which is of similar size to Z. These stability properties were  suggested to be general for small proteins, a proposal which is  consistent with the results presented here for the conformational  stability of the Z domain.
  The expression system used is very efficient, and all mutant  proteins are produced at very high levels in soluble form in E. coli  (Figure 3).
In fact, the production levels of all Z variants analyzed  in this paper were produced at levels exceeding 200 mg/1 in a  shaker flask (data not shown), and we have not observed any  proteolytic degradation even after prolonged incubation in a  bioreactor (data not shown).
This may be considered surprising  since it has been suggested by previous reports diat one domain  protein A analogs are proteolytically unstable in E.coli, and can  only be produced at high levels in E.coli as fusion protein  inclusion bodies (Saito etal., 1989; Popplewell etal., 1991).
  The contradictory results presented in diis paper could be  explained by an increased proteolytic stability caused by the short  peptide sequence derived from die TrpLE leader sequence  (MKAIFVLN) fused at die N-terminus of die Z protein used in  diis study.
However, die reported instabilities of one domain  protein A was only defined by low production levels and not by  direct analysis of its half-life in vivo (Saito etal., 1989).
  Therefore, we suggest that possible explanations for die low  production levels in previous reports are simply less efficient  production systems and not product degradation.
Recendy, we  have used our production system to efficiendy isotopically enrich  Z with   13C and   15N.
