M207340200  Takako Sasaki, Pjotr G. Knyazev, Yuri Cheburkin, Walter Gohring, Dominic Tisi,  Axel Ullrich, Rupert Timpl, and Erhard Hohenester  From the Max-Planck-Institut fur Biochemie, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany and the Department of Biological  Sciences, Imperial College, London SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom  Receptor tyrosine kinases of the Axl family are activated by Gas6, the product of growth arrest-specific  gene 6.
Gas6-Axl signaling is implicated in cell survival,  adhesion, and migration.
The receptor-binding site of  Gas6 is located within a C-terminal pair of laminin Glike (LG) domains that do not resemble any other receptor tyrosine kinase ligand.
We report the crystal structure at 2.2- resolution of a Gas6 fragment spanning  both LG domains (Gas6-LG).
The structure reveals a  V-shaped arrangement of LG domains strengthened by  an interdomain calcium-binding site.
LG2 of Gas6-LG  contains two unusual features: an -helix cradled by one  edge of the LG -sandwich and a conspicuous patch of  surface-exposed hydrophobic residues.
Mutagenesis of  some residues in this patch reduces Gas6-LG binding to  the extracellular domain of Axl as well as Axl activation  in glioblastoma cells, identifying a component of the  receptor-binding site of Gas6.
  Gas6,1 the product of growth arrest-specific gene 6, belongs  to the vitamin K-dependent protein family, which is characterized by the presence of -carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues  mediating calcium-dependent phospholipid membrane binding  (13).
Gas6 consists of a Gla domain followed by four epidermal  growth factor-like (EG) domains and a pair of laminin G-like  (LG) domains.
The same domain organization is found in protein S (PS), a negative regulator of blood coagulation that  shares 40% sequence identity with Gas6 (1).
Vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins function in hemostasis and thrombosis (3).
A recent study using GAS6 knock-out mice showed that  Gas6 acts as a platelet-response amplifier in thrombosis by an  unknown mechanism (4).
  An important biological activity of Gas6 is its binding to and  activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) Axl (Ark,  Ufo, Tyro7), Sky (Rse, Tyro3, Dtk, Etk, Brt, Tif), and Mer (Eyk,  Nyk, Tyro12) (59).
Gas6 is the only known bona fide ligand of  the Axl RTK family, but PS can also activate these receptors  under non-physiological conditions (10, 11).
The biological consequences of RTK activation by Gas6 appear to be complex and  include cell growth and survival (1216), adhesion (17, 18), and  migration (19, 20).
Gene knock-out studies in mice indicate a  high level of redundancy as only mice lacking all three receptors manifest an overt phenotype, namely infertility due to  abnormal spermatogenesis (21) and a severe lymphoproliferative disorder accompanied by autoimmunity (22).
The fact that  these defects are distinct from the phenotype of the GAS6  knock-out mice could indicate the presence of additional  components in the Gas6-Axl system regulating cellular  homeostasis.
  Experiments with Gas6/PS chimeras demonstrated that the  LG domains of Gas6 fully contain the RTK-binding site (8).
The  equivalent region of PS is involved in non-physiological RTK  activation (11) and mediates PS binding to C4b-binding protein  (C4BP) (23, 24).
Axl family RTKs have ectodomains reminiscent of cell adhesion molecules consisting of two immunoglobulin-like domains followed by two fibronectin type III domains  (25, 26).
The Gas6-binding site has not been localized to any  RTK domain nor is the mechanism of activation known.
Because LG domains are not related to any of the established  families of RTK ligands, the available receptor-ligand complex  structures (2730) are not informative about the Gas6-Axl  system.
  LG domains consist of 180200 residues and are found in a  functionally diverse set of proteins, including extracellular matrix proteins, cell surface receptors, and hormone-binding proteins (31).
The structures of LG domains from the laminin 2  chain (32, 33), neurexin (34), and sex hormone-binding globulin  (SHBG) (35) revealed a -sandwich structure consisting of  1214 -strands.
A homology model of the LG domain pair of  PS, based on the structures available at the time, did not offer  any clues about the location of ligand-binding sites in PS or  Gas6 (36).
  Here we report the crystal structure of the LG domain pair of  human Gas6 (Gas6-LG), which reveals significant differences  to the LG pair from the laminin 2 chain, including a conspicuous patch of surface-exposed hydrophobic residues.
Mutagenesis of some of these residues is shown to have a marked effect  * This work was supported by grant Ti95/8-1 from the Deutsche  Forschungsgemeinschaft (to R. T.) and a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship in Basic Biomedical Science (Reference 54334) (to  E. H.).

  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Protein Production and MutagenesisA full-length cDNA coding for  human Gas6 was prepared using mRNA from normal breast epithelium  cell line MCF-10a as a template (kindly provided by Tatjana Knyazeva).
  This cDNA and a human expressed sequence tag clone (AI 129327) were  used to obtain expression vectors for the LG modules in the pCEP-Pu  plasmid following previous protocols (37).
The oligonucleotide primers  used for amplification were: G6-1, 5-GTCAGCTAGCCCACTGTGACGGGCGTGGGGG; G6-2, 5-GTCAGGATCCCTAGGCTGCGGCGGGCTCC; G6-3, 5-GTCAGGATCCCTATCTCTCCGTCACCGAGAAG; G6-4,  5-GTCAGCTAGCAGGCTCTTTCTACCCCGGGAG.
These primers introduced an NheI site at the 5-end and a BamHI site at the 3-end to  allow insertion into the pCEP-Pu vector after the BM-40 signal peptide.
  The combinations G6-1/G6-2 were used for the Gas6-LG vector (residues 261678), G6-1/G6-3 for the Gas6-LG1 vector (residues 261476),  and G6-4/G6-2 for the Gas6-LG2 vector (residues 477678).
Point mutations were introduced by fusion PCR.
The correct sequence (wild type,  GenBank accession code L13720) was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
  The episomal expression vectors were used for the transfection of human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells (37).
  Conditioned serum-free medium (1 liter) was passed over DEAEcellulose equilibrated in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and the recombinant  proteins were eluted with a linear 00.5 M NaCl gradient (800 ml).
  Gas6-LG eluted at 0.080.15 M NaCl, and LG2 eluted at 0.150.20 M  NaCl.
Final purification was achieved on a Superose 12 column equilibrated in 0.02 M ammonium acetate, pH 6.8.
Both Gas6-LG (molecular  mass, 51 kDa) and Gas6-LG2 (20 kDa) eluted at positions expected for  monomers.
Disulfide bridges in Gas6-LG were reduced in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride as described previously (38).
Digestions with  endoproteinase Glu-C were performed in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for  24 h at 37 C at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 and examined by  SDS-PAGE.
  An expression vector for the extracellular domain of human Axl  (Axl-ex) was produced by inserting the cDNA coding for residues 1410  into the pcDNA3-GST vector (Invitrogen).
The Axl-ex-GST fusion protein was purified from the conditioned medium of stably transfected 293  cells on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturers instructions and showed a single band of  100 kDa in SDS-PAGE.
  The generation of rabbit antisera against Gas6-LG and Axl-ex-GST  as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titrations followed previous protocols (37).
The antiserum to Axl-ex-GST was cross-absorbed  on GST-Sepharose resin prior to use.
  Binding AssaysSolid-phase binding assays with Gas6 proteins followed previous protocols (37).
Microtiter wells (50 l) were coated with  5 g/ml Axl-ex-GST.
Binding was detected by a rabbit antiserum  against Gas6-LG.
No binding was observed in control wells coated with  bovine serum albumin.
Surface plasmon resonance assays were performed with a BIAcore 100 instrument (BIAcore AB) following previous  protocols (39).
The Axl-ex-GST fusion protein was coupled to CM5  sensor chips with carbodiimide.
Kinetic constants were calculated by  non-linear fitting of association and dissociation curves according to a  1:1 model (BIA evaluation software 3.0).
All binding curves could be  fitted with 2  2.
  Receptor Activation AssayHuman U-118 glioblastoma cells (ATCC,  Manassas, VA) expressing the Axl receptor were maintained in Dulbeccos minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf  serum.
The cells were passaged twice a week to keep them in a proliferating state.
One day prior to testing, the medium was replaced to  reduce Axl phosphorylation by endogenous Gas6.
The cells were incubated with the various recombinant Gas6 fragments and mutants for 15  min, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2)  containing 1 mM Na3VO4, and lysed on ice in lysis buffer (1% Triton  X-100, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM  Na3VO4,1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 g/ml each of  leupeptin and aprotinin).
The lysate was clarified by centrifugation,  and 1 ml of lysate was incubated with Axl-ex antiserum (200 g/ml  antibody) and protein A-Sepharose.
The immunoprecipitates were  washed four times with lysis buffer, dissolved in reducing Laemmli  buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.512.5% gradient gels.
Following transfer to Protran membranes, blots were performed with the  monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted 1:104 and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.
The reaction was visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturers protocol.
Control  incubations included non-stimulated cells and cells stimulated with  Gas6-LG but with the Axl-ex antiserum replaced by preimmune serum.
  Both controls consistently gave negative results.
  Crystal Structure DeterminationFor crystallization experiments,  the Gas6-LG buffer was exchanged to 0.1 M Na-HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 M  NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and the protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a  Centricon-30 ultrafiltration device.
Tetragonal bipyramidal crystals  were obtained by the hanging drop method using 0.1 M Na-HEPES (pH  7.5), 1.41.5 M Li2SO4 as precipitant.
The space group of the crystals is  I4122 with unit cell dimensions a  b  111.31 , c  217.72 . There  is one molecule of Gas6-LG in the asymmetric unit, resulting in a  solvent content of 65%.
For data collection, the crystals were briefly  soaked in 0.1 M Na-HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.6 M Li2SO4, 20% (v/v) glycerol  and flash-frozen to 100 K. Diffraction data were collected on station 9.6  of the Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS) Daresbury using a Quantum4 CCD detector (  0.87 ).
The data were processed with MOSFLM (40) and reduced with programs of the CCP4 suite (41).
  Two non-isomorphous native data sets (NAT1 and NAT2) and a data  set collected from a crystal soaked in 10 mM NaAu(CN)2 for 30 h  (AUCN) were used in the structure determination (Table I).
The AUCN  data were scaled to NAT1, and two heavy atom sites were found using  the CCP4 program RSPS.
Phases to 3.0- resolution were calculated  with MLPHARE including the anomalous scattering of the gold atoms  (mean figure of merit  0.347).
The resulting electron density was  dramatically improved by solvent flattening and histogram matching  with the CCP4 program DM at 3.0- resolution.
A partial model was  built with O (42) using the laminin 2LG45 structure (33) as a template.
This model was refined with CNS (43) against the NAT1 data and  rebuilt.
Further refinement was carried out against the NAT2 data at  2.2- resolution and converged at Rfree  0.259 (Table II).
The first and  last residue defined by the electron density are His261 and Ala678,  respectively.
There is no convincing density for a number of loop regions  (300304, 452460, 495502, and 544548).
A total of 86.4% of all  residues are in the core regions of the Ramachandran plot (44), and only  two residues (Gln315 and Arg414) have disallowed main chain torsion  angles.
The coordinates of the final model have been deposited in the  Protein Data Bank (entry code 1h30).
  RESULTS  Expression and Crystal Structure Determination of Gas6-  LGThe Gas6-LG fragment (amino acid residues 261678 of  human Gas6) was expressed in 293-EBNA cells using the episomal vector pCEP-Pu, which contains the BM-40 secretion  signal sequence (37).
In addition to domains LG1 and LG2, the  Gas6-LG fragment contains the last disulfide-bonded loop of  the EG tandem (residues 261277).
We also prepared episomal  vectors for the individual LG1 (residues 261476) and LG2  (residues 477678) domains but could observe expression only  of LG2.
  We determined the crystal structure at 2.2- resolution of  Gas6-LG.
Initial phases were obtained from a single gold derivative with anomalous scattering and greatly improved by  density modification (Tables I and II).
The Gas6-LG model  refined against the high resolution NAT2 data encompasses  residues 261678.
Residues 300304, 452460, 495502, and  544548 are not defined by the electron density and are presumed to be disordered.
Refinement against the NAT1 data did  not reveal any electron density for the missing regions.
  Gas6-LG StructureThe Gas6-LG fragment has approximate overall dimensions of 80  40  35 3  .
The two domains,  LG1 and LG2, are related by a rotation of 100 about an axis  passing near the domain termini and interact through an interface that buries 900 2 of solvent-accessible surface (Fig. 1).
  A calcium ion is an integral part of the domain interface (see  below).
The C-terminal 16 residues of EG4 pack loosely against  LG2 but make no specific contacts with LG2.
The extended  segment linking EG4 to LG1 contains Cys283, which forms a  disulfide bridge with Cys570 located in LG2.
  LG1 and LG2 adopt the typical -sandwich fold of all LG  domains (31).
LG1 contains 12 -strands arranged in two  sheets (ALCHIJ and BKDEFG).
The long K-L loop fills the  Crystal Structure of the C-terminal LG Domain Pair of Gas6 44165   at Univ. of Wyoming Libraries on March 30, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from concave depression created by the BKDEFG sheet.
LG2 contains 11 -strands arranged in the same topological order but  with strand J missing.
The detailed structure of LG2 is significantly different from all other LG domains solved to date due  to the presence of a 25--long -helix (1) situated at the upper  edge of the -sandwich (in the view of Fig. 1A).
The -sandwich  is splayed open to allow 1 to participate in the hydrophobic  core of the domain.
Like almost all members of the LG superfamily, both LG1 and LG2 contain a disulfide bridge near the C  terminus of the domain.
  The calcium-binding site located in the interface between  LG1 and LG2 is shown in Fig. 2.
Both LG domains contribute  metal ion ligands.
The calcium ion is coordinated by the side  chains of Asp329 (LG1) and Asp656 (LG2), the carbonyl oxygens  of residues 331 and 440 (both in LG1), and two water molecules.
The interaction with Asp329 is bidentate, resulting in a  favorable pentagonal bipyramidal coordination of the calcium  ion.
The calcium-ligand distances range from 2.45 to 2.72   (average, 2.59 ).
In the second shell, the side chain of Asp654  (LG2) forms a hydrogen bond with one of the calcium-bound  water molecules, and His668 (LG2) interacts with both Asp654  and Asp656.
  In addition to the calcium-binding site, there is an intricate  network of hydrogen bonds and well ordered water molecules  connecting LG1 and LG2.
Notably there are no prominent  hydrophobic interface contacts in the LG1-LG2 interface  proper, although Phe471 in the LG1-LG2 linker region packs  against Pro671 near the C terminus.
The extended segment  preceding LG1 makes one very conspicuous interaction with  LG2 by inserting the side chain of Phe286 into a hydrophobic  pocket created by LG2 residues Phe479, Ala516, and Pro671.
The  overall impression of the Gas6-LG structure is that of a relatively rigid domain tandem.
  Comparison of Gas6-LG to Other StructuresThe prototype  of an LG tandem structure is the C-terminal LG4-LG5 domain  pair from the laminin 2 chain (33), which shares 20% sequence identity with Gas6-LG.
While the two structures are  rather similar, as expected, there is a significant difference in  the relative arrangement of the two LG domains.
Compared  with the laminin structure, the LG domains in Gas6-LG are  twisted by 20 about an axis roughly parallel to the long dimension of the domain pair and passing near the LG1-LG2  linker (not shown).
As a result, many interface contacts in the  two structures do not involve equivalent residues.
For instance,  the C-C distance of the two calcium ligands in Gas6-LG,  Asp329 and Asp656, is 9.7 , whereas the equivalent residues in  the laminin 2 chain (Ala2793 and Ala3102, respectively) are  13.1  apart.
  Domain LG1 of Gas6 is most similar to the N-terminal LG  domain of SHBG (35), and 120 C atoms can be superimposed  with a root mean square (r.m.s.) difference of only 0.82  (Fig.  3A).
The structure of full-length SHBG is not known but is  likely to contain an interdomain calcium site equivalent to the  one in Gas6-LG, given that the calcium ligands are conserved  in the two proteins and a calcium ion was observed in the  N-terminal LG domain of SHBG (35).
Domain LG2 of Gas6 can  be superimposed onto LG5 of the laminin 2 chain (32) with an  r.m.s.
difference of 1.8  (116 C atoms) (Fig. 3B).
Helix 1 in  Gas6 LG2 replaces the extended J-K segment in laminin LG5,  which is involved in binding a functionally important calcium  ion (32).
From sequence analysis, a similar helix is likely to be  present in the C-terminal LG domain of PS but not of SHBG.
  Identification of Receptor-binding Residues in Gas6-LGWe  examined the molecular surface of the Gas6-LG structure for  potential receptor-binding regions and noticed a patch of solvent-exposed aromatic and aliphatic residues in the LG2 domain consisting of Phe485, Phe487, Trp526, Leu620, and Tyr660  (Fig. 4).
Using a 1.4- probe, we calculated that 1633% of the  side chain surface area of these residues is accessible to solvent.
The indole ring of Trp526, located in the D-E hairpin, is  sandwiched between two proline residues, Pro528 and Pro627.
  The side chains of Phe485, Phe487, Trp526, and Leu620 surround  the side chain of Phe622, which is slightly recessed from the  molecular surface.
The hydrophobic patch is relatively flat, and  in the Gas6-LG crystals the patches of symmetry-related molecules pack tightly against each other, completely excluding  water molecules from the 650-2 contact area.
The dimeric  association is a crystal artifact as Gas6-LG behaves as a monomer during size exclusion chromatography (see Experimental  Procedures).
  We produced five Gas6-LG mutants: Phe485, Phe487, Leu620,  and Tyr660 were individually replaced by alanine, and Trp526  was replaced by phenylalanine.
All five mutants were secreted  by the 293-EBNA cells and showed the same electrophoretic  mobility and chromatographic behavior as the wild-type protein.
Furthermore, wild-type and mutant Gas6-LG also showed  the same stability against endoproteinase Glu-C digestion,  which converted the 42-kDa band of the intact proteins into a  26-kDa band, presumably by cleaving the interdomain linker of  Gas6-LG (data not shown).
Reduction of disulfide bridges, in  contrast, caused a complete loss of stability.
These data  strongly suggest that mutation of solvent-exposed residues in  the hydrophobic patch does not affect the overall structure of  Gas6-LG.
A double mutant of the calcium-binding residues  (D329N/D656N) was also constructed, but no protein was seTABLE I  Data collection and phasing statistics  Data set  NAT1 NAT2 AUCN  Resolution range () 202.7 202.2 203.0  Unique reflections 19,147 35,018 13,975  Average multiplicity 6.4 5.0 (5.0)a 4.9  Completeness (%) 99.7 99.8 (100)a 99.5  Rmerge  b 0.064 0.082 (0.297)a 0.042  Rderiv  c 0.190 0.225  RCullis  d (centric/acentric) 0.78/0.85  Phasing powere  (centric/acentric)  0.88/1.10  a Values in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution  shell (2.322.20 ).

  44166 Crystal Structure of the C-terminal LG Domain Pair of Gas6   at Univ. of Wyoming Libraries on March 30, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from creted by the 293-EBNA cells despite the fact that they contained the expression vector (as demonstrated by a Northern  blot; data not shown).
  The Gas6-LG mutants were examined in receptor binding  and activation assays.
In a solid-phase assay, wild-type  Gas6-LG bound to the immobilized extracellular domain of Axl  with half-maximal saturation at 0.81 nM, whereas the Cterminal LG2 domain alone was completely inactive (Fig. 5).
  Some of the mutations barely affected Axl binding, but the  L620A and Y660A mutations reduced the apparent affinity of  Gas6-LG for Axl by a factor of 15 and 3, respectively.
Similar  results were obtained in a surface plasmon resonance assay  with the L620A mutation again showing the most pronounced  (30-fold) reduction in affinity (Table III).
To determine whether  the reduction in Axl binding affected receptor activation, we  analyzed Axl activation in U-118 glioblastoma cells.
Gas6-LG  at 200 ng/ml, but not the LG2 domain alone, induced a robust  phosphorylation of Axl.
The F487A and L620A mutations decreased this activity 510-fold, whereas only marginal effects  were observed for the other mutations (Fig. 6).
Similar results  were obtained with higher ligand concentrations (data not  shown).

  Crystal Structure of the C-terminal LG Domain Pair of Gas6 44167   at Univ. of Wyoming Libraries on March 30, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from DISCUSSION  LG domains are among the most functionally versatile extracellular modules: they interact with a host of (glyco)proteins, bind glycosaminoglycans, and transport steroid hormones (32).
The C-terminal pair of LG domains in Gas6 is  unique in containing a binding site for RTKs of the Axl family  (8).
Gas6 is the only known physiological ligand for Axl RTKs,  which have multiple roles in cell survival, adhesion, migration,  spermatogenesis, and immunity (1222).
  The crystal structure of Gas6-LG superficially resembles  that of the laminin 2 chain LG4-LG5 pair (33) as expected  from an overall sequence identity of 20%.
There are several  important differences, however, that can be correlated with  the different biological functions of the two molecules.
Laminin 2 LG4-LG5, as well as several other matrix proteins  containing LG domains, bind to the cellular receptor  -dystroglycan, and this interaction requires calcium ions  bound to sites at the distal edge of the LG domain -sandwich  (32, 33).
The equivalent regions in Gas6, which include the  J-K loop in LG1 and the unique 1 helix in LG2, do not bind  calcium, and indeed Gas6-LG does not interact with  -dystroglycan (data not shown).
  On the other hand, Gas6-LG and, from sequence comparison,  FIG. 3.

The soluble ligands were Gas6-LG (f), Gas6-  LG2 (), and the Gas6-LG mutants F485A (), F487A (), W526F (),  L620A (E), and Y660A ().
  44168 Crystal Structure of the C-terminal LG Domain Pair of Gas6   at Univ. of Wyoming Libraries on March 30, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from PS and SHBG contain a calcium-binding site in the domain  interface that is absent in the laminin LG pair.
The calciumbinding site in Gas6-LG appears to be critical for the folding  and/or structural integrity of the LG domain pair as indicated  by the lack of expression of the D329N/D656N Gas6-LG mutant. While no data exist on the role of metal ions in the  Gas6-Axl interaction, calcium has been shown to significantly  increase the binding of C4BP to PS (45).
Calcium may affect the  interaction of PS with C4BP either directly by binding an acidic  C4BP residue or indirectly by stabilizing a PS conformation  with high affinity for C4BP.
In this regard, regions near the LG  domain interface of PS have been implicated in C4BP binding  (24).
  One important aim of the present study was to obtain insight  into the binding of Gas6 to RTKs of the Axl family.
RTK  activation is believed to result from ligand-induced receptor  dimerization (46).
If the ligand is a homodimer, as in cystine  knot growth factors, only one type of ligand-receptor interface  is required for receptor dimerization (30), whereas monomeric  ligands, such as -trefoil growth factors, form two non-equivalent interfaces (27, 28).
Gas6-LG behaves as a monomeric protein in size exclusion chromatography, and one might, therefore, expect two distinct RTK-binding sites in Gas6-LG.
  In agreement with earlier studies, we found that the two LG  domains of Gas6 are necessary and sufficient for Axl binding  and activation (8) and that Gas6 and Axl interact with a KD of  14 nM (810).
LG2 alone was completely inactive in all assays,  whereas LG1 could not be studied in isolation because it was  not expressed by 293-EBNA cells.
There are two alternative  scenarios to explain these observations.
The determinants for  Axl binding could extend over both LG domains in Gas6-LG as  is the case with C4BP binding to PS (23, 24) and -dystroglycan  binding to laminin 2 LG4-LG5 (47).
Alternatively the Axlbinding site could be located exclusively in LG1, which does,  however, require LG2 for proper folding.
Sequences within LG1  have indeed been implicated in the non-physiological activation  of Sky by PS (48), but the data do not rule out additional  contributions from LG2.
  Inspection of the Gas6-LG structure revealed a conspicuous  patch of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues in LG2 that we  suspected to be involved in Axl binding and/or activation.
Mutation of some residues in this patch, most notably of Leu620,  significantly reduced binding of Gas6-LG to the extracellular  domain of Axl in two different assay formats as well as Axl  activation in a cellular assay.
The strong contribution of Leu620  to Axl binding is somewhat surprising as this residue is situated at the periphery of the patch.
Other residues are likely to  contribute to the putative Axl-binding site around Leu620 because no mutation within the hydrophobic patch abolished Axl  binding and activation completely. It is tempting to speculate  that the disordered A-B loop of LG1, which is adjacent to the  hydrophobic patch and contains two hydrophobic residues  (Met300 and Phe301), becomes ordered upon Axl binding.
A  significant contribution of the A-B loop to Axl binding would  explain why the isolated LG2 domain does not bind Axl.
As  discussed above, a second receptor-binding site, distinct from  the hydrophobic patch and its surroundings, is likely to exist in  Gas6-LG.
We assume this second site to be located within LG1.
  In conclusion, the crystal structure of Gas6-LG has provided  a first clue about regions involved in RTK binding and activation.
Clearly further studies into the mechanism of Axl activation by Gas6 are required.
The Gas6-LG structure will not only  be valuable in informing further biochemical experiments but  also provides the foundation for a structure determination of a  minimal Gas6-Axl complex.
