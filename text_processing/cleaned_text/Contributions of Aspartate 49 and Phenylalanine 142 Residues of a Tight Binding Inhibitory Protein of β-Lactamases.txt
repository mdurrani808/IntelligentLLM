Contributions of Aspartate 49 and Phenylalanine 142 Residues of a  Tight Binding Inhibitory Protein of b-Lactamases*  (Received for publication, October 5, 1998, and in revised form, November 13, 1998)  Joseph Petrosino, Gary Rudgers, Hiram Gilbert, and Timothy Palzkill  From the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Department of Biochemistry, Baylor College of  Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030  b-Lactamases are bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze  b-lactam antibiotics to render them inactive.
The b-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) of Streptomyces clavuligerus, is a potent inhibitor of several b-lactamases,  including the TEM-1 enzyme (Ki 5 0.6 nM).
Evidence  from the TEM-1/BLIP co-crystal suggests that two BLIP  residues, Asp-49 and Phe-142, mimic interactions made  by penicillin G when bound in the active site of TEM-1.
  To determine the importance of these two residues, a  heterologous expression system for BLIP was established in Escherichia coli.
Site-directed mutagenesis  was used to change Asp-49 and Phe-142 to alanine, and  inhibition constants (Ki) for both mutants were determined.
Each mutation increases the Ki for BLIP inhibition of TEM-1 b-lactamase approximately 100-fold.
To  address how these two positions effect the specificity of  b-lactamase binding, Ki values were determined for the  interaction of wild-type BLIP, as well as the D49A and  F142A mutants, with two extended spectrum b-lactamases (the G238S and the E104K TEM variants).
Positions  104 and 238 are located in the BLIP/b-lactamase interface.
Interestingly, the three BLIP proteins inhibited  the G238S b-lactamase mutant to the same degree that  they inhibited TEM-1.
However, wild-type BLIP has a  higher Ki for the E104K b-lactamase mutant, suggesting  that interactions between BLIP and b-lactamase residue  Glu-104 are important for wild-type levels of BLIP  inhibition.
  b-Lactamases are bacterial enzymes that confer resistance to  b-lactam antibiotics, which include the penicillins and cephalosporins.
These drugs act by inhibiting bacterial penicillin  binding proteins (PBPs)1 that are essential for the synthesis of  the bacterial peptidoglycan layer (1).
Several resistance mechanisms have evolved in bacteria to protect them from the lethal  effects of b-lactam antibiotics.
  b-Lactamase imparts resistance to the b-lactams by hydrolyzing the amide bond in the four-membered b-lactam ring (2).
  Genes encoding b-lactamases may be found on plasmids, transposons, and on the bacterial chromosome (26).
There are four  classes of b-lactamases (classes A-D), categorized by their primary sequence homology.
b-Lactamase-mediated resistance  has increased because of selective pressure from widespread  use of b-lactam antibiotics and is now a serious threat to  antibiotic therapy (7).
  TEM-1 b-lactamase, encoded by the blaTEM-1 gene, is among  the most prevalent plasmid-encoded b-lactamases found in  Gram-negative bacteria (8).
The name TEM is derived from the  name of the patient carrying the pathogen from which the  enzyme was isolated (9).
It efficiently hydrolyzes penicillins  and most cephalosporins (2).
However, it is a poor catalyst for  hydrolysis of the newer third-generation cephalosporins, such  as ceftazidime, that were designed to circumvent TEM-1-mediated inactivation.
  In addition to developing new drugs that are unable to be  cleaved by b-lactamase, another method to counter the hydrolytic activity of this enzyme has been to administer b-lactamase  inhibitors, such as sulbactam and clavulanic acid.
Use of an  inhibitor along with an existing b-lactam antibiotic is an effective means to treat various b-lactamase producing bacterial  pathogens (10).
Clavulanic acid was originally found as a metabolite of the Gram-positive soil bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus and, today, is one of the most commonly used b-lactamase inhibitors.
  b-Lactamase-mediated resistance has been exacerbated by  the fact that specific mutations in TEM-1 b-lactamase enable  the enzyme to hydrolyze the newer third-generation antibiotics  (11, 12).
These evolved b-lactamases, called extended spectrum  b-lactamases (ESBLs), provide clinically relevant levels of resistance to even the most recently developed b-lactams.
Furthermore, other mutants have been found with substitutions  that allow b-lactamase to avoid inactivation by the b-lactamase  inhibitors (13).
A similar result has been observed with SHV-1  b-lactamase, another class A enzyme that is 68% identical to  TEM-1 b-lactamase (7).
Recently, a b-lactamase mutant (TEM50) has been recovered from clinical isolates with both types of  mutations, enabling b-lactamase to hydrolyze extended spectrum antibiotics and avoid inactivation by inhibitors (14).
  In 1990, the b-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) was isolated from S. clavuligerus culture supernatants (15).
BLIP is  a 165-amino acid protein in its secreted form and is a potent  inhibitor of TEM-1 b-lactamase (Ki 5 0.6 nM) (16).
BLIP is  able to inhibit several b-lactamases, as well as weakly inhibit  a penicillin-binding protein (PBP) from Enterococcus faecalis  (16).
The DNA sequence and crystal structure of BLIP  have been determined, as well as the co-crystal with TEM-1  b-lactamase (16, 17).
  The BLIP crystal structure shows that the protein has a  novel fold with two similar domains.
The BLIP mechanism of  inhibition appears to be two-fold.
At 2636 2  , the surface area  of the enzyme/inhibitor interface is one of the largest known for  protein/protein complexes as BLIP essentially clamps over the  active site of b-lactamase (17).

Printed in U.S.A.  2394 This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org   by guest on March 24, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from residue at position 49 of BLIP aligns itself in the active site  pocket and forms strong hydrogen bonds with four catalytic  residues of b-lactamase.
Furthermore, a phenylalanine at position 142 of BLIP appears to mimic the benzyl group of the  b-lactam antibiotic penicillin G (PenG) and further stabilizes  the inhibitory complex (17).
The result is potent inhibition of  TEM-1 b-lactamase.
  The ongoing problem of targeting bacteria with antimicrobial  agents able to circumvent ESBL-mediated antibiotic inactivation creates a need for new potent inhibitors of b-lactamases.
  The ability to engineer BLIP to tightly bind the ESBLs and  PBPs would aid in the design of effective new antimicrobials.
  New protein-protein interactions found to be effective in inhibiting b-lactamases and PBPs could be duplicated by a peptide  inhibitor or synthetic compound designed to mimic the interactions.
It would be easier to perform such studies with BLIP if  the inhibitor could be expressed in a more manageable genetic  and molecular system, such as Escherichia coli.
This report  describes the efficient expression of functional BLIP in E. coli  and the use of this system to determine the importance of  residues Asp-49 and Phe-142 for BLIP inhibition of TEM-1  b-lactamase, two extended spectrum TEM-1 mutants, and the  SHV-1 b-lactamase.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Strains and PlasmidsE. coli XL1-Blue (recA1, endA1, gyrA96,  thi-1, hsdR17, supE44, relA1, lac, (F9 proAB, lacIq lacZDM15,  Tn10(tetr  ))) was used to propagate plasmid DNA (Stratagene, Inc.).
E.  coli RB791 (5 strain W3110 lacIQL8) was used to express BLIP and the  D49A and F142A BLIP mutants (18, 19).
Plasmid pTP123 is a cmpr  amps derivative of pTrc 99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (see Fig.  1).
It was created by ligating the HincII cassette from pKRP10 into  BsaI- digested pTrc 99A (20).
The BsaI site was filled in using the  Klenow fragment of DNA Polymerase I prior to ligation.
This cloning  step inserts a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene into the  rrnBT1T2 transcriptional terminators and part of the b-lactamase gene  encoded by pTrc 99A.
As a result, functional b-lactamase is not expressed, and potential difficulty in BLIP purification because of binding  of endogenous b-lactamase is avoided.
The cat gene in pTP123 is in the  same orientation as the trc promoter.
  BLIP Cloning and PCR MutagenesisA 6-histidine (6XHis) tag was  first inserted between the b-lactamase signal sequence and the BLIP  coding sequence of pG3-BLIP (21) by overlapping PCR mutagenesis  (22).
The internal mutagenic PCR primer sequences are: BLIPHIS-1 (a  top strand primer), 59-CACCACCACCACCACCACGCGGGGGTGATGACCGGGGCGAAG-39; and BLIPHIS-2 (a bottom strand primer), 59-CGCGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTTCTGGGTGAGCAGCAAAAACAGGAAGGCA-39.
The external PCR primers used to amplify the construct  are: PD-bla1 (top strand, N-terminal), 59-CGGGGAGCTCGTTTCTTAGACGTCAGGTGGC-39; and MALBLI-2 (bottom strand C-terminal),  59-GGGAAATCTAGATTATACAAGGTCCCACTGCCG-39.
A SacI site  in PD-bla1 and a XbaI site in MALBLI-2 allowed the PCR product to be  cloned into SacI- and XbaI-digested pTP123 following treatment of the  vector with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase.
The final SacI/XbaI  fragment contains, from 59 to 39, the TEM-1 b-lactamase constitutive  promoter, the TEM-1 b-lactamase signal sequence, and a 6XHis tag at  the N terminus of BLIP followed by the mature BLIP coding sequence.
  The sequence of this clone was confirmed by the dideoxy chain-termination method and was named pGR32 (Fig. 1).
The positioning of this  construct in pTP123 allows the N-terminal His-tagged BLIP to be  expressed either under the TEM-1 b-lactamase constitutive promoter or  by induction of the trc promoter with IPTG.
The 6XHis tag facilitates  the purification of BLIP using an appropriate nickel- or cobalt-based  affinity column, while the b-lactamase signal sequence enables BLIP to  be transported to the periplasmic space, thus eliminating the need to  isolate whole cell extracts for BLIP purification.
  PCR MutagenesisConstruction of the BLIP D49A and F142A mutants was accomplished by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (22).
PD-bla1  and MALBLI-2 were used as external primers in these mutagenesis  reactions.
The internal top and bottom primers for constructing the  D49A mutant are: BP-D49A (top), 59-CGGGGGCACGCGGCAGGGGCTTACTACGCCTACGCCACC-39; and D49A (bottom), 59-GGTGGCGTAGGCGTAGTAGGCCCCTGCCGCGTGCCCCCG-39.
The internal top  and bottom primers for constructing the F142A mutant are: BP-F142A  (top), 59-GGTTACTCGTCGACGGGGGCTTACCGAGGCTCGGCGCA39; and F142A-BOT (bottom), 59-GTGCGCCGAGCCTCGGTAAGCCCCCGTCGACGAGTAACC-39. PD-bla1 and MALBLI-2 were used to  amplify the full-size mutagenized product.
Both mutagenic PCR products were cloned into SacI/XbaI-digested and calf intestinal alkaline  phosphatase-treated pTP123.
The plasmid containing the D49A mutant  was named pJP128, and the plasmid containing the F142A mutant was  named pJP129.
The DNA sequence of each mutant was confirmed by  the dideoxy chain-termination method.
  BLIP and b-Lactamase Expression and PurificationPlasmids  pGR32, pJP128, and pJP129 were transformed into E. coli RB791 by  electroporation.
An overnight culture of each was grown shaking in 40  ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 C in the presence of 12.5 mg/ml  chloramphenicol.
The 40 ml of overnight culture were used to inoculate  2 liters of LB medium containing 12.5 mg/ml chloramphenicol.
The  bacteria was then grown shaking at 25 C until A600 5 1.2.
For induction of BLIP, 3 mM IPTG was added to each culture, and the cultures  were then allowed to grow an additional 5 h.  Following the 5-h induction, the cells were pelleted and resuspended  FIG.

The BLIP cassette, possessing an N-terminal His-tagged BLIP gene, under control of the  b-lactamase promoter, was inserted into SacI/XbaI-digested pTP123.
This construct also features the b-lactamase signal sequence fused to the N  terminus of the His-BLIP construct.
  Role of Asp-49 and Phe-142 in BLIP Inhibition 2395   by guest on March 24, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from in 15 ml of sonication buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mM  NaCl).
The cells were then sonicated in two batches, and insoluble  material was pelleted by centrifugation.
The soluble protein in the  supernatant was purified over a 4-ml TALON column (CLONTECH)  according to the manufacturer instructions.
A 4 mM imidizole wash step  was utilized to remove protein from the column which bound less tightly  than the His-tagged BLIP.
BLIP was eluted using an elution buffer  consisting of 50 mM imidizole added to the sonication buffer (pH 8.0).
  Fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE to estimate purity and yield  (Fig. 2).
Approximately 500 mg of .90% pure BLIP could be isolated for  every two liters of culture using this strategy.
Quantitative amino acid  analysis was performed to calibrate a Bradford assay for determining  BLIP and b-lactamase concentrations (23).
  Wild-type b-lactamase and the G238S and E104K extended spectrum mutants were expressed and purified as described previously (24).
  The location of the two extended spectrum mutations, with respect to  Asp-49 and Phe-142 of BLIP, is shown in Fig. 3.
  BLIP Inhibition AssayVarying concentrations of BLIP were incubated with 1 nM b-lactamase for 2 h at 25 C.
2 nM of the b-lactamase  were used in the G238S studies.
The enzyme-inhibitor incubation was  done in 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mg/ml bovine  serum albumin.
Following the 2-h incubation, which is sufficient time to  achieve binding equilibrium in a small volume, cephaloridine was  added at a concentration of at least 10-fold lower than the Km of the  b-lactamase being tested (e.g. wild-type TEM-1 b-lactamase has a Km of  approximately 700 mM for cephaloridine, therefore 70 mM cephaloridine  was added to the TEM-1/BLIP incubation).
The final volume for the  reaction was 0.5 ml.
Hydrolysis of cephaloridine was monitored at A260  on a Beckman DU70 spectrophotometer.
The extinction coefficient used  for cephaloridine was De 5 10,200 M21 cm21 (24).
Plots of the concentration of free b-lactamase versus inhibitor concentration were fit by  nonlinear regression analysis to Equation 1, where [Efree] is the concentration of active b-lactamase calculated from the measured velocity  and the activity and concentration of uninhibited b-lactamase, [Eo] is  the total b-lactamase concentration, and [Io] is the total inhibitor concentration (25).
From the equation, apparent equilibrium dissociation  constants (Ki  *) were determined.

Wild-type or mutant  BLIP was incubated with a target for 2 h, which is sufficient  time to achieve equilibrium.
After the 2-h incubation, cephaloridine (at a concentration 10-fold less than the cephaloradine  Km for the b-lactamase being tested) was added.
Monitoring  the hydrolysis of cephaloridine at a concentration below Km  allowed the concentration of uninhibited b-lactamase to be  determined without shifting the binding equilibrium.
The concentration of free b-lactamase was calculated from the cephaloridine activity in the presence of a given quantity of BLIP, the  cephaloridine activity in the absence of BLIP, and the known  molar concentration of b-lactamase being used.
Fitting the  data obtained when incubating varying concentrations of wildtype, His-tagged BLIP with 1 nM TEM-1 b-lactamase resulted  in a Ki of 0.11 nM (Fig. 4, Table I).
This value compares reasonably well with the previously reported value of 0.6 nM found  with BLIP purified from S. clavuligerus (16) and suggests that  the N-terminal 6XHis tag has little effect on the binding of the  inhibitor to the TEM-1 enzyme.
  To determine whether wild-type BLIP has similar affinity for  extended spectrum b-lactamases, the Ki of BLIP for two representative ESBLs was determined.
The G238S b-lactamase mutation is found in many extended spectrum enzymes (26).
This  single mutation increases the catalytic efficiency of b-lactamase for the third generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and  cefotaxime approximately 70- and 40-fold, respectively (27).
  The E104K mutation, likewise, has been found in many extended spectrum b-lactamase variants (26).
This mutation increases the catalytic efficiency of b-lactamase approximately  50-fold for ceftazidime and 10-fold for cefotaxime (28).
Both  Gly-238 and Glu-104 are located at the binding interface of  BLIP and b-lactamase (17).
Wild-type BLIP was found to have  a Ki of 0.07 nM for G238S, and a Ki of 140 nM for E104K (Figs.  5 and 6, Table I).
These values suggest that the G238S mutation has little effect on the binding of wild-type BLIP to b-lactamase, whereas the E104K mutation interferes with binding  in such a way that the Ki increases 1000-fold.
  Mutant BLIP BindingThe x-ray structure of the  BLIPzTEM-1 b-lactamase complex shows that BLIP residues  Asp-49 and Phe-142 mimic portions of the b-lactam PenG when  bound to b-lactamase (17).
This structural mimicry suggests  that these residues maintain important interactions in the  inhibitory complex.
To determine the contribution of these  amino acids to inhibition of TEM-1 b-lactamase and extended  spectrum-hydrolyzing b-lactamases, the D49A and F142A mutants were constructed.
The Ki of each was determined with  TEM-1, E104K, and G238S b-lactamases (Figs. 46; Table I).
  Both the D49A and F142A mutants exhibited an approximately 100300-fold increase in Ki compared with wild-type  BLIP inhibition of TEM-1 b-lactamase.
The D49A mutant inhibits TEM-1 with a Ki of 8.3 nM, whereas the F142A mutant  inhibits with a Ki of 33 nM. To ascertain whether these mutations affect inhibition in an additive manner, the D49A/F142A  double mutant was constructed.
However, we were unable to  express the double mutant under the same strategy used with  wild-type BLIP and the other single amino acid mutants.
  The interactions of the wild-type, D49A, and F142A BLIP  inhibitors with the ESBLs show that BLIP binds G238S with  similar strength as that of wild-type TEM-1, but binds E104K  weakly.
The Ki values found for D49A and F142A mutants with  G238S b-lactamase were similar to the Ki values found for the  BLIP mutants binding TEM-1.
The D49A BLIP mutant inhibited G238S with a Ki of 9.4 nM. Therefore, as with TEM-1, the  D49A mutation reduced inhibition 100-fold.
Likewise, the  F142A BLIP bound G238S b-lactamase approximately 800-fold  weaker, with a Ki of 55 nM. The fact that these two substitutions in BLIP have a similar effect on the Ki values for the  FIG.

  2396 Role of Asp-49 and Phe-142 in BLIP Inhibition   by guest on March 24, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from TEM-1 and G238S b-lactamases suggests that BLIP inhibits  G238S in much the same way it inhibits TEM-1.
  Further experiments showed that Asp-49 and Phe-142 do not  contribute to the binding of E104K b-lactamase as they do to  the binding of TEM-1 and G238S.
The Ki of BLIP D49A with  E104K b-lactamase is 1.5 mM, which is only a 10-fold increase  compared with that of the wild-type BLIP interaction with  E104K.
This suggests that BLIP residue Asp-49 is not as critical to inhibition of E104K b-lactamase as it is to the other  enzymes tested.
This observation is even more pronounced  with the BLIP F142A substitution in that there was little  change from the wild-type BLIP Ki with the BLIP F142A mutant inhibiting E104K (Ki (F142A) 5 240 nM).
Therefore, in  contrast to their effect on TEM-1 and G238S binding, the D49A  and F142A substitutions do not have as detrimental an effect  on the Ki for E104K b-lactamase.
  BLIP Binding to SHV-1 b-LactamaseThe amino acid sequence of SHV-1 is 68% identical to TEM-1 b-lactamase (7).
  How this similarity corresponds to structure homology is unknown as the crystal structure of SHV-1 b-lactamase has not  yet been solved.
Both the TEM-1 and SHV-1 enzymes hydrolyze a similar profile of penicillins and cephalosporins.
It is not  clear whether the homology between the two enzymes implies  FIG.

It may be that even  slight differences in the three-dimensional structure of SHV-1  compared with TEM-1 would effect BLIP binding considerably.
  These issues were addressed by performing an additional inhibitory assay with wild-type BLIP and SHV-1 b-lactamase.
  SHV-1 was purified to greater than 90% homogeneity (data not  shown) and was bound to increasing concentrations of wildtype BLIP.
The Ki of BLIP for SHV-1 was found to be 1.0 mM,  9,000-fold higher than what was found for TEM-1 (Fig. 7, Table  I).
Therefore, the high degree of identity between these enzymes does not translate to similar binding properties by BLIP.
  DISCUSSION  The development of novel inhibitors for b-lactamases as well  as penicillin-binding proteins would provide new options for  the treatment of bacterial infections.
As b-lactamases are believed to have evolved from PBPs, it is conceivable that minor  changes in the structure of BLIP could enable it to bind and  inhibit PBPs (29).
It has already been observed that wild-type  BLIP weakly inhibits PBP5 from Enterococcus (16).
Understanding how the amino acid sequence of BLIP encodes its tight  binding affinity for certain b-lactamases, and its weaker affinity for PBPs, would facilitate the development of novel inhibitors with potent activity for the ESBLs and for the PBPs.
The  identification of amino acids most responsible for inhibition  and those critical for binding specificity will pinpoint the residues that need to be targeted for engineering BLIP mutants  with higher inhibitory activity for different b-lactamases and  PBPs.
  The crystal structure of the BLIPzTEM-1 complex suggests  that two BLIP amino acids, Asp-49 and Phe-142, are critical for  FIG. 6.

In addition, the BLIP amino acids that bind the  99112 loop of b-lactamase (Ser-35, Phe-36, Ser-39, His-41,  His-45, Ala-47, Gly-48, Tyr-50, Tyr-53, Ser-71, Glu-73, Lys-74,  Ser-113, Gly-141, Tyr-143, Trp-150, Trp-112, Arg-160, Trp-162)  represent the majority of the surface interactions between the  two proteins (2636 2 is buried at the intermolecular surface)  (17).
These residues are the primary candidates for mutational  analysis to distinguish whether hot spots consisting of a  subset of these amino acids are involved in specificity and  binding or if all of these residues contribute to the binding of  BLIP to TEM-1 b-lactamase.
  The first step in being able to identify amino acids important  for BLIP specificity and inhibitory activity is to develop an  expression system to produce functional BLIP.
BLIP expressed  in its native S. clavuligerus produces large quantities of protein, whereas expression in another Streptomyces species,  Streptomyces lividans, produces limited quantities of BLIP  (15, 30).
Successful expression of soluble BLIP in E. coli  would facilitate the study of BLIP mutants and would also  allow protein engineering techniques to be performed.
  Histidine-tagged proteins are able to be purified in a relatively simple manner, while usually maintaining the native  activity of the tagged protein.
Therefore, an expression system  centered around an N-terminal 6XHis-tagged BLIP was constructed.
Expression is directed by the inducible trc promoter,  and a cat gene is inserted into the b-lactamase gene of the  plasmid to avoid possible complex formation during purification of BLIP (Fig. 1).
This system enabled BLIP to be purified  to .90% homogeneity in one step (Fig. 2).
Wild-type His-tagged  BLIP was found to have a Ki of 0.11 nM. This value is slightly  lower than the previously calculated value of 0.6 nM for BLIP  isolated from S. clavuligerus (16).
This difference could be  attributed to the manner in which the Ki was calculated, and  confirms that the N-terminal His tag has no effect on BLIP  binding.
  Once expression of functional BLIP was achieved, the roles of  BLIP residues in the inhibition of different targets could be  determined.
The crystal structure of BLIP with TEM-1 b-lactamase shows that Asp-49 of BLIP makes strong hydrogen  bond contacts with four conserved residues in the TEM-1 active  site pocket: Ser-130, Lys-234, Ser-235, and Arg-244 (17).
These  four amino acids are involved in the binding and catalysis of  b-lactam antibiotics and are conserved in all class A b-lactamases.
Mutation of the aspartic acid to an alanine removes the  carboxylate moiety that serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor for  the four active site TEM-1 residues.
Elimination of the carboxylate reduced the inhibitory activity of BLIP approximately  100-fold, indicating residue Asp-49 does make an important  contribution to BLIP inhibition of TEM-1 b-lactamase.
  The crystal structure also leads to the prediction that Phe142 is also important for inhibition of TEM-1 b-lactamase (17).
  Phe-142 is in contact with b-lactamase residues Glu-104, Tyr105, Asn-170, Ala-237, Gly-238, and Glu-240 in the complex.
As  in the case of Asp-49, most of these residues are either conserved in class A b-lactamases or are involved in catalysis.
It  was also found that in other protein complexes, such as between human growth hormone and its receptor, the most critical interactions are hydrophobic (31).
Therefore, the contribution of Phe-142 to binding and inhibition was examined.
The  F142A substitution removes the hydrophobic side chain that  mimics the benzyl group in PenG from the TEM-1zPenG complex.
This change also increases the Ki approximately 100-fold,  which suggests that the interactions mediated by Phe-142 are  important for inhibitor binding, and that they are similar in  magnitude to the contributions made by Asp-49.
The D49A/  F142A double mutant was constructed to test additivity between these two residues, but the protein was not expressed.
  The ability of wild-type BLIP and the D49A and F142A  mutants to inhibit two extended spectrum b-lactamase mutants was also examined.
G238S, the b-lactamase mutation  found in TEM-19, and E104K, the mutation found in TEM-17,  were the two representative extended spectrum mutants tested  with BLIP and the BLIP mutants (26).
The prevalence of the  G238S and E104K substitutions in many of the extended spectrum b-lactamases makes these two single mutants ideal candidates for study.
Interestingly, wild-type BLIP, D49A, and the  F142A BLIP mutant each inhibited G238S at similar levels to  that which they inhibited wild-type TEM-1 b-lactamase.
According to the crystal structure, the only contact made with  FIG. 7.
Determination of wild-type  BLIP Ki for SHV-1 b-lactamase.
BLIP  inhibitory activity is expressed as the remaining concentration of free b-lactamase at varying inhibitor concentrations.
  SHV-1 concentration is 1 nM, and the  cephaloridine concentration is 70 mM for  all experiments.
The apparent Ki was determined as in Fig. 4.
  Role of Asp-49 and Phe-142 in BLIP Inhibition 2399   by guest on March 24, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Gly-238 of TEM-1 is by Phe-142.
The fact that no change in the  inhibition profile was observed between the b-lactamase enzymes suggests that this contact between Gly-238 and Phe-142  is not critical for BLIP binding and inhibition.
If this interaction played a role in BLIP inhibition, then replacement of the  glycine side-chain at position 238 of TEM-1 would have resulted in an increased Ki with wild-type BLIP.
However, the  possibility that the substituted serine at position 238 makes  new interactions with BLIP, and corrects exactly for the loss of  interaction with Phe-142, cannot be excluded.
  In contrast to BLIP binding to G238S, significant changes in  the inhibitory profile were observed when E104K was used as  the target b-lactamase.
Wild-type BLIP inhibited E104K approximately 1000-fold worse than for TEM-1, suggesting that  the interactions made between BLIP and Glu-104 are critical  for wild-type levels of activity.
This result indicates that some,  or all, of the BLIP residues interacting with Glu-104 (BLIPGlu-73, Lys-74, Phe-142, and Tyr-143) are making important  interactions.
However, results from the BLIP F142A/b-lactamase E104K binding experiment suggest that the lysine substitution at position 104 of b-lactamase disrupts critical interactions made by Phe-142 of BLIP.
This disruption of the BLIP  Phe-142 interaction with b-lactamase results in the pronounced loss of inhibition observed with the E104K enzyme.
  It is apparent from this study that while BLIP residues  Asp-49 and Phe-142 are critical for wild-type BLIP inhibitory  levels, the D49A and F142A variants still bind TEM-1 b-lactamase with nanomolar affinity.
Therefore, other interactions  must also contribute to the strong levels of inhibition observed.
  The identification of the epitopes responsible for the remaining  binding energy will facilitate the engineering of tighter,  smaller inhibitors for these b-lactamases.
  Determination of the Ki of BLIP with SHV-1 b-lactamase  shows that even though TEM-1 and SHV-1 are both class A  b-lactamases and are 68% identical, the interactions which  make BLIP a tight inhibitor of TEM-1 are not conserved with  SHV-1.
Although no crystal structure is available for SHV-1,  the level of identity between TEM-1 and SHV-1 suggests that  both enzymes share a similar protein fold.
However, the fact  that BLIP is a poorer inhibitor of SHV-1 shows that small  differences between the b-lactamases are significant with respect to BLIP binding.
