The central feature of the  .
  HyHEL-5rHEL complex is the presence of two saltlinks between Arg45 and Arg68, which form a ridge  on the HEL surface, with GluH50 and GluH35, which  lie in a crevice on the HyHEL-5 paratope 5 .
The w x  R68K mutation in the HyHEL-5 epitope lowers the  affinity of the HyHEL-5rlysozyme complex by over  1000-fold 6,7 .
In a semi-quantitative estimation of w x  the Gibbs free energy contribution of each lysozyme  residue to the HyHEL-5rHEL association, the  arginines at positions 45 and 68 were found to make  the most significant contributions to HyHEL-5 affinity 8 .

The affinity of HyHEL-5 for CQL is similar to  that for HEL Table 1 .

Studying the thermodynamics of HyHEL-5 binding to BWQL and CQL included as a   control for the quail mutations can help delineate .
  the role of Arg68 and the importance of the salt-link  it forms in the antibodyrantigen complex.
The inclusion of CQL in this study as a control gave the  unexpected result that the quail mutations contributed significantly to the observed thermodynamics, especially the change in heat capacity.
The energetics of the salt-link formed by Arg45 using the  lysozyme mutant R45K-HEL has also been studied.
  The results support the energetic importance of the  HyHEL-5 epitope residues Arg45 and Arg68 in the  association of HyHEL-5 with HEL.

Materials and methods  2.1.
HyHEL-5 cell culture and purification  The hybridoma cell line producing the HyHEL-5  antibody was cultivated in a hollow fiber reactor at  
the National Cell Culture Center Minneapolis, MN .  .
  HyHEL-5 was purified as described previously 10 .
w x  2.2.
Lysozyme purification and assays  The R45K-HEL mutant was expressed and purified as described previously 11 and was shown to w x  be homogeneous by silver-stained SDS-PAGE.
  Purified BWQL and CQL, the generous gift of Dr.  E. Prager at the University of California at Berkeley  w x 12 , appeared as single bands on silver-stained SDSPAGE, and were used as received.
Additionally, bobwhite quail eggs were purchased from Stevenson  Game Bird Farm Riverside, TX and California quail  .
  eggs were purchased from Dallas and Linda Bowles  Farm Fort Morgan, CO .
Upon receipt, the egg  .
  white was separated from the yolk and stored at  y808C.
The purification was done essentially as  described by Arnheim et al. 12 , with updated chro- w x  matographic matrices.
Briefly, the egg white was  thawed and homogenized in a Waring blender ca.
  3045 s .
It was filtered through cheesecloth and .
  then through tissue paper, and diluted six-fold with  15 mM ammonium acetate, pH 9.2.
Batch adsorption  was done overnight at 48C using CM Sephadex   .
Pharmacia , in the ratio of 1 g of adsorbentr60 ml  of diluted egg white.
After adsorption, the supernatant was repeatedly replaced with fresh buffer at  2-h intervals, until the liquid was clear ca.
three   times .
Proteins were eluted with 500 mM ammo- .
  nium acetate pH 9.2 .
The material was concentrated  .
  by ultrafiltration Amicon 8200 and fractionated by  .
  size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-100  HR Pharmacia column, using 15 mM ammonium  .
  acetate pH 9.2 .
Final purification was done on a  .
  CM Sepharose Pharmacia column; the protein was  .  eluted with a gradient of ammonium acetate pH 9.2  .
  from 15 mM to 500 mM. Purified lysozyme was  characterized using silver-stained SDS-PAGE and  stored at 48C in the presence of 0.05% sodium azide.
  Because BWQL from Stevenson Game Bird Farm  had not been used in previous immunochemical experiments, it was further verified that the purified  protein bore the characteristic BWQL mutations using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry per-   formed by Gregory Rahn, Oneida Research Services,  Whitesboro, NY .
The mass of HEL was found to be .
  14302.7"0.9 the mass calculated based on the   mRNA sequence is 14305.1 13 and that of BWQL w x.  to be 14261.3"1.0 the calculated mass is 14263.1 .
 .  Importantly, the experimental and calculated mass  differences between HEL and BWQL were 41.4 and  42.0 respectively, which are in agreement within the  experimental error.
  2.3.
Isothermal titration calorimetry  An OMEGA isothermal titration calorimeter Mi-   croCal, Northampton, MA was used for all experi- .
  ments.
The design and operation of the instrument  w x 14 and sample preparation and experimental  methodology have been described previously 10 . w x  Origin, the data analysis software provided with the  calorimeter, was used to analyze all results.
To obtain  the reported enthalpies, the apparent binding enthalpy  values were corrected for the lysozyme enthalpy of  dilution, determined by averaging the integrated areas  obtained for injections after saturation.
For analysis  of tight associations HyHEL-5 with HEL, CQL   and R45K-HEL , the integrated areas for injections .
  prior to saturation typically varied by less than about  4% and were averaged to obtain the apparent binding208 K.A. Shick et al.rBiochimica et Biophysica Acta 1340 1997 205214 ( )  enthalpy.
For associations of intermediate affinity   .
HyHEL-5 with BWQL , the Origin software was  used to fit the data using a single set of identical  sites model after correcting for lysozyme dilution  .
  in order to obtain the stoichiometric equivalence ratio  n, association constant K , and enthalpy of associa- a  tion DH.
  In the ITC experiments the experimentally determined equivalence ratio based on the number of  antibody binding sites is typically 1520% less than  the expected value of 1.0.
Potential sources of this  discrepancy include approximately 510% error in  the calculated value of the extinction coefficient for  HyHEL-5 used to determine the antibody concentration 10 , the presence of traces of inactive protein or w x  residual contaminants in the purified preparations  control experiments using excess BSA have showed  that the presence of BSA does not affect the accuracy  of the experimentally determined thermodynamic  quantities 10 .
The deviation in the equivalence w x.  ratio does not affect the accuracy of the determined  enthalpy change of association because each experiment was done with an accurately known amount of  lysozyme and excess antibody was present during  initial injections.
The equilibrium binding constant  determined for the association of BWQL with HyHEL-5 was in good agreement with the binding  constant determined by fluorescence spectroscopy  w x 15 , further supporting the accuracy of the values  reported here.

Control experiments for proton liberation or uptake upon  binding were performed by measuring the enthalpy of  association in Tris buffer enthalpy of ionization,   y1 11.51 kcal mol at 258C 16 and sodium phosphate w x.   y1 buffer enthalpy of ionization, 1.22 kcal mol at  258C 16 .
The slight difference in w x. DH indicates that  there may be uptake of a fraction of a proton per mol   .

The enthalpy  of association depends strongly on temperature, declining linearly from y15.5 kcal moly1 at 138C to  y25.6 kcal moly1 at 378C.

Discussion  Characterizing the thermodynamic driving forces  responsible for association in antibodyrprotein antigen complexes of known three-dimensional structure  can advance understanding of the structural and energetic determinants of affinity and specificity.
The  association of BWQL, CQL and R45K-HEL with  HyHEL-5 is enthalpically-driven at all temperatures  studied, as was found for HyHEL-5rHEL binding  w x 10 and for most high affinity antibodyrprotein antigen associations 1725 .
For all the lysozymes, w x DH8  is a linear function of TDS8 suggesting the existence  of enthalpy-entropy compensation in the binding process Table 6 .
 .
  In all four systems the entropic contributions to  association are unfavorable.
The lysozyme loops  around residues 45 and 70 lie within the HyHEL-5  epitope and are among the most mobile residues in  uncomplexed lysozyme 4 ; the unfavorable entropy w x  of association may arise in part from loss of mobility  of these residues on complex formation, as in the  native HyHEL-5rHEL complex 2 .
Large backbone w x  differences were observed for these loops on comparing free and HyHEL-5 complexed BWQL 4 .
It has w x  been estimated by experiments using osmolytes that  about 612 water molecules are taken up on formation of the HyHEL-5rBWQL complex 15 , which w x  Table 6  Effect of temperature on the change in free energy, enthalpy and entropy for the association of HEL, R45K-HEL, CQL and BWQL with  HyHEL-5 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0  .

Some of the favorable enthalpic contribution may be due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions 26 .
Comparing R45K-HEL with HEL and w x  BWQL with CQL Table 7 , it is observed that in the  .
  temperature range studied the salt-links formed by  arginine residues at positions 45 and 68 contribute  favorably to the enthalpy of association.
  The results for the association of BWQL with  HyHEL-5 at 258C in the presence of Tris and phosphate buffers Table 2 , suggests the existence of  .
  slight proton linkage in this system.
The corrected  DH8 of association obtained by accounting for the  enthalpy of ionization of the buffers is y20.4 kcal  moly1 at 258C. As no proton linkage was observed  for the association of HEL, CQL and R45K-HEL  with HyHEL-5, it is likely that the loss of the salt-link  between Arg68 and GluH50 may be associated with a  fractional proton absorption event.
This issue is the  subject of further investigation using directed mutagenesis.
  Both BWQL and CQL bear the characteristic  quail mutations at positions 40, 55 and 91 Table   1 .
Additionally, BWQL has an Arg68 .
Lys and  CQL has a Gln121His mutation.
Since residue  121 is away from the HyHEL-5 epitope and in all  functional assays done to date the interaction of CQL  with HyHEL-5 is equivalent to that with HEL, the  thermodynamic differences between BWQL and CQL  are most likely due to the difference in residue 68   .
ArgLys .
The loss of the salt-link formed by  residue 68 3,4 has a large effect on the affinity w x   .

The Arg68Lys mutation produces an  unfavorable change in the entropic contribution to  association Table 7 .
Interestingly, in both HyHEL-  .  5rBWQL and HyHEL-5rR68K-HEL complexes a  water molecule is bound in place of the terminal  nitrogens of HEL Arg68 3,4 .
Also, comparison of w x  the HyHEL-5rHEL structure with HyHEL-5rBWQL  and HyHEL-5rR68K-HEL structures shows the loss  of at least one hydrogen bond, which could account  for some of the observed unfavorable change in the  enthalpic contribution to association for the HyHEL5rBWQL system.
At present, however, the structural  data do not provide a complete explanation for the  observed differences in the energetics of association.
  The structure of the HyHEL-5rHEL complex  shows a salt-link between Arg45 of HEL and GluH50  of HyHEL-5 2,5 .
Molecular modeling suggests that w x  a Lys in position 45 could also form that salt-link  w x 27 , in contrast to the Arg68Lys mutation where  Table 7  Effect of Arg45Lys, Arg68Lys and quail mutations on the change in free energy, enthalpy and entropy of association at various  temperatures  y1 y1 y1 Temperature  .

Comparing the association of R45K-HEL with  HEL and BWQL with CQL, the thermodynamic effects of the R45K and R68K mutations are strikingly  different Table 7 .
The  . DDG8s at 258C of the mutations are q2.0"0.2 kcal moly1 and q5.1"0.2  kcal moly1 respectively.
Both the mutations are associated with an increased DH8 and TDS8, but each  effect is more pronounced at lower temperatures for  the R45K mutation.
  All three variant lysozymes studied have similar  DC for association with HyHEL-5 p y420 to y450  cal moly1 Ky1  ; these values are indistinguishable  within experimental error , which is quite different .

Comparing . .
  DDC for the association of HyHEL-5 with HEL and p  CQL, the effect of the quail mutations on DC is p   y1 y1 large 110 cal mol K .
There was good agree- .
  ment between the DC calculated by the method of p  Murphy and Freire 28 and the experimentally deter- w x  mined DC 10 for the HyHEL-5 w x rHEL system.
p  However, methods for calculating DC from surface p  area buried on association 28,29 cannot account for w x  the observed change in DC due to the buried quail p  mutations.
Although the quail mutations in CQL are  all buried and are not part of the HyHEL-5 structural  epitope residue 40 is at the edge of the epitope , the  .
  calorimetric results suggest that these residues affect  the interaction of the HyHEL-5 epitope with the  antibody.
There is no evidence to date that the difference in residue 121 significantly affects HyHEL-5  association; however, a definitive test must await the  results of ongoing experiments.
In contrast, studies of  the putative evolutionary intermediates separating hen  from quail lysozymes showed significant variation in  thermostability, which was correlated with the combined volume of the amino acid side groups occupying positions 40, 55 and 91 30,31 .
There is a w x  likelihood of the quail mutations affecting the binding of CQL and possibly also BWQL due to the  linkage between folding and binding, but further  experiments are necessary to draw any definitive  conclusions.
There is some evidence that BWQL and  the site-directed mutant, R68K-HEL which does not   have the quail mutations , do not associate equiva- .
  lently with HyHEL-5 7 and in the present study we w x  were unable to obtain good calorimetric data with  R68K-HEL.
Also, HyHEL-5 association perturbs  amide exchange kinetics of residues distant from the  epitope 32 , suggesting that mutations away from the w x  structural epitope could affect the association energetics.
  For comparison, we note that trypsin binds equally  well to substrates with either arginine or lysine in the  P site of the trypsin inhibitor 33,34 .
In the w x 1  trypsinrBPTI complex, an aspartic acid residue of  trypsin forms a salt-link with arginine or a water  molecule mediates the interaction with lysine, similar  to the interaction of HyHEL-5 with HEL and with  R68K-HEL or BWQL 3 .
Comparison of the Hy- w x  HEL-5rHEL and HyHEL-5rR68K-HEL complexes  with trypsin complexed with wild-type BPTI 35 and w x  Lys15Arg BPTI mutant 36 show that the local w x  environment is important in determining the effect of  even a conservative mutation 4 . w x  The sensitivity of antibodyrprotein antigen association thermodynamics to seemingly minor structural  perturbations has been illustrated by several previous  examples.
A few residues at the center of the contact  interface of the anti-HEL antibody D1.3 were shown  to be primarily responsible for the binding affinity to  lysozyme, but non-contact residues could modulate  the binding interaction 37 .
Interestingly, a study of w x  substitutions of closely related amino acids at the  contact surface in the D1.3rHEL system showed that  changes in entropy compensate for changes in enthalpy produced by mutation 38,39 .
The affinity of w x  the humanized version of the anti-lysozyme antibody  D1.3 was improved by substitutions in framework  positions adjacent to the CDRs, but not in direct  contact with the antigen 40 .
Structures of several w x  variants of influenza virus neuraminidase with single  amino acid changes in the epitope recognized by  antibody NC41 41,42 have demonstrated that very w x  subtle changes in the antigen can dramatically reduce  antibody binding, while seemingly drastic substitutions may be accommodated with only a slight decrease in affinity.
Heteroclitic binding of D11.15 with  avian lysozymes was shown to be due to a stereochemically permissive environment for residues that  varied in the epitope region 43 . w x  In agreement with previous studies, we have shown  that the salt-links formed between the arginines of the  HyHEL-5 epitope and the glutamic acids on the HELK.A. Shick et al.rBiochimica et Biophysica Acta 1340 1997 205214 ( ) 213  paratope contribute significantly to the energetics of  HyHEL-5rHEL association.
However, the thermodynamic effects of the two salt-links are different.
  Surprisingly, the antibodyrantigen interaction is affected by conservative substitutions of buried residues  which are not part of the HyHEL-5 structural epitope.
  This study has also demonstrated the usefulness of  isothermal titration calorimetry as a technique for  delineating very subtle changes in protein structure,  that are not apparent from the comparison of the  three-dimensional structures of the individual proteins and proteinprotein complexes.
