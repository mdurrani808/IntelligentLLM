On the Importance of Being Aromatic at an  Antibody-Protein Antigen Interface: Mutagenesis of  the Extracellular Interferon g Receptor and  Recognition by the Neutralizing Antibody A6  Klaus Hofstadter, Fiona Stuart, Luyong Jiang, Jan W. Vrijbloed  and John A. Robinson*  Department of Chemistry  University of Zurich  Winterthurerstrasse 190  8057 Zurich, Switzerland  A complex formed between the extracellular human interferon gamma  receptor a-chain (hIFNgR) and the Fab fragment of the neutralizing antibody A6 has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis.
Five complementarity determining regions of the A6 antibody interact primarily with the CC0  surface loop of the receptor, from Lys47 to Trp56, although contact is also  made with residues in the neighbouring F strand, in particular with Trp82.
  The relative contribution that individual side-chains make to complex stabilization was assessed with 21 receptors mutants, whose afnity for A6 was  monitored using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor, as well as by solution-phase competition ELISA.
The results reveal two lysine side-chains  (Lys47 and Lys52), an asparagine side-chain (Asn53), and two aromatic  side-chains (Tyr49 and Trp82) in the receptor that are important for recognition by A6.
The role of aromatic side-chains in antibody-antigen recognition is of particular interest, not least in this case because 13 aromatic  groups (six Tyr, six Trp and one His) are present at the interface (four in VL,  six in VH and three in the receptor), and several are proximal to the charged  and polar side-chains of Lys47, Lys52 and Asn53 in the receptor.
The results  highlight the possibility for aromatic rings to participate in networks of cooperative interactions with not only hydrophobic, but also charged and  hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups, properties that are well suited  for creating binding sites for protein epitopes, regardless of the distribution  of polar and non-polar surface residues.
These ndings may contribute,  therefore, to an understanding of how surface groups on proteins are captured by the often aromatic-rich hypervariable loops of antibodies, and may  be of value for the design of molecules with novel recognition properties.

The bound  antigen surface, which may comprise polar and  non-polar residues, typically makes multiple contacts with several of the antibody hypervariable  loops.
The relative importance of salt bridges,  hydrogen bonds, as well as the hydrophobic and  other effects in stabilizing the antibody-antigen  complex remain, however, a matter of debate  (Braden & Poljak, 1995, 1997; Davies & Cohen,  1996; Jones & Thornton, 1996; Wilson & Staneld,  1994; Xu et al., 1997).
  Here, we have studied by mutagenesis a complex formed between the extracellular human interferon g receptor a-chain (hIFNgR) and the Fab  fragment of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody  (mAb) A6.
The hIFNgR is a type-II cytokine receptor (Silvennoinen & Ihle, 1996) whose extracellular  portion folds into two Ig-like domains (Figure 1;  Williams et al., 1995).
Each domain has a FBN-III  (bronectin type-III) fold comprising two antiparallel b-sheets formed by strands A, B, E and G, F, C  and C0  .
A crystal structure of a recombinant extracellular hIFNgR in a 2:1 receptor:ligand complex  with IFNg revealed how two receptor chains bind  the homodimeric ligand at the cell surface (Walter  et al., 1995).
Residues in the CC0 and EF loops as  well as the F and G b-strands of the rst receptor  domain, the helical interdomain linker, and the BC  and FG loops from domain 2, together provide an  extensive surface (total ca.
960 A 2  ) that is buried  by IFNg in the complex.
  The epitope bound by the mAb A6 was revealed  in a crystal structure of hIFNgR domain 1 (residues  1-108 with a Cys105Ser mutation{) complexed to  the Fab fragment at 2.8 A (Figure 2; Sogabe et al.,  1997).
Five complementarity determining regions  (CDRs) of A6 interact primarily with the CC0 surface loop of the receptor, from Lys47 to Trp56,  although contact is also made with residues in the  neighbouring F strand, in particular with Trp82  Figure 2.

  806 Interferon   Receptor Recognition by A6(Figure 3).
The antibody epitope on the receptor  overlaps to a large extent with the site occupied by  IFNg in the ligand-receptor complex, thereby  explaining the inhibitory activity of A6 (Bridges  et al., 1996).
However, the CC0 loop has quite a  different backbone conformation in the two complexes, with the tip of the loop displaced over  8 A , which allows the receptor to provide steric  and electrostatic complementarity to two quite differently shaped ligands.
No (3D) structural information is available for the free hIFNR, nor for the  free A6 mAb.
  We describe here mutagenesis studies of residues in the CC0 loop and anking F strand in the  hIFNgR, designed to examine their role in recognition by A6.
Site-directed receptor mutants have  been prepared and their afnities for A6 have been  monitored using a SPR (surface plasma resonance)  biosensor (BIAcore instrument, Pharmacia) and a  solution-phase competition ELISA.
The results  point to the importance of, in particular, two lysine  side-chains (Lys47 and Lys52), an asparagine sidechain (Asn53), and two aromatic side-chains  (Tyr49 and Trp82) in the receptor for recognition  by A6.
The role of aromatic side-chains in antibody-antigen recognition is of particular interest,  not least in this case, because 13 aromatic groups  (six Tyr, six Trp and one His) are present at the  interface (four in VL, six in VH and three in the  receptor), and several are proximal to the charged  and polar side-chains of Lys47, Lys52 and Asn53  in the receptor.
The results highlight the potential  importance not only of the hydrophobic effect,  but also of p-cation interactions and NH-aromatic  hydrogen bonds, all mediated by aromatic  groups, in stabilizing the complex.
Our ndings  may, therefore, have a wider signicance for  understanding how polar and non-polar surface  groups on proteins are captured by the often aromatic-rich (Davies & Cohen, 1996; Mian et al.,  1991; Padlan, 1990) hypervariable loops of  antibodies.

The injected concentration of  each receptor protein was 100 nM,  except for K52 M, W82Y, W82F,  K47 M and wt binding to gR38,  where a receptor concentration of  500 nM was used.
The ow buffer  was 50 mM sodium phosphate  (pH 7.4) with 150 mM NaCl and  0.005 % (v/v) Surfactant p20, and  the ow rate was 10 ml per minute.
  Interferon   Receptor Recognition by A6 807Finally, a second anti-hIFNgR neutralizing mAb  gR38 (Garotta et al., 1990) has been investigated,  whose epitope overlaps that recognized by A6  (Sogabe et al., 1997; Williams et al., 1995).
However,  no crystal structure is available for the gR38-  hIFNgR complex.
Binding assays with receptor  mutants have identied residues in the CC0 loop  that are also important for recognition by this  mAb.
  Results  Production and CD spectra of mutants  The yields of most mutant receptors were similar  to that of wt (wild-type) except for Y49A and  W82A (two- to threefold higher), and W56F, W56Y  and R84A (two- to threefold lower).
No full-length  W56A mutant could be isolated.
Also, the R84A  mutant was less stable than wt, being especially  prone to proteolytic cleavage.
  The CD spectra of all mutants in the far-UV  were similar in shape to that of the wt receptor,  with a large negative peak at 198 nm and a small  positive maximum at 230-235 nm, although for  some mutants (N48A, G50A, K52A, W56F) peak  intensities were reduced by 10-20 %.
In the nearUV CD, all mutants gave spectra similar to wt,  with a negative peak at 284 nm; however, for  N48A, G50A and E55A this peak was slightly less  intense, and for W56Y and all W82 mutants  slightly more intense.
The data support the conclusion that all mutants have the same overall fold  as the wt receptor, but do not rule out changes in  preferred loop conformations (vide infra).
  SPR measurements  For afnity measurements using a BIAcore  instrument (Pharmacia) the intact mAbs were  immobilized on the sensor surface by random  amine coupling.
The soluble wt or mutant receptors in the ow buffer contain a single antibody  binding site.
The validity of tting binding curves  to a 1:1 interaction model was assessed using global data analysis, as described in method 1 (see  Materials and Methods).
For comparison, attempts  were also made to t binding curves to alternative  binding models that describe reactions in which  the immobilized ligand is heterogeneous, or the  receptor is heterogeneous, or that assume a twostep binding reaction.
In all cases where this method was applied, the assumption of a simple 1:1  interaction model tted the experimental data at  least as well as more complex models, or was the  only acceptable model.
Incorporation of a term for  mass transfer had little effect on the closeness of  the t. Studies using different immobilization  levels and ow rates indicated little inuence of  mass-transport limitation under the measurement  conditions used.
Representative binding curves are  shown in Figure 4, and the apparent binding conTable 2.

  808 Interferon   Receptor Recognition by A6stants for each mutant are shown for mAbs A6  and gR38 in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
  For mutants with dissociation rates increased  more than fourfold method 2 was employed  (see Figure 4).
Mutants that were analysed with  method 2 showed association phases that tted  well a 1:1 interaction model.
Also, analysis of the  wt and several mutants by method 1 and method  2 gave essentially the same afnity constants.
  Binding interactions with a very high koff reach  steady state almost immediately, and so give rise  to rectangular-shaped binding curves, from which  it is impossible to extract kinetic data.
The interactions of mutants K47A and Y49A with A6, and  N53A, S54A, W56F and W82A with gR38 fell into  this category.
For these mutants the only extractable parameter was KA, which was determined as  described in method 3 (Tables 1 and 2).
  Several interactions could not be analysed by the  above methods, either because they exhibited  clearly biphasic binding patterns, or because the  afnity of the interaction was too low.
For  example, mutant G50A showed biphasic association and dissociation responses.
The major component in the response to K47M, K52M and W82A  showed a fast off-rate, and a gradual increase in  response during the association phase (Figure 4).
  Injections of increasing receptor concentrations  indicated that in no case was saturation reached.
  The ts of these binding curves to the 1:1, and to  more complex binding models were poor.
The  apparent KD values for these mutants (Table 1)  were, therefore, estimated by method 4 (see  Materials and Methods).
  Competition ELISA  
The apparent KD values for mutants binding to  the mAb A6 (where a crystal structure of the antibody-antigen complex is available) were also determined in solution by competition ELISA.
The  results shown in Table 3 indicate a good agreement  with the afnities determined using the BIAcore  instrument (Table 1).
In particular, mutants with  signicantly poorer afnities (e.g. >10-fold higher  KD values) are correctly identied by both  methods.
  Discussion  The mutagenesis experiments described above  provide binding data that correlate well with the  structure of the A6-receptor complex determined  by crystallography.
The A6 Fab fragment contacts  mainly residues in the CC0 surface loop of the  receptor (Lys47 to Trp56) in the A6-hIFNgR complex.
In addition to this loop, the residue Trp82 in  the neighbouring F-strand makes edge-on-face contact with the side-chain of TrpL92 of the mAb.
  These two tryptophan residues, along with Trp56  and Try49, comprise a group of four aromatic residues that lie nearby the side-chain of Lys47  (Figure 3).
The indole ring of TrpL92 is positioned  above the side-chain of the (presumably)  ammonium N-atom of Lys47.
The NZ atom of  Lys47 is 3.9 A from the centre of the six-membered  ring of TrpL92, which together with the mainchain carbonyl O-atoms of TrpL92 and Asn48,  offer an almost optimal hydrogen-bonding geometry for an ammonium group (Figure 5(a)).
Truncation of the side-chain in the mutant K47A leads  to a large loss in afnity to the antibody.
Moreover, this afnity loss is not recouped in the  K47M mutant, highlighting the signicant energetic contribution made by the polar side-chain  of Lys47.
  The mutagenesis data also show that the sidechains of Tyr49 and Trp82 are important for high  afnity binding to A6.
Whether the same is true  for Trp56 is less clear, since the W56A mutant  could not be isolated.
The indole of Trp56 packs  against the aliphatic methylene groups (CB, CG  and CD) in the side-chain of Lys47, but can be  replaced by a benzene (W56F) or phenol (W56Y)  ring without loss of afnity (Tables 1 and 3).
The  W82A mutant is of special interest.
The indole ring  of Trp82 does not directly contact Lys47.
Rather,  the centroids of the ve-membered ring of Trp82  and the six-membered ring of TrpL92 are 5.1 A  apart, in an edge-to-face stacking geometry  (Figure 5(a)).
The signicance of this T-stacked  arrangement is discussed in more detail below.
  The energetically important side-chains of Tyr49  and Asn53 (Tables 1 and 3) lie adjacent on one face  of the CC0 loop and constitute the central part of  the epitope that reaches deepest into the binding  cavity on A6.
From the crystal structure, it appears  that one NH bond from the Nd2 atom of Asn53 is  Table 3.

  Interferon   Receptor Recognition by A6 809directed towards the backbone carbonyl O-atom of  TyrL91, while the other points to the centre of the  benzenoid ring of TrpL96 located at the bottom of  the antigen binding site (2.8 A from the H-atom to  the ring centre), suggestive of an NH-aromatic  hydrogen bond (Levitt & Perutz, 1988; Figure 5(b)).
  It is also intriguing that the side-chain carbonyl  O-atom of Asn53 points directly at the s-plane of  TrpH52.
The dipole interaction of the carbonyl-CO  group and the aromatic C-H bond would suggest  that this arrangement might also have a stabilizing  inuence.
This conclusion is supported by earlier  theoretical and structural database studies, which  revealed a preferred edge-on orientation of carbonyl CO groups with respect to aromatic rings in  densely packed protein interiors (Thomas et al.,  1982).
  In the case of Tyr49, the side-chain is buried in a  pocket with its phenolic O-atom in hydrogen-bonding distance (ca. 3.1 A ) of an imidazole N-atom in  HisH100B.
Both BIAcore assays and ELISA show a  reduced receptor afnity for the Y49F mutant of  about 0.8-1.0 kcal/mol.
More detailed crystallographic and thermodynamic studies of the energetic importance of hydrogen bonds involving Tyr  OH groups have been reported at the D1.3-lysozyme antibody-antigen interface, where effects of  Tyr to Phe mutations up to 2.6 kcal/mol were  reported (Fields et al., 1996).
Truncation of the Tyr  side-chain to alanine in this work, as in the Y49A  mutant, leads to a more dramatic loss in afnity to  the antibody (Tables 1 and 3).
  Another cluster of critical residues are those at  the tip of the loop, from Gly50 to Lys52.
The f/  c angles of Gly50 (132  and 94 , resp.) lie in  a region of f/c-space that is unfavourable for a  non-glycine residue.
Introducing Ala at this position (G50A mutant) should force a change in the  preferred conformation of the CC0 loop, thereby  explaining the lower afnity of the G50A mutant.
  The biphasic behaviour of the association-phase  binding curves from BIAcore measurements  clearly suggest that more than one process is  occurring, which conceivably may correspond  with binding reactions involving conformational  changes within the CC0 loop.
The Val51 sidechain makes hydrophobic contacts with several  surrounding residues, the loss of which would  account for the reduced afnity observed in the  V51A mutant.
  The side-chain of Lys52, at the tip of the CC0  loop, appears to be involved in a network of interactions, including several with aromatic sidechains donated by the antibody.
The ammonium  N-atom is positioned ca. 2.8 A from carboxylate  O-atoms in the side-chains of both AspH56 and  AspH54 (Figure 5(c)).
In addition, the four methylene groups in Lys52 run parallel and across the  indole ring of TrpH52 (Cd and Ce 4.5 A from the  centroids of the six and ve membered rings,  respectively) on one side, and close to the indole  ring of TrpH53 on the other.
Meanwhile, the indole  of TrpH52 makes edge-on-face contact through its  indole NH with the phenol ring of TyrH58, while  the other face (not in contact with Lys52) makes  edge-on-face contact with the side-chain imidazole  of HisH50.
The other face of the benzenoid ring of  TrpH53 is also only 3.4 A from the backbone  N-atom of GlyH33, in a H-bonding geometry  (Figure 5(c)).
This network of interactions seem to  have formed around a cavity occupied by the  Lys52 side-chain.
Truncating or removing the  ammonium group from the Lys52 side-chain leads  to a large loss of afnity for the K52A and K52M  mutants (Tables 1 and 3).
  The polar-charged side-chains of Arg84, Lys98  and Glu55, on the other hand, are located on the  periphery of the interface (Figure 3), and appear  from analysis of mutants to be energetically less  important than the buried side-chains of Lys47 and  Figure 5.

  810 Interferon   Receptor Recognition by A6Lys52.
The E55A mutant is the only one to show a  small increase in afnity compared with wt, for  reasons that are not clear, in both the BIAcore  assay and by ELISA.
The side-chains of Asn79,  Ser54, and Asn48 are situated under the CC0 loop,  and do not make direct contact with the antibody.
  The N48A, S54A and N79A mutations had minor  effects on afnity, suggesting that they have little  inuence on the bound conformation of the CC0  loop (Sogabe et al., 1997).
  As far as the structural epitope bound by gR38 is  concerned, the mutagenesis data in Tables 1 and 2  reveal similarities and differences in the relative  importance of side-chains in and around the CC0  loop for binding these two antibodies.
The K47A,  Y49A, G50A and W82A mutations have large  effects on binding both antibodies, whereas, in particular, the K52A mutation produces a large effect  only on binding to A6.
Unfortunately, it has not  proven possible so far to crystallize the IFNgR in a  complex with either the Fab or single chain Fv  fragment of gR38 (Bridges et al., 1996).
  It would also be of interest to investigate how  the receptor mutants are recognized by the natural  ligand IFNg.
IFNg, however, is a homodimer with  two apparently equivalent binding sites, each composed of residues from both polypeptide chains  (Walter et al., 1995).
There are also reports that the  homodimer dissociates at sub-micromolar concentrations to inactive monomeric chains (Boteva et al.,  1996).
These properties considerably complicate  analyses of ligand-receptor binding in terms of a  simple 1:1 interaction model, by BIAcore and competition ELISA, and have so far prevented determination of reliable binding constants using these  methods.
The recent report of a designed, monomeric, single chain IFNg that forms a 1:1 complex  with the receptor (Randal & Kossiakoff, 1998) may,  however, provide a starting point to overcome  these problems.
  In several other protein-protein complexes, only  a subset of the many side-chains buried at the  interface appear to be crucial for high afnity recognition.
These key side-chains may be distributed  over the interface as found, for example, in the  D1.3-E5.2 complex (Covell & Wallqvist, 1997;  Dall'Acqua et al., 1996; Goldman et al., 1997) and  the 5G9 Fab bound to TF (Huang et al., 1998), or  localized to one (usually central) region, as found  in the D1.3-lysozyme (Dall'Acqua et al., 1996;  England et al., 1997; Fields et al., 1996; Hawkins  et al., 1993), the NC41-neuraminidase (Nuss et al.,  1993), barstar-barnase (Serrano et al., 1991), and  hGH-hGHR (Clackson & Wells, 1995) complexes.
  From the perspective of the antigen, the A6-  hIFNgR complex ts the former pattern, in that  only ve from about a dozen side-chain modi-  cations produced the largest changes in afnity,  these being distributed throughout the binding  interface.
  Detailed studies of the D1.3-E5.2 (Goldman et al.,  1997) as well as hGH-hGHR (Clackson & Wells,  1995) complexes revealed that the ``hot'' residues  on one side of the interface generally match  those on the other, both with respect to position,  and polarity/hydrophobicity.
The hot spot at the  hGH-hGHR interface appears to comprise central,  well-packed hydrophobic contacts, dominated on  the receptor side by two tryptophan residues  (W104 and W169), and surrounded towards the  periphery of the interface by apparently less critical hydrophilic residues (Pearce et al., 1996).
The  importance of hydrophobic aromatic groups in  ligand binding to another cytokine receptor has  also been noted (Johnson et al., 1998).
In the  D1.3-E5.2 system, on the other hand, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic contacts play important  roles in stabilizing the complex.
This may reect  a more general requirement that antibodies be  able to bind diverse antigenic surfaces comprising polar as well as non-polar residues (Goldman  et al., 1997).
In this respect, the statistical overrepresentation of aromatic residues, especially  Tyr and Trp (discussed by Davies & Cohen,  1996), in antibody combining sites may be of  special interest.
  Thus aromatic residues may participate favourably not only in hydrophobic contacts with nonpolar groups in the antigen but, where necessary,  also in polar interactions through the quadrupole  and dipole moments of the aromatic ring.
For  example, the interactions of the p-system of a benzene ring with cations (Dougherty, 1996) and with  amide NH hydrogen bond donors (Burley &  Petsko, 1986; Levitt & Perutz, 1988; Worth &  Wade, 1995) are well recognized, as are so-called  ``p-p`` interactions between aromatic rings, in  model systems such as the benzene and toluene  dimers, and in proteins.
Analyses of crystal structures (Burley & Petsko, 1985; Hunter et al., 1991)  indicated a preference for T-shaped (edge-on-face)  conformations for interacting aromatic rings in proteins, and mutagenesis data has suggested interaction energies of 1.3 kcal/mol for aromatic pairs  in a T-geometry in barnase (Serrano et al., 1991).
  Recent quantum mechanical calculations (Chipot  et al., 1996) have indicated that the T-geometry of  the benzene dimer is preferred over the stacked  geometry in water by 1.47 kcal/mol, although  this preference changes for the toluene dimer  which favours the stacked geometry by 1.12 kcal/  mol.
As noted by Chipot et al., (1996), however, the  T-geometry may be advantageous within folded  proteins and, by analogy, also at protein-protein  interfaces, since not only the ``s-p`` contact may  occur, but also additional stabilizing interactions,  possibly in co-operative networks, through the  remaining three exposed p-faces.
  The importance of aromatic-aromatic and  ammonium-aromatic interactions at antibody-protein antigen interfaces has been addressed already  in studies of HyHEL10 Fab complexed to HEL  (Tsumoto et al., 1995).
Both types of interaction are  implicated in the A6-IFNgR complex, for example,  by the T-stacking of Trp82 indole with the indole  of TrpL92 which, in turn, appears to participate in  Interferon   Receptor Recognition by A6 811a p-cation interaction with the side-chain of Lys47.
  The Trp82 indole, meanwhile, also participates in  hydrophobic contacts through its lower face with  the methylene groups in Glu101 (Figure 5A).
The  ability of aromatic groups to participate in favourable and possibly co-operative interactions with  hydrophobic, aromatic, as well as charged and  hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups, would  appear to make them well suited for binding sites  that must respond to surface features of proteins,  regardless of the distribution of polar and nonpolar groups.
Of course, the phenolic O-atom in  Tyr is itself a valuable additional source of hydrogen-bonding interactions.
This interpretation of the  chemistry of the aromatic amino acids, if correct,  might go some way to explaining their frequent  occurrence in antibody CDRs, and potentially also  be of importance in designing sites with novel  binding capabilities.
The energetic contribution  that each type of interaction makes will no doubt  depend on the detailed geometry, dielectric and  extent of solvation of the immediate environment.
  A study of the A6 antibody combining site using  site-directed mutagenesis is currently underway,  which may shed more light on the relative importance of these interactions in this system.
  Materials and Methods  Site-directed mutagenesis  The wt hIFNgR from residues 1-229 (hIFNgR1-229), and  all mutants, were produced by a secretion expression  system in Escherichia coli HB2151, and puried by immunoafnity chromatography using a mAb (9E10) against a  C-terminal c-myc tag (Evan et al., 1985), and subsequent  ion-exchange chromatography on Mono-Q (Pharmacia),  as described (Sogabe et al., 1997).
Site-directed mutations  were introduced by PCR-based methods using the wt  hIFNgR cDNA as template, as described (Sogabe et al.,  1997).
Each mutant cDNA was sequenced in the  expression vector pHEN1 (Hoogenboom et al., 1991)  throughout the entire open reading frame, on both DNA  strands, using dye terminator chemistry (Perkin Elmer)  to conrm that only the desired nt changes had been  introduced.
The yield of protein was typically 0.2-  0.5 mg/l of culture.
The puried wt hIFNgR1-229 and  mutants were >95 % homogeneous on SDS-PAGE, and  gave electrospray mass spectra consistent with the  expected mass.
  CD spectra  CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter at 25 C at 10-20 mM protein concentration in  20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 30 mM  NaCl for measurements in the range 180-280 nm.
For  spectra in the near-UV (250-330 nm), 50 mM sodium  phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 150 mM NaCl was used.
  BIAcore measurements  The mAbs A6 and gR38 were immobilized on CM5  sensor surfaces (Pharmacia) by random amine coupling,  using methods described (Sogabe et al., 1997).
The wt  and mutant receptor proteins were eluted over the sensor surface in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2;  BIAcore buffer) with 150 mM NaCl) and 0.005 % (v/v)  Surfactant p20 (Pharmacia) at 25 C. For determination  of kon and koff the immobilization levels corresponded to  400-900 RU, whereas for steady-state measurements  the levels were 1200-5000 RU.
These immobilization  levels gave rise to Rmax values on receptor binding of  100-200 RU, and 200-900 RU, respectively.
Around  10,000 RUs of mAb gR99 (which binds an epitope in the  second FBN-III domain of the receptor, unrelated to that  bound by A6 and gR38; Sogabe et al., 1997) were  immobilised and used for determination of active free  receptor concentrations from initial binding rates (mass  transport limited conditions; Karlsson et al., 1993).
Protein concentrations in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer  (pH 7.2) with 150 mM NaCl were determined from A280  measurements after calibration by quantitative amino  acid analysis (1 mg/ml corresponds with A280  1.7 for  IFNgR1-229), and from mass transport limited initial binding rates to the gR99 surface.
The agreement between  these methods was good.
  Freshly prepared wt receptor was analysed with  each batch of mutants.
All measurements were completed at least in duplicate.
Repeat runs on one surface  with duplicates of the same sample gave maximum  standard deviations of 3 % for kon and koff, and 5 %  for KD.
The standard deviation was greater between  batches of protein analysed on mAb surfaces immobilised at different times; kon varied up to 25 %, koff up to  15 % and KD up to 25 %.
A6 mAb surfaces were regenerated by injection of 10 ml of 10 M ethanolamine  (pH 10).
For gR38 surfaces, sufcient time between  sample injections was given to allow the response to  return to the pre-injection level.
  BIAcore data analysis  The mutant receptor proteins showed a broad range  of binding characteristics.
As such, no one method of  quantifying afnities was applicable.
  Method 1: determination of kon and koff by  global analysis  A 1:1 interaction model was tted to the data using  BIAevaluation Software (v 3.0) (Karlsson & Faelt, 1997).
  In this method, the association and dissociation phases  of all binding curves in a dilution series are tted simultaneously (global analysis).
This tting method was suitable for analysis of the binding curves of receptor  mutants N48A, N48Q, K52A, N53A, S54A, E55A, W56F,  W56Y, N79A, R84A and K98A interacting with A6, and  mutants N48A, G50A, V51A, K52A, K52 M, E55A,  W56Y and K98A interacting with gR38.
  Method 2: determination of kon from the association  phase and KA from steady state analysis  Mutants Y49F, V51A, W82F and W82Y binding to A6  and mutants N48Q, Y49F, N79A, W82F, W82Y and R84A  binding to gR38, gave binding curves with a high apparent koff, but with association phases suitable for kinetic  analysis.
These mutants were measured on low density  surfaces to collect data for association phase analysis, and  on higher density surfaces for determination of steady812 Interferon   Receptor Recognition by A6state binding levels.
Association phase data were tted to  the equation (O'Shannessy et al., 1993):  R  Req1  ekobs tto   1  where Req is steady state response level; kobs  konC  koff,  where C is the molar concentration of the injected analyte;  and to is start time for tting association data.
KA was  determined by a tting a plot of Req against C (Karlsson  et al., 1991):  Req  KACRmax=KAC  1 2  Method 3: determination of KA from steady  state analysis  Mutants K47A and Y49A interacting with A6 and  mutants N53A, S54A, W56F and W82A interacting with  gR38 gave rectangular binding curves.
In these cases KA  only was determined by steady state measurements (see  Method-2).
  Method 4: approximation of affinity from  comparison of binding curves  An approximation of the afnity was obtained from  the concentration of mutant required to give half the saturation response (Rmax/2) of the A6 surface, Rmax being  determined using 1 mM wt IFNgR1-229.
These cases are  discussed individually in Results.
  Competition ELISA  Competition ELISA was performed as described  (Friguet et al., 1985, 1989).
Conditions were chosen so  that only a small percentage of the free antibody molecules bind to the coated antigen (<10 %), and the absorbance measured in the ELISA is proportional to the mAb  concentration, as described (Friguet et al., 1989).
The  coating of wells was performed with IFNgR1-229 receptor  (0.2 mg/ml) in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6).
  Receptor and A6 were incubated in BIAcore buffer, then  free A6 was detected by ELISA using goat anti-mouse  IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase.
If the equilibrium concentration of free antigenic sites is a, that of  free antibody sites is i, and that of the antigenic sites  occupied by mAb is x, then KA  x/(a/i). Also x  io  i  and a  ao  x, where io and ao are the total antibody site  and antigenic site concentrations, respectively.
The fraction of bound antibody sites is then f  x/io, which was  measured using the method described by Stevens (1987)  to account for the bivalency of the mAb.
The experimental data gave linear plots of f/a against f, from which KD  was calculated according to the Scatchard equation:  f =a  1=KD  1  f 3  All measurements were completed at least in triplicate  and the mean standard deviation was maximally 20%  Acknowledgements  The authors thank Dr Fritz Winkler (F.
