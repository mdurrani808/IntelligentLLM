Mutations in CBF genes are found in leukemias,  bone disorders, and gastric cancers.
CBFs consist of a  DNA-binding CBF subunit (Runx1, Runx2, or Runx3)  and a non-DNA-binding CBF subunit.
CBF binds DNA  in a sequence-specific manner, whereas CBF enhances  DNA binding by CBF.
Both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBF are mediated by a single  domain in the CBF subunits known as the Runt domain. We analyzed the energetic contribution of amino  acids in the Runx1 Runt domain to heterodimerization  with CBF. We identified two energetic hot spots that  were also found in a similar analysis of CBF (Tang,  Y.-Y., Shi, J., Zhang, L., Davis, A., Bravo, J., Warren, A. J.,  Speck, N. A., and Bushweller, J. H. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.  275, 3957939588).
The importance of the hot spot residues for Runx1 function was demonstrated in in vivo  transient transfection assays.
These data refine the  structural analyses and further our understanding of  the Runx1-CBF interface.
  Core-binding factors (CBFs)1 are a small family of heterodimeric transcription factors that play critical roles in development and in human disease.
CBFs contain a DNA-binding  CBF subunit and a CBF subunit that does not contact DNA  directly (13).
Three related genes encode CBF subunits:  RUNX1 (CBFA2/AML1/Pebpa2b), RUNX2 (CBFA1/AML3/  Pebpa2a), and RUNX3 (CBFA3/AML2/Pebpa2c).
The common  CBF subunit is encoded by one gene, CBFB.
RUNX1 and  CBFB are required for hematopoiesis and are frequently targeted by chromosomal rearrangements and point mutations in  human leukemia (49).
RUNX2 and CBFB are required for  bone development, and mutations in RUNX2 cause the human  skeletal disorder cleidocranial dysplasia (1015).
Disruption of  the Runx3 gene in mice causes hyperplasia of gastric mucosa  (16) and severe limb ataxia (17, 18).
Runx3 is thought to be  required for the controlled proliferation and apoptosis of gastric  epithelial cells, the survival of dorsal root ganglia proprioreceptive neurons, and for epigenetic silencing of the CD4 gene in  cytotoxic T lymphocytes (1619).
Hemizygous deletion and hypermethylation of RUNX3 is found in a significant number of  primary gastric cancers (16).
  The DNA binding domain in CBF is known as the Runt  domain (20).
The Runt domain is responsible for DNA binding  as well as for heterodimerizing with the CBF subunit (2, 20,  21).
The Runt domain of the CBF subunits is an s-type immunoglobulin fold in the p53 family of DNA-binding transcription factors, whose other members include STAT3, p53, NF-  B, NFAT, and the Brachyhury T box family of proteins (22  24).
DNA binding by the Runt domain is mediated by loops and  -strands at one end of the immunoglobulin -barrel (25, 26).
  The DNA is bent toward the protein by 20 (2527).
CBF  increases the DNA binding affinity of the Runt domain by  710-fold (25, 28).
CBF binds to a region of the Runt domain  distinct from the DNA-binding sequences and contacts neither  the DNA nor amino acids in the Runt domain that are directly  involved in DNA binding (25, 26, 29, 30).
  Comparison of the Runt domain-DNA and Runt domainCBF-DNA complexes (25, 26, 31) with the recently determined crystal structures of the Runt domain in the free state  (30, 32) suggests a model for allosteric regulation of DNA  binding by CBF.
The Runt domain contains several regions  that are likely to equilibrate between at least two conformations in the free state, including the C-D, E-F, and G-G  loops.
CBF appears to stabilize a specific conformation of the  Runt domain.
The most dramatic change occurs in the G-G  loop that assumes two conformations in the free and complexed  state crystal structures and has been referred to as the Sswitch (32).
The dramatic change in the G-G loop and the  changes in the C-D loop are in agreement with an earlier  study by NMR chemical shift perturbation that showed dramatic changes in the C chemical shift for residues in the  G-G loop indicative of a significant conformational change  (28).
  Previous studies in our laboratory and others identified  amino acid side chains in CBF that contribute functionally to  heterodimerization with the Runt domain (25, 29, 33).
Residues  in the Runt domain that mediate heterodimerization with  CBF were identified by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystal-  * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the  payment of page charges.

3309733104, 2003   2003 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Printed in U.S.A.  This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org 33097   at Monash University (CAUL) on March 7, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from lography (23, 25, 26, 31, 34).
Some of those residues have been  analyzed functionally (25, 29); however, a comprehensive quantitative study of all amino acid side chains in the Runt domain  implicated by structural analyses to form contacts to the CBF  subunit has not yet been reported.
Here we determine the  energetic contribution of the amino acids in the Runt domain  that contact CBF to heterodimer formation.
In doing so we  identify two energetic hot spots at the heterodimerization interface involving Runt domain residues Asn-109 and Thr-161,  and we discuss the importance of these contacts in terms of the  overall ternary complex structure.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Protein PurificationWe introduced alanine substitutions into a  cDNA encoding the murine Runx1 Runt domain and subcloned the  cDNA sequences into the bacterial pET-3c (Novagen) expression vector  as described by Li et al. (35).
We labeled the wild type and mutated  Runt domains (residues 41214, numbered according to Bae et al. (36))  with 15N and purified them as described previously (23, 37).
  We subcloned the CBF141 cDNA, which encodes the CBF heterodimerization domain (amino acids 1141), into the bacterial expression vector pET3c (Novagen) using NdeI and BamHI sites.
We transformed the resulting plasmid pET3c-CBF141 into Rosetta (DE3) cells  (Novagen) and overexpressed the CBF (141) protein at 37 C.
We  harvested cells from a 1-liter culture and resuspended them in 10 ml of  50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, and 25% sucrose.
We then  sonicated the cells, collected the insoluble inclusion body by centrifugation, and denatured it with 7 M urea.
We passed the denatured  protein through a 50-ml DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) column in the presence of 7 M urea, collected the protein fractions, and  refolded the CBF (141) protein by serial dialysis in 25 mM Tris-Cl (pH  7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10%  ethylene glycol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl  fluoride with 1, 0.5, and 0 M urea.
We concentrated the proteins and  loaded them onto a 550-ml S-100 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration  column.
We pooled and concentrated the fractions of interest, which  contained a single protein band on SDS-PAGE gels as visualized by  Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (not shown).
  NMR SpectroscopyWe performed all measurements on a Varian  Inova 500-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with an actively shielded  triple resonance probe from Nalorac Corp. We prepared samples of  Runt domain-DNA complexes and recorded 15N-1  H HSQC spectra at  40 C as described previously (23).
  Urea Denaturation Monitored by Fluorescence SpectroscopyWe detected the urea denaturation of the Runt domain by tryptophan fluorescence as described previously (37).
We performed all fluorescence  experiments using a protein concentration of 2040 M in a total  volume of 0.8 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 M EDTA, and 1 mM  dithiothreitol on a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ).
We incubated individual 0.8-ml solutions of the Runt  domain with increasing concentrations of urea (06.0 M) and equilibrated the samples for 2 h at 4 C prior to fluorescence measurement to  follow the Runt domain denaturation.
We excited the samples at a  wavelength of 280 nm and detected the emission at 340 nm.
We took  background spectra of the buffer alone for later subtraction.
We then  recorded spectra in the range of 300370 nm with an increment of 4 nm  and an integration time of 1 s, and averaged two scans to minimize  error.
We obtained the parameters for the unfolding curves by nonlinear, least squares fitting using two-state equations (Equation 1 and  Equation 2) as described elsewhere (3840).
  Fobs  (N  N[D])  (D  D[D])exp{m([D]  [D]50%)/RT}  1  exp{m([D]  [D]50%)/RT} (Eq. 1)  We fit the data using Equation 1, where Fobs is the fluorescence observed; N and D are the intercepts; N and D are the slopes of the  base lines at low (N) and high (D) denaturant concentrations, respectively; R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature in K, [D] is  the denaturant concentration; [D]50% is the concentration of the denaturant when half of the protein is denatured; and m is the slope of the  unfolding transition.
We used Equation 2 to determine GN-D.  Fobs   (N  N[D])  (D  D[D])(exp  {GN-D/RT  m[D]/RT})  1  exp  {GN-D/RT  m[D]/RT} (Eq. 2)  GN-D is the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant.
We  used Origin 5.0 software for nonlinear least square fitting.
  Equilibrium Binding Constant MeasurementsWe determined equilibrium binding constants for the wild type and mutated Runt domains  by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using conditions described previously (6, 28, 33, 4143).
We fit all data points to a rearranged mass action equation, [PD]/[Dt  ]  1/(1  Kd/[P]), using nonlinear least squares analyses (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software).
  Transient Transfection of P19 Cells and Luciferase Activity MeasurementsWe performed site-directed mutagenesis of a cDNA encoding  the full-length (451 amino acid) murine Runx1 protein in pBluescript  SK as described above.
We prepared pcDNA/Runx1 expression vectors  by subcloning 1714-bp Runx1 cDNA fragments from pBluescript SK  between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1() (Invitrogen).
We  used the TCR-LUC plasmid, which contains the firefly luciferase gene  driven by a nucleotide 617735 fragment from the T cell receptor   chain enhancer (44), and the TCR(core)-LUC plasmid which contains  the same fragment with mutations in the three CBF-binding sites in the  enhancer (45) to detect Runx1 activity.
We constructed both reporter  plasmids by isolating a BamHI fragment containing the TCR enhancer fragments from the previously described pTCRCAT plasmids  (45), filling in the overhangs with Klenow polymerase and ligating the  fragment into the SmaI site of pT81-LUC (46).
  We seeded P19 cells at 2  106 cells per well in 6-well plates the day  before transfection, and we performed transient transfections with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers instructions.
Typically, we mixed 1 g of the TCR-LUC reporter plasmids, 2  g of the pcDNA/Runx1 expression vectors, and 2 ng of transfection  efficiency control plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega) with 250 l of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and then added LipofectAMINE 2000 (7.5 l) with  250 l of Opti-MEM and incubated for 5 min at room temperature.
We  then added the plasmid DNA mixture to the LipofectAMINE 2000  mixture and incubated for 3045 min at room temperature.

  33098 Residues in the Runt Domain Required for CBF Binding   at Monash University (CAUL) on March 7, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from P19 cells with 2 ml of serum-free Dulbeccos modified Eagles media and  added another 2 ml of the same media to each well.
The DNA/LipofectAMINE 2000 mixture was then added, and the cells were incubated  for 5 h at 37 C, and then 350 l of Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium  with 70% fetal calf serum was added to each well.
We prepared cell  lysates 48 h post-transfection, and we measured their luciferase activity  following instructions provided in the manual accompanying the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
We used pRL-SV40,  which carries the Renilla luciferase gene, to monitor the transfection  efficiency for each sample, and we used P19 cells that were transfected  in the absence of DNA as blanks.
We calculated the reporter activity as  follows: reporter activity  (firefly luciferase activity  Blank)/(Renilla  luciferase activity  Blank).
  RESULTS  Preparation of Alanine-substituted Runt Domain Proteins  and Assessment of Their Structural IntegrityCrystal structures of the Runt domain-CBF complex (31) and of the ternary  Runt domain-CBF-DNA complex (25, 26) identified 16 amino  acids in the Runt domain within 3.5  of 12 amino acids in  CBF (Table I).
Eight of these amino acids in the Runt domain  (Asn-69, Met-106, Tyr-113, Ser-14, Thr-149, Pro-156, Pro-157,  and Thr-161) make side chain contacts to CBF that involve  atoms beyond the CB carbon.
To determine which of these Runt  domain side chains are energetically important for the interaction with CBF, we substituted all but the two prolines with  alanine (Fig. 1) (35).
Substitution with alanine should remove  interactions involving atoms beyond the CB of an amino acid  side chain (47).
Alanine substitution, on the other hand, will  not allow us to examine the energetic contribution of main  chain atoms or the CB moieties to heterodimerization.
We also  substituted Asp-66 and Val-159 with alanines as controls.
  Asp-66 and Val-159 make backbone contacts to CBF, and  Asp-66 also makes a CB contact.
Alanine substitution of these  residues should not affect heterodimerization unless the Runt  domain structure is perturbed.
We substituted Asn-109, which  makes backbone O, C, and CA contacts with CBF with alanine  because Asn-109 maps to a previously defined energetic hot  spot at the heterodimerization interface identified in a similar  analysis of CBF (33).
  Because it is possible that an alanine substitution will perturb the Runt domain fold, the structural integrity of the mutated Runt domains was examined by two methods.
We performed 15N-1  H heteronuclear single quantum correlation  (HSQC) spectroscopy, which is a very sensitive measure of  structural integrity, on all of the 15N-labeled, alanine-substituted Runt domains.
NMR spectra of the isolated Runt domain  are poor due to signal broadening caused by conformational  exchange (22, 23, 48).
For this reason, and because the mutations at the heterodimerization interface did not substantially  affect DNA binding (35), we recorded the 15N-1  H HSQC spectra  on Runt domain-DNA complexes containing 15N-labeled Runt  domain and unlabeled DNA, which yield superior spectra.
Fig.  2 compares the 15N-1  H HSQC spectra of the wild type Runt  domain in the Runt domain-DNA complex, with spectra of  three of the mutated Runt domains: RD(T161A), RD(T149A),  and RD(N69A).
RD(T161A) is correctly folded as it has an  15N-1  H HSQC spectrum that closely resembles that of the wild  type Runt domain with only residues in spatial proximity to the  site of the substituted alanine showing significant changes in  chemical shift.
In fact the RD(T161A) spectrum is superior to  that of the wild type Runt domain, in that the exchange broadening seen in the dynamic region of the Runt domain spanning  amino acids 159166 is quenched (not illustrated), indicating  that the 159166 region is no longer in conformational equilibrium.
The RD(N69A) spectrum, on the other hand, is significantly altered, with many missing peaks and numerous residues displaying substantial chemical shift changes.

  Residues in the Runt Domain Required for CBF Binding 33099   at Monash University (CAUL) on March 7, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from RD(T149A) spectrum is also significantly perturbed, albeit not  to the same extent as that of RD(N69A).
Table II summarizes  the 15N-1  H HSQC spectroscopy results for all of the alaninesubstituted Runt domains.
The spectrum of RD(M106A) was  severely perturbed, comparable with that of RD(N69A), suggesting that the overall structure of the Runt domain had been  compromised, at least at the temperature (40 C) at which the  spectra were recorded.
The 15N-1  H HSQC spectra of RD(D66A),  RD(Y113A), RD(S114A), and RD(T161A) were essentially the  same as that of the wild type Runt domain, with chemical shift  changes observed only for amino acids in spatial proximity to  the substituted alanine.
The 15N-1  H HSQC spectra of  RD(N109A), RD(T149A), and RD(V159A) were perturbed but  not to the same extent as those of RD(N69A) and RD(M106A).
  Although NMR spectra are very sensitive to the structural  integrity of the protein, they do not provide a quantitative  measure of protein stability.
In addition, other factors such as  protein aggregation can affect the quality of NMR spectra, and  a perturbed spectrum may not reliably reflect an altered protein fold.
Therefore, for those mutants that showed altered  NMR spectra, we also carried out urea denaturation measurements as an independent and quantitative measure of the  effect of alanine substitution on protein stability (Table II).
  Denaturation with urea was monitored by means of the change  in the fluorescence of the single tryptophan residue in the Runt  domain, as described previously (37).
Representative data for  the wild type Runt domain and three of the mutant proteins are  shown (Fig. 3).
We carried out all measurements at 4 C, which  is approximately the same temperature at which we determined the equilibrium binding constants summarized in Tables III and IV.
Table II shows the relevant thermodynamic  parameters obtained from fitting the data to a two-state model.
  All of the alanine-substituted Runt domains that we examined  were less thermodynamically stable than the wild type Runt  domain, with RD(N109A) being by far the most dramatically  perturbed.
  Alanine Substitution of Runt Domain Asn-109 and Thr-161  Severely Impairs CBF BindingWe measured the affinities  of Runt domain-DNA complexes for CBF by electrophoretic  mobility shift assay (EMSA) (K3 in Fig. 4A).
K3 values are  presented in Table III, and a representative EMSA is shown in  Fig. 4.

  33100 Residues in the Runt Domain Required for CBF Binding   at Monash University (CAUL) on March 7, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Runt domain (RD)-DNA complex by CBF using the formula:  (CBF-RD-DNA)/(RD-DNA)  1/(1  K3/[CBF]).
Therefore,  even if a significant proportion of the Runt domain molecules  for those mutants with lower thermodynamic stability were  incorrectly folded, this should not affect the K3 values because  the Runt domain concentration does not factor into the K3  determination.
We found that the N109A and T161A substitutions in the Runt domain caused the most severe perturbation  of CBF binding, increasing K3 by 60.7- and 40.0-fold, respectively.
The Y113A and S114A mutations had little or no effect  on heterodimerization (Table III).
The N69A mutation also did  not affect binding to CBF, despite the fact that it perturbed  the 15N-1  H HSQC spectrum and decreased the thermodynamic  stability of the Runt domain.
The M106A and T149A substitutions decreased the affinity of the Runt domain-DNA complex  for CBF by 10-fold.
The controls for the analysis, RD(D66A)  and RD(V159A) (Asp-66 and Val-159 contact CBF via atoms  that would not be replaced by an alanine substitution), had K3  values equivalent to that of the wild type Runt domain.
Dissociation constants for RD(D66A), RD(N109A), RD(Y113A), and  RD(T149A) with CBF in the absence of DNA (K1) were reported by Tahirov et al. (25), and the relative differences compared with the wild type Runt domain are basically in agreement with the data reported here.
In the companion paper (35),  however, we showed that RD(D66A) had decreased activity in  both a yeast one-hybrid assay designed to detect DNA binding  and in a yeast two-hybrid assay that detects heterodimerization with CBF.
We predicted based on the yeast analyses that  the D66A mutation disrupts the Runt domain fold (35).
However, this prediction was not borne out by the biochemical  analyses here or reported elsewhere (25).
  We analyzed previously (33) the energetic contribution of  amino acids in the CBF subunit to heterodimerization.
The  amino acids examined in that study were chosen based on NMR  chemical shift perturbation data, which detected atoms in  CBF that experienced a change in their local chemical environment in the presence of the Runt domain-DNA complex  (49).
Subsequent to that study, the structure of the Runt domain-CBF complex was solved by x-ray crystallography, and  five additional amino acids in CBF at the heterodimerization  interface that were not identified in the NMR experiments  were described (Arg-33, Val-58, Asn-63, Ser-65, and Gly-105)  (31).
We substituted each of these amino acids in the CBF  subunit with alanine, purified the 15N-labeled CBF subunits,  FIG. 4.

  Residues in the Runt Domain Required for CBF Binding 33101   at Monash University (CAUL) on March 7, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from and performed 15N-1  H HSQC spectroscopy to assess the protein  fold, as described previously (33).
All alanine-substituted proteins with the exception of CBF(G105A) produced normal 15N-1  H HSQC spectra (not shown).
The affinities of  CBF(R33A), CBF(V58A), CBF(N63A), and CBF(S65A) for  a wild type Runt domain-DNA complex were determined by  EMSA (Table IV).
Alanine substitution of CBF Val-58, Asn63, and Ser-65 had little (Asn-63) or no (Val-58 and Ser-65)  effect on heterodimerization.
On the other hand the  CBF(R33A) mutation increased K3 by 20-fold.
  Amino Acids in the Heterodimerization Interface Contribute  to Runx1 Function in VivoWe assessed the in vivo activity of  full-length Runx1 proteins containing several of the alanine  substitutions in a transient co-transfection assay, using the  enhancer from the T cell receptor  (TCR) chain gene to detect  Runx1 activity.
A minimal core enhancer from the TCR  chain contains three Runx1-binding sites, and transactivation  by Runx1 in vivo is dependent on the integrity of these sites  (45, 50, 51).
The transfection assays were performed in P19  embryonic carcinoma cells, which appear to contain CBF activity but do not express Runx1 (52, 53).
Runx1 stimulated  transcription from the TCR enhancer by 15-fold, and as  previously shown this activation was dependent on the Runx1-  binding sites (Fig. 5) (45).
The Runx1 proteins that we tested,  Runx1:N109A, Runx1:Y113A, Runx1:T149A, and Runx1:  T161A, contained mutations that spanned the range of in vitro  CBF binding activity, from the Y113A mutation that decreased the affinity of the Runt domain for CBF by a relatively modest 4.9-fold, to the T161A and N109A mutations that  impaired heterodimerization 40.0- and 60.7-fold, respectively.
  We found that although Tyr-113 makes extensive contacts with  Lys-28, Arg-33, and Asn-63 in CBF, expression of Runx1  (Y113A) induced activity from the reporter gene by 14.6-fold,  indicating that the Tyr-113 side chain is not essential for the in  vivo activity of Runx1 in this assay.
The Runx1:T149A protein  (the T149A mutation decreased the affinity of the Runt domain  for CBF by 13-fold) transactivated the TCR reporter gene  by a significantly smaller 9.3-fold.
Runx1:T161A transactivated slightly less well than Runx1:T149A (7.8-fold), consistent  with its lower affinity for CBF.
The N109A mutation, which  reduced the affinity of the Runt domain for CBF 60.7-fold,  severely impaired the ability of Runx1 to activate transcription  of the reporter gene.
We were unable to detect the wild type or  mutated Runx1 proteins in transiently transfected P19 cells by  Western blot analysis; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the variances in transactivation were due to  differences in Runx1 protein concentration and/or stability.
  This is most likely to be a factor for the Runx1 proteins with the  T149A and N109A mutations, as these mutations in the context of the isolated Runt domain caused perturbations in  15N-1  H HSQC spectra recorded at 40 C, which is close to the in  vivo temperature.
The N109A mutation also caused the largest  decrease in thermodynamic stability that we observed.

The fold activation  was calculated as the luciferase activity induced by transfection of the  expression vector encoding the wild type or alanine-substituted Runx1  proteins relative to that induced by the empty expression vector.
The  results from three independent pools of transfected cells are averaged,  and representative results from one of three independent experiments  are shown.
pTCR(core)-LUC was the reporter construct pTCR-LUC  with mutations in all three CBF-binding sites (45).
The difference in  activity from the wild type Runx1 protein was significant (p  0.01) for  Runx1:N109A, Runx1:T149A, and Runx1:T161A.  FIG.

  33102 Residues in the Runt Domain Required for CBF Binding   at Monash University (CAUL) on March 7, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from DISCUSSION  We carried out a structure-based alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of the CBF-binding interface on the Runx1 Runt  domain to identify those residues that are energetically important for heterodimerization.
As has been shown for a number of  systems, there are a rather limited number of residues, referred to as hot spots, that contribute the bulk of the binding  energy at protein-protein interfaces (5457).
A hot spot is generally defined as an alanine substitution that reduces the binding energy by 2 kcal/mol (56).
We identified one mutation in  the Runt domain, T161A, that did not disrupt the overall Runt  domain structure but did have a significant impact on binding  to CBF (2.00 kcal/mol).
In addition, the N109A mutation that  significantly destabilized the Runt domain fold also caused a  large perturbation in CBF binding (2.22 kcal/mol).
A proportional effect on in vivo function was also demonstrated for the  T161A and N109A mutations in the context of full-length  Runx1.
  Asn-109 is located at the C-terminal end of strand C in the  Runt domain and makes van der Waals contacts to CBF  residue Gly-61, a residue that we demonstrated previously (33)  is also very sensitive to alanine substitution.
Although the  N109A substitution should not affect the contact to CBF per  se, the perturbations seen in the NMR and urea denaturation  data indicate that the N109A mutation causes an alteration in  the Runt domain structure that contributes to the observed  change in affinity.
In the ternary complex the Runt domain  Asn-109 ND2 forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain O of  Ser-140 in the E-F loop, whereas OD1 interacts with the  backbone nitrogens of Glu-111 and Asn-112 in the C-D loop  (Fig. 6C).
Thus removal of the Asn-109 side chain may destabilize both loops, which could affect not only the Asn-109 O  contact to the CA of CBF Gly-61, but also other Runt domain  residues that contact CBF such as Tyr-113 and Ser-114.
Consistent with this hypothesis, the dissociation constant (K3) of  the wild type Runt domain for CBF(G61A) is 3.5  107 M,  whereas the K3 for the RD(N109A) with CBF(G61A) is 13-fold  higher (4.6  106 M (not shown)).
The non-equivalence of these  two K3 values indicates that the RD(N109A) mutation is more  deleterious than the CBF(G61A) mutation, and therefore by  affecting the Runt domain conformation the N109A mutation  disrupts more than the contact to CBF Gly-61.
The  CBF(G61A) mutation did not affect the CBF fold (33).
We  predicted that substitution of CBF Gly-61 with alanine would  move the main chain oxygen of Asn-109 in the Runt domain  away from the heterodimer interface, thereby destabilizing the  interaction.
  Mutations in a hot spot residue at the analogous position of  Runt domain Asn-109 in the p53 tumor suppressor protein  (Arg-175), which makes similar bridging interactions between  the same two loops, also perturb the protein fold (39, 58).
As  Runt domain loops C-D and E-F and the analogous L2 and  L3 loops in p53 have little regular secondary structure, the lack  of extensive hydrogen bonding interactions may be compensated by side chain to side chain and side chain to backbone  interactions between the loops.
By contrast with the Runt  domain-CBF complex, a bound zinc atom in addition to salt  bridge interactions links the analogous loops in p53.
  Thr-161, the second energetic hot spot residue, is located in  the G strand in the Runt domain.
Comparison of binary and  ternary complex structures with those of the free Runt domain  reveals Thr-161 makes main chain and side chain hydrogen  bonding interactions to CBF residue Asn-104 (Fig. 6B).
CBF  Asn-104 was identified as making one of the most critical  contacts for heterodimerization, and Thr-161 also appears to  play the same role in the Runt domain.
Thr-161 is in a region  of the Runt domain (amino acids 159166) that was shown by  NMR to undergo a significant conformational change upon  CBF binding (28).
In addition, recent crystal structures of the  isolated Runt domain also showed this region of the protein  undergoes a substantial conformational change upon CBF  binding (30, 32).
  We also examined the effects of four additional alanine substitutions in CBF identified in later structural studies: Arg33, Val-58, Asn-63, and Ser-65.
Only R33A showed a significant  effect, decreasing the binding affinity for the Runt domainDNA complex by 20-fold.
In the Runx1 Runt domain-CBF  complex, the Arg-33 guanidino group interacts with the aromatic ring of Tyr-113 via a hydrogen bond interaction with the  hydroxyl group and perhaps also a cation- type of interaction  that has been shown to be quite energetically favorable (59).
  Alanine substitution of Tyr-113 in the Runt domain resulted in  a more modest (4.9-fold) increase in K3 (Table III).
The reason  for the larger increase in K3 seen with the Runt domain R33A  mutant is not clear.
  If hot spots are, as has been suggested, good binding sites in  a general sense, then identifying them may prove useful for  targeted drug design (57, 60).
Virtual screening of compounds  against the hot spot residues at the Runt domain-CBF interface may assist in the identification of small molecules or  peptides that will interfere with heterodimerization.
Coupling  inhibitors of heterodimerization with those targeted to protein  interfaces specific to the oncogenic Runx1 or CBF fusion proteins may result in compounds with potent activities against  the oncogenic proteins.
For example, the inv(16)(p13;q22) associated with acute myelogenous leukemia fuses the N-terminal 165 amino acids of CBF to the coiled-coil tail region of a  smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (61).
The resulting CBF-  SMMHC protein dominantly inhibits Runx1-CBF function  (6266).
CBF-SMMHC binds to the Runx1 Runt domain with  an affinity 10-fold higher than does CBF, and this high  affinity binding may contribute to the potent dominant negative activity of CBF-SMMHC (67).
A small molecule targeted  to a hot spot at the Runt domain-CBF interface covalently  attached to another molecule that binds to the high affinity  Runx1-binding site in CBF-SMMHC may prove useful in  counteracting the dominant negative activity of this fusion  protein.
