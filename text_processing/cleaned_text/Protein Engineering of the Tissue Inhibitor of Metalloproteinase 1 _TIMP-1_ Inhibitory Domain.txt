M211793200  Shuo Wei, Ying Chen, Linda Chung, Hideaki Nagase, and Keith Brew  From the Department of Biomedical Sciences, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida 33431 and  the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology Division, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College of Science,  Technology and Medicine, 1 Aspenlea Road, Hammersmith, London W6 8LH, United Kingdom  Studies of the structural basis of the interactions of  tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may provide clues for  designing MMP-specific inhibitors.
In this paper we report combinations of mutations in the major MMP-binding region that enhance the specificity of N-TIMP-1.
Mutants with substitutions for residues 4 and 68 were  characterized and combined with previously studied  Thr2 mutations to generate mutants with improved selectivity or binding affinity to specific MMPs.
Some combinations of mutations had non-additive effects on G of  binding to MMPs, suggesting interactions between subsites in the reactive site.
The T2L/V4S mutation generates an inhibitor that binds to MMP-2 20-fold more  tightly than to MMP-3(C) and over 400-fold more  tightly than to MMP-1.
The T2S/V4A/S68Y mutant is the  strongest inhibitor for stromelysin-1 among all mutants  characterized to date, with an apparent Ki for MMP3(C) in the picomolar range.
A third mutant, T2R/V4I,  has no detectable inhibitory activity for MMP-1 but is an  effective inhibitor of MMP-2 and -3.
These selective  TIMP variants may provide useful tools for investigation of biological roles of specific MMPs and for possible  therapy of MMP-related diseases.
  Degradation of the extracellular matrix is essential for normal biological processes including embryonic development and  morphogenesis (1, 2), reproduction (3) and wound healing (4),  and enhanced turnover is associated with diseases including  arthritis (5, 6), tumor angiogenesis and metastasis (7), multiple  sclerosis (8), and cardiovascular diseases (9).
The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 are a family of more than 20 zinc-dependent proteases that catalyze extracellular matrix turnover  (10).
Activity and zymogen activation in MMPs are regulated  by a group of endogenous proteins named the tissue inhibitors  of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (11).
  TIMPs are distributed in both invertebrates and vertebrates  (1113).
The mammalian TIMPs are a family of four members  (TIMP-14) that have about 40% sequence identity and fold  into two domains, each containing three disulfide bonds (11).
  The isolated N-terminal domains (N-TIMPs) are able to form  the correct native structure that carries the inhibitory activity  against the MMPs (14).
Although there are four TIMPs, their  inhibitory activities toward different MMPs are not particularly specific.
A notable exception is that TIMP-1 is a weak  inhibitor of MT-MMPs, whereas TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 are much  more effective (1517).
  Reported structures of TIMPs include crystal structures of  TIMP-1 in a complex with the MMP-3 catalytic domain (18),  TIMP-2 in a complex with the catalytic domain of membrane  type MT1-MMP (19) and in a free form (20), and the solution  NMR structures of N-TIMP-1 (21) and N-TIMP-2 (22).
These  structures show that the N-terminal inhibitory domain consists  of a 5-stranded -barrel with three associated -helices resembling the folds of members of the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) protein family (23).
The structure of the  TIMP-1/MMP-3 complex reveals that about 75% of all intermolecular contacts are made by residues adjacent to the disulfide  bond between Cys1 and Cys70, especially residues 15 and  6670.
These two sections of chain insert into the active site  cleft of the MMP, thus blocking its accessibility to substrates  (18).
The N-terminal Cys1 coordinates the catalytic Zn2  through the -amino group and the peptide carbonyl group and  is crucial for the inhibitory activity of TIMPs for MMPs, as  shown by the complete loss of inhibitory activity for MMPs in  TIMP-2 on carbamylation of the -amino group of the NH2-  terminal Cys1 (24) or mutation to append an alanine extension  to the amino terminus (25).
  Our previous mutagenesis studies of N-TIMP-1 (26, 27), together with work with N-TIMP-2 by others (28), suggest that  the affinity and specificity of TIMP for MMPs can be modified  by site-directed mutagenesis.
A major determinant of the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for different MMPs is the residue at position  2 in the sequence (threonine 2 in the wild-type protein) which  interacts with the S1 pocket of MMPs, a key to MMP substrate  specificity (27).
Based on this, it is reasonable to hypothesize  that other residues that make contact with MMPs also contribute to the binding affinity and specificity of N-TIMP-1 and that  selective variants can be generated by combining suitable mutations at these sites.
In the present study, we show that  N-TIMP-1 mutants with substitutions at positions 4 and 68  showed changes in affinity and specificity for MMPs.
Combinations of mutations in these positions with those in position 2  led to the discovery of N-TIMP-1 variants with higher binding  affinity and specificity for individual MMPs.

Val4 mutations and double mutations at positions 2 and 4 were introduced by direct PCR with a forward  primer containing the mutations and a T7 terminator primer as reverse  primer.
The primers used (mutated codons are underlined) are as  follows: 5-GGAGATATACATATGTGCACCTGTGCCCCACCCCAC-3  for V4A; 5-GGAGATATACATATGTGCACCTGTATCCCACCCCAC-3  for V4I; 5-GGAGATATACATATGTGCACCTGTAAACCACCCCAC-3  for V4K; 5-GGAGATATACATATGTGCACCTGTTCCCCACCCCAC-3  for V4S; 5-GGAGATATACATATGTGCCTCTGTTCCCCACCCCAC-3  for T2L/V4S; 5-GGAGATATACATATGTGCTCCTGTGCCCCACCCCAC-3 for T2S/V4A; and 5-GGAGATATACATATGTGCCGCTGTATCCCACCCCAC-3 for T2R/V4I.
  Ser68 mutations and triple mutations were introduced by megaprimer PCR as described previously (26, 27) using a T7 promoter primer  (for Ser68 single mutation) or primers introducing the corresponding  double mutations at positions 2 and 4 (for triple mutations) as the  forward primer, a reverse primer that introduces the corresponding  mutation at position 68, and a T7 terminator primer as the other  reverse primer.

All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using T7 promoter primer.
The N-Timp-1 mutants were expressed in Escherichia.
coli BL21(DE3) cells.
Protein was purified from  inclusion bodies and folded in vitro as described previously (29).
  Further Purification of N-TIMP-1 and MutantsN-TIMP-1 and mutant proteins purified by cation exchange chromatography with CM-52  were dialyzed overnight against 15 volumes of 20 mM bis-Tris-HCl, pH  5.5 (pH 6.0 for T2R/V4I) and applied to a cation exchange Mono S HR  5/5 column previously equilibrated with the same buffer and connected  to a Biologic DuoFlow medium pressure chromatography system.
The  protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient of 00.5 M NaCl over 60  min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.
The activity of different fractions was  estimated by the fluorescence assay method using MMP-3(C) and  NFF-3 substrate as described (26).
  Two similarly sized peaks, which slightly overlap, were obtained in  this separation, and fractions corresponding to the second peak, which  contained the MMP-3 inhibitory activity, were pooled and titrated with  MMP-3(C).
Various concentrations of the inhibitors were incubated  with MMP-3(C) (300 nM) for 4 h at 37 C, diluted 300-fold with TNC  buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.02%  Brij 35) and immediately assayed with 1.5 M NFF-3 substrate as  described (26).
These results showed that this protein is 85% active  for MMP inhibition.
  Inhibition Kinetic StudiesKi  (app) of N-TIMP-1 and mutants against  MMP-1, -2, and -3(C) were determined using fluorescence assay as  described previously (26) with slight modifications.
The incubation time  for the inhibitors with MMP-1 and MMP-3(C) was 2 and 4 h, respectively.
To calculate Ki  (app), the following formulas were used (30) as seen  in Equations 1 and 2,  It  1  vi  v0   Et  Ki  app  v0  vi  (Eq. 1)  Ki  app  Ki  At  Km  Km   (Eq. 2)  where It is the total inhibitor concentration, Et is the total enzyme  concentration, At is the total substrate concentration, and Km is the  Michaelis constant.
In our assays the value of Et  /Ki  (app) does not exceed  100 so that the inhibitor is distributed in both free and bound forms,  and Ki  (app) can be calculated by fitting inhibition data to Equation 1  (30).
Because the inactive portion of the N-TIMP-1 does not interfere  with the binding of the active inhibitor with MMPs, as shown by  isothermal titration by isothermal titration,2 the true Ki values can be  determined by multiplying the Ki  , calculated as described above, by the  fraction of active TIMP determined by titration.
Because the substrate  concentration is very low relative to the estimated Km, the apparent Ki  values are essentially identical to the true Ki values.
  RESULTS  Substitutions for Val4 of N-TIMP-1In the crystal structure  of the N-TIMP-1/MMP-3 complex, the side chain of Val4 interacts with the S3 site of MMP-3, forming contacts at the edge of  the interaction interface (Fig. 1, and Ref.
18).
Four mutants  with substitutions at position 4 of N-TIMP-1 were constructed  and expressed in E. coli.
As compared with the Thr2 mutations,  which generally have strong effects on MMP binding (27), these  mutations produce more moderate changes (Table I).
Mutations of Val4 into isoleucine, lysine, and serine cause significant  increases in the Ki  (app) for MMP-1 while having only a small  effect on the affinity for MMP-2.
  Mutants V4K and V4S are more selective for MMP-2 than  the wild-type N-TIMP-1 as a result of minor changes in affinity  for MMP-2 and larger reductions in binding to MMP-1 and  MMP-3.
The V4S mutant has an unchanged Ki for MMP-2 but  5-fold and 8-fold increased Ki values for MMP-1 and -3, respectively.
The other two mutants also have modified inhibition  activities; V4A has an increased affinity for MMP-3(C),  whereas V4I results in a 15-fold reduced affinity for MMP-1 but  unchanged activity with MMP-2 and MMP-3(C).
  Substitutions for Ser68Residues 6670 of the C-D loop also  form part of the core of the TIMP/MMP contact site (Fig. 1 and  Ref. 18), and previous studies have shown that substitutions  for Met66 or Val69 affect TIMP activity (26).
Here we mutated  the Ser68 to Ala, Glu, Arg, and Tyr.
These mutations have large  effects on MMP binding (Table I).
Three of the four mutants  have improved selectivity for MMP-2 relative to the other two  MMPs, whereas the fourth mutant, S68Y, inhibits MMP-3  much more strongly than MMP-1 and -2.
  Combined Mutations of Thr2  , Val4  , and Ser68Based on the  mutagenesis studies of Thr2  , Val4  , and Ser68, we constructed  double and triple mutants containing combinations of the more  selective single-site mutations.
Characterization of these mutants shows that effects of the individual mutations are generally additive but with some exceptions (Table II), suggesting  that these residues do not always contribute independently to  the stability of the TIMP/MMP complex.
  The T2L mutation was combined with V4S to generate a  N-TIMP-1 variant that is more selective for MMP-2.
As predicted, with MMP-2 the resulting double mutant inhibits 20-  fold more strongly than with MMP-3(C) and about 470-fold  more strongly than with MMP-1.
Introduction of a third mutation, S68A, produced a mutant binding very weakly to MMP-1  while retaining a good activity for MMP-2.
However, this inhibitor is much more effective with MMP-3 than is predicted  2 S. Arumugam, G. Gao, B. L. Patton, V. Semechenko, K. Brew, and  S. R. Van Doren, submitted for publication.

This triple mutant, T2L/V4S/S68A, is less selective against  MMP-3(C) than the double mutant T2L/V4S.
  The double mutant, T2S/V4A, has an increased inhibitory  activity for MMP-3.
Binding with MMP-2 is unchanged,  whereas that with MMP-1 is weaker than the wild-type protein.
Interestingly, the triple mutant T2S/V4A/S68Y has the  highest inhibitory activity for MMP-3(C) among all mutants  characterized so far, with a Ki of 50 pM. Unexpectedly, it also  has a greatly improved affinity for MMP-2, whereas binding to  MMP-1 was reduced over 36-fold.
  The T2R/V4I mutant was purified as a 95% active form  using a Mono S column at pH 6.0 instead of pH 5.5, which is  used for the wild-type protein.
We could not detect any inhibition of MMP-1 by this mutant even at a concentration of 10 M,  yet it retains good activity as an inhibitor of MMP-2 and  MMP-3(C).
  DISCUSSION  The TIMPs are important regulators of extracellular matrix  metabolism (11), principally through their primary activities as  endogenous inhibitors of MMPs.
Imbalances between the levels  of TIMPs and active MMPs are linked to disease processes such  as tumor metastasis, arthritis, and atherosclerosis (31, 32).
  Low molecular weight MMP inhibitors have been developed  and extensively studied, and a few have been used in clinical  trials but with little success (33).
Nonspecific inhibition of  housekeeping MMP functions has been proposed as the major  drawback of these inhibitors (34).
We proposed previously that  N-TIMP-1 can be engineered to produce more selective MMP  inhibitors that could be applied in gene therapy of MMP-related diseases (35, 36), and residue 2 of TIMP-1 was found to be  a major determinant of affinity and specificity for MMPs (27).
  In this paper we report the effects of mutagenesis of two other  residues that are important in TIMP/MMP binding; combinations of mutations in these positions with Thr2 mutations generate N-TIMP-1 variants with increased selectivity and/or affinity for specific MMPs.
  The side chain of Val4 occupies a site similar to the substrate  P3-subsite in currently known TIMP/MMP complexes (18, 19).
  In the complex of TIMP-1 with MMP-3, the side chain of Val4  sits in a shallow groove at the margin of the interaction site  close to the side chains of Gly161, Asn162, Leu164, and Tyr223 of  the protease (15).
These residues are 4  from Val4  , and the  insignificant effect of truncating the side chain through the Ala  substitution on the affinity for all three MMPs suggests that  interactions between the side chain of Val4 and the protease  contributes little to the free energy of binding.
The Val4 side  chain projects away from the protease surface in the TIMP-1/  MMP-3 complex (18), and the more extended Ile side chain can  be accommodated in MMP-2 and -3 without perturbing the  protein-protein interaction, but in MMP-1 it produces a 14-fold  FIG. 1.

The basis for this is uncertain, because the  structures of complexes of TIMP-1 with MMP-1 and -2 have not  been determined, but this result suggests that the S3 site of  MMP-1 does not readily accommodate a larger side chain; it is  also affected more than the other proteases by the Lys substitution (Table I).
Differences between the MMPs in the residues  that form the P3 site do not readily account for these effects;  residues Leu164 and Tyr223 of MMP-3 are conserved in MMP-1  and -2, whereas residues corresponding to Gly161-Asn162 are  Gly-Gly in MMP-1 and Asp-Gly in MMP-2, so changes in side  chain size are not responsible for the reduced steric tolerance in  this subsite in MMP-1.
The binding of TIMP-1 to MMP-2 is  least affected by substitutions for Val4  , suggesting that there is  greater separation between MMP-2 and N-TIMP-1 in this part  of the interaction site.
  The side chain of Ser68 of TIMP-1 interacts with the S2  subsite of MMP-3 in the crystal structure of their complex and  is in contact with Ala167 of the metalloproteinase (18).
It is also  near ( 4.5  distance) to His166, Tyr168, Ala169, and His205.
  Mutation of Ser68 to Ala, Glu, and Arg reduces the affinity of  N-TIMP-1 for all three MMPs, but the effect is less for MMP-2  than for MMP-1 and MMP-3.
The Tyr mutant has a major  effect on inhibitor specificity, producing a 150-fold loss in affinity for MMP-1, a 7-fold reduction in affinity for MMP-2, but  essentially no change in binding to MMP-3.
The side chain of  Ser68 of TIMP-1 projects toward Ala169 of MMP-3 in their  complex (18), and it appears that the Tyr side chain can be  accommodated without major perturbation of the interaction  interface.
Ala is conserved at this site in MMP-2, but in MMP-1  it is replaced by Gln.
A steric conflict between the Gln side  chain and Tyr68 in the N-TIMP-1 mutant is a possible explanation of the effects of this mutation on inhibitor selectivity.
  Substitutions for residues 2, 4, and 68 with similar selectivity were combined in an attempt to engineer N-TIMP-1 variants with higher selectivity and/or affinity for specific MMPs.
  In some cases, the effects of these mutations are essentially  additive (Table II), indicating that interactions with the S1,  S3, and S2 subsites of MMPs contribute independently to the  stability of the TIMP/MMP complex.
However, some mutants  containing combinations of mutations have much lower Ki values for particular MMPs than predicted based on the assumption that individual substitutions have additive effects on the  G of binding.
For example, the T2L/V4S/S68A mutant has a  100-fold higher affinity for MMP-3(C) than expected, yet its  Ki values for MMP-1 and MMP-2 are in good agreement with  predictions.
Similarly, the T2S/V4A/S68Y is a 60-fold better  inhibitor of MMP-1 and also a 68-fold better inhibitor of MMP-2  than predicted based on additivity.
These discrepancies greatly  exceed the compounded errors of the single-site mutations and  suggest interactive effects between the sites in these triple  mutants.
Because of the complexity of protein-protein interactions, there are many possible explanations for this, such as  changes in relative orientation of TIMP and protease, structural changes introduced by the mutations, and changes in  dynamics (11).
Structural studies are in progress to address  this question.
  Several combined mutants have interesting and potentially  useful properties.
T2L/V4S is selective for MMP-2, providing a  possible tool for gene therapy of gelatinase-related diseases.
  Another mutant, T2S/V4A/S69Y, is the best inhibitor for  stromelysin-1 among all mutants discovered so far, although it  also exhibits excellent inhibitory activity for MMP-2.
The apparent Ki of this inhibitor for MMP-3(C) is 50 pM, providing  the most potent inhibitor of stromelysin-1 among all N-TIMP-1  mutants.
The third mutant, T2R/V4I, has no detectable activity  for MMP-1 while retaining good inhibition for MMP-2 and -3.
  This mutant is of special interest, because the failure of many  general MMP inhibitors in clinical trials was the result of  muscular-skeletal disorders that are thought to be caused by  nonspecific inhibition of MMP-1 (38).
  Our mutational studies have demonstrated the feasibility of  generating selective MMP inhibitors by engineering TIMP.
  Using high throughput screening methods, it should be possible to identify TIMP variants that are specific inhibitors of  individual MMPs for application in future clinical trials.
