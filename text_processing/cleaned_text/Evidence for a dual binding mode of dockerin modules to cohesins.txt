Doi, University of California, Davis, CA, December 20, 2006 (received for review October 24, 2006)  The assembly of proteins that display complementary activities into  macromolecular complexes is critical to cellular function.
One such  enzyme complex, of environmental significance, is the plant cell wall  degrading apparatus of anaerobic bacteria, termed the cellulosome.
  The complex assembles through the interaction of enzyme-derived  type I dockerin modules with the multiple cohesin modules of the  scaffolding protein.
Clostridium thermocellum type I dockerin modules contain a duplicated 22-residue sequence that comprises helix-1  and helix-3, respectively.
The crystal structure of a C. thermocellum  type I cohesin-dockerin complex showed that cohesin recognition  was predominantly through helix-3 of the dockerin.
The sequence  duplication is reflected in near-perfect 2-fold structural symmetry,  suggesting that both repeats could interact with cohesins by a  common mechanism in wild-type (WT) proteins.
Here, a helix-3  disrupted mutant dockerin is used to visualize the reverse binding in  which the dockerin mutant is indeed rotated 180o relative to the WT  dockerin such that helix-1 now dominates recognition of its protein  partner.
The dual binding mode is predicted to impart significant  plasticity into the orientation of the catalytic subunits within this  supramolecular assembly, which reflects the challenges presented by  the degradation of a heterogeneous, recalcitrant, insoluble substrate  by a tethered macromolecular complex.
  cellulosome structure  cellulosome assembly  Clostridium thermocellum   cohesin-dockerin  The microbial degradation of the plant cell wall is a fundamental  biological process that is of considerable, and increasing, industrial importance.
This process is critical to the cycling of carbon  between microbes, herbivores and plants and the enzymes that  catalyze this process are now used in several biotechnology-based  industries (13).
The major and evolving potential application of  these biocatalysts, however, is the conversion of plant biomass into  bio-ethanol and other forms of energy (4, 5).
A common feature of  all plant cell wall degrading organisms is that they harness a  consortium of enzymes, acting in synergy, to degrade the otherwise  recalcitrant substrate (1).
The plant cell wall degrading apparatus of  aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, however, differ considerably in their macromolecular organization.
The plant cell wall  hydrolases synthesized by anaerobes frequently assemble into a  large (molecular mass 3 MDa) multienzyme complex termed the  cellulosome (6, 7).
  The cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum is the paradigm for  such enzyme complexes (812).
The grafting of the catalytic  entities, primarily glycoside hydrolases but also carbohydrate esterases and polysaccharide lyases, onto the macromolecular scaffold  CipA, contributes to enzyme-substrate targeting and enhances the  synergistic interactions between the hydrolases.
CipA is a noncatalytic protein composed of nine modules known as type I cohesins  (13) which display high affinity for the type I dockerins present in  the cellulosomally destined plant cell wall degrading enzymes (14).
  CipA also contains a type II dockerin at its C terminus, which  maintains the cellulosome on the bacterial cell surface by its binding  to the type II cohesin modules located in proteins anchored to the  bacterial proteoglycan layer (15).
Significantly, there is no crossspecificity between type I and type II cohesin-dockerin partners  (15).
Cellulosome assembly is therefore mediated by the interaction  of the type I dockerins of the enzymes each with one of the  complementary type I cohesin modules of CipA (810, 14).
In CipA  the nine type I cohesins exhibit a high level of sequence identity and  the type I C. thermocellum dockerins seem to display little discrimination between their receptors in the protein scaffold of the  cellulosome (16, 17) (Fig. 1a).
Indeed, the composition of C.  thermocellum cellulosomes is dictated by the expression of the 70  type I dockerin-containing proteins produced by the bacterium in  response to different plant cell wall derived inducers.
  The crystal structures of C. thermocellum type I (18) and type II  (19) cohesin-dockerin complexes have been solved providing insight into the mechanism of cellulosome assembly and cell surface  attachment, respectively.
In both complexes, cohesin-dockerin recognition is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, augmented  through an extensive hydrogen-bonding network.
Within the 60-  residue C. thermocellum dockerins there is a tandem duplication of  a 22-residue sequence, each contributing an -helix with a calmodulin-like fold.
The structure of the complex showed that the type I  dockerin binds to its cognate cohesin primarily through its Cterminal -helix.
In the type I complex, the dockerin residues that  dominate electrostatic contact with the cohesin are Ser-45 and  Thr-46 in the C-terminal helix, whereas the corresponding Ser-Thr  pair in the first duplicated sequence (within the N-terminal helix),  located at positions 11 and 12, does not contribute to proteinprotein interactions in the crystal structure.
  One of the most interesting features of the type I cohesindockerin complex is that, in addition to sequence homology, the  duplicated dockerin regions also display significant structural conservation, with an rmsd for the internally repeated segments of just  0.36  for all main-chain atoms.
Significantly this structural conservation includes the EF hand motifs and the two Ser-Thr pairs.

104  no. 9  3089 3094  BIOCHEMISTRYThis structural homology is further manifested in an internal  near-perfect two-fold symmetry within the dockerin molecule (Fig.  1b); the structure of the first duplicated segment, which contains the  N-terminal helix (helix-1), can be superimposed precisely over the  structure of the second segment, containing the C-terminal helix  (helix-3), and vice versa.
Based on these data we predicted that a  180 rotation of the dockerin would lead to cohesin recognition by  the N-terminal helix, in which Ser-11 and Thr-12 would play an  equivalent role, in ligand binding, to Ser-45 and Thr-46.
To demonstrate and visualize the alternative binding mode the crystal  structure of a dockerin mutant, in which the helix-3 Ser/Thr pair  (Ser-45-Thr-46) had been substituted with alanine, in complex with  its cognate cohesin was determined.
The resultant structure at 2   resolution indeed shows that the dockerin module interacts with its  cognate cohesin through a dual binding mode.
The implications of  the plasticity in dockerin-cohesin interactions are discussed in light  of the functional synergy between the catalytic components of the  cellulosome, one of the most efficient plant cell wall degrading  systems known.
  Results  To produce the cohesindockerin S45AT46A mutant complex  (designated Coh-DocS45A-T46A) the genes encoding the WT  cohesin and the S45A-T46A dockerin mutant were co-expressed in  Escherichia coli, allowing for dockerin stabilization in vivo.
The final  2- structure of the Coh-DocS45A-T46A complex model comprises 2  149-aa residues belonging to two cohesin modules  (termed molecules A and C), 2  62 residues of the dockerin  modules (modules B and D), two phosphate molecules, 2  2  calcium atoms, coordinated by residues of the dockerin modules,  and 562 water molecules.
The two complexes in the asymmetric unit  are related by a 2-fold noncrystallographic axis and overlay with an  rmsd of 0.3 , for 140 aligned residues of the cohesin modules, and  0.2  for 62 aligned residues of the dockerin modules [crystallographic statistics are in supporting information (SI) Table 2].
  Architecture of the Type I Coh-DocS45A-T46A Complex: A Dual Mode  of Binding.
Superimposition of the WT cohesin-dockerin complex  (designated Coh-DocWT) and Coh-DocS45A-T46A reveals that  the structure of the cohesin (rmsd of 0.5  for 140 C residues)  and dockerin (rmsd of 0.5 , for 55 aligned residues) modules are  very similar in the two crystal structures (Fig. 2).
In the WT and  mutant complexes, the type I cohesin contains nine -strands,  which form two -sheets aligned in an elongated -barrel that  displays a classical jelly roll fold.
The first -sheet comprises  -strands 5, 6, 3 and 8 and defines the interacting surface with  the dockerin, whereas -strands 4, 7, 2, 1 and 9 define the second  -sheet.
Comparison of both type I or type II cohesin structures  of C. thermocellum, solved either as discrete entities (10, 2025),  or in complex with the corresponding dockerin modules (18, 19),  show that the conformation of both cohesins do not change upon  binding its protein ligand.
Coh-DocS45A-T46A contains three  Fig. 1.

The type I dockerins,  appended to the catalytic subunits, interact with the cohesin modules on the  scaffoldin (CipA) leading to the formation of the supramolecular cellulosome  complex.
The type II dockerin on CipA, by binding to a type II cohesin on the  bacterial membrane, tethers the cellulosome to the surface of C. thermocellum.

Not only do  residues 122 overlap with 3556, but the reverse is also true, because the  dockerin shows internal 2-fold symmetry (panel b adapted from ref. 18).

Calcium coordination in CohDocS45A-T46A is essentially identical to the Coh-DocWT complex reported previously (18), and details of this coordination are  provided in supplementary information (SI Table 3).
  The dockerin in the Coh-DocS45A-T46A structure presents the  symmetry observed for the WT module in Coh-DocWT (18), with  -helices 1 and 3 rotated 180 with respect to each other and  overlapping almost perfectly, Fig. 2a.
Although interpreting electron density maps of a protein that displays dyad symmetry can be  problematic, the following differences in the duplicated sequence of  the dockerin in Coh-DocWT and Coh-DocS45A-T46A, respectively, enabled the orientation of the protein to be unambiguously  assigned: Gly-5/Lys-39, Ser-11/Ala-45, Thr-12/Ala-46, Thr-15/Leu49, Met-16/Leu-50, Lys-18/Ser-52 and Ser-20/Tyr-54.
The orientation of the dockerin in the two protein complexes indicate that  -helices 1 and 3 indeed play equivalent roles in cohesin recognition.
Consistent with this view is the observation that in Coh-Doc  S45A-T46A the major region of the dockerin that interacts with its  cohesin partner is not the C-terminal helix-3, as occurs in the WT  complex, but helix-1, Fig. 2a.
As expected, the two alanine residues  (Ala45B and Ala46B) created by the mutation, are now very distant  from, and thus do not interact with, the cohesin.
Indeed, Ser-11B  and Thr-12B in the mutant protein, fulfil the same role as Ser-45B  and Thr-46B in the WT dockerin (see Fig. 2b) making extensive  hydrogen bonds with its cohesin partner (see below).
  The equivalent hydrophobic character of the interactions between the protein partners is also evident in both complexes (Fig.  3a and SI Table 4).
The cohesin hydrophobic residues participating  in complex formation (Ala-36A, Val-41A, Ala-72A, Ile-79A, Val81A, Leu-83A, Ala-85A and Leu-129A from -strands 3, 5, and 6)  remain unchanged in Coh-DocWT and Coh-DocS45A-T46A (Fig.  3).
In both the WT and mutant dockerin the equivalent residues  from -helix 1 and 3 make hydrophobic contacts with the cohesin.
  Thus, in the dockerin mutant S45A-T46A, Leu-55B and Leu-56B  from helix-3 and the equivalent residues in helix-1 of the WT  protein (Val-21 and Leu-22, respectively) make analogous hydrophobic interactions with the cohesin.
Similarly, Leu-14B, Thr-15B  and Met-16B from helix-1 of the dockerin mutant, and the corresponding amino acids in helix-3 of the WT protein (Val-48, Leu-40  and Leu-50, respectively) make apolar interactions with aliphatic  residues in the cohesin (Fig. 3a and SI Table 4).
  The hydrogen-bonding network between the dockerin and cohesin in the two complexes is also very similar; the equivalent  residues in helix 3 and helix 1 of the WT versus the mutant  dockerins, respectively, make near-identical hydrogen bonds with  cohesin residues (Fig. 3c and SI Table 5).
The only differences in  the hydrogen bonding network in the mutant and WT cohesindockerin complexes are as follows: In the S45A-T46A dockerin  mutant Asn-10B (N2) interacts with Glu-131A (2), Thr-15B  (O1) hydrogen bonds to Asn-37A (N2), Lys-18B (N) interacts  with the carbonyls of Ala-85A and Asp-87A, whereas Arg-57 N2  makes a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of Glu120A.
The  equivalent residues in the WT dockerin; Asn-44B, Thr-49B, Ser52B and Arg-23B (N2), respectively, do not make direct interactions with the cohesin (SI Table 5).
Mutagenesis studies support the  importance of the polar interactions between the cohesin residues  Ala-36A, Asn-37A, Asp-39A, Tyr-74A, Glu-86A, Gly-89A and  Glu-131A (26, 27) and type I dockerins, although the functional  significance of Arg-77A, which seems to make important hydrogen  bonds with Arg-23B and Arg-57B at the C-terminal end of the two  dockerin binding sites, has not previously been explored.
  In addition to the direct polar interactions there are also several  Fig. 3.

104  no. 9  3091  BIOCHEMISTRYsolvent-mediated hydrogen bonds, which are generally conserved in  the two complexes (Fig. 3).
Whereas the role of indirect hydrogen  bonds in protein ligand recognition is controversial (28, 29), mutating the cohesin residue Asp-39A, which makes solvent-mediated  hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl and amines of the  dockerin residues Ile-43B, Ile-19B, Val-21B and Leu-55B, reduces  affinity 1000-fold (26), suggesting that these interactions may be  important in cohesin-dockerin binding.
Furthermore, the cohesin  residue Thr66A, which makes a solvent-mediated hydrogen bond  with Lys18B, when the C-terminal binding site of the dockerin  interacts with its protein ligand, is not invariant in the CipA  cohesins.
In cohesins 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 this residue is replaced by an  Asp.
It remains to be established whether this amino acid replacement influences the affinity of these CipA cohesins for the Cterminal binding site of type I dockerins.
  The recent resolution of the type II cohesin-dockerin complex,  which recruits the C. thermocellum cellulosome onto the surface  of the bacterium, reveals structural similarities with the corresponding type I proteins (19).
Comparison of the type I and type  II dockerins, bound to their cognate cohesin partners, reveal  differences in the relative position of the two helices, which  results in marked differences at the complex interface, Fig. 4.
  Upon complex formation the two helices of the type II dockerin  contact the cohesin by forming a parallel interacting hydrophobic platform.
The multiple contacts made with the cohesin  module by both helices and, decisively, the lack of symmetry of  type II dockerin amino acids at the interface (19) indicates that  the module is unlikely to display the dual binding mode exhibited  by the corresponding type I module.
  Relative Affinity of the Two Binding Sites of the Dockerin for Its  Cohesin Ligand.
The structural data presented above supports the  hypothesis that type I dockerins contain two, highly conserved,  cohesin-binding surfaces, consistent with mutagenesis data showing  that cohesin recognition is only disrupted when both Ser-Thr pairs  are replaced with bulky amino acids or when multiple mutations are  introduced into both of the duplicated segments of the dockerin  (refs. 27 and 30 and Table 1).
The observation that there is no  significant change in affinity when either of the Ser-Thr pairs is  mutated on their own (Table 1 and refs. 27 and 30) indicates that  both binding sites display similar affinity for the cohesin partner.
It  is interesting to note that the apparently more polar nature of ligand  binding via helix 1 is entropically driven, whereas the more hydrophobic dockerin helix-3 cohesin interaction is associated with a gain  in enthalpy (27). Whereas it is currently unclear why the thermodynamic forces driving ligand binding are not reflected in the nature  of the amino acids that mediate cohesin-dockerin recognition, the  thermodynamic parameters are likely to be influenced by changes  in solvation, which cannot easily be explained by static crystal  structures.
  Inspection of the draft genome sequence of C. thermocellum  revealed the presence of 71 polypeptides containing type I dockerins (31).
Indeed, the residues in the two cohesin-binding sites in  the Xyn10B dockerin are highly conserved in most of the identified  dockerins.
The one exception to this high degree of conservation is  the residue corresponding to Arg-19B (N-terminal helix) or Arg53B (C-terminal helix), which is often substituted for a lysine,  although this amino acid change is unlikely to influence the  functionality of either the N- or C-terminal ligand-binding site.
  More dramatic variation from this high degree of conservation is  observed in the dockerins of Cel9D-Cel44A and two cellulosomal  proteins of unknown function (accession numbers BAA12070,  EAM47344 and EAM44539, respectively), where the first Ser-Thr  pair is replaced by Ala/Asp-Val/Ile/Glu, whereas the other residues  participating in cohesin recognition at both binding sites are  conserved.
In a fourth cellulosomal polypeptide (accession number  EAM46149) the second Ser-Thr pair is replaced by the residues  Asp-Ile.
The introduction of these mutations into helix-1 (Ala/AspVal/Ile/Glu) and helix-3 (Asp-Ile) destroys cohesin recognition by  the N- and C-terminal binding faces, respectively.
These type I C.  thermocellum dockerins will therefore interact with their cohesin  partners via only a single surface, whereas the remaining 67  modules will contain two sites that display very similar affinities for  the protein ligand.
  The crystal structure reported here sheds light on the biochemFig.

The crystal  structure of the mutant also clarifies the role of Arg-57B in cohesin  recognition.
Mutagenesis studies suggest that the equivalent residue  to Arg-57B plays a key role in cohesin recognition (30), but in the  WT cohesin-dockerin complex this amino acid is disordered.
Consistent with the proposal of Carvalho et al. (18) the data reported  here show that Arg-57B plays an equivalent role to Arg-23B when  cohesin recognition is mediated by the N-terminal binding site.
The  most surprising feature of the mutagenesis studies reported here  (Table 1) and elsewhere (30) is that substitution of both Ser-Thr  pairs with small residues does not cause a dramatic reduction in  affinity, even though these hydroxy amino acids make a significant  contribution to the hydrogen-bonding network between the dockerin and cohesin partner.
Crystals of cohesin bound to the Nterminal dockerin binding site were only obtained when the S45AT46A double mutation was introduced into the dockerin (18)  suggesting that the orientation of binding is exquisitely poised such  that although mutation weakens binding only slightly, the population is modified sufficiently to reverse the cohesin recognition  trapped crystallographically.
Only by replacing both of these Ser/  Thr pairs with bulky amino acids could ligand binding be significantly reduced (Table 1 and ref. 27).
  Type I Dockerins Bind to Cohesins with a Stoichiometry of 1.
To  determine the stoichiometry of the cohesin-dockerin complex, the  binding of the Xyn10B dockerin, fused to the enzymes CBM22, to  the cohesin was determined by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).
The data revealed a stoichiometry of 1 indicating that  both ligand-binding sites on the dockerin cannot be occupied  simultaneously.
Overlaying Coh-DocWT and Coh-DocS45A-T46A  indicates that two cohesin molecules would indeed be unable to  bind to a single dockerin molecule simultaneously because residues  in the cohesin loop extending from Pro-63 to Ser-68 will make steric  clashes.
Inspection of the nine type I cohesins in CipA show that this  sequence is completely conserved. It would seem, therefore, that all  of the CipA cohesin modules bind to the dockerins of the catalytic  subunits with a stoichiometry of one.
In addition to CipA, three  membrane-bound C. thermocellum proteins also contain type I  cohesins in which the loop predicted to cause the steric clash,  discussed above, is truncated, and thus these modules may be able  to interact with the two dockerin ligand binding sites simultaneously.
To test this hypothesis, two of these proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and their binding to the Xyn10B dockerin  determined by ITC.
The data reveal that the three cohesins bind to  the Xyn10B dockerin with a stoichiometry of one (Table 1)  indicating that all of the type I C. thermocellum cohesins cannot  occupy the two dockerin ligand-binding sites simultaneously.
  Discussion  The construction of multiprotein complexes is one of the key  emerging fields in modern chemistry.
The clostridial cellulosome  is a stunning example of a naturally occurring multienzyme  complex in which key catalytic elements may be grafted onto a  framework scaffold.
The cohesin-dockerin interaction is central  to the cellulosomal architecture; both in integrating the enzyme  components into the complex, and in its anchoring to the cell  surface.
Within a given cellulosome-producing species such as C.  thermocellum, the conservation of the amino acid sequence  between the two repeated units of the dockerin is remarkable.
  Intriguingly, crystallographic data pointed to asymmetric binding of type I dockerins to its protein ligand, even though these  modules displayed structural symmetry consistent with the observed sequence duplication.
Here we have demonstrated that  the internal symmetry of the dockerin is not merely structural  but also functional.
By changing the Ser-Thr dyad that was  previously shown to interact with the cohesin (18), the equilibrium between the two binding modes was altered sufficiently to  allow the mutated dockerin to interact with the cohesin via the  alternative Ser-Thr pair in the N-terminal helix.
  The extremely tight sequence conservation within the dockerins  of C. thermocellum, which results in 90% identity in the residues  involved in calcium coordination and cohesin interaction, demonstrates that there is a strong selective advantage for the duplication  of the two dockerin segments leading to an internal structural  symmetry and a dual mode of cohesin binding.
The functional  significance of this plasticity of cohesin-dockerin recognition in  cellulosome assembly is thus intriguing, not only in light of cellulose  assembly and function but as a template for nonnatural engineered  protein complexes elsewhere.
Although a dual binding mode points  to a single dockerin interacting with two cohesin molecules simultaneously, biochemical and structural studies presented in this  report indicate that steric clashes between the cohesin molecules  would prevent the formation of such a tri-molecular complex.
  The dual binding mode displayed by type I dockerins will confer  flexibility in cellulosome assembly.
Although there is no selectivity  between specific cohesin-dockerin partners (16, 17, 32), the steric  constraints imposed by the appended catalytic (and/or ancillary)  modules will restrict the combination of enzymes that can be  assembled into a single cellulosome complex.
The dual binding  mode displayed by dockerins is predicted to overcome these steric  constraints and thus increase the range of enzymes that can be  integrated into discrete cellulosome molecules.
This flexibility in  the arrangement of catalytic subunits within cellulosomes is important as different (and potentially temporally evolving) enzyme  combinations are required to degrade the myriad of composite  structures displayed by plant cell walls (1).
Indeed, the incorporation of complementary enzyme activities into single cellulosomes  potentiates the synergistic interactions between these biocatalysts  and is a key element for the optimization of plant cell wall  degradation (3335).
In addition, the switching of the mode of  binding from one site to another can introduce quaternary flexibility into the multienzyme complex and enhance substrate targeting and hydrolysis.
For example, the optimal juxtaposition of the  catalytic subunits could vary during the degradative process, and  the flexibility introduced by binding face switching can contribute  to the optimization of the quaternary structure of the enzyme  complex for the specific composite substrate presented to the  bacterium.
For example, the established synergistic interaction  between endo- and exo-acting cellulases demands that these enzymes attack the same cellulose microfibril.
The dual binding mode  displayed by the dockerin modules facilitates the optimization of the  orientation of these enzymes such that they can attack a common  microfibril structure.
In that sense the cellulosome is an unusual  protein complex in that it consists of a tethered enzymatic microarray acting upon a solid substrate.
The dual orientation facilitated by  the twin faces of the dockerin should allow the flexibility in position  that is always harnessed by free enzyme systems.
  One of the key issues raised by the demonstration that the vast  majority of C. thermocellum type I dockerins display structural and  functional dyad symmetry is the generic significance of these  findings.
Inspection of type I dockerins appended to the catalytic  subunits of cellulosomes from a variety of organisms reveals a  similar sequence duplication as observed in the C. thermocellum  modules (8, 10).
Therefore, the dual binding mode displayed by the  C. thermocellum type I dockerins seems to be replicated in other  bacterial dockerins and thus we propose that the plasticity in  dockerin-cohesin recognition is fundamental to the mechanism by  which these complexes catalyze plant cell wall degradation.
  Methods  Cloning and Expression.
Previously we obtained the WT Coh-Doc  complex from the coexpression of the genes encoding the xylanase  10B dockerin (residues 733791) and CipA cohesin-2 (residues  182328) organized in tandem, in plasmid pCF1 (18).
Recombinant  cohesin contained a C-terminal His6 tag.
The Coh-Doc S45A-T46A  Carvalho et al. PNAS  February 27, 2007  vol.
104  no. 9  3093  BIOCHEMISTRYcomplex was generated from pCF2, which is an engineered version  of pCF1 produced by using the PCR-based QuikChange sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
The encoded dockerin  contains the three N-terminal dockerin residues, Val-730-Leu-731-  Leu-732, and the mutations S45A and T46A.
To study cohesindockerin binding, the dockerin was also expressed independent of  its cohesin partner, fused to a His-tagged family 22 carbohydrate  binding module (CBM22) (18), whereas the His-tagged CipA  cohesin-2 was also expressed from a plasmid lacking the dockerin  sequence (20).
DNA encoding additional type I cohesins, derived  from the C. thermocellum membrane protein (OlpA) and an ORF  identified from the draft C. thermocellum genome (EAM46162)  were amplified by PCR and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI  cloning sites of the T7-based E. coli expression vector pRSET,  which supplies an N-terminal His-tag to the recombinant protein.
  The various cohesin-dockerin constructs were expressed in E. coli  BL21 at 37C and cell pellets were prepared by using standard  methodology (18).
  Protein Purification.
The Coh-Doc S45A-T46A complex was purified by metal-ion affinity chromatography (18), buffer exchanged  into 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mM CaCl2, and then  further purified by anionic exchange chromatography by using a  Source 30Q column and a gradient elution of 01 M NaCl  (Amersham Biosciences), to separate the complex from unbound  cohesin.
Fractions containing the complex were buffer exchanged  and then concentrated in 2 mM CaCl2 to a final concentration of  5 mg/ml.
The discrete His-tagged cohesin and dockerin-CBM22  were purified by metal-ion affinity chromatography (18, 20).
  ITC.
ITC was carried out essentially as in (18).
The WT and mutants  of the Xyn10B dockerin fused to CBM22 (20  ) were retained in  the reaction cell and was titrated with 25  10-l aliquots of various  cohesin proteins (350  ) in the syringe, at 65C in 50 mM  NaHepes (pH 7.5) containing 2 mM CaCl2.
Integrated heat effects,  after correction for heats of dilution, were analyzed by nonlinear  regression by using a single-site binding model (Microcal ORIGIN  Ver.
5.0, Microcal Software, Northampton, MA).
The fitted data  yield the association constant (KA) and the enthalpy of binding  ( H).
Other thermodynamic parameters were calculated by using  the standard thermodynamic equation: RTlnKA   G   H   T S. The c values (product of the molar concentration of binding   the association constant) were 100.  Complex Crystallization, Data Collection and Structure Determination.
  The S45A-T46A Coh-Doc complex was crystallized by using vapor  diffusion techniques and the hanging drop method.
With the  protein at a concentration of 5 g/liter, crystals suitable for subsequent analysis were obtained from 20% (wt/vol) PEG 8000 in the  presence of 0.05 M of potassium dihydrogen phosphate.
Crystals  were flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at 110 K, incorporating 30%  (vol/vol) glycerol as cryoprotectant, and data were collected to 2  resolution on European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF;  Grenoble, France) beamline ID14-3.
Data (SI Table 2), were  processed by using programs MOSFLM (36) and SCALA (37)  from the CCP4 suite (38) and 10% of the observations flagged for  cross-validation.
Crystals are in space group P21 with cell dimensions a  48.6 , b  92.6 , and c  49.9 , with a   94.0 .
The  structure was solved by molecular replacement, by using the program MOLREP (CCP4 suite; ref. 39) with the type I cohesin  module alone (PDB accession code 1ohz; ref. 18) which yielded a  solution with two cohesins in the asymmetric unit.
Manual inspection of the electron density map, clearly revealed the presence of  two S45A-T46A mutated dockerin molecules, one bound to each of  the two cohesin molecules.
The dockerin modules were built  manually by using the COOT program (40) and the two complexes  refined by using REFMAC5 (41).
Water molecules were added and  final refinement included translation, libration and screw-rotation  of the four independent groups (molecules A, B, C, and D).
