We have investigated the  structure and function of the principal import receptor  Pex5p, which recognizes targets bearing a C-terminal  peroxisomal targeting signal type 1.
Crystal structures  of the receptor in the presence and absence of a peroxisomal target, sterol carrier protein 2, reveal major  structural changes from an open, snail-like conformation into a closed, circular conformation.
These  changes are caused by a long loop C terminal to the  7-fold tetratricopeptide repeat segments.
Mutations  in residues of this loop lead to defects in peroxisomal  import in human fibroblasts.
The structure of the receptor/cargo complex demonstrates that the primary  receptor-binding site of the cargo is structurally and  topologically autonomous, enabling the cargo to retain its native structure and function.
  Introduction  Diverse machineries involved in translocating proteins  across organellar membranes are required to maintain  the compartmentalization of biological processes within  eukaryotic cells (Kunau et al., 2001; Wickner and Schekman, 2005).
Many components of membrane receptors  recognize specific targeting sequences in proteins destined for translocation (Eichler and Irihimovitch, 2003).
  However, they differ in their requirements for cargo folding/unfolding during the translocation process to retain  the functional integrity of the cargo.
To date, the only  well-characterized system supporting the translocation  of folded protein targets is the nuclear import/export  system by karyopherins (Conti and Izaurralde, 2001;  Matsuura and Stewart, 2004).
The extent to which other  translocation systems may resemble karyopherin-mediated processes remains elusive.
  Peroxisomal import is one of the few transport processes that uses a translocon for the purpose of trafficking folded and functional cargo proteins across  membranes (Gould and Collins, 2002; Holroyd and  Erdmann, 2001; Lazarow, 2003; Schnell, 2000; van der  Klei and Veenhuis, 2002).
To date, more than two dozen  proteins involved in trafficking cargo to the peroxisomereferred to as peroxinshave been identified  and partially characterized.
No pore-like structure in  the peroxisomal membrane has so far been observed,  and the exact composition of the import translocon,  possibly assembled according to the size and type of  import substrates, has yet to be established.
The majority of peroxisomal matrix proteins destined for translocation into peroxisomes share the C-terminal type 1  peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) motif.
It comprises  an obligatory C-terminal tripeptide, conforming to the  consensus sequence -[S/A/C]-[K/H/R]-[L/M]-CO2  2, which  is specifically recognized by the C-terminal segment of  the import receptor peroxin Pex5p.
Human diseases  leading to impaired fatty acid metabolism, organ dysfunction, and neonatal mortality, such as Zellwegers  syndrome, are often caused by mutations in the Pex5p  receptor (Weller et al., 2003), rendering the receptor an  important subject for biomedical research.
  At the molecular level, these Pex5p translocation targets appear to be released into the peroxisomal lumen  by interactions between the receptor and other peroxins  and by their association with the peroxisomal membrane  (Gouveia et al., 2003; Holroyd and Erdmann, 2001;  Madrid et al., 2004).
Cargo loading may also influence  the oligomeric state of Pex5p and its interactions with  other peroxisomal membrane docking factors, such as  Pex14p (Madrid et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2003).
Other  evidence demonstrates that the cargo-loaded Pex5p  receptor may even shuttle across the peroxisomal membrane (Dammai and Subramani, 2001).
However, to date,  questions still remain regarding whether the receptor, or  parts of the receptor, physically shuttle or just become  accessible to the peroxisomal lumen (Erdmann and  Schliebs, 2005; Kunau et al., 2001).
  To investigate the molecular requirements of this  dynamic receptor for both cargo loading and release,  we determined the structures of the PTS1-cargo binding  region of the Pex5p receptor in the presence and in the  absence of a peroxisome translocation target, sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2).
The cargo is bound to the receptor  by two separate binding sitesa C-terminal PTS1 motif  and a topologically separate secondary siteproviding  a rationale as to how the target remains folded and functional during translocation.
A comparative analysis of the  two Pex5p receptor structures reveals major conformational changes in the receptor upon cargo loading, which  are generated by the loose structural arrangement of the  receptor tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) segments and  by the intrinsic structural flexibility within some of these  *Correspondence: wilmanns@embl-hamburg.de structural segments.
Results  Selection of a Functional Receptor/Cargo System  In order to unravel the molecular basis of PTS1-driven  protein translocation via the Pex5p receptor into peroxisomes, we searched for a suitable physiological target  that could serve as a model system.
We selected  SCP2, which contains a canonical C-terminal PTS1 motif  (Seedorf et al., 1998).
Its structure has been characterized previously by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy (Choinowski et al., 2000; Garcia et al., 2000).
  The SCP2 gene is translated into two protein products:  SCPx, a 58 kDa fusion protein comprising an N-terminal  thiolase domain and a C-terminal SCP2 domain, and  preSCP2, a protein with a molecular mass of about 15  kDa, which is processed into its mature form (mSCP2)  by proteolytic cleavage of a 20 residue leader sequence  after translocation into peroxisomes (Figure 1).
SCP2  binds to the Pex5p receptor both in vivo and in vitro,  allowing structural investigation of the receptor/cargo  complex.
  We used NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration  microcalorimetry (ITC) to determine the molecular basis  of SCP2 receptor binding.
For both preSCP2 and  mSCP2, respectively, the chemical shift perturbations  in 1  H,15N correlation spectra upon binding to Pex5p(C)  affect the same set of SCP2 residues (see Figures S1  and S2 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online).
Furthermore, chemical shifts and line widths  indicate that the presequence remains unstructured and  dynamic and is not involved in receptor binding.
The  binding affinities of preSCP2 and mSCP2 for the receptor, as measured by ITC, are both in the order of 100 nM  (Table 1), indicating that the presequence is tolerated  and does not affect the receptor interaction.
  To determine whether SCP2 retains its function upon  loading onto the Pex5p import receptor, we used two  complementary approaches.
First, we investigated the  capacity of SCP2 to bind specific lipids in the presence  and in the absence of Pex5p(C).
To locate the lipid-binding site with SCP2, we used spin-labeled paramagnetic  doxylstearate as a fatty acid derivative (Garcia et al.,  2000).
We observed similar bleaching of NMR signals  upon binding of this fatty acid derivative to either free  SCP2 or Pex5p(C)-bound SCP2, indicating that the functional integrity of SCP2, in terms of lipid binding, is not  impaired upon receptor loading (Figure 2).
We further  used ITC to quantify the thermodynamic parameters  governing the receptor/cargo interaction in the presence  and in the absence of stearoyl-CoA, a physiological  ligand of SCP2 (Frolov et al., 1996).
The data show that  mSCP2 binds to the receptor with about the same Kd  and 1:1 stoichiometry, regardless of whether it is loaded  with stearoyl-CoA (Table 1).
  Structure of the Cargo-Loaded Pex5p Receptor  We have determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal part of the Pex5p import receptor (Pex5p(C), residues  315639) in the presence of mSCP2 (21143), at 2.3 A resolution (Figures 1, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, and 5; Table 2).
The  X-ray data reveal the complete structure, except for the  very N terminus (315334) and one loop (441453) of  Pex5p(C).
Most of its structure is formed by seven consecutive TPR motifs, each consisting of a helix-turn-helix  motif (DAndrea and Regan, 2003).
The fourth segment,  which matches the established TPR sequence signature,  is in a distorted arrangement (Figure 5A) and is preceded  by a glycine-rich loop that is, in part, flexible.
The C terminus of the structure is folded into a three-helical bundle,  of which the first two helices display TPR-like properties,  both in terms of sequence signature pattern and structure.
The long loop connecting the seventh TPR segment  and the C terminus (589601), referred to as 7C loop,  interacts with the two helices from the TPR1 segment  (Figure 5B).
This loop and the distorted TPR4 segment  link the two arch-shaped TPR motif triplets (13 and  57), thus generating a pseudocircular structure of the  cargo-loaded receptor with a tunnel in its center, which  is open to both faces of the ring-like structure (Figure 4B).
  The connecting segments represent the most mobile  regions of the cargo-loaded receptor (Figure S3A) and,  therefore, can be regarded as hinges.
The C-terminal  helical bundle does not participate in the circular arrangement (Figures 3A, 3B, 5A, and 5B).
  The structure of the receptor-bound mSCP2 resembles that of free SCP2 (Choinowski et al., 2000), except  the C terminus that bears the PTS1 motif (Figure S3C).
  In the Pex5p(C) receptor complex, the ten C-terminal  residues (134143) of mSCP2 adopt an extended conformation, pointing away from its core domain.
However,  unlike the structure of free SCP2, wherein both termini  are flexible, in the receptor-bound SCP2 structure, the  C terminus becomes the most rigid part of the overall  structure, while its N terminus remains mobile (Figure 1C  and Figures S3B and S3C).
The most C-terminal AKL  motif (141143) of mSCP2 binds within the central hole  of the ring-like structure of the receptor.
It is involved in  specific interactions with four asparagines (N415, N526,  N534, and N561) that are located on the N-terminal  helices of TPR segments 4, 5, 6, and 7.
These residues  are conserved (Figures 1, 5A, and 5B), indicating that  PTS1 binding is a general property of the Pex5p receptor.
  In contrast to the most C-terminal region, the preceding  residues (134140) interact with the receptor by van der  Waals forces only.
  The structure of the receptor/cargo complex also reveals a second interaction site of about 500 A 2 that is  formed by the C-terminal helical bundle of Pex5p(C)  and a surface patch of SCP2, covering parts of helices  a1 and a3 (Figures 1, 4A, 4B, and 5B).
ITC binding data  using a PTS1 peptide reveal that its binding affinity to  Pex5p(C) is reduced (Kd = 664 nM) compared with the entire protein cargo (Table 1).
Thus, the data indicate that  there is a notable contribution by the secondary interface  in SCP2 loading onto the Pex5p receptor.
However, none  of the residues of either the Pex5p receptor or SCP2  involved in these interactions are invariant (Figure 1).
  These findings suggest that, in contrast to the PTS1-  mediated receptor/cargo interactions, the formation of  the secondary SCP2/Pex5p(C) interface is specific and  may not be conserved taxonomally.
Since PTS1 targets  are generally unrelated in terms of structure and function, with the exception of the C-terminal PTS1-receptor  recognition motif, our findings suggest that the involvement of secondary binding sites may serve as a determinant for the sorting of folded import substrates.
  Our NMR spectroscopy data on mSCP2 in the presence and in the absence of the receptor correlate with  Molecular Cell  654the crystallographic analysis.
The largest chemical shift  perturbations are found for the backbone amides of  the C terminus (136143) (Figure S1B), coinciding with  the structural alterations observed by comparing the  structures of unbound SCP2 and Pex5p(C)-bound  SCP2 (Figure S3C).
NMR relaxation measurements indicate that the PTS1 backbone, which is flexible and disordered in free SCP2, rigidifies upon binding to Pex5p(C)  (Figure S1C).
Significant chemical shift changes  have also been detected for residues in the secondary  binding site.
  Taken together, our biochemical and structural data  suggest bipartite binding of the SCP2 cargo to the Pex5p  receptor.
The PTS1-binding site at the most C-terminal  region is structurally and topologically well separated  from the functional SCP2 core domain.
As such, the data  provide a rationale for our observations on a mechanism  of receptor recognition that does not interfere with the  function of SCP2 as lipid-binding protein.
Our data, however, do not support previous hypotheses proposing that  binding of lipid substrates to members of the SCP2 family  may enhance the exposure of the PTS1 motif, thereby  Figure 1.

  Target Recognition by the Import Receptor Pex5p  655driving ligand-dependent translocation (Choinowski et al.,  2000; Garcia et al., 2000; Lensink et al., 2002).
  Structure of the Unliganded Pex5p Receptor  Protein translocation into peroxisomes requires a delicate balance between the binding and release of cargo  proteins to and from the appropriate import receptor.
  To investigate the molecular parameters that govern  cargo release, we have also determined the structure  of the import receptor Pex5p(C) in the absence of a cargo  at 2.5 A resolution (Figures 3C and 4C; Table 2).
Comparative analysis of the cargo-loaded and unloaded  Pex5p(C) receptor structures reveals major conformational changes upon cargo binding.
Contrary to previous  hypotheses proposing that the TPR4 segment is a flexible hinge (Gatto et al., 2000), these changes originate  from three clusters in TPR segments 5 and 6, rendering  a rotation of about 20 of the C-terminal TPR segments  with respect to N-terminal TPR segments (Figure 3D).
As  a result of this conformational change, the 7C loop of the  apo structure no longer completes the ring-like structure  of Pex5p(C) as observed in the cargo complex, thus generating an open, snail-like arrangement of the receptor  (Figures 3C and 4C).
For instance, Gln586 and Ser600,  which interact with residues from the TPR1 segment in  the cargo-loaded receptor (Figure 5B), have moved by  more than 8 A in the apo structure.
  Since the overall arrangement of TPR segment-containing structures can be described as a superhelical  coil or solenoid (DAndrea and Regan, 2003; Jinek  et al., 2004), we compared the underlying structural parameters of the cargo-free and cargo-loaded structures  of the Pex5p receptor.
Our analysis revealed that the  superhelical pitch is about 30 A in the apo structure,  rather than 20 A in the Pex5p/SCP2 complex.
Furthermore, the N-terminal helices of TPR7 (556568) and the  C-terminal helical bundle (601613), which bear several  residues that are involved in binding of the cargo PTS1  motif, are moved by the equivalent of about two a-helical  pitches with respect to the N-terminal TPR segments,  leading to a displacement of part of the PTS1 motif binding site by several angstroms (Figure 3D).
These suggestions are consistent with our ITC data, indicating that,  although the binding affinity is in the nanomolar range,  there is only a small contribution, or even a loss of  entropy, during cargo binding (Table 1).
Indeed, a recent  Figure 2.
Lipid Binding to mSCP2 in the Absence and Presence of Pex5p(C)  (A and B) Binding of a spin-labeled lipid molecule (5-doxylstearic acid, 5DSA) attenuates the peak intensity in 1  H,15N correlation spectra due to  PRE.
Spectra in the presence of oxidized (i.e., paramagnetic) and reduced lipid are shown in green and black, respectively.
Residues Thr105 and  Gly106, which are located in the center of the lipid-binding pocket, are entirely bleached.
Gly139, which is proximal to the PTS1 motif, experiences a large chemical shift perturbation in the presence of Pex5p(C).
It is less bleached in the Pex5p(C) complex, consistent with the strongly  reduced mobility of the C-terminal residues and the increased distance to the lipid ligand.

  Molecular Cell  656study has demonstrated coupled folding and ligand  binding in at least one TPR array (Cliff et al., 2005).
  Our model allows for speculation on further possible  structural changes.
Although TPR4 is not involved in  the conformational changes evident from our comparative analysis of the apo- and cargo-loaded Pex5p receptor structures, we cannot exclude the possibility that  there are steps during the target-import cycle that affect  this receptor segment as well.
For instance, complete  folding of the distorted TPR4 motif into the canonical  TPR domain structure would only require minor changes  in the flexible loop N terminal to the TPR4 segment  (Figure 5A).
The resulting overall structure could open  up into a superhelical arrangement with a pitch in the  order of 55 A , reminiscent of previous observations in  another TPR segment-containing structure (Jinek  et al., 2004).
In contrast to the observed changes in the  receptor structures in the presence and in the absence  of cargo, the overall conformation of the cargo-loaded  Pex5p(C) receptor structure remains virtually identical  regardless of whether it is bound only to the C-terminal  PTS1 motif (Gatto et al., 2000) or to a complete cargo  target, as shown by the Pex5p/SCP2 complex.
  Residues from the 7C Loop Are Critical for In Vivo  PTS1 Import  In contrast to several known peroxisome disease mutations wherein direct interactions with the PTS1 motif  are abolished, a patient with an inherited peroxisome  biogenesis disorder, infantile Refsum disease, was  found to be impaired in the import of proteins containing  only the AKL- and KANL-type PTS1 motifs, such as SCP2  and catalase (Shimozawa et al., 1999).
In this patient,  dysfunctional import into peroxisomes is linked to mutation S600W in Pex5p.
Comparative analysis of the cargoloaded and unloaded structures of the Pex5p(C) receptor reveals that Ser600, which is situated at the base of  the 7C loop, plays a central role in connecting the C-terminal and N-terminal TPR segments, to arrange the  PTS1-binding site as well as the secondary binding site  at the C-terminal helical bundle in the Pex5p(C)/SCP2  complex (Figure 5B).
  To examine the involvement of the 7C loop in PTS1 target import, we mutated three residues (Gln586, Ser589,  and Ser600) that are involved in specific interactions of  this loop with other parts of the receptor in the cargobound conformation (Figure 5B).
As a control, we chose  one single-residue mutant from the TPR2 segment  (N382A), which previously was shown to be involved in  PTS1 cargo import by the S. cerevisiae Pex5p receptor  (Klein et al., 2001).
First, we measured the binding affinity  Figure 3.

  Target Recognition by the Import Receptor Pex5p  657of the cargo SCP2 to the resulting Pex5p variants under  in vitro conditions (Table 1).
As expected, no binding  could be detected for the S600W mutant, while a more  than ten-fold reduced binding affinity was observed  for the Q586R Pex5p variant, thus demonstrating the  critical involvement of this residue from the 7C loop in  SCP2 cargo recognition as well.
On the other hand, the  cargo binding by the Pex5p S589Y was only slightly  reduced.
  The same mutations were introduced in full-length  Pex5p, and the resulting variants were expressed in  a fibroblast cell line devoid of endogenous PTS1 receptor.
Transfected cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for their capacity to import two established  PTS1 peroxisome targets, catalase and SCP2 (Shimozawa et al., 1999).
While SCP2, due to its low molecular  weight and absence of evidenced tendencies for oligomerization, can be considered as a model target with  only modest structural requirements for import in its  functional form, catalase forms a homotetrameric hemecontaining assembly with a molecular mass of about 240  kDa, possibly with additional requirements for import  (Purdue and Lazarow, 1996).
As a control, we tested  Pex5p-dependent import of the PTS2-tagged reporter  protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAcT) as  well.
To control for expression level and turnover of the  mutants, we have analyzed all Pex5p mutants in a  Pex5p-free cell line 24 hr after transfection with the  appropriate plasmids by western blotting (Figure S4),  demonstrating that the Pex5p mutants were synthesized at their full length and at steady-state levels comparable with WT Pex5p expressed from the same  plasmid.
The levels of expression were significantly increased when compared with WT Pex5p under control  of its endogenous promotor.
  The transfected WT Pex5p receptor correctly directed  both PTS1 targets, catalase and SCP2, as well as the  PTS2-tagged CAcT into the peroxisomal matrix (Figure 6).
As expected, three of the 7C-loop mutants  (Q586R, S589Y, and S600W) and the PTS1 reference  mutant (N382A) mediated properly the import of PTS2  proteins but showed severe defects for catalase targeting.
Retarded import was observed for SCP2, most  apparently when expressing the Q586R and S600W  mutants.
During the first 24 hr after transfection, the  bulk of GFP-SCP2 remained in the cytosol and only  a few peroxisomes were detected by characteristic  punctate fluorescence (Figure 6).
The number of SCP2-  containing peroxisomes further increased with incubation time, and after 24 days nearly all peroxisomes  were labeled (data not shown).
  By taking our in vitro and in vivo data together, both  lines of evidence demonstrate critical contributions of  several residues from the 7C loop in the peroxisomal  import of PTS1 targets by the Pex5p receptor.
Comparison of the data for SCP2 and catalase indicates an  amplification of the effect for the latter one, which is  expected to be more sensitive because of its oligomeric  arrangement and requirement for cofactor binding.
  Although a quantitative interpretation of this differential  effect will only be possible once a structure of receptorcatalase cargo complex becomes available, it is intriguing to hypothesize on additional sorting effects for the  import of different PTS1 cargoes, supporting or complementing previous observations (Kiel et al., 2005; Knott  et al., 2000; Otera et al., 2002).
  Discussion  Pex5p Receptor Recognition of Diverse PTS1  
Targets  To what extent may our structural findings of the Pex5p  receptor suggest general principles for the translocation  of a variety of folded proteins into peroxisomes?
For  mSCP2, our data suggest a bipartite recognition mechanism, via the C-terminal PTS1 motif and a secondary,  less-conserved binding site that is distinct in terms of  sequence and structure.
Much attention has previously  focused on residues preceding the C-terminal tripeptide  PTS1 motif, suggesting that some of these may serve as  determinants for altering binding affinity (Lametschwandtner et al., 1998; Neuberger et al., 2003).
However,  Figure 4.

In the structure  of the apo-Pex5p(C) receptor (C), the approximate location of the  PTS1-binding site, as determined from the Pex5p(C)/mSCP2 complex, is indicated by an orange circle.
Conformational changes of  several residues at this site lead to disappearance of the open  tunnel, observed in the Pex5p(C)/mSCP2 complex (B).
In the apo  conformation, the 7C-loop region (red) is well separated from the  remaining TPR segments of the receptor.
  Molecular Cell  658the structure of the Pex5p(C)/mSCP2 complex has not  revealed any further specific cargo interactions with  the receptor beyond the C-terminal PTS1 motif.
Although  several hydrophobic interactions can be observed,  these interactions may change in other PTS1 targets, in  which the orientation of the linker region between the  PTS1 motif and the functional domain structures may  be different.
As such, it is difficult to quantify possible  contributions of residues from the linker connecting the  core domain of SCP2 and the PTS1 C terminus to  Pex5p receptor.
  Recent data on the recognition of another peroxisome  target, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGA), by  the Pex5p receptor support our findings on bipartite  cargo binding by a second topologically remote interaction site separated by about 40 residues in the AGA  sequence (Huber et al., 2005).
Since considerable variation has been observed in the sequence within the PTS1  motif of different targets, it is plausible to assume that  there is a correlation between a weakened PTS1-Pex5p  receptor interaction and a need for secondary binding  sites on the cargo surface.
A peculiar property of the  Pex5p import system is its capacity to translocate large  folded proteins, either monomeric or oligomeric (Brocard et al., 2003; Lazarow, 2003; Walton et al., 1995;  Yang et al., 2001).
Some PTS1 targets can be imported  into peroxisomes by either a PTS1-dependent or PTS1-  independent mechanism (Parkes et al., 2003).
On the  other hand, there has been recent biochemical and  structural evidence demonstrating that oligomerization  of proteins established as physiological peroxisomal  targets may actually inhibit PTS1-driven translocation  (Faber et al., 2002; Modis et al., 1998).
In this scenario,  a possible blockade of secondary binding sites (by oligomerization, for example) appears to be more likely than  the PTS1 motif, as predicted by previous data (Parkes  et al., 2003) and supported by the Pex5p(C)/mSCP2  complex structure reported here.
  The Pex5p Import Receptor Cycle  The generally accepted model for PTS1-driven import  of peroxisomal proteins consists of four steps per cycle:  (1) cargo recognition by the Pex5p receptor, (2) cargoloaded receptor docking and, possibly, integration into  the peroxisomal membrane, (3) cargo release into the  peroxisomal lumen, and (4) recycling of the unloaded receptor into the cytosol (Erdmann and Schliebs, 2005).
  The model proposes two essential types of binding/release events that may be associated with conformational changes in the receptor: loading/unloading of  the cargo and docking/release of the receptor to/from  the peroxisomal membrane.
For canonical PTS1-driven  import, loading/unloading of the cargo seems to be confined to the C-terminal part of the receptor.
Data on the  Figure 5.
Structural Determinants of mSCP2  Cargo Loading onto Pex5p(C)  (A) Stereo view of the 2FO 2 FC electron density, using phases from the refined model and  contoured at 1s, of the PTS1 motif from  mSCP2 (gray) and some interacting residues  from Pex5p and ordered solvent molecules  (dark green).
  (B) Pex5p(C)/mSCP2 complex formation by  two distinct interfaces: C-terminal PTS1 motif  from mSCP2 (orange)-central cavity of the  circular TPR motif structure from Pex5p; secondary surface from mSCP2-C-terminal helical bundle from Pex5p.
Ser600 is in a central  position between the two surface patches,  allowing the proper arrangement of the two  cargo surface patches of Pex5p to support  binding of mSCP2.
The C terminus of the 7C  loop (red) interacts by a few hydrogen bonds  with the TPR1 segment.
  (C) TPR4 motif of Pex5p(C), as observed in  the cargo-loaded structure of the receptor.
  Specific interactions between TPR3 and  TPR4, generating a circular conformation of  Pex5p(C), are shown.
Colors are as in Figures  3 and 4, except that some of the bonds of  residues from the C-terminal TPR motifs 57  and the 7C loop are colored in gray to allow  illustrations of oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
  Hydrogen bonds are shown by dashed lines.
  Target Recognition by the Import Receptor Pex5p  659N-terminal part of Pex5p, which is thought to be largely  unstructured (Costa-Rodrigues et al., 2005), have indicated that this region is critically involved in membrane  docking/release of the receptor, either by interactions  with other docking factors of the translocon, such as  Pex13p and Pex14p as well as Pex8p and Pex17p  (only demonstrated in yeast), or by direct interactions  with the peroxisomal membrane (Agne et al., 2003; Gouveia et al., 2003; Scha fer et al., 2004).
The model implies  that these interactions could have an effect on the affinity of the peroxisomal target for the C-terminal part  of the receptor, ultimately leading to cargo release.
  Pex8p appears to play a key role in this process, either  as a cargo release factor, as suggested from in vitro  data of the H. polymorpha Pex5p receptor (Wang  et al., 2003) or as an inducer of a subsequent translocon  complex with additional components allowing cargo release (Agne et al., 2003).
Regardless of the precise origin  of the conformational changes in the C-terminal part of  the receptor, both the canonical nature of the loose  arrangement of the TPR domains and our direct comparative analysis of the cargo-loaded and unloaded  receptor structures suggest a ring-opening mechanism  for peroxisomal target release.
  Conclusions and Future Perspectives  The data presented here have led to three key findings  with functional implications for the molecular recognition  process of PTS1 cargoes by the Pex5p import receptor.
  (1) The C-terminal part of the receptor undergoes substantial conformational changes upon cargo binding.
  As demonstrated by structural comparison and supported by the in vitro and in vivo analysis of several  single-residue mutations, the loop C terminal to the  TPR-segment region, referred to as the 7C loop, plays  a central role in altering the conformation of the receptor  upon cargo binding.
(2) Within the cargo used in this  investigation, SCP2, there is a conformational change  upon receptor binding, leading to disassembly of the  C-terminal PTS1 motif from the surface of the globular  domain of the cargo.
Although this type of change needs  to be confirmed in different receptor/cargo complexes,  our data suggest that similar unwinding may occur at  the C termini of other PTS1 proteins.
(3) The structure  Figure 6.
7C-Loop Mutants Lead to Functional PTS1 Import Defects  Pex5p-deficient fibroblast cells from Zellweger patient PBD005 were cotransfected with a PTS2-tagged CacT-expressing plasmid, pEGFPSCP2, and plasmids expressing either WT Pex5p or a range of different single-residue mutants (N382A, Q586R, S589Y, and S600W).
At 24 hr  after transfection, PTS2-CAcT ([A], red color) and endogenous catalase ([B], red color) were labeled by immunofluorescence, while EGFPSCP2 was detected by direct fluorescence ([A] and [B], green color).
In cells expressing WT Pex5p, both marker proteins and EGFP-SCP2  colocalized in peroxisomes ([A] and [B], yellow color).
All Pex5p mutants were capable of restoring the PTS2 import defect of PEX5-deficient  cells.
In contrast, all mutants were impaired in catalase import and showed more or less pronounced import defects for EGFP-SCP2.
The introduction of the 7C-loop mutations Q586R and S600W resulted in an inefficient SCP2 import as indicated by the diffuse cytosolic staining and only  weak labeling of peroxisomes in the representative cells.
Strikingly, in cells expressing the Pex5p mutants S589Y and N382A, both cytosolic and  peroxisomal localizations of SCP2 were found, while the same cells were devoid of functional catalase import as indicated by the lack of  a congruent punctate pattern.
  Molecular Cell  660of the Pex5p(C)/SCP2 complex demonstrates that the  receptor/ligand interactions for PTS1-containing cargoes are not restricted to this C-terminal recognition motif.
A future challenge remains in the determination of the  events leading to cargo release as a subsequent functional step in the translocation cycle of Pex5p.
Further,  it will be of specific interest to investigate the functional  implications of potential release factors such as Pex8p  and changes of the receptor environment, by association/dissociation of the receptor with the peroxisomal  membrane during the translocation cycle.
  Experimental Procedures  Protein Preparation  Human Pex5p(C) (residues 315639), preSCP2 (1143), and mSCP2  (21143) were expressed from a modified pET24d vector (G. Stier,  EMBL-Heidelberg) in E. coli BL21(DE3).
Mutants N382A, Q586R,  S589Y, and S600W were introduced into Pex5p(C) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
The expressed  proteins contained an N-terminal His6-GST fusion, cleavable with  tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease.
Cultures were grown in Tris-buffered LB medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) glucose, and induced  mid-log phase with 0.5 mM IPTG for 6 hr at 21C.
Cleared lysates  were loaded onto a glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare)  and eluted with 20 mM reduced glutathione.
Fusion proteins were  cleaved with His6-TEV and applied to Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN).
  The flowthrough was subjected to gel filtration through a Superdex  75 (16/60) column (GE Healthcare).
  Crystallization and X-Ray Structure Determination  Pex5p(C) and mSCP2 were mixed in a 2:3 molar ratio and dialyzed  against 20 mM bis-Tris-propane, 20 mM KCl, and 1 mM TCEP (pH  7.0).
The protein mixture was concentrated to 7 mg ml21 by ultrafiltration.
Crystallization was carried out by mixing 1 ml protein with 1 ml  reservoir solution (24% [w/v] PEG 3350, 175 mM NaCl, and 100 mM  bis-Tris [pH 6.5]), using hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20C.
Prior  to X-ray data collection, 10% (v/v) PEG 400 was added to the drop  for 510 min.
Crystals of unliganded Pex5p(C) (at 7 mg ml21  ) were  obtained by mixing 1 ml protein with 1 ml reservoir solution (23%  [w/v] PEG 3350, 100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.75], and 0.22 mM octaethylene glycol monolauryl ether), using hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20C.
  X-ray data were collected at 100 K at the synchrotron beamlines  X13 (EMBL/DESY, Hamburg, Germany), and at BL14.1 (BESSY, Berlin, Germany).
Data were processed and scaled using XDS (Kabsch,  1988).
Five percent of the reflections were randomly selected for  crossvalidation.
The structure of Pex5p(C)/mSCP2 complex was  solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP (Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997).
Pex5p(C) and SCP2 were located using PDB entries  1FCH and 1C44, respectively, as models.
REFMAC (Murshudov  et al., 1997) was used to refine the structure, applying TLS parameterization (Winn et al., 2001).
Simulated annealing refinement was  carried out in CNS (Bruenger et al., 1998).
Manual building and structure analysis were carried out in O (Jones et al., 1991).
Solvent  molecules were added both manually and by ARP/wARP (Lamzin  and Wilson, 1993).
The structure quality was assessed using  PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993).
Residues 335440 and 454  639 of Pex5p and residues 22143 of SCP2 were included in the  final model.
  In order to determine the unliganded Pex5p(C) structure, the  Pex5p coordinates from the complex structure were split into two  parts, spanning residues 335440 and 454637, to find a molecular  replacement solution using MOLREP (1994; Vagin and Teplyakov,  1997).
All four copies of the C-terminal part, but only two copies of  the N-terminal part, could be located.
After initial refinement (Murshudov et al., 1997) and rebuilding (Jones et al., 1991), weak electron  density was observed for the two missing N-terminal fragments,  allowing the determination of the overall orientation of each domain.
  The orientation of each N-terminal part relative to the C-terminal part  was essentially the same in all four Pex5p molecules.
Refinement  was continued by applying NCS restraints separately to the N- and  C-terminal halves of each Pex5p monomer.
Furthermore, TLS  parameters were applied during refinement.
Due to the flexibility of  the N-terminal parts of two of the four Pex5p molecules in the crystal  and the anisotropy of the diffraction data, the final R factors  remained higher than those for the Pex5p/cargo complex.
Programs  of the CCP4 package (CCP4, 1994) were also used for structure  manipulation, analysis, and validation.
  NMR Spectroscopy  Isotopically labeled (90% 2  H, 13C, and/or 15N) SCP2 was prepared by  growing bacteria in minimal medium supplemented with [U-13C] glucose and/or 15NH4Cl in D2O.
Proteins/complexes were exchanged  into 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) by gel filtration.
Samples  were used at concentrations of 0.21.0 mM. NMR spectra were acquired at 22C (complex) or 37C (free SCP2) on Bruker spectrometers (DRX600 with cryogenic probe or DRX900 with triple resonance  probe).
The backbone chemical shifts of preSCP2 and mSCP2 were  based on BMRB entry 4438 (Garcia et al., 2000) and extended using  standard methods (Sattler et al., 1999).
The assignments for SCP2 in  the 50 kDa Pex5p(C)/SCP2 complexes were obtained using triple  resonance and 15N-edited TROSY-NOESY experiments on samples  comprising 2  H,15N- or 2  H,13C,15N-labeled SCP2 and unlabeled  Pex5p(C).
Chemical shift perturbations (Dd = [(Dd1  H)2 + (1/5  Dd15N)2  ]  1  /2  , in ppm) were monitored in two-dimensional 1  H,15NTROSY experiments.
Spin-label-induced paramagnetic relaxation  enhancements (PREs) were analyzed from intensity changes in  1  H,15N-TROSY experiments of SCP2 or SCP2/Pex5p(C) recorded  in the presence of the fatty acid derivative 5-doxylstearic acid in  the oxidized form and after reduction with ascorbic acid (Battiste  and Wagner, 2000).
  Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry  Proteins were codialyzed against 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH  7.4) and 1 mM DTT.
When appropriate, SCP2 was premixed with  stearoyl-CoA (Sigma) in a small molar excess, and 2 mM stearoylCoA was added to the dialysis buffer to ensure uniform loading of  SCP2.
Dialysates were degassed, and the concentration was measured by A280nm.
ITC measurements were conducted on a MicroCal  VP-ITC using Pex5p(C) at 3050 mM as a sample and SCP2 or PTS1  peptide (Sigma Genosys) at 350750 mM as the titration ligand.
  Experiments were conducted at 35C using injection protocols  found to saturate Pex5p(C) with ligand.
Ligand heats of dilution  were subtracted, and data were fitted using MicroCal Origin 5.0.
  In Vivo Peroxisome Import Assays  Point mutations were introduced into the Pex5p expression vector  pGD106 (Braverman et al., 1998) by using the QuikChange sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
GFP-SCP2 expression vector  was derived from subcloning a PCR amplification product of mSCP2  into pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech Laboratories).
All primers used  are listed in Table S1.
pPTS2-CAcT encoding an N-terminal PTS2  signal followed by the reporter protein CAcT was described previously (Braverman et al., 1998).
  Human fibroblast cells were cultured at 37C in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM  L-glutamine, 100,000 U/l penicillin, and 100 mg/l streptomycin at 8%  CO2.
Pex5p-deficient cells (Dodt et al., 1995) grown for 1 day on coverslides in 60 mm tissue-culture dishes were transfected with  pPTS2-CAcT, pEGFP-SCP2, and one of the Pex5p expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics,  Mannheim, Germany).
At various time points (24, 48, 72, and 96 hr  after transfection), cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100  in PBS, and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy and  GFP fluorescence life imaging.
Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against  CAcT and sheep antibodies against human catalase were purchased from Invitrogen (Germany) and The Binding Site (UK), respectively.
Secondary antibodies were conjugated with Alexa Fluor  594 or 488 (Invitrogen, Germany).
All micrographs were recorded on  a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 633/  1.4 oil objective and an Axiocam MR digital camera and were processed with AxioVision 4.2 software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
