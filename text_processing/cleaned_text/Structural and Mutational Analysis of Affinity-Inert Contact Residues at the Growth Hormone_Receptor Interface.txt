C., & Wells, J. A. (1993) J. Mol.
Biol. 234, 554-563; Clackson, T., & Wells,  J. A. (1995) Science 267, 383-386].
Herein, three of the most buried, yet functionally inert, residues on  hGH (F25, Y42, and Q46) have been simultaneously mutated to alanine.
Binding kinetics of the triplealanine mutant shows that neither association nor dissociation rates are significantly affected and only  slight, local disorder is seen in the crystal structure.
However, large and compensating changes were  observed in the enthalpy and entropy of binding as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry.
The  triple-alanine mutant bound with a more favorable enthalpy (H ) -12.2 ( 0.7 kcal/mol) and  corresponding less favorable entropy [S ) -2.3 ( 2.4 cal/(molK)] compared to the wild-type interaction  [H ) -9.4 ( 0.3 kcal/mol; S ) 7.7 ( 1.2 cal/(molK)].
Dissection of the triple-alanine mutant into  the single F25A and double Y42A/Q46A mutants showed that the more favorable enthalpy was derived  from the removal of the F25 side chain on helix-1 of the hormone.
The Cp values for both the triplealanine mutant [-927 ( 10 cal/(molK)] and the individual mutants were significantly more negative  than the Cp for the wild-type interaction [-767 ( 34 cal/(molK)].
Such negative Cp values are  consistent with the proposal that the hydrophobic effect is the primary contributor to the free energy of  binding at this protein-protein interface.
These results show that multiple-alanine mutations at contact  residues may not affect binding kinetics, affinity, or global structure; however, they can produce local  structural changes and can cause large compensating effects on the heat and entropy of binding.
These  studies emphasize that one cannot infer binding free energy from the existence of contacts alone and  further support the notion that only a small set of contacts are crucial for the human growth hormonereceptor interaction.
  Protein-protein complexes play fundamental roles in  many biological processes such as hormone-receptor interactions, enzyme regulation, immune recognition, signal  transduction, transcription regulation, and cell motility.
To  elucidate how molecular recognition processes govern complex biological systems, it is necessary to better understand  the noncovalent forces that drive protein-protein interactions.
The complex between human growth hormone (hGH)1  and two molecules of the extracellular domain of its receptor  (called the hGHbp) is one of the best characterized proteinprotein complexes [for review see Wells and De Vos (1996)].
  X-ray crystallography has identified the molecular contacts  between the two sites on hGH (called site 1 and site 2) and  the two bound hGHbps (De Vos et al., 1992; Ultsch & De  Vos, 1993).
Virtually all the contacts at these interfaces are  made by side chains.
  Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the site 1 interface  between hGH and its first bound hGHbp probed the energetic  importance of these contact side chains from both hormone  and receptor sides (Cunningham & Wells, 1989, 1993;  Clackson & Wells, 1995).
These studies revealed that only  a small set of the contact side chains are critical for binding  (Figure 1).
For example, three critical residues at site 1 on  hGH (R64, K172, and R178), which make between 7 and  26 van der Waals contacts to the hGHbp using side chain  atoms beyond the -carbon, reduced binding affinity by 16-  60-fold when converted to alanine (Table 1).
In contrast,  three other contact residues (F25, Y42, and Q46), which  make between 6 and 27 van der Waals contacts, had no  significant impact on binding affinity when converted to  alanine.
These three inert contact residues are among the  most buried residues at the site 1 interface; together these  nonfunctional residues account for 16% of the 1300 2  surface area buried when hGH binds the first hGHbp.
  The primary motivation for this investigation was to study  the mutational effects at these affinity-inert contact residues  (F25, Y42, and Q46) by analysis of the structure of the 1:1  complex, binding kinetics, and thermodynamics.
Remarkably little change was found in the binding affinity, kinetics,  or global structure of the complex.
However, local changes  in structure were observed, as well as large and compensating  changes in the enthalpy and entropy of the reaction.
The  central core of critical contact residues (the hot spot)  appears to function independently of these peripheral, inert  contacts.
The results presented herein lend further support  to the possibility that building small molecule mimics of such  * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Site-directed mutagenesis and expression of hGH variants  were performed as described (Cunningham & Wells, 1989).
  All hGH proteins were purified to homogeneity by gel  filtration (Sephacryl-100 HR; Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) and  hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Toyopearl phenyl  650M; TosoHaas).
Mass spectrometry was used to verify  the mass of all variant proteins.
The hGHbp was expressed  and purified as described (Ultsch & De Vos, 1993).
  Concentrations of proteins were determined by OD280 using  280 ) 19 560, 16 942, 19 937, 16 118, and 64 345 (M-1  cm-1  )  for G120R, F25A/Y42A/Q46A/G120R, F25A/G120R, Y42A/  Q46A/G120R, and hGHbp, respectively, as calculated from  quantitative amino acid analysis.
  Kinetic and Equilibrium Binding Analysis.
Association  rates (kon), dissociation rates (koff), and equilibrium binding  constants (Kd) were determined using surface plasmon  resonance (Karlsson et al., 1991) on a Pharmacia BIAcore  instrument.
Introduction of a cysteine residue (S201C) into  hGHbp allowed for uniform immobilization of receptor to  the sensor chip as described (Cunningham & Wells, 1993).
  Typically, S201C hGHbp was reacted with the activated  sensor chip to yield between 1000 and 1200 refractive index  units (RU).
Dissociation rates were measured by passing  35 L of either 2 M, 5 M, or 10 M hGH in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS: 10 mM sodium phosphate, 137 mM  NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.2) with 0.05% Tween-20 at a flow  rate of 20 L/min over the sensor chip; after the injection,  the decrease in RUs was monitored with time.
Association  rates were determined from the concentration dependence  of the binding profiles for various hGH solutions.
Typically,  1.25 M solutions of ligand were serially diluted (2-fold)  six times, and 35 L was injected with flow rates of 20 L/  min.
Sensor chips were regenerated as described (Cunningham & Wells, 1993).
Binding profiles were analyzed by  nonlinear regression using a simple monovalent binding  model (BIAevaluation version 2.0; Pharmacia Kinetics).
  Equilibrium dissociation constants were calculated by Kd )  koff/kon.
  Structure Determination by X-ray Crystallography.
The  complex was formed by adding a 1:1 ratio of the hGH variant  and hGHbp and purified over a size exclusion column.
  Crystals of the complex were grown as described (Ultsch &  De Vos, 1993; De Vos and Ultsch, in preparation), in space  group P43212, with cell parameters a ) 66.34  and c )  227.3  and contained one complex per asymmetric unit.
  The crystals diffracted anisotropically, to about 2.7  in the  a*, b* plane but to much higher resolution along c*.  Diffraction data were collected at 100 K from a flash-frozen  crystal using a Mar Research imaging plate mounted on a  Rigaku RU200 X-ray generator operated at 45 kV and 90  mA, with graphite-monochromated Cu KR radiation.
Data  were processed with XDS (Kabsch, 1988).
The final data  set was 98% complete to 2.69  resolution, comprising a  total of 14 559 unique reflections (3.9-fold redundancy; Rmerge  ) 4.2%).
The starting model for refinement consisted of  the 2.6  structure of the complex between the G120R  mutant of hGH and hGHbp, refined to an R-value of 0.187  (De Vos and Ultsch, in preparation).
Refinement was carried  out using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) and the Engh and Huber  parameter set (Engh & Huber, 1991); no  cutoff was  applied, but the data were corrected for anisotropy (yielding  a 23 2 difference between the a*, b*, and c* directions).
  Rigid-body refinement of the model gave a crystallographic  R-value of 0.35 (data between 10 and 2.7  resolution), and  cycles of rebuilding using FRODO (Jones, 1978) and  positional refinement and refinement of individual temperature factors resulted in a final R-value of 0.229 (all 13 775  reflections between 8 and 2.7  resolution).
The final model  consists of residues 2-45, 52-129, 136-148, and 156-  189 of hGH and residues 33-52, 61-72, and 79-237 of  the receptor, with 17 water molecules.
The stereochemistry  of the protein molecules is characterized by rms deviations  from ideality of 0.013  and 1.8 in bond lengths and angles,  respectively, and the average B-factor for all 2890 nonhydrogen atoms is 36.9 2 (the rms B-factor difference  between bonded atoms is 2.4 2  ).
  Isothermal Titration Calorimetry.
Measurement of the  enthalpy change (H) for the variant hGH-hGHbp interactions was performed on a MicroCal OMEGA titration  calorimeter (Wiseman et al., 1989; MicroCal Inc., Northhamptom, MA) coupled with a nanovolt preamplifier.
  Protein solutions were dialyzed exhaustively against PBS,  passed through a 0.2 m filter, and degassed before use.
  Experiments were performed at 26.2 ( 0.2, 29.1 ( 0.2, 34.4  ( 0.2, and 38.8 ( 2 C.
The sample cell (1.394 mL) was  loaded with hGHbp solution (typically between 5 and 15  M).
While being stirred at 400 rpm, the system was  allowed to equilibrate to an rms noise value of 0.002 cal/s  before beginning the injections of hGH variants.
The  injection syringe (43.2 L/in.) was filled with hGH variant  solutions (between 150 and 300 M), and a number of  injections (typically 2-3 nmol each) were made.
Injections  were continued beyond saturation of the hGHbp to allow  for determination of heats of ligand dilution.
Calorimetric  data were analyzed by integration of resultant peaks (version  2.9; MicroCal Software, Inc.), and heats of dilution were  subtracted from heats of binding to yield Hassoc.
The  calorimeter was calibrated electrically using the provided  software and periodically by titration with hydrochloric acid.
  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The three affinity-inert contact residues, F25, Y42, and  Q46, lie in the periphery of the central cluster of functionally  important residues that form site 1 on hGH for binding the  first hGHbp (Figure 1).
F25 is located in the middle of helix1; Y42 and Q46 are in the first minihelical segment that  follows helix-1.
These three residues were mutated to  alanine and combined with an additional mutation in site 2,  G120R (Fuh et al., 1992; Cunningham & Wells, 1993).
The  G120R prevents the hormone from complexing a second  molecule of the hGHbp, thus ensuring that the kinetic and  thermodynamic effects are confined to binding events at site  1 alone.
Control experiments have shown that G120R has  no significant effect on the binding kinetics or affinity at  site 1 relative to wild-type hGH (Cunningham & Wells,  1993).
Finally, the G120R allows crystallization of the triplealanine mutant as a 1:1 complex with the hGHbp (Ultsch &  De Vos, 1993).
  The Three Alanine Mutations Cause Little Change in the  Structure of the 1:1 Mutant hGH-hGHbp Complex.
The  Inert Growth Hormone-Receptor Interactions Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 32, 1996 10301  + +  + +structure of the F25A/Y42A/Q46A/G120R hGH-hGHbp  complex was determined at 2.7  resolution and refined to  a crystallographic R-value of 0.229.
The mutant complex  is virtually superimposable with that of the 1:1 G120R hGHhGHbp complex (Figure 2).
The average rms difference in  coordinates for 237 common CR atoms in the triple-alanine  mutant and the G120R 1:1 complex is 0.44  and is  comparable to that between the 1:1 and 1:2 hGH-hGHbp  complexes (A. De Vos and M. Ultsch, unpublished results).
  This small difference reflects random error in the coordinates  of the final structure.
  The structures of the triple-alanine mutant and G120R 1:1  complexes are virtually superimposable in the helix-1 region  of hGH containing the F25A mutation (Figure 3A).
Except  for the missing phenyl ring and an ordered water molecule  4.8  from the -carbon of F25, the positions of helix-1  and side chains therein are virtually the same for the triplealanine mutant and the G120R hGH.
Although the missing  phenyl ring deletes six van der Waals contacts (i.e., atomatom distances e4.4 ) with the receptor, the receptor  residues show only slight changes in conformation between  the two complexes.
In fact, similar differences in conformation are seen in this region around G220 of the receptor for  the wild-type 1:1 and 1:2 complexes (A. De Vos, unpublished observations).
Thus, these slight changes are not  attributable to the mutation of F25 to alanine.
  Unlike the well-defined structure for helix-1 of the triplealanine mutant, the minihelical region (residues 38-47) is  not well ordered in the electron density map, and therefore  most of this region could not be accurately modeled (Figure  3B).
This apparently reflects disorder in this segment that  is specific for the Y42A/Q46A mutations because the  minihelix is ordered in the 1:1 G120R complex (De Vos &  Ultsch, in preparation).
Generally, the minihelix appears to  be a metastable structure; it is often seen in different  conformations in different structures.
For example, in the  original structure of uncomplexed porcine GH (70% sequence identity to hGH) this region is apparently not helical  (Abdel-Meguid et al., 1987); however, it is partially helical  in the uncomplexed structure of human placental lactogen  (85% sequence identity to hGH) (W. Somers, L. Pelletier,  A. De Vos, and A. Kossiakoff, unpublished results).
For  an affinity-optimized variant of hGH (Lowman & Wells,  1993), which contains four mutations in this helix, the  minihelix is present in the free hormone (Ultsch et al., 1994)  but exists in an extended, partially unwound form when  complexed to the hGHbp (C. Schiffer, W. Somers, M. Ultsch,  A. De Vos, and A. Kossiakoff, unpublished results).
  The Y42A/Q46A mutations delete a total of 37 atomatom contacts (e4.4 ) with the receptor, among them being  the loss of a hydrogen bond (3.0 ) between Q46 and E120  on the hGHbp.
This interaction does not appear to contribute  significantly to receptor binding because binding affinity is  practically unchanged for the Q46A mutation (Table 1).
  Despite the absence of these contacts, the receptor contact  residues in this region are not substantially changed compared  to the G120R 1:1 structure (Figure 3B).
One exception is  the loop between receptor residues 72 and 79 which is  disordered in the mutant complex.
Like the first minihelical  region of hGH, this receptor loop is seen to be flexible in  all hGH crystal structures.
Thus, while the structural changes  in the hGH minihelix and receptor loop are clearly the largest  observed between the triple-alanine mutant and G120R 1:1  complex, these changes appear in regions that are prone to  conformational variation.

  10302 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 32, 1996 Pearce et al.  + +  + +The Three Alanine Mutations Cause Little Change in  Binding Kinetics or Affinity.
The kinetics of binding of hGH  variants to hGHbp was measured using a BIAcore instrument  (Pharmacia).
Within a microfluidic flow cell, the BIAcore  monitors soluble protein binding to an immobilized ligand  by using changes in surface plasmon resonance that are  caused by a change in solution refractive index near a planar  surface.
The hGHbp was specifically immobilized to the  sensor chips dextran matrix via an engineered thiol (S201C)  to provide uniform receptor orientation and to further prevent  dimer formation of the hGHbp in the flow cell (Cunningham  & Wells, 1993).
The association rates were determined from  the concentration dependence on the rate of association of  the hGH variants.
As seen in Table 2, none of the mutations  caused significant changes in the association rate.
This is  consistent with previous findings showing that alanine  mutations at any contact residue (whether important for  affinity or not) had little effect on the on-rate (Cunningham  & Wells, 1993).
  Generally, off-rate values are more influenced by mutation  of interfacial residues; previous work has shown that when  functionally important residues at the hGH-hGHbp interface  were converted to alanine, off-rate values increased up to  30-fold (Cunningham & Wells, 1993).
However, when the  three buried hGH residues chosen for the present study were  mutated to form the triple-alanine variant, the off-rate was  virtually unchanged compared to the G120R control (Table  2).
Dissection of the triple-alanine mutant into the individual  helix-1 (F25A) and minihelix-1 (Y42A/Q46A) mutants  showed slight and compensating effects on the off-rate.
The  F25A mutant demonstrated about a 2-fold slower dissociation, whereas the Y42A/Q46A double mutant caused about  a 2-fold faster dissociation rate.
The effects on the equilibrium constant (calculated from Kd ) koff/kon) simply  reflected the small effects observed for the off-rate.
  The Three Alanine Mutations Cause Large Compensatory  Changes in the Enthalpy and Entropy of Binding.
The free  energies of binding (Gassoc) for these variants of hGH,  calculated from the equilibrium constant, were all approximately -12 kcal/mol (Table 3).
To dissect how much  of Gassoc was attributable to a change in the enthalpy of  binding (H) or entropy of binding (S), isothermal titration  calorimetry was used to directly measure the H values for  FIGURE 3: Close-up of the contact regions of G102R-hGHbp and  F25A/Y42A/Q46A/G120R-hGHbp in areas near the mutated  residues.

The reduction in number of van der Waals contacts is simply  defined as the loss of atom-atom contacts (e4.4 ) when atoms beyond  the -carbon of a side chain are removed.
Solvent accessibility upon  complex formation was calculated according to methods of Lee and  Richards (1971) using a probe radius of 1.4 . The total surface area  of the hormone buried by receptor is approximately 1300 2.

The S values were  calculated using the standard thermodynamic relationship,  G ) H - TS (where T is absolute temperature).
  A typical isothermal titration is shown in Figure 4A.
The  negative peaks produced when less than saturating amounts  of hGH were titrated into the calorimetry cell indicate an  exothermic process upon binding to the hGHbp.
After the  addition of 1 equiv of the variant hormones (Figure 4),  injections produced positive peaks since, in this case, ligand  dilution is an endothermic process.
As expected, the  stoichiometry of binding calculated for each of the binding  reactions was close to 1.0 (data not shown), since all the  variants contained the G120R mutation.
To calculate the  Hassoc, the average heat of ligand dilution was subtracted  from the heat released for each subsaturating hGH injection  to yield the heat of binding: Hassoc ) Htotal - Hdilution.
  The Hdilution was virtually the same for each hGH variant  solution (data not shown).
  The thermodynamic parameters for these binding reactions  were characterized by large negative enthalpies of binding  (Table 3).
For the G120R mutant roughly 80% of the Gassoc  can be attributed to the Hassoc.
The triple-alanine mutant  had an even more negative heat change than G120R (-12.2  kcal/mol versus -9.4 kcal/mol, respectively).
To identify  the source of the greater enthalpy change, we dissected the  triple-alanine mutant into the two components, F25A and  Y42A/Q46A.
The F25A variant had virtually the same  Hassoc as the triple-alanine mutant, whereas the Y42A/Q46A  had the same Hassoc as the G120R alone.
The greater  Hassoc for the F25A mutation could result from several  factors; one possibility is that in the wild-type binding event  desolvation of the phenyl ring causes the release of ordered  solvent (Gill et al., 1976), and this contributes nonfavorably  to the enthalpy of binding.
Therefore, the absence of the  phenyl ring in the F25A mutant removes the endothermic  process of losing ordered water molecules to bulk solvent.
  The less favorable enthalpy of binding for the G120R  interaction compared to the F25A interaction is in agreement  with solvation enthalpies of benzene derived from small  molecule transfer experiments by Gill et al. (1976).
However, this trend is in contrast to several other small molecule  transfer studies (Tanford, 1980; Murphy & Gill, 1991).
For  example, Murphy and Gill (1991) used the dissolution of  cyclic peptides to predict that desolvation of a phenyl group  would yield a -1.1 kcal/mol contribution to the enthalpy of  binding.
Such inconsistencies further support the notion that  thermodynamic relationships derived from small model  compounds may not accurately represent intermolecular side  chain interactions in the context of large protein-protein  interfaces.
Effects of mutations at interface residues on  enthalpy and entropy of binding may depend on the  microscopic environments of the side chains in both the free  and bound states.
  Using an analysis described by Murphy and Freire (1992),  a comparison can be made between the measured Hassoc  and the calculated Hassoc.
From the calculation of polar  and nonpolar surface area buried (Ap and Anp, respectively) for both the G120R and triple-alanine 1:1 complexes,2  the contribution to Cp can be estimated with relationships  as shown in eq 4.
Thus, both the nonpolar and polar  contibutions to Cp can be used in the equations (Murphy  & Freire, 1992)  2 The structure of the 1:1 hGH G120R-hGHbp complex was solved  at 2.6 ; inclusion of water molecules in combination with positional  refinement resulted in a final R-value of 0.187 (A. De Vos and M.  Ultsch, unpublished results).
From both crystal structures, calculation  of the decrease in solvent-accessible surface area upon binding was  made with the use of the Lee and Richards algorithm (Lee & Richards,  1971) using a probe radius of 1.4 .

Shown is a  plot of heats of reaction versus the ratio of ligand-receptor  following injection.
The solid line shows the best fit obtained by  least-squares regression using a one-site model; this analysis gave  a determined stoichiometry value of 0.93.  10304 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 32, 1996 Pearce et al.  + +  + +to yield the nonpolar enthalpy change, Hnp, and the polar  enthalpy change, Hp, where the reference temperature T  H  ) 100.5 C, and the residual enthalpy change H ) 35  cal/(mol2).
  Using the structural parameters to calculate the Hassoc  for each reaction at 26 C yields -12.5 kcal/mol for the  G120R-hGHbp complex and -12.1 kcal/mol for the triplealanine-hGHbp complex.
These calculated values compare  rather favorably with the measured values of -9.4 ( 0.3  kcal/mol for G120R and -12.2 ( 0.7 kcal/mol for triplealanine binding at 26 C.
However, the discrepancy between  the calculated and the measured Hassoc values decreases  (from approximately 25% difference at 26 C to approximately 8% difference at 38 C) with an increase in  temperature for the G120R reaction, and the discrepancy  increases (from approximately 1% difference at 26 C to  approximately 33% difference at 38 C) with an increase in  temperature for the triple-alanine reaction.
It should be noted  that calculations based on the triple-alanine-hGHbp 1:1  complex are estimates due to a significant degree of disorder  in the hGH minihelical region of the structure.
  Given the more negative enthalpy change for binding of  the F25A-containing hormones, to maintain the same free  energy of binding, the entropic terms were correspondingly  less favorable compared to the G120R hGH-hGHbp and  Y42A/Q46A/G120R hGH-hGHbp interactions (Table 3).
  Overall, the trend to less favorable entropic contributions  upon removal of F25 suggests that desolvation of the exposed  phenylalanine occurs upon binding.
In some respects, it is  somewhat surprising that the Y42A/Q46A binding events  did not demonstrate a substantially more favorable entropy  term compared to the G120R reaction.
Since the crystal  structure shows that the minihelical region is apparently  disordered in the mutant complex, it might be expected that  there would be less of a configurational entropic barrier to  binding for Y42A/Q46A.
However, comparison of the 1:1  complex structure with structures of the free triple-alanine  mutant and G120R is necessary for further elaboration on  this point.
Even though electron density was not welldefined in this region of the complex, the data cannot give  an indication of the degree of disorder.
  The entropic contribution to binding is at least four times  smaller than the enthalpy of binding for all the mutants.
In  general, given the large surface area involved at this interface,  one may have expected that a significant number of water  molecules would be displaced upon association to result in  a much more favorable entropy term than that observed.
  However, the total entropic contribution to binding can be  subdivided into a number of components (such as solvent,  rotational, vibrational, and conformational effects) (Sturtevant, 1977); therefore, it is difficult to predict what the overall  entropic contribution to binding would be on the basis of  the structural information of the 1:1 complex.
To clarify  the relative solvation between free and bound states, structural analysis of the free components is necessary.
  Heat Capacity Measurements Suggest That Binding Is  DriVen by Hydrophobic Interactions That Become Stronger  in the Triple-Alanine Mutant.
The heat capacity change,  Cp, upon protein-protein interaction has previously been  related to the nonpolar surface area buried upon protein  folding or protein-protein association (Varadarajan et al.,  1992; Spolar & Record, 1994).
Generally, large negative  heat capacities have been found to correspond to exclusion  of highly ordered water molecules from exposed hydrophobic  areas on unfolded proteins or free unassociated ligands  (Jelesarov & Bosshard, 1994; Spolar & Record, 1994;  Livingstone et al., 1991).
Hydrophobic interactions tend to  generate negative contributions whereas electrostatic interactions generate positive changes in heat capacity of binding  (Sturtevant, 1977; Tanford, 1980; Makhatadze & Privalov,  1990; Livingstone et al., 1991).
To calculate the change in  heat capacity, we measured the enthalpy of binding as a  function of temperature and applied the relationship (Privalov  & Gill, 1988):  This assumes that Cp is temperature independent in the  temperature range of the experiment.
As shown in Figure  5, H as a function of temperature was linear for all four  mutants between 26 and 38 C (Figure 5).
For the G120R  hGH-hGHbp interaction, the change in heat capacity was  determined to be -767 ( 34 cal/(molK).
This large  negative value for the change in heat capacity is similar to  other values reported for protein-protein interactions (Varadarajan et al., 1992; Kelly et al., 1992; Spolar & Record,  1994; Hibbits et al., 1994).
  In all three hGH variants tested, the Cp values were  significantly more negative than for the wild-type site 1  interaction (Table 3).
This result was somewhat unexpected  given the fact that the F25A and the Y42A mutations remove  hydrophobic side chains that are substantially buried at the  interface.
Another interesting aspect of these measurements  is that the mutational effects on the Cp values were not  additive for the component mutations whereas effects on the  Hnp ) Cp,np(T - T  H) (1)  Hp ) H  (Ap) + Cp,p(T - T  H) (2)  FIGURE 5: Temperature dependence of H for hGH varianthGHbp binding.

Error bars represent the standard deviation for multiple  injections (ranging between 2 and 13).
The slope of the solid line  gives the heat capacity change (Cp) as summarized in Table 3.

At present, there is no satisfying explanation for  this observation.
Preliminary temperature denaturation  experiments by differential scanning calorimetry indicate that  the Tm values for unfolding for both hGH (Tm  75 C) and  hGHbp (Tm  49 C) are above the maximum temperature  used for Cp determination by isothermal titration calorimetry (38 C).
Therefore, the Cp measurements are not  affected by protein folding upon binding.
  Comparison of the change in nonpolar surface area buried  between the wild-type hGH-hGHbp and F25A hGHhGHbp using the crystal structures of the G120R and F25A/  Y42A/Q46A 1:1 complexes with hGHbp shows that approximately 37 2 (Anp) more nonpolar area is buried  with a phenylalanine at position 25 versus an alanine.
This  area value was determined by calculating the decrease in  solvent-accessible area (Lee & Richards, 1971) for F25 and  F25A in the respective structures and taking the difference  in areas to yield Anp.
Using the relationship  (Murphy et al., 1992) the expected Cp can be determined  from the Anp value derived from the crystal structures of  the two complexes.
From Table 3, the experimentally  determined change in heat capacity difference can be  calculated as Cp(exptl) ) Cp(wt) - Cp(mut) ) +189  cal/(molK).
Comparison of this value to the calculated value  using Anp and eq 4 [Cp(calc) ) +16.7 cal/(molK)]  shows that the magnitude of the experimentally determined  value does not compare well to the value obtained from  structural parameters and the relationship (eq 4) derived from  small molecule transfer studies.
Additionally, the Cp(exptl)  [-767 cal/(molK); Table 3] and the Cp(calc) [-364 cal/  (molK); Anp ) -1465 2 and Ap ) -1134 2; De Vos  and Ultsch, in preparation] for the G120R hGH-hGHbp  interaction and the Cp(exptl) [-927 cal/(molK); Table 3]  and the Cp(calc) [-295 cal/(molK); Anp ) -1218 2  and Ap ) -974 2  ) for the triple-alanine-hGHbp interaction do not correlate very well.
Determination of Cp(calc)  from area buried data using the relationship of Spolar and  Record (1994) also yielded less negative Cp values  compared to Cp(exptl).
Similar discrepancies concerning  Cp and surface area buried have also been reported for  antibody-antigen interactions (Kelley & OConnell, 1993)  and S-peptide-S-protein interactions (Varadarajan et al.,  1992).
Although these apparent differences cannot be readily  explained, they suggest that there are significant complicating  factors involved in using small molecule transfer or dissolution-derived relationships to describe the effects of mutations  of amino acids at a large protein-protein interface.
  Affinity-Inert Contacts for the hGHbp Can Still Be  Functionally Important.
Although mutation of F25, Y42,  and Q46 to alanine affects neither the affinity nor kinetics  of binding to the hGH receptor, they may play other roles.
  hGH is a multifunctional hormone and binds to at least one  other receptor, the prolactin receptor (Somers et al., 1994).
  In fact, the F25A mutation causes a 7-fold reduction in  prolactin receptor binding (Cunningham & Wells, 1991).
  Thus, some of these affinity-inert residues for binding the  hGHbp can still be important for binding other receptors or  for preventing binding of other receptors.
Furthermore, the  affinity inert polar residues may promote solubility of this  interface where hydrophobic interactions tend to dominate  the interaction.
  CONCLUSIONS  Not all contact residues at a protein-protein interface are  critical for binding.
Here, removal of at least 16% of the  contact interface at site 1 in the hGH-hGHbp complex  caused almost no change in the binding affinity or kinetics.
  While these mutations at the interface caused essentially no  global structural change, the minihelix at the variant hGHhGHbp interface is partially disordered.
These studies  support the notion that massive cumulative reductions in  some molecular contacts at a protein-protein interface can  be tolerated with minimal change in affinity.
In another  recent example, a total of 16 alanine mutations that encircled  five functionally critical residues for binding hGH to a  monoclonal antibody could be simultaneously introduced  with little effect on binding affinity (Jin & Wells, 1994).
  These and other experiments (Kelley & OConnell, 1993;  Cunningham & Wells, 1993; Niu et al., 1994; Clackson &  Wells, 1995) suggest there are hot spots of binding energy  at protein-protein interfaces.
We have suggested such sites  may be targets for rational drug design (Clackson & Wells,  1995).
  Although mutations at these inert contact residues caused  little free energy change, there were sometimes compensating  changes in the enthalpy and entropy of binding.
In fact, these  component thermodynamic parameters appeared more sensitive to changes in contact residues than the overall free  energy.
Compensation in enthalpy-entropy terms has been  reported previously for protein-protein interactions upon  solvent isotopic substitution (Chervenak & Toone, 1994),  with temperature change (Hibbits et al., 1994; Kelley et al.,  1992) and amino acid substitution (Brummell et al., 1993);  enthalpy-entropy compensation has also been observed for  protein-carbohydrate (Brummell et al., 1993) and for  protein-hapten (Herron et al., 1986) interactions.
Detailed  interpretation of the changes in the enthalpy and entropy of  binding is confounded by the absence of a detailed understanding of solvent structure as well as structures of the  unbound components.
  The negative heat capacity measurements are entirely  consistent with previous mutational studies, indicating that  hydrophobic forces dominate the affinity for this interaction  (Clackson & Wells, 1995).
However, the predicted heat  capacity changes based on changes in area buried at the  interface were discrepant from those measured for any of  the mutants.
These results suggest that small molecule model  systems may not be adequate for mimicking the role of  hydrophobic side chains in the context of a protein-protein  interface (Murphy & Gill, 1989; Spolar et al., 1992).
  Furthermore, the effects on Cp were not additive whereas  the other thermodynamic parameters (at 26 C) appeared  additive.
Prediction of thermodynamic parameters from  structural data such as buried surface area is central to  understanding the molecular basis for protein-protein interaction (Chothia & Janin, 1975; Horton & Lewis, 1992;  Vakser & Aflalo, 1994).
However, the structural results in  conjunction with the thermodynamic measurements presented  here emphasize the inherent difficulty in predicting such  relationships.

For the  F25A, a simple cavity was produced which we presume to  be solvent filled.
For the Y42A/Q46A mutations, some  apparent disorder was introduced into a previously welldefined helical segment.
It is noteworthy, but perhaps only  coincidental, that these structural changes occurred in regions  that are prone to flexibility.
This result suggests the  possibility that regions that are more dynamic at this interface  are ones that are less important for affinity.
