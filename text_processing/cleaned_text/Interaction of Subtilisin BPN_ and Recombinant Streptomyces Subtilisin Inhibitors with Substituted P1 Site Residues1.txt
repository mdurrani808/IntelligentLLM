The inhibitor constant, Klt was determined from the residual enzyme activity  by using a peptide substrate.
The rate constant of binding, ft, and the rate constant of  dissociation, h,,,, were determined from a progress curve of the substrate hydrolysis in the  presence of the inhibitor by using newly derived equations.
A recombinant SSI in which  Met73 was replaced by He showed an affinity (I/if,) toward subtilisin BPN' of only about  7% of that of the wild-type SSI, and the kinetic analysis revealed that the increase of feoff was  responsible for this difference.
The affinity of other SSI mutants in which Met73 was  replaced by Glu or Asp decreased significantly as pH became increasingly alkaline.
The  decrease in the affinity of these recombinants was due to the decrease of feon rather than the  increase of feoff Stopped-flow studies revealed that the binding reaction was reconcilable  with a two-step mechanism, and the kinetic parameters for each step were obtained for the  binding of the enzyme and recombinant SSIs.
  Proteinaceous proteinase inhibitors (2) occur widely in  nature and must be closely involved in the control of many  biological functions (2, 3).
Elucidating the detailed features  of the inhibition of the target proteinase is not only  necessary for understanding the biological significance of  the inhibitor, it is also important for understanding the  mechanisms of specific protein-protein interaction and of  proteolysis (4, 5).
The most fundamental question about  proteinaceous proteinase inhibitors concerns the nature of  the structural requirements for a protein to be a proteinase  inhibitor.
  Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI), which is produced by Streptomyces albogriseolus S-3253 and strongly  inhibits such bacterial alkaline serine proteinases as subtilisin BPN', has been the subject of intensive studies (6).
  The reactive site of SSI toward subtilisin BPN' is the  peptide bond Met73-Val74 (7).
The three-dimensional  structures of SSI (8, 9) and SSI-subtilisin BPN' complex  1   This study was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific  Research from the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of  Japan, and by Grants for Scientific Research from the Komori  Foundation and The Food Science Institute Foundation of Japan  (Ryoshoku Kenkyukai).
  Present addresses: ' Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science,  Kobe University, Nada-ku, Kobe 657; ' Institute of Biomolecular  Science, Gakushuin University, Mejiro, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 171.  Abbreviations: P,, notation for the amino acid residue in protease  substrates as used in Schechter and Berger (28); SSI, Streptomyces  subtilisin inhibitor; SSI(wt), SSI wild type; SSIM73X, an SSI  mutant in which an amino acid X has replaced methionine at position  73.
  (10, 11) have been resolved by X-ray crystallography.
SSI  is a homodimer with a subunit molecular weight of 11,500,  and the SSI-subtilisin BPN' complex is in the form of a  Michaelis complex (10-12) similar to those of bovine  pancreatic trypsin inhibitor-trypsin complex (23), turkey  ovomucoid third domain- Streptomyces griseus proteinase  B complex (14), eglin-c-subtilisin Carlsberg complex, and  barley chymotrypsin inhibitor-subtilisin complex (15).
  The term Michaelis complex here means one in which the  carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond of the inhibitor  remains trigonal.
The SSI gene has been isolated (26), and  an expression system has been established in a heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans 66 (17).
Accordingly,  subtilisin BPN' and SSI can provide a suitable system for  detailed analysis of the structure-function relationship of  specific protein-protein interaction and of the reaction  mechanism of serine proteinase.
  In studies of the structure-function relationship of SSI,  the role of the Pi site residue [according to Schechter and  Berger's nomenclature (28)] in the interaction with subtilisin BPN' was first analyzed.
This was done with  ovomucoid inhibitors (29) and barley chymotrypsin inhibitors (20).
Recombinant SSIs in which a different amino  acid was substituted for the P] residue, Met73 in the wild  type, were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, and  their binding affinity with subtilisin BPN' was determined  (21).
In the present study the interaction of SSI with  subtilisin BPN' was analyzed by kinetic methods.
The  simplest binding mechanism of an enzyme and an inhibitor  is represented as Eq. 1:  Vol. 114, No. 4, 1993 553  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jb/article-abstract/114/4/553/789559 by 04860000 user on 12 January 2019554 K. Masuda-Momma et al.  ^ E I  kill  and the inhibitor constant, K,, is defined as Eq. 2:  (1)  where [E], [I], and [El] are the concentrations of free  enzyme, free inhibitor, and El complex, respectively.
At,n  and kott are the bimolecular association rate constant and  the unimolecular dissociation rate constant, respectively,  and they are composite constants as shown in "RESULTS."  In this study we have derived equations with which one can  obtain Abn and k^,, simultaneously from a progress curve of  peptide hydrolysis reaction.
Application of these equations  has enabled us to work with smaller amounts of precious  samples.
It was found that substitution of Met73 of SSI by  He increased kott, whereas substitution by Asp or Glu  resulted in the decreased Abn; and all of those mutant SSIs  had larger values of K than the wild type.
The rapid  reaction kinetic studies with the stopped-flow method were  made to clarify these binding processes.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS  ProteinsSSI was purified from the culture filtrate of  Streptomyces albogriseolus S-3253 essentially as described  previously (22).
A thrice crystallized and lyophilized  subtilisin BPN' [EC 3.4.21.14] (lot No. 7370935) was  purchased from Nagase Sangyo Company, Osaka.
The  concentration of active enzyme was determined to be 75%  by the initial burst titration with AT-traTW-cinnamoylimidazole (23).
The protein concentration was determined  spectrophotometrically, from the absorbance at pH 7.0 by  using A27l (1 mg/ml) = 0.829 for SSI and A278 (1 mg/ml) =  1.063 for subtilisin BPN' (24).
The molecular weights were  11,500 for SSI (subunit) (25, 26) and 27,500 for subtilisin  BPN' (27).
SSI concentration in the text, shown as [I], is  represented as subunit concentration unless otherwise  mentioned.
  The site-directed mutagenesis of the SSI gene and its  expression were carried out as previously described (17,  21).
Mutant SSIs were purified from the culture media by  the same method as used for the wild-type SSI [abbreviated to SSI(wt)] (22) except that DEAE-cellulose chromatography (10 mM borate buffer at pH 7.2) was changed  to QAE-Toyopearl chromatography (25 mM borate-KCl  buffer at pH 9.4).
Mutant SSIs are named SSIM73X, where  X represents the amino acid replacing Met at position 73.
  ChemicalsSuccinyl(Suc)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-nitroanilide (p-NA) and succinyl(Suc)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-methylcoumarylamide (MCA) were purchased from BoehringerMannheim and Peptide Research Institute, Minoh, respectively, and dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide to prepare a  stock solution of 8 and 10 mM, respectively.
All other  chemicals were of the best grade commercially available.
  Enzyme ActivityEnzyme activity was measured by the  initial rate of the hydrolysis of Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA  as substrate.
Reactions were carried out in 25 mM phosphate bufFer, pH 7.0, 1 = 0.1 M (NaCl), containing 0.005%  (w/v) Triton X-100 at 25'C. Triton X-100 was included in  the buffer to prevent undesired protein adsorption to  incubation vessels (19).
The reaction was started by the  addition of the substrate (final concentration 1.2 //M) to the  enzyme (3 nM), and the release of 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (AMC) was followed by measuring fluorescence  intensity at 440 nm with excitation at 350 nm.
Kn and k^t  were respectively 3.7xlO~6M and 0.8 s"1   under these  conditions.
  Enzyme InhibitionThe inhibition of subtilisin BPN' by  SSI was measured as described in the previous section in  the presence of various amounts of the inhibitor: 5-100 n\  of inhibitor solution (0.13 //M) was added by use of a  microsyringe to 2 ml of the enzyme solution in a test tube,  mixed and incubated for 30 min at 25*C before addition of  the substrate.
The initial rate of enzyme reaction in the  presence of the inhibitor was taken as the residual enzyme  activity.
  K\ DeterminationThe residual enzyme activity was  plotted against the inhibitor concentration.
These data  were fitted to a theoretical equation derived for the one-toone binding of an enzyme and an inhibitor, with the aid of  a computer program for the nonlinear least-squares analysis developed in the laboratory of Prof. M. Laskowski, Jr.  (28).
Since SSI is a competitive inhibitor, the K\ thus  obtained was an apparent constant, KoPP, and the intrinsic  K, was calculated by K,= Xapp/(l + [S]o/Km) (29).
  Estimation of the Rate of Enzyme-Inhibitor Interaction  by Enzyme ActivitySuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-NA was used  as substrate of the enzyme.
Assays were carried out in 25  mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and 50 mM Tris-HCl bufFer  pH 8.6, 1 = 0.1 M (NaCl), containing 0.005% (w/v) Triton  X-100 at 25C.
The enzyme concentration was 0.3 nM  except for the cases of SSIM73E and SSIM73D, for which  it was 6 and 16 nM, respectively, so that the rate of  inhibitor binding was in the time range of the steady-state  enzyme activity measurement.
Reactions were started by  adding enzyme solution (1 ml) to a cuvette containing 50 //I  of 4 mM substrate solution (final concentration 0.18 mM)  and 50 //I of the inhibitor solution or the bufFer solution.
  The inhibitor concentration was set such that [I] 0 ^5[E] 0 .
  The release of p-nitroaniline was followed at 405 nm for 20  min.
The progress curve was analyzed as described in  "RESULTS" to obtain the rate constants.
The iC was 0.22  and 0.17 mM at pH 7.0 and 8.6, respectively.
  Dissociation KineticsConventional determination of  the dissociation rate constant, kott, was made by diluting  the preformed enzyme-inhibitor complex (El) (30).
That  is, 50 n\ of the substrate solution (final concentration 0.25  mM) and 2.5 ml of 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH7.0,  containing 0.005% (w/v) Triton X-100 were mixed in a  cuvette and 50 ^1 of the El complex solution (2 nM) was  added to it (final concentration 0.04 nM).
Increase in A,Os  was followed.
The reaction kinetics was treated as firstorder by assuming Abn[E][I]<^,ff[EI] under the conditions employed.
The ko,, was also obtained with the newly  derived equations as described in "RESULTS."  Stopped-Flow MeasurementsA Union Giken RA-1300  (gas pressure-driven) stopped-flow apparatus was used for  the direct measurement of the interaction.
The fluorescence change through a cutoff filter at 310 nm was detected  perpendicular to the excitation beam at 280 nm.
A cylindrical cell of optical path 2 mm was used, and the dead time of  the apparatus was about 2 ms under the working conditions.
  The apparent first-order rate constant, kPP, was obtained  by the Guggenheim plot (31) under the conditions of [I]o ^  J. Biochem.

RESULTS  Inhibitor Constant, K,Figure 1 shows the titration  curves of the enzyme with the inhibitor as monitored by the  residual activity.
The inhibitor constants of SSI(wt) and  recombinant SSIs against subtilisin BPN' at pH 7.0 are  summarized in Table I. These values show a general  tendency similar to those obtained at pH 9.5 by Kojima et  al. (21), except for the Asp and Glu mutants.
Among the P,  mutants examined, SSIM73I was the weakest inhibitor, Kt  being 2.7 (0.2) X 10"10   M, which is about 15 times larger  than that of SSI(wt); SSIM73V, SSIM73E, and SSIM73D  showed a little weaker inhibitory activity than SSI(wt).
  pH-Dependence of Kt   values of SSI(wt), SSIM73K, SSIM73E, and SSIM73D were studied in the pH range from 7 to  10 (Fig. 2).
SSIM73E and SSIM73D showed clear pH  dependence, whereas SSIM73K and SSI(wt) exhibited  little dependence.
In the former two mutants, log if,  values decreased as pH increased.
  Estimation of the Rate of Enzyme-Inhibitor Interaction  by Enzyme ActivityThe reaction scheme is assumed to be  as in Eq. 3, since SSI is a competitive inhibitor (24):  ES-E+P  I  i t k>H  El  (3)  where S, ES, and P are the substrate, enzyme-substrate  complex, and the product, respectively. [E]0)   the initial  enzyme concentration, and Km, the Michaelis constant, are  assumed to be as in Eqs. 4 and 5, respectively.
  [E] 0=[E] [ES]  [ES]  (4)  (5)  A progress curve was obtained (Fig. 3, curve a) by following  liberation of the product in the reaction.
If it can be  assumed that the association of the substrate with free  enzyme is much faster than the inhibitor-enzyme association under the experimental conditions (the relationship  between curves a and b of Fig. 3 supports the validity of the  assumption), the slope of the contact line (d[P]/dt)t   on the  progress curve at time t will give the enzyme activity at  time t, vt   (Eq. 6).
  d[P]  dt -=v, (6)  Instead of drawing the contact line at t = 0 to estimate i*>,  we carried out the reaction in the absence of the inhibitor  and obtained ub from the slope of the straight progress line  in the initial time range (Fig. 3, curve b).
Thus, the  concentration of El at time t is given by Eq. 7.

  which kon[l]0/(l + [S]0/Km) and ko,, can be determined  independently according to Eq. 9 (Fig. 5).
Equation 8 was  transformed to Eq. 10 by integration, which should give the  time dependence of [El].
  (11)  The treatment of Eq. 11 has been employed for many years  (32).
The results of these analyses are presented in Table  I.  The association rate constant, kon, of SSI(wt) with  S-BPN' was obtained as 6.5(0.1)xl08M-'-s- 1   and the  dissociation rate constant, k,,,, of SSI(wt) as 0.9(0.2) X  lO"1   s"1  .
Accordingly, K, calculated by Eq. 2 with the  kinetic constants was 1.4(0.3) X10"11   M (Table I, the  right most column), which is in good agreement with the  value obtained by the equilibrium method (Table I, the  second column from the left).
The values of A^n at pH 7.0 of  almost all the mutant SSIs treated are similar to that of  SSI(wt), except for those of SSIM73E and SSIM73D,  which are slightly smaller.
The values of k^, are also almost  the same as that of SSI(wt), except for SSIM73I, for which  ko,, was 1.7 X 10"3   s"1  , about 20 times larger than that of  SSI(wt).
  For SSIM73K and SSIM73R, K, values were as same as  that of SSI(wt) but the values of k^ obtained by Eq. 11  were smaller than that for SSI(wt).
However, the plots of  (d[EI]/dO/([E].-[EI]) against [EI]/([E] 0 -[EI]) did  not give good straight lines due to some yet unknown  J. Biochem.

Accordingly, &> and ko,t   for these mutants were not  determined in the present analysis.
  Kinetic analysis was also made at pH 8.6, 25'C for  SSI(wt), SSIM73E, and SSIM73D (Table II), and the  values of kn were 4.8(0.1)xl08  , 5.9(0.2)xl06  , and  3.7(0.1)xl05M- 1  -s-', respectively.
These two mutants  having an acidic residue at P] site showed much weaker  affinity and considerably smaller km values than does the  wild type, whereas their Abrr values are larger, though the  difference is less than 3-fold.
  Direct Measurement of Enzyme-Inhibitor Interaction by  Stopped-Flow MethodThe apparent first-order rate constant, fepp, for the association was obtained from the  stopped-flow reaction curve (Fig. 6).
When kPP was plotted  against the inhibitor concentration (Fig. 7), a hyperbolic  curve was observed.
This concentration dependence of A^PP  is consistent with a two-step mechanism in which a fast  SSI  (10- M) (/s) (10-/8)  SSI(wt) 1.4 (0.2) 1,100 (70)  Met73Ee 1.3 (0.2) 1,020 (85)  Asp 2.5 (0.2) 440 (30)  (lOVM-s)  1.4 (0.3) 7.8 (1.9)  22.0 (0.5) 7.9 (2.2)  1.1 (0.2) 1.8 (0.2)  bimolecular process for the formation of a loosely bound  intermediate is followed by a slower unimolecular isomerization step (33):  (12)  In Eq. 12, (EI)L and El represent the loosely bound intermediate complex and the tightly bound complex, respectively; and k+i, fe_i, k+2> and k-2 are rate constants.
Two  relaxation times may be expected and the reciprocal of the  slower relaxation time, designated by fe,pp, can be expressed under the condition that [I] 0>[E] 0 as follows:  (13)  where KL is the dissociation constant of the loosely bound  complex (EI)L,  (14)  The concentration dependence of &PP shown in Fig. 7 is  consistent with Eq. 13 with k-2^0.
KL and k+2 were  calculated according to Eq. 13 by the nonlinear leastsquares method.
In the two-step mechanism like this, the  overall dissociation constant (equal to the inhibitor constant, Ki) is expressed as Eq. 15:  TTT (1>)  By using the values of KL and k+2 calculated above and K{  values of Table I, we estimated &_2 values. And kon was also  calculated from the equation kon = hr2/KL (16).
All the  values at pH 7.0, 25'C obtained for SSI(wt), SSIM73I, and  SSIM73D are listed in Table HI.
There is no essential  difference in KL and fe+2 between SSI(wt) and SSIM73I;  however, k-2 of SSIM73I is 15 times larger than those of  SSI(wt).
On the other hand, for SSIM73D, KL is about  twice and k+2 is 40% of that of SSI(wt).
The hn values  calculated by Eq. 16 show good agreement with that  obtained under the slower binding conditions with the  enzyme activity as probe (Table I).
  DISCUSSION  In measuring the interaction between an enzyme and a  proteinaceous inhibitor, it is preferable to detect direct  signals accompanying the binding such as difference absorption or fluorescence.
However, the magnitude of these  signals is usually small, and therefore measurement at high  protein concentration is necessary.
Under these conditions,  the reaction is fast, and it has to be measured by a method  with a rapid response, such as stopped-flow apparatus.
On  the other hand, the use of the more sensitive enzyme  activity as probe allows measurement at low enzyme  Vol. 114, No. 4, 1993  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jb/article-abstract/114/4/553/789559 by 04860000 user on 12 January 2019558 K. Masuda-Momma et al.  concentration, in which the reaction is much slower.
There  have been many kinetic studies of tight binding inhibitors  in which enzyme activity was used as probe (4, 34, 35).
In  addition, the treatment proposed in this paper has made it  possible to determine the values of k,n and k,,, independently from one reaction curve, and has facilitated the  study of precious inhibitor samples.
  The km value obtained by the present treatment for  SSI(wt) and subtilisin BPN', 6.5(0.1)xl06M-'-s-', is  the same as that obtained by the stopped-flow method with  fluorescence change as probe (36).
All values of km (Table  I) are close to, but a little larger than, those (kon in Table  I) obtained conventionally with Eq. 11, in which k>tt was  neglected.
The k,u value obtained by the present treatment  for the wild type, 0.9(0.2) X lO"4   s"1  , is almost the same  as that obtained by the conventional method [1.6(0.1) X  10"1   s"1  ; Jfc'oft in Table I).
The values of Kit/km are close to  the K, values obtained by the equilibrium analysis as in Fig.  1 except for the cases of Asp, His, and Leu mutants (Table  I), the reason for which is not clear.
  SSIM73I exhibits the weakest inhibition at pH7.0  among the Pi mutants tested.
This may be due to the steric  hindrance of the /^-branched side chain of He with the Pi  binding pocket of subtilisin BPN'; the valine mutant also  has weaker inhibitory activity.
The difference in the K{  values between SSI(wt) and SSEM73I was found to be  largely due to the difference in dissociation rate constant,  Abf   (Table I).
That the increase in X, is accounted for by the  increase of k,,, was also reported for the binding of SSI with  a-chymotrypsin and subtilisin BPN' (37); ovomucoid third  domain with serine proteinases (19); and barley chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 with subtilisin BPN' and chymotrypsin  (20).
  SSIM73E and SSIM73D also have lower inhibitory  activity (Table I), and this effect of Pj substitution by acidic  residues is more pronounced in the basic pH region (Fig. 2).
  The isoelectric point, pi, of SSI(wt) is 4.3 (38), and  glutamic and aspartic acid residues must have a fully  negative charge in this pH range.
Therefore, the effect of  pH on the binding of these recombinant SSIs in this region  is likely to be due to proton dissociation on the enzyme side.
  A model peptide substrate with Glu at the Pi position was  a poor substrate of subtilisin BPN', and electrostatic  repulsion between Glul56 of the enzyme and the P!
Glu  residue was shown partly to account for its low preference  for this substrate (39).
However, it is unlikely that the  repulsion between these two Glu residues would cause the  present pH dependence of K, of SSIM73E in this pH range.
  On the other hand, the pi of subtilisin BPN' is 7.8 (40), and  this may be partly related to the pH effect here in question.
  The differences in if, values of SSIM73D and SSIM73E at  pH 8.6 are found to be largely due to the difference in the  association rate constant, ^,n (Table II), in contrast to the  case of SSIM73I.
Therefore, in the cases of SSIM73D and  SSIM73E, repulsion between the like net charges of the two  proteins may be a cause of the decrease in the binding rate  constant, which results in the larger inhibitor constant, K,,  in the alkaline pH region.
Between these two mutants,  SSIM73D has lower affinity to subtilisin BPN' than does  SSIM73E (Fig. 2), and the kinetic analysis shows that this  difference stems from both km and k,,, (Table II).
  The standard free energy change of binding of subtilisin  BPN' and the inhibitors, AG ( = 2.S03RT\ogK,), where R  is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature, are  -14.7, -13.9, -13.9, and-13.1 kcal-mol"1   for SSI(wt),  SSEM73E, SSIM73D, and SSIM73I, respectively, at pH  7.0.
The free energy level of the subtilisin BPN'-SSI  complex is thus in the order of SSI(wt)<SSIM73E =  SSIM73D<SSIM73I.
These complexes are assumed to  exist as Michaelis complexes, as has been elucidated for the  wild-type complex by X-ray crystallographic analysis (10,  11) and NMR study (12).
  The free energy of activation for the association of  subtilisin BPN' and the inhibitor, AG*,( = 2.303-RT {log( As  T/h) \ogkm}), where kg is Boltzmann's constant and h,  Planck's constant, are 8.16,8.89,8.92, and 8.18 kcal-mol-1  for SSI(wt), SSIM73E, SSIM73D, and SSEM73I, respectively.
Therefore, it can be assumed that the free energy  level of the transition state of association for subtilisin  BPN' and SSEM73I is'close to that of the wild-type complex, whereas those forSIM73D and SSIM73E are higher  than that of the wild type.
  In this regard, it should be worth analyzing this binding  process of the recbmbinant SSIs with rapid reaction  kinetics.
A two-step mechanism (Eq. 12) in which a fast  bimolecular process for the formation of a loosely bound  intermediate is followed by a slower unimolecular step has  been proposed for the interaction of SSI(wt) and subtilisin  BPN' (36).
A similar plot of k,pp against inhibitor concentration was obtained for SSIM73I and SSI(wt) (Fig. 7)  indicating similar values of KL and k+2 for the two SSIs  (Table HI).
The k-2 of SSIM73I was calculated to be 2.2 x  10~3   s"1   from Eq. 15, which is considerably larger than that  of SSI(wt).
These results suggest that, like SSI(wt),  SSIM73I binds with subtilisin BPN' in the fast bimolecular  process to make a loose complex, but that the tight complex  of SSIM73I and subtilisin BPN' is less stable than that of  SSI(wt).
The y3-branched side chain of He seems to prevent  the residue from fitting tightly into the Si pocket of  subtilisin BPN'.
The relationship between A^pp and SSIM73D concentration was different from that of SSI(wt) (Fig.  7).
The larger value of KL of SSIM73D represents the  instability of the loose complex.
There is also a difference in  the slower unimolecular step: the smaller k+2 indicates  difficulty in isomerization, and a possible explanation for  this may be repulsion between the negative charges on Asp  at the Pi residue and Glul56 in the S, pocket of subtilisin  BPN'.
  We have investigated the effects of replacement of the Pi  residue of a protein proteinase inhibitor, SSI, on its interaction with subtilisin BPN'.
Kinetic analysis has revealed the  significance of the Pi side chain in the tight binding of SSI  and subtilisin BPN' and given us a glimpse of the detailed  mechanism of specific interaction between the two proteins.
