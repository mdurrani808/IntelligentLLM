ATXN1 binds to  the transcriptional repressor Capicua (CIC), and the interaction plays a critical role in SCA1 pathogenesis whereby  reducing CIC levels rescues SCA1-like phenotypes in  a mouse model.
The ATXN1/HBP1 (AXH) domain of  ATXN1 mediates its homodimerization as well as the  interaction with CIC.
Here, we present the crystal structure of ATXN1s AXH domain bound to CIC and show  that the binding pocket of the AXH domain to CIC  overlaps with the homodimerization pocket of the AXH  domain.
Thus, the binding to CIC disrupts the homodimerization of ATXN1.
Furthermore, the binding of  CIC reconfigures the complex to allow another form of  dimerization mediated by CIC, showing the intricacy  of protein complex formation and reconfiguration by  ATXN1 and CIC.
Identifying the surfaces mediating the  interactions between CIC and ATXN1 reveals a critical  role for CIC in the reconfiguration of the AXH dimers and  might provide insight into ways to target the ATXN1/CIC  interactions to modulate SCA1 pathogenesis.

  Received December 11, 2012; revised version accepted  February 7, 2013.
  Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of nine  polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion neurodegenerative diseases.
SCA1 is caused by the polyQ expansion in Ataxin-1  (ATXN1) (Orr et al. 1993).
It is believed that the polyQ  expansion in ATXN1 modulates its normal activity to  cause the pathology (Lim et al. 2008) ATXN1 has many  binding partners, including Capicua (CIC), a transcriptional repressor that is involved in SCA1 pathogenesis.
In  fact, reducing CIC levels by 50% rescues many SCA1-like  phenotypes in a mouse model of the disease (Fryer et al.  2011).
A highly conserved ATXN1/HBP1 (AXH) domain  in ATXN1, which is required for SCA1 pathogenesis  (Tsuda et al. 2005), interacts with an N-terminal region  of CIC (Lam et al. 2006).
Furthermore, the AXH domain is  required for ATXN1 self-association, which is also shown  by the crystal structure of the AXH domain alone (Burright  et al. 1997; Chen et al. 2004).
Although ATXN1 interacts  with several cellular partners and regulates their activities, the biochemical properties of ATXN1 and the  molecular mechanism mediating complex formation of  ATXN1 with a protein such as CIC are still not well  understood.
Here, we present the crystal structures of  ATXN1s AXH domain bound with CIC peptides.
These  structures, followed by biochemical and in vivo analysis,  reveal that the binding of CIC to ATXN1 dissociates the  ATXN1 homodimer and induces a new form of ATXN1  dimer mediated by CICs.
These data implicate that ATXN1  undergoes reconfiguration of complex formation upon CIC  binding.
  Result and Discussion  Crystal structure of the ATXN1CIC complex  To understand the molecular mechanism mediating  ATXN1CIC interaction, we determined the crystal  structure of ATXN1s AXH domain bound to a highly  conserved N-terminal region of CIC (2848 amino acids,  CIC21: EPRSVAVFPWHSLVPFLAPSQ) at 2.5 A resolution  using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD)  method (Supplemental Table 1; Supplemental Fig. S1).
  The structure of the AXH domain bound with CIC peptide  is almost identical with the structure of the AXH domain  alone (Chen et al. 2004).
The complex structure reveals  that CIC21 binds to a highly hydrophobic pocket of the  AXH domain (Fig. 1).
Highly conserved residues (W37, L40,  and V41) of CIC21 form hydrophobic interactions with  highly conserved residues (V591, S602, and L686) of the  AXH domain (Fig. 1).
To confirm that the interaction  observed in the crystal structure is biologically relevant,  we first mutagenized the conserved residues of CIC21  and examined the binding by maltose-binding protein  (MBP) pull-down assay (Fig. 2A, top).
Among the conserved  residues, mutating the conserved W37 to A (W37A), and  L40 to S (L40S) of CIC21 severely impaired the binding  abilities of CIC21 to the AXH domain, while mutating  other conserved residues moderately affected the binding abilities.
We next generated several mutations in  the hydrophobic pocket of the AXH domain.
Among  these mutants, combined mutations in the pocket  (V591A_S602D, V591A_L686E, or S602D_L686E) abolish the interaction between the AXH domain and CIC21  (Fig. 2A, bottom).
  To determine whether the interaction between the  AXH domain and CIC observed in the crystal structure  and whether in vitro pull-down assays reflect in vivo  interactions in the context of the full-length proteins, we  transfected either Myc-tagged full-length CIC (CICf_WT)  [Keywords: complex; neurodegenerative disease; SCA1] 6  Corresponding author  E-mail songj@kaist.ac.kr  Article is online at http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gad.212068.112.
  590 GENES & DEVELOPMENT 27:590595  2013 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 0890-9369/13; www.genesdev.org  Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on January 7, 2015 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Pressor full-length CIC mutants (CICf_W37A and CICf_L40S) and  asked whether the mutations disrupt the interaction between endogenous ATXN1 and CIC in vivo.
Consistent  with the structural and in vitro binding data, the conserved  hydrophobic residues (W37 and L40) of CIC are critical for  ATXN1 binding in vivo (Fig. 2B).
Next, we transfected  either Flag-tagged full-length wild-type or mutant ATXN1  and examined the binding abilities with endogenous CIC.
  We found that the AXH mutants (ATXN1V591A_S602D,  ATXN1V591A_L686E, and ATXN1S602D_L686E) fail to interact  with endogenous CIC, but a negative control mutant  (R665A) shows binding comparable with that of wild-type  ATXN1 (Fig. 2C).
These data validate the information  deduced from the crystal structure.
  Disruption of ATXN1 homodimerization upon CIC  binding  The previous structure of the AXH domain shows that  the AXH domain forms a homodimer (Chen et al. 2004).
  Interestingly, the same pocket on ATXN1 that mediates  CIC binding was initially identified to be involved in  homodimerization of the AXH domain, suggesting that  CIC binding might disrupt AXH domain homodimerization (Supplemental Fig. 2A,B; Chen et al. 2004).
Therefore, we investigated whether the CIC binding to the  AXH domain disrupts AXH homodimerization by size  exclusion chromatography (Supplemental Fig. 3).
While  the AXH domain alone elutes at fractions corresponding  to the AXH dimer, the AXH domain bound to CIC21  (AXH_CIC21) elutes in a fraction similar to the N-terminal-deleted AXH domain (AXH_DN), which is supposed  to be a monomer, since the N terminus of the AXH  domain is critical for its homodimerization.
Combined  with the structure of AXHCIC complex, these data show  that the binding of CIC to the hydrophobic pocket of the  AXH domain disrupts the homodimerization of ATXN1.
  ATXN1CIC interactions  To measure the binding affinity between the AXH domain and CIC in a quantitative manner, we assayed  binding affinities using isothermal titration calorimetry  (ITC).
Wild-type CIC21 binds to the AXH domain with  ;100 nM KD affinity, while CIC21 mutants (CIC21_W37A  and CIC21_L40S) show decreased affinity, with a KD in the  micromolar range (Fig. 2D).
We next measured the  binding between wild-type CIC21 and the AXH mutants  (Supplemental Fig. 4).
Unexpectedly, the binding between  CIC21 and the AXHV591A_S602D mutant shows endothermic  kinetics.
Moreover, the double mutants (AXHV591A_L686E  and AXHS602D_L686E), which fail to interact with CIC21 by  MBP pull-down assay, show apparent binding affinities  comparable with AXHWT to CIC21.
We also measured the  binding between wild-type CIC21 and AXH single mutants (AXHV591A, AXHS602D, and AXHL686E) as well as  a triple mutant (AXHV591A_S602D_L686E) (Supplemental  Fig. 5).
All single mutants show binding affinities comparable with the wild-type, and the triple mutant shows  almost no binding.
Furthermore, to investigate the dimerization status of the double mutants, we performed  size exclusion chromatography and found that all double  mutants elute as monomer forms, indicating that the  dimerization interface was disrupted (Supplemental Fig. 6).
  The double mutants affect not only the homodimerization of the AXH domain, but also the hydrophobic  interface between the AXH domain and CIC (Fig. 2A).
  This makes it difficult to interpret the binding between  the AXH domain and CIC21 by ITC.
  Therefore, we decided to directly measure the binding between the AXH mutants (AXHV591A_S602D,  AXHV591A_L686E, and AXHS602D_L686E) and CIC21 using  surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which measures the  binding events only between the AXH domain and CIC.
  We immobilized biotinylated CIC21 peptide on a SA chip  as a ligand and examined the bindings of the AXH domains as analytes.
Consistent with the MBP pull-down  assay, SPR analysis shows that the wild-type AXH domain  binds to CIC21 with ;40 nM KD affinity, while the mutant  AXH variants are unable to bind to CIC (Fig. 2A [bottom  panel], E).
These data are consistent with the notion that  CIC binds the hydrophobic pocket of the AXH domain and  disrupts the homodimerization of the AXH domain.
  Reconfiguration of complex formation by ATXN1  and CIC  Upon further examination of the structure, we noticed  that there are three molecules of the AXHCIC21 complexes in an asymmetric unit in the crystal.
Among them,  the structure of two AXHCIC21 complexes suggests  a possible new form of ATXN1 dimerization mediated  Figure 1.

  Complex structure of ATAXIN-1 and Capicua  GENES & DEVELOPMENT 591  Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on January 7, 2015 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Pressby the CIC dimer (Supplemental Fig. 7).
To assess the  biological relevance of this new form of AXHCIC  complex, we determined the crystal structure of the  AXH domain bound to a longer CIC peptide (2148 amino  acids, CIC28:MFVWTNVEPRSVAVFPWHSLVPFLAPSQ)  at 3.15 A resolution by molecular replacement method  using the AXH domain alone without CIC21 as a search  model (Fig. 3; Supplemental Table 1).
There are two  AXHCIC28 molecules in an asymmetric unit of the  crystals, which belong to a different space group with  the AXHCIC21 crystals (Supplemental Table 1), indicating that the AXHCIC28 molecules have a different  packing environment with the AXHCIC21.
Indeed, the  AXH domains make a new form of dimerization mediated by the CIC28 dimer (Fig. 3A).
Two CIC28 molecules  positioned in an anti-parallel manner make an intertwining interaction between each other, and these two intertwined CIC28 molecules bridge two AXH domains.
Specifically, hydrophobic residues (MFVW, 2124 amino  acids) of CIC28 interact with a hydrophobic patch composed of F632, V634, V645, and Y649 from the AXH  domain as well as with F43 from the other CIC28 (Fig. 3B).
  Furthermore, four molecules (two CIC28 molecules and  two AXH domains) interact together, forming a hydrophobic core composed of I580 and L588 from both AXH  domains and V32 and V34 from both CIC28 molecules  (Fig. 3C).
To examine whether the AXH domain dimerization mediated by CIC occurs in a more physiological  condition, we analyzed complex formation of AXH and  CIC comparing the sizes of several AXHCIC complexes  by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4A).
The wildtype CIC28AXH domain elutes earlier than the AXH  domain alone (homodimer), indicating that the AXH  CIC28 complex forms a larger complex or a complex with  Figure 2.
Mutation in critical residues disrupts the interaction between the ATXN1 and CIC both in vitro and in vivo.

Mutations in MBP-CIC21 (W37A and L40S) and His-AXH (V591A_S602D, V591A_L686E, or S602D_L686E)  greatly disrupt the interaction.
The same amounts of the AXH domains used for MBP pull-down were shown by His pull-down for His-AXH  domains.
The amount of bound AXH domain is quantified at the bottom of the gels.

(D) ITC measurements  between the AXH domain and CIC21_WT, CIC21_W37A, and AXH-CIC21_L40S.
CIC21_W37A and AXH-CIC21_L40S have greatly reduced affinity to the  AXH domain compared with CIC21_WT.
(E) SPR measurements of the binding affinities between CIC21 and the AXH domain.
The KD for the  binding between CIC21 and AXHWT is ;40 nM.. AXHV591A_S602D, AXHV591A_L686E, and AXHS602D_L686E fail to bind to CIC21.  Kim et al.  592 GENES & DEVELOPMENT  Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on January 7, 2015 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Pressextended conformation.
Consistent with this observation, the CIC28-mediated AXH dimer structure has an  extended shape compared with the AXH homodimer.
We  then generated a triple mutation in CIC (CIC28_AEA:  F22A_V23E_W24A), which would affect the CIC-mediated AXH dimerization but not AXHCIC interaction.
  We also generated AXH mutants (L588A and L588D)  to disrupt the hydrophobic core where four molecules  junction without affecting the CIC-binding pocket at  the AXH domain (Fig. 2A,C).
All of the mutants elute  at similar fractions where AXHCIC21 elutes, which is  shown to be a monomer, suggesting that the mutations  disrupt the CIC-mediated AXH dimerization, resulting  in a AXHCIC monomer.
To analyze the complex formation more quantitatively, we measured the size of the  complexes using size exclusion chromatography multiFigure 3.

GST-ATXN1 can pull down Flag-ATXN1 in the presence of wild-type CICf and wild-type Flag-ATXN1, but the interaction is  abolished or reduced with mutant CICf or mutant Flag-ATXN1.
  Complex structure of ATAXIN-1 and Capicua  GENES & DEVELOPMENT 593  Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on January 7, 2015 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Pressangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) (Supplemental Fig. 8).
  SEC-MALS analysis shows that the molecular weight  of the AXHWT CIC28 shows 33.8 kDa, indicating that  AXHWTCIC28 forms a heterotetramer of AXHWTCIC28,  whereas AXHL588DCIC28 shows a heterodimer size.
Interestingly, AXHWT CIC28_AEA and AXHL588ACIC28  show slightly higher molecular weights than their heterodimer sizes, suggesting the existence of partial heterotetramers.
Collectively, SEC-MALS data with the gel  filtration analysis indicate that the CIC dimer can reconfigure the ATXN1 dimer and form a heterotetramer  with ATXN1s.
  To determine whether the structural data and
in vitro  studies regarding the CIC28-mediated complex formation  of AXH reflect the in vivo complex formation by fulllength ATXN1 and CIC, we transfected GST-ATXN1 and  Flag-ATXN1 with saturated amounts of wild-type MycCICf (CICf_WT) or Myc-CIC mutant (CICf_AEA: F22A_  V23E_W24A) and examined CIC-mediated ATXN1 dimerization (Fig. 4B).
Figure 4B shows that wild-type GSTATXN1 is able to bring down Flag-ATXN1 when cotransfected with CICf_WT but not with mutant CICf_AEA,  suggesting that the dimer formation between GSTATXN1 and Flag-ATXN1 is mediated by CIC and that  the AEA mutation in CIC disrupts ATXN1 dimerization.
  These data are consistent with the structural observation  that the hydrophobic residues (F22, V23, and W24) are  critical for CIC-mediated dimerization of ATXN1.
Next,  we transfected wild-type GST-ATXN1 and Flag-ATXN1  mutants (L588A and L588D) with CICf_WT and examined  the CIC-mediated dimerization of ATXN1.
The mutants  (L588A and L588D) would affect the AXH dimerization  mediated by CIC but not the interaction between AXH  and CIC (Fig. 2C).
Figure 4B shows that wild-type GSTATXN1 failed to pull down the Flag-ATXN1 mutant  (L588D) in the presence of wild-type Myc-CICf.
The small  amount of Flag-ATXN1 mutant (L588A) pulled down by  GST-ATXN1 was likely due to the hydrophobic property  of alanine substitution.
Collectively, these data show that  the CIC binding to ATXN1 disrupts the homodimerization and reconfigures to make a CIC-mediated ATXN1  dimer complex.
  The interaction between polyQ-expanded ATXN1  and CIC plays a critical role in SCA1 pathogenesis  (Fryer et al. 2011).
The notion that the binding of CIC  to ATXN1 substantially reconfigures the arrangement of  ATXN1 prompted us to propose that the rearrangement  of ATXN1 homodimer to the CIC-mediated ATXN1 complex might affect the interaction with one of the many  other binding partners (Lim et al. 2008).
Previous work  showed that the level of CIC protein is reduced in the  absence of ATXN1, and the level of ATXN1 is also reduced upon reduction of CIC in a dose-dependent manner  (Fryer et al. 2011).
  The crystal structure in this study reveals that the  ATXN1 dimer is mediated by the CIC dimer and that the  CIC dimer is mediated by the ATXN1 dimer, indicating  that the formation of the ATXN1CIC complex is highly  interdependent.
These observations suggest that the protein stabilities of ATXN1 and CIC might be contingent on  ATXN1CIC complex formation.
Recently, it was shown  that the polyQ in Huntingtons disease protein modulates  the activity of its endogenous binding partner, Polycombrepressive complex2 (Seong et al. 2010).
Furthermore, it  was shown that in SCA1 knock-in mice, some CIC target  genes are hyperrepressed, while other CIC target genes  are derepressed (Fryer et al. 2011).
Therefore, it is tantalizing to propose that the expanded polyQ in ATXN1  CICCICATXN1 configuration may alter the transcriptional repressor activity of CIC, which may be involved in  SCA1 pathology.
However, the exact mechanism of SCA1  pathology regarding the ATXN1 and CIC interaction  needs to be further investigated.
  This study provides the first structural and molecular  insights into the interaction between one polyQ disease  protein, ATXN1, and its endogenous binding partner,  CIC.
Our findings underscore the importance of domains  beyond the glutamine tract for interactions that modulate disease pathogenesis.
Given the in vivo benefits of  reducing CIC levels in the SCA1 mouse model (Fryer  et al. 2011), the identification of the surface mediating the  ATXN1CIC interaction opens up the possibility of developing agents that target the ATXN1CIC interactions  to modulate SCA1 pathogenesis.
  Materials and methods  Protein expression and purification  The AXH domain (563689 amino acids) from human ATXN1 was cloned  into a pET28a vector, generating an N-terminal His tag.
The AXH domain  was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified with an Niaffinity column.
