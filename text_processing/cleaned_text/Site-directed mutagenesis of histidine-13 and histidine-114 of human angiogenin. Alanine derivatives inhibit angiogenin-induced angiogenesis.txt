Alanine Derivatives Inhibit Angiogenin-Induced Angiogenesis?   Robert Shapiro and Bert L. Vallee*   Center for Biochemical and Biophysical Sciences and Medicine. Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 021 15   Received April 18, 1989; Revised Manuscript Received June 1, 1989   ABSTRACT: The roles of His-13 and His-114 in the ribonucleolytic and angiogenic activities of human   angiogenin have been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis.
Replacement of either residue by alanine   (H13A and H114A) decreases enzymatic activity toward tRNA by at least 10000-fold and virtually abolishes   angiogenic activity in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay.
Both the H13A and H114A mutant   proteins compete effectively with angiogenin in the latter assay; only a 5-fold molar excess of H13A over   unmodified protein is required for complete inhibition.
The His - Ala substitutions, however, do not have   any significant effect on the interaction of angiogenin with human placental ribonuclease inhibitor, an   extremely potent inhibitor of angiogenin (Ki N 7 X M) previously shown to interact with another   active-site residue, Lys-40.
The effects of more conservative replacements-glutamine at position 13 and   asparagine at position 114-were also examined.
While the enzymatic activity of the H114N mutant was   at least 3300-fold less than for the unmodified protein, the H13Q derivative had only 300-fold reduced activity   toward tRNA and cytidylyl(3+)adenosine.
Both substitutions substantially decreased angiogenic activity.
  The parallel effects on ribonucleolytic and biological activities observed with all four mutant proteins provide   strong evidence that the latter activity of angiogenin is dependent on a functional enzymatic active site.
  The capacity of the H13A and H114A derivatives to compete with angiogenin in the chorioallantoic membrane   assay suggests several additional features of the biological mode of action of this protein.
  Human angiogenin, a 14.1-kDa monomeric protein, induces   neovascularization in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and rabbit cornea (Fett et al., 1985), cleaves   RNA (Shapiro et al., 1986b), and exerts a number of effects   on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells in vitro, which   include activating phospholipases C and A2 (Bicknell & Vallee,   1988, 1989) and increasing cholesterol esterification (Moore   & Riordan, 1989).
Angiogenin displays extensive sequence   homology to the pancreatic RNases (Strydom et al., 1985;   Kurachi et al., 1985).
Indeed, most of the active-site components of bovine pancreatic RNase A, including the critical   catalytic residues His- 12, Lys-4 1, and His-1 19, are conserved   in angiogenin.
Nonetheless, the enzymatic activity of angiogenin differs markedly in both magnitude and specificity   from that of RNase A (Shapiro et al., 1986b St. Clair et al.,   1987, 1988; Rybak & Vallee, 1988).
  Numerous pieces of evidence suggest that the ribonucleolytic   and angiogenic activities of angiogenin are related.
Both   activities are abolished by the human placental RNase inhibitor (PRI) (Shapiro & Vallee, 1987), which binds to   angiogenin with a dissociation constant of 7 X M (Lee   et al., 1989b).
Mutation of Lys-40 to glutamine also virtually   eliminates both activities (Shapiro et al., 1989).
Conversely,   a mutation that increases enzymatic activity 15-fold, Asp-1 16   - His, also increases angiogenicity by 1-2 orders of magnitude   (Harper & Vallee, 1988).
  Further, chemical modification of histidines in angiogenin   by bromoacetate at pH 5.5 decreases both enzymatic and   angiogenic activity (Shapiro et al., 1986b, 1987).
The sites   of carboxymethylation have been identified as His- 13 and   This work was supported by funds from Hoechst, A.G., under an   agreement with Harvard University.   *Address correspondence to this author at the Center for Biochemical   and Biophysical Sciences and Medicine, Harvard Medical School, 250   Longwd Ave., Boston, MA 021 15.
  His-1 14 (Shapiro et al., 1988b), whose corresponding residues,   His- 12 and His- 1 19, are modified under these conditions in   classical studies on RNase A (Stein & Barnard, 1959;   Crestfield et al., 1963).
However, unlike with RNase A, it   has not been possible to obtain and characterize derivatives   of angiogenin carboxymethylated at only a single histidine.
  For this reason, and because of the inherent limitations and   interpretive ambiguities of chemical modification approaches,   we have now employed oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis   to investigate the role of these two histidines in angiogenin.
  Replacement of either histidine by alanine essentially abolishes   ribonucleolytic and biological activities.
Strikingly, both the   H13A2 and H114A mutants effectively inhibit the angiogenesis   induced by angiogenin in the chick embryo CAM assay.
The   effects of more conservative replacements-i.e., glutamine at   position 13 and asparagine at position 114-were also examined.

  Angiogenin expressed in E. coli differs from natural angiogenin only   with respect to its N-terminus: Met-(-1)-Gln-1 versus <Glu-1, respectively.
These two forms have indistinguishable enzymatic and angiogenic   activities (Shapiro et al., 1988a).

  Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis.
Genes encoding   angiogenin with alanine or glutamine replacing His- 13 and   alanine or asparagine replacing His- 1 14 were obtained by the   method of Kunkel (1985) as described (Shapiro et al., 1988a).
  The mutagenic oligonucleotides were pCTGACTATGACGCT (H 13Q), pTGCCAGTCGCTCTAGATCAG   (H114A), and pCTGCCAGTCAATCTAGATCAG   (H114N).
They were purchased from Biotix (Danbury, CT).
  Expression and Isolation of Angiogenin Derivatives.
Genes   encoding mutant angiogenins were transferred from M 13mpl8   into the expression vector pAng2 by standard procedures   (Shapiro et al., 1988a).
The expression plasmid contains a   modified E. coli trp promoter and an ampicillin resistance   marker for selection.
Expression and purification of recombinant proteins were performed as described (Shapiro et al.,   1988a) except that the H13Q and H114N derivatives were   rechromatographed on the C18 HPLC column (see Results).
  In this case, elution was achieved with a gradient of 32-42%   solvent B in 45 min at 0.8 mL/min, where solvent A was 0.1%   TFA in water and solvent B was 0.08% TFA in a 3:2:2 mixture   of 2-propanol/acetonitrile/water.
One-minute fractions were   collected, lyophilized, and reconstituted in 100 pL of water.
  All other samples were dialyzed vs water prior to being tested   for ribonucleolytic and angiogenic activity.
In order to ensure   that preparations of angiogenin mutants were not contaminated by unmodified angiogenin, all glassware and centrifuge   bottles employed during the isolation were either autoclaved   or treated with 0.1 N NaOH for 30 min prior to use.
In   addition, blank gradients were run on both the Mono S and   C18 HPLC columns immediately before each mutant protein   was chromatographed.
In all cases, the chromatograms revealed no detectable (Le., <50 ng) carryover of angiogenin   from previous use of the columns.
  Structural Characterization.
Amino acid analyses (Picotag   method; Waters Associates) and tryptic peptide mapping were   performed as described (Strydom et al., 1985; Shapiro et al.,   1988a).
  Enzymatic Assays.
All buffers and water used in enzymatic   assays were passed through a SepPak C18 cartridge (Waters)   to remove adventitious RNases.
Formation of perchloric acid   soluble fragments from yeast tRNA (type X, Sigma Chemical   Co.) was measured as described (Shapiro et al., 1987).
Incubation mixtures contained 0.6 mg of RNA, 30 pg of human   serum albumin, 33 mM Hepes, and 33 mM NaCl, pH 6.8,   in a 300-pL volume.
Maximum concentrations of mutant   angiogenins were 10.4 pM (H13A), 6.6 pM (H13Q), 5.0 pM   (H114A), and 7.5 pM (H114N), and incubation times of 4-7   h at 37 OC were employed.
For comparison of nonenzymatic   and angiogenin-catalyzed cleavage rates, the assay was modified in that albumin was omitted and the tRNA was purified   to remove extraneous RNases.
The tRNA stock solution (10   mg/mL in water) was extracted with phenol, with a 1:l   mixture of phenol and chloroform, and then with chloroform   3 times.
One-tenth volume of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2,   was then added, followed by 2.5 volumes of ethanol.
After   centrifugation (1 5600g, 15 min, 4 "C), the RNA pellet was   washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and reconstituted in water.
  For the assays measuring the nonenzymatic rate of tRNA   cleavage, a 5-h incubation at 37 OC in the mixture described   above was employed.
For comparison, a sample containing   angiogenin (0.24 pM) was incubated for 30 min at 37 OC.

  Cleavage of the dinucleotide CpA (1 00 pM) by angiogenin   and H13Q-angiogenin in 33 mM Mes/33 mM NaCl, pH 5.8,   was measured by HPLC as described (Shapiro et al., 1986a,   19888).
With the H13Q derivative (12.8 pM), an incubation   time of 20 h at 37 OC was employed.
In order to measure the   nonenzymatic rate of cleavage, a sample of 1 mM CpA in the   same buffer was incubated at 37 OC for up to 11 days.
  Biological Assays.
Angiogenic activity was assayed by the   chick embryo CAM method of Knighton et al. (1977) as   described (Fett et al., 1985).
The repeatability and reproducibility of this assay have been documented previously (Fett   et al., 1985).
The number of eggs employed in any individual   group of assays at a given concentration ranged from 7 to 17.
  Interaction of Angiogenin Derivatives with Human PRI.
  Apparent second-order rate constants for association of PRI   with angiogenin derivatives were determined by examining   their competition with RNase A for PRI as described (Lee   et al., 1989a; Lee & Vallee, 1989a; Shapiro et al., 1989).
Rate   constants for dissociation of angiogenin derivatives from their   complexes with PRI were also measured by methods reported   previously (Lee et al., 1989b).
The conditions employed were   identical with those described in Shapiro et al. (1989).
  RESULTS   Genes encoding   H 1 3A-, H 134-, H 1 14A-, and H 1 14N-angiogenin were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described   previously (Shapiro et al., 1989).
The DNA for each mutant   was sequenced in its entirety in order to rule out any spurious   mutations.
Mutant proteins were expressed under the control   of the trp promoter in E. coli strain W3 110 and purified as   described (Shapiro et al., 1988a).
All derivatives had elution   times indistinguishable from those of unmodified angiogenin   during both Mono S and C18 HPLC.
The final preparations   were >98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (not shown).
  Yields were 0.5 mg/L (H13Q) to 2 mg/L (H13A).
  Structural Characterization.
Amino acid compositions of   the four mutant angiogenins (Table I) support the proposed   structures and indicate that all proteins contain a Met-(-1)   residue.
Tryptic peptide maps (H13A and H114A shown in   Figure 1) indicate that in all cases the three disulfide bonds   Preparation of Angiogenin Mutants.
Role of Histidines in Angiogenin Biochemistry, Vol, 28, No. 18, 1989 7403   H13A- and Hl14A-angiogenins, allowing an upper limit to   be set at 0.01% activity compared with unmodified angiogenin.
  Initial preparations of the H13Q and H114N derivatives,   however, appeared to be 0.1-1% active.
In order to examine   whether this activity might be due to trace amounts of a   contaminating ribonuclease, both mutant proteins were rechromatographed on a C18 HPLC column employing a   shallow gradient (see Experimental Procedures).
Fractions   collected from across each peak were lyophilized, reconstituted   in water, quantitated by amino acid analysis, and tested for   enzymatic activity.
With the H13Q derivative, the three major   protein-containing fractions had similar specific activities, 0.3%   that of native angiogenin.
Thus, this activity appears to be   associated with the mutant protein.
With the H114N derivative, the specific activity varied considerably through the peak.
  The earliest fractions had no measurable activity, under   conditions where an activity 0.03% of that of angiogenin could   have been detected.
This value thus represents an upper limit   on the true activity.
  Activity of the rechromatographed H13Q mutant toward   CpA was also measured.
A k,,/K, value of 0.045 M-' s-I   was obtained, 0.4% of that determined for angiogenin.
Owing   to limitations of the assay, it has not been possible to determine   whether this activity decrease reflects changes in kat, K,, or   both.
  Rate of Nonenzymatic Cleavage of tRNA and CpA. In   order to facilitate mechanistic evaluation of ribonucleolytic   activities measured with mutant angiogenins, the nonenzymatic   rates of substrate cleavage were examined.
At pH 6.8, 37 OC,   the observed reaction velocity for formation of perchloric acid   soluble fragments from tRNA was 3.3 X lo4 A260 units/min   at a substrate concentration of 2 mg/mL. The initial reaction   velocity with 0.24 pM angiogenin and 2 mg/mL tRNA was   1.2 X A260 units/min.
In calculation of the difference   between the rate constant for the nonenzymatic reaction   (=uo/[S]) and that for the angiogenin-catalyzed reaction   (= Vm/ [E]) from these data, the following assumptions were   made: (a) all phosphodiester bonds in the substrate are equally   susceptible to nonenzymatic cleavage; (b) no more than 10%   of these bonds are attacked by angiogenin in the initial stages   of the reaction [see Rybak and Vallee (1988)l; and (c) the   catalyzed reaction rate is approximately half of V,, (Lee &   Vallee, 1989b).
On this basis, the calculated rate enhancement   is at least IO5.
  The rate enhancement by angiogenin was also examined in   a less complex system, employing the dinucleotide CpA as   substrate.
After 11 days at 37 OC, pH 5.8, in the absence of   angiogenin, <0.05% conversion to products were observed by   HPLC.
Thus, the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the   reaction is <5 X s-l.
Under the same conditions, k,,,   for angiogenin is -0.1 s-* (T. P. Curran and R. Shapiro,   unpublished results).
Thus, the overall rate enhancement is   >2 x 108.
  Biological Activity of Angiogenin Derivatives.
The angiogenic activities of the H13A-, H114A-, H13Q-, and   H114N-angiogenins were measured in the CAM assay at doses   ranging from 1 to 10 ng per egg (Table 111).
In all cases,   activities are substantially decreased compared with that of   angiogenin.
Thus, the percentage of positive responses at 10   ng/egg for each mutant (1 7-25%) is considerably lower than   the 47% observed for unmodified angiogenin at 1 nglegg, and   not significantly different from typical values observed with   control samples lacking angiogenin (see legend of Table 111).

  For the H13A- and H13Q-angiogeniw amino acid compositions of peptide T7 (Table 11), containing residue 13, indicate   the replacement of His by Ala or Glx, respectively, and no   other changes.
Peptide T7 of the H13A mutant elutes later   than the natural peptide T7 during C18 HPLC, as expected   for replacement of His by Ala. For the H114A- and   H114N-angiogenins, amino acid compositions of peptide T11   (Table II), containing residue 114, show the replacement of   His by Ala or Asx, respectively, and no other changes.
The   H 1 14A peptide elutes somewhat later than the corresponding   peptide from angiogenin, again consistent with the His - Ala   replacement.
Amino acid compositions of the remaining   peptides are in good agreement with the proposed structures   and account for the rest of the four proteins, except for Arg-32   and Arg-33 of H114A.
  Ribonucleolytic Activity of Angiogenin Derivatives.

Data from multiple experiments   (1 1-17 eggs per group) were combined.
Control samples containing   only water assayed during the same period of time on 104 eggs were   12% positive.
  iogenin-induced angiogenesis was examined.
The amount of   unmodified angiogenin used in these experiments, 1 ng, is in   that region of the dose-response curve where activity decreases   would be most readily apparent (Fett et al., 1985; Kurachi   et al., 1988); it was sufficient to induce positive responses on   52% of the eggs.
In the presence of 20 ng of the H13A- or   H 1 14A derivatives, the percentages of positive responses to   1 ng of angiogenin were only 23% and 27%, respectively (Table   IV).
These are essentially the same as observed for 20 ng   of each mutant protein alone (22 and 24%, respectively).
This   inhibitory effect was examined further with the H13A derivative, in this case employing l and 5 ng of mutant protein   together with 1 ng of unmodified angiogenin (Table IV).
With   5 ng of H 13A-angiogenin, the inhibition was as effective as   with 20 ng.
Even with only 1 ng, partial inhibition was observed.
  Interaction of HI 3A- and HI 14A-Angiogenin with Placental Ribonuclease Inhibitor.
The apparent second-order rate   constants of association for H13A- and H114A-angiogenin   with PRI were determined by using a previously described   competition assay (Lee et al., 1989a; Shapiro et al., 1989).   RNase A (4.5 nM) and angiogenin derivatives (3.7-10.4 nM)   were mixed, PRI (4.5 nM) was added, and then the concentration of free RNase A was quantitated by adding the dinucleotide CpG and measuring its rate of cleavage spectrophotometrically.
This procedure yielded rate constants of (4.1   f 0.7) X lo8 M-' s-' for H13A and (2.2 f 0.4) X lo8 M-I   s-l for H114A, compared with (4.0 f 0.3) X lo8 M-' s-' for   unmodified Met-(-1) angiogenin (Shapiro et al., 1989).
  The rate constants for dissociation of the complexes of PRI   with H 13A- and H 1 14A-angiogenin were measured by first   5 10   TIME (days)   FIGURE 2: Dissociation of H13A-angiogenin-PRI (circles) and   H 1 14A-angiogeninePR1 complexes (triangles).
Angiogenin derivatives   were incubated with 1.5 equiv of PRI for 20 min at 25 OC, followed   by addition of 250 equiv of RNase A. Release of free angiogenin   was then measured by cation-exchange HPLC.
  forming each complex, then adding a 250-fold excess of RNase   A as scavenger for free PRI, and measuring the release of free   angiogenin derivative by cation-exchange HPLC (Figure 2).
  In both cases, the dissociation was biphasic with 12-13% of   the angiogenin released during the first 2 days, followed by   dissociation of an additional 5% (H13A) or 13% (H114A)   during the next 8 days! Treating the second, slower, phase   as a first-order process, dissociation rate constants of 8.1 X   lo-* and 2.2 X lC7 s-l were calculated for H13A and H114A,   respectively.
The corresponding value for native Met-(-1)-   angiogenin determined at the same time was 1.5 X loe7 s-I.   The Ki values calculated from these association and dissociation rate constants are 3.3 X 2.0 X 10-l6, and 1.0 X   M for unmodified and H13A- and H114A-angiogenins,   respectively.
  DISCUSSION   Critical functional roles for His- 12 and His- 1 19 of RNase   A were originally proposed on the basis of what are now   classical chemical modification studies (Gundlach et al., 1959;   Stein & Barnard, 1959; Crestfield et al., 1963; Heinrikson et   al., 1965).
Treatment of RNase with either iodo- or bromoacetate at pH 5.5 carboxymethylated Nal of His-1 19 and Nez   of Hi~-12.~ Homogeneous derivatives modified at one or the   other of these sites were isolated and shown to be inactive.
  Numerous additional reagents have since been demonstrated   to inactivate the enzyme through reaction at these sites also,   including iodoacetamide (Fruchter & Crestfield, 1967), 2'-   (3')-O-bromoacetyluridine (Pincus et al., 1975), and ferrate   ion (Steczko et al., 1979).
The view of His-12 and -119 as   important catalytic residues has been supported by a multitude   of X-ray and neutron diffraction studies of RNase and its   complexes with inhibitors (Richards & Wyckoff, 197 1, 1973;   Wlodawer & Sjolin, 1981; Wlodawer et al., 1983, 1988;   Borkakoti, 1983; Campbell & Petsko, 1987).
Nonetheless,   the essentiality of these two histidines is not as yet established   rigorously, and the postulated role of His-12 has been questioned (Machuga & Klapper, 1975; Deakyne & Allen, 1979).
  The enzymatic activity of angiogenin is lost upon treatment   with bromoacetate at pH 5.5, albeit 5-fold more slowly than   is that of RNase A (Shapiro et al., 1987).
The primary sites   ~ ~~   A similar biphasic process, with relatively rapid dissociation of a   small percentage of the complex followed by slower dissociation of the   remainder, has been observed previously for the complexes of PRI with   RNase A and, to a lesser extent, angiogenin (Lee et al., 1989b).
It has   also been reported for other systems, e.g., complexes of avidin with biotin   derivatives (Garlick & Giese, 1988).
  The system of Oldfield et al. (1975) is used when referring to the   side chain atoms of amino acids.
Role of Histidines in Angiogenin   of modification are Nal of His-1 14 and Ne2 of His-13, with   the former reacting - 1 S-fold more rapidly than the latter   (Shapiro et al., 1988b).
By comparison, in RNase A His-1 19   reacts 8-fold faster than His-12 (Crestfield et al., 1963).
The   capacity of angiogenin to induce neovascularization on the   CAM also appears to be markedly diminished by carboxymethylation (Shapiro et al., 1986b).
Thus, these experiments   point to critical roles for the two residues in both the enzymatic   and biological activities of this protein.
In addition, the   carboxymethyl derivatives have been shown to bind placental   RNase inhibitor 15-fold less tightly than does unmodified   angiogenin, suggesting that the two histidines are part of the   contact region (Lee & Vallee, 1989a).
  Unambiguous interpretation of the chemical modification   results is limited by several factors.
Since an additional   substituent has been attached to the imidazole ring, it is impossible to attribute the activity decrease solely to alteration   of that functional group.
This is further complicated by the   anionic nature of the substituent, since the substrate is also   anionic.
In addition, it has not been possible to isolate an   angiogenin derivative modified at only one site and determine   whether it is completely devoid of activity.
  In principle, these limitations can be largely circumvented   by employing site-directed mutagenesis.
By this method, the   imidazole moiety can be removed, as in the Ala derivatives,   or conservatively replaced, as in the Gln and Asn derivatives.
  Characterization of the His - Ala mutants allows the essentiality of these residues for ribonucleolytic, angiogenic, and   other activities to be assessed.
Additional functional information can then be obtained by studying the His - Gln and   His - Asn mutants.
These replacements could potentially   provide some of the same hydrogen-bonding interactions as   the original histidine (Lowe et al., 1985).
In RNase A, Ne2   of His-12 and Nal of His-119 are thought to participate in   catalysis (see below).
Since bromoacetate reacts with the same   imidazole nitrogens (on the corresponding residues) in angiogenin as in RNase A, it is probable that the same nitrogens   are involved in catalysis.
Thus, for His-13 of angiogenin,   glutamine was selected as the most conservative substitution   since its t-NH, occupies a position analogous to that of the   imidazole Ne2.
His-1 14 was replaced by an asparagine since   the asparagine 6-NH2 can hydrogen bond in a manner similar   to the imidazole N61.
  We find that the H13A, H114A, and H114N mutants have   no detectable enzymatic activity.
In contrast, the H13Q   mutant is only -300-fold less active than angiogenin toward   both tRNA and CpA. It is most likely that this activity is due   to the mutant itself rather than a contaminant for several   reasons.
Contamination by a ribonuclease is improbable since   enzymatic activity and H 13Q-angiogenin comigrate during   C18 HPLC.
In addition, the similar levels of activity observed   toward tRNA and CpA indicate an angiogenin-like specificity,   markedly different from those of typical bacterial and mammalian RNases (Barnard, 1969, and see below).
Contamination by unmodified angiogenin is also unlikely in view of   the precautions described under Experimental Procedures.
  Finally, similar activity was measured in two different preparations.
  Any interpretation of the activity decreases accompanying   mutations of angiogenin should be made in light of the overall   rate enhancement achieved in angiogenin-catalyzed reactions.
  Angiogenin cleaves tRNA and CpA (-5 X lo4)-fold and   - 106-fold, more slowly, respectively, than does RNase A   under the conditions employed in the present study (Lee &   Vallee, 1989b; Harper & Vallee, 1989).6 The magnitude of   Biochemistry, Vol. 28, No. 18, 1989 7405   the enhancement of C>p hydrolysis by RNase A is reported   to be -7 X lo9 (Eftink & Biltonen, 1983).
The enhancement   of the initial transphosphorylation step would be expected to   be much higher (Eftink & Biltonen, 1987), but no value appears to have been reported.
We find that the pseudo-firstorder rate constants for the nonenzymatic cleavage of tRNA   and CpA are at least 105-fold and (2 X lo*)-fold lower, respectively, than the apparent k,,, values for the angiogenincatalyzed reactions.
These represent lower limits since part   of the non-enzymatic rate may be due to trace amounts of   RNase, despite the precautions taken to avoid this, and since   the mechanisms and/or rate-limiting steps for the nonenzymatic and angiogenin-catalyzed reactions may differ.
  The rate decreases accompanying mutation of His-13 and   His-1 14--1104-fold for His-13 - Ala and His-1 14 - Ala   and 1103.5-fold for His-114 - Asn, but only 300-fold for   His-13 - Gln-may have important implications for the   catalytic mechanisms of this enzyme and the homologous   RNases.
The most widely accepted mechanism for RNase   A is that originally proposed by Findlay et al. (1962) and   subsequently extended by Roberts et al. (1969).
In the   transphosphorylation step of this mechanism (Figure 3), the   primary role of His-12 is to act as a general base catalyst,   removing a proton from the ribose 2-hydroxyl group and   thereby facilitating attack on the phosphorus to form a pentacovalent transition state.
This species then breaks down to   yield the 2,3-cyclic phosphate, aided by His-1 19, which acts   as a general acid, donating a proton to the leaving group.
The   results of most chemical, NMR, and X-ray diffraction studies   [see Richards and Wyckoff (1971, 1973), Blackburn and   Moore (1 982), and Eftink and Biltonen (1 987)] support this   view and point to the involvement of Ne2 of His- 12 and N6,   of His- 1 19.
  The inactivity of the H13A-, H114A-, and H114Nangiogenins is consistent with this catalytic mechanism.
The   observed activity of the H13Q derivative suggests that even   partial deprotonation of the 2-hydroxyl by a residue at this   position can impart a substantial rate enhancement, in   agreement with a theoretical study of RNase by Deakyne and   Allen (1979).
These authors note that a hydrogen bond between N6, of His-12 and the carbonyl of Thr-45 may prevent   the 2-hydroxyl from becoming totally deprotonated through   interaction with Nt2. Instead, a bent hydrogen bond between   Ne2 and the 2-hydroxyl would increase the negative charge   on On activating it for attack on the phosphorus.
In this case,   it is reasonable that Gln-13 angiogenin would also be partially   active, since it too might form a hydrogen bond with 02,.
  Alternatively, the 300-fold decreased activity of H 134-   angiogenin could reflect the difference between total and   partial deprotonation of the 2-hydroxyl.
  Results of a joint X-ray and neutron diffraction analysis of   RNase A (Wlodawer et al., 1983) have suggested a different   possible role for His-12 that is also consistent with the relatively   modest activity decrease accompanying the His - Gln replacement in angiogenin.
In this study of the complex of   RNase A with uridine vanadate, a putative transition-state   analogue, His-12 was observed to hydrogen bond to one of the   equatorial oxygens of vanadate rather than to the apical 2-   oxygen.
Instead, Lys-41 hydrogen bonds to the 2-oxygen.
  This interaction of Lys-41 has also been suggested by NMR   In contrast, angiogenin cleaves specific bonds of rRNA in the intact   ribosome somewhat more quickly than does RNase (St. Clair et a].,   1987).
It is possible that other substrates, as yet undiscovered, are   cleaved by angiogenin at rates comparable to those observed for RNase   A acting on its best substrates (e.& CpA). 1406 Biochemistry, Vol. 28, No. 18, 1989 Shapiro and Vallee   FIGURE 3: Proposed mechanism for the transphosphorylation reaction catalyzed by RNase A, adapted from Roberts et al. (1969).   of the 13C-methylated enzyme (Jentoft et al., 1981). If this 1989).
Replacement of Asp-116 by histidine increases both   view of His-12 is correct -[this depends in part on whether   uridine vanadate represents a true transition-state analogue   (Wlodawer et al., 1983)], then glutamine might well be able   to fulfill in part the function of the histidine.
  Clearly, direct extension to RNase A of the present results   for angiogenin may be unwarranted.
As stated above, angiogenin is several orders of magnitude less active than RNase   A toward the substrates used in this study.
The molecular   basis for this difference is unknown but could reflect changes   in substrate binding interactions, reactivity of catalytic residues,   or even reaction mechanism.
  Previous work has indicated that human PRI binds to the   active site of angiogenin.
Thus, replacement of Lys-40 by   glutamine or arginine decreases binding affinity by 1300-fold   (Lee & Vallee, 1989a) or 100-fold (Shapiro et al., 1989),   respectively.
In addition, PRI is a competitive inhibitor of   RNase A (Lee et al., 1989b) and therefore, presumably, of   angiogenin.
Measurement of the interaction of PRI with a   mixture of angiogenin derivatives carboxymethylated at either   His- 13 or His- 1 14 revealed a 15-fold increase in Ki (Lee &   Vallee, 1989a), suggesting that these residues may also contact   activities by more than 1 order of magnitude (Harper &   Vallee, 1988).
The His-13 and His-1 14 mutants now provide   further evidence for this dependence, since they also show   parallel decreases in angiogenic and enzymatic activities.
  These results indicate, at the least, that a functional active site   is necessary for angiogenic activity.
Since numerous other   ribonucleolytic enzymes, including bovine RNase A, a human   tumor cell derived RNase (Shapiro et al., 1986a), and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, are not angiogenic (Fett et al., 1985;   J. W. Fett, personal communication), it is clear that RNase   activity per se does not confer angiogenicity.
Whether the   specific enzymatic action characteristic of angiogenin is sufficient to induce neovascularization remains an open question.
  The observed inhibition of angiogenin-induced angiogenesis   by the H13A and H114A mutants suggests several further   features of the biological mode of action of angiogenin.
Inhibition presumably reflects successful competition of the   mutant over the unmodified protein for some target.
This is   most easily understood in terms of specific interaction with   target cells, e.g., via a receptor, rather than with a diffusible   substance which angiogenin might convert to an angiogenic   the inhibitor.
The present study, however, demonstrates that   neither histidine participates in a major interaction with PRI   since the H13A derivative binds with a Ki value slightly lower   than that obtained with unmodified angiogenin and the Ki   value for the H114A derivative is only -3-fold higher.
Thus,   product. (If such an extracellular substrate were involved, it   would have to be present at concentrations similar to or lower   than that of angiogenin itself in order for inhibition to be   observed.) Recent studies have shown that angiogenin does   indeed act directly on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle   the substantial increase resulting from carboxymethylation   may have reflected interference by the negative carboxymethyl   groups.
  One of the most compelling reasons for preparing and   studying mutants of angiogenin is to gain insight into its biological action.
In this regard, the relationship between the   angiogenic and ribonucleolytic activities of angiogenin has been   a critical issue.
Previous studies have strongly suggested that   the former activity is dependent on the latter.
Thus, both   cells in culture, rapidly eliciting a variety of transient responses.
  These include activation of phospholipase C, resulting in an   increase in 1,2-diacylglycerol levels (Bicknell & Vallee, 1988;   Moore & Riordan, 1989), and activation of phospholipase A*,   thereby stimulating prostacyclin secretion (Bicknell & Vallee,   1989).
It has not yet been determined whether there is a causal   relationship between these cellular effects and angiogenesis.
  However, preliminary results (R. Bicknell, personal communication; Fox & Riordan, 1989) with the H13A, H114A, and   activities are abolished by binding of PRI (Shapiro & Vallee,   1987) and mutation of Lys-40 to glutamine (Shapiro et al.,   other mutants suggest that alterations in responses in vivo and   in vitro closely parallel one another.
Role of Histidines in Angiogenin   Angiogenesis inhibition by the His - Ala mutants clearly   indicates that binding of angiogenin to the appropriate receptor   or target molecule is not sufficient to induce angiogenesis.
  Either the catalytic action of angiogenin is required or else   binding of angiogenin to its target must induce a conformational or chemical change that in some other manner depends   on both histidines.
These two possibilities cannot be distinguished at present.
The fact that independent mutations of   four active-site residues-His- 13, Lys-40, His-1 14, and Asp1 16-affect enzymatic and angiogenic activities similarly is   perhaps more readily understood if an actual catalytic event   is involved.
  The results of the competition experiments also indicate that   neither His-13 nor His-1 14 is involved in an interaction that   is critical in terms of the affinity of angiogenin for its target.
  Thus, even an equimolar amount of H13A-angiogenin is   sufficient to cause partial inhibition, and a relatively small   (5-20-fold) excess of either mutant inhibits completely.
  A major goal of angiogenin research has been the development of antagonists that may inhibit undesirable vascular   proliferation, such as in growth of solid tumors or neovascular   glaucoma (Vallee et al., 1985; Folkman & Klagsbrun, 1987).
  The homology between angiogenin and pancreatic RNase   suggested that PRI might bind tightly to angiogenin, and PRI   was indeed shown to inhibit angiogenesis on the chick embryo   CAM (Shapiro & Vallee, 1987).
A number of factors, however, may limit the therapeutic utility of this inhibitor, including its sensitivity to oxidation and inactivation by metals   (Blackburn et al., 1977) and its apparent tight binding to all   members of the alkaline RNase family, which are abundant   in most body compartments.
  The H13A and H114A mutant angiogenins provide an   alternative type of antagonist.
Since these derivatives appear   to compete with angiogenin for its target, they should have   much greater specificity.
In addition, they should be relatively   stable.
Further, it may be possible to obtain, either fortuitously   or by design, inactive mutants that will bind much more effectively than angiogenin itself.
  Finally, we note that the conclusions drawn above based on   the inactivity of angiogenin mutants are to some extent restricted by uncertainties regarding the three-dimensional   structures of these proteins.
Ideally, it would be desirable to   establish that the only difference in structure between unmodified and mutant proteins is at the position of the side chain   which is altered [see Gerlt (1987) and Knowles (1987) for   discussion of this issue].
X-ray crystallography has indicated   that this is the case for several proteins [e.g., see Howell et   al. (1986)l.
However, there is now at least one well-documented instance, involving staphylococcal nuclease (Hibler et   al., 1987; Wilde et al., 1988), in which minor changes in   active-site residues have produced unexpected conformational   changes as far away as 15-30 A. It is not known whether these   effects influence activity.
  The following pieces of evidence, taken together, strongly   suggest that for the angiogenin mutants under consideration   significant conformational changes are absent.
First, the three   disulfide bonds, involving widely separated regions of the   protein, have formed correctly (Figure 1).
The existence of   these disulfides greatly limits the extent of any possible conformational changes.
It may be noted that staphylococcal   nuclease, the protein in which such effects do occur, contains   149 amino acids and no disulfide bonds.
Second, the Mono   S and C18 HPLC elution times for both mutants are indistinguishable from those of angiogenin [see Shapiro et al.   (1989)l.
Third, the extremely tight binding of PRI, known   Biochemistry, Vol. 28, No. 18, 1989 7407   to involve the active site of angiogenin, is virtually unaffected   by the two mutations in question.
Fourth, the inactive H13A   and H114A mutants compete effectively with angiogenin in   the CAM assay, indicating a lack of significant structural   perturbations in that region of the protein responsible for   binding to its target.
Incontrovertible proof, however, must   await the determination of the three-dimensional structure of   angiogenin and its mutant derivatives by crystallography or   NMR.
In any event, these considerations have no bearing on   either the potential therapeutic utility of the H13A and H114A   mutants or the biological implications of their anti-angiogenic   capacity.
