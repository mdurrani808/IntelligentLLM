M605986200  Mahua Ghosh  , Gregor Meiss  , Alfred M. Pingoud  , Robert E. London1, and Lars C. Pedersen  From the   Laboratory of Structural Biology, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709  and   Institut fur Biochemie (FB 08), Justus-Liebig-Universitat, Heinrich-Buff-Ring 58, D-35392 Giessen, Germany  Nonspecific, extracellular nucleases have received enhanced  attention recently as a consequence of the critical role that these  enzymes can play in infectivity by overcoming the host neutrophil defense system.
The activity of the cyanobacterial nuclease NucA, a member of the  Me superfamily, is controlled  by the specific nuclease inhibitor, NuiA. Here we report the  2.3-A resolution crystal structure of the NucA-NuiA complex, showing that NucA inhibition by NuiA involves an  unusual divalent metal ion bridge that connects the nuclease  with its inhibitor.
The C-terminal Thr-135NuiA hydroxyl oxygen is directly coordinated with the catalytic Mg2 of the  nuclease active site, and Glu-24NuiA also extends into the  active site, mimicking the charge of a scissile phosphate.
NuiA  residues Asp-75 and Trp-76 form a second interaction site, contributing to the strength and specificity of the interaction.
The  crystallographically defined interface is shown to be consistent  with results of studies using site-directed NuiA mutants.
This  mode of inhibition differs dramatically from the exosite mechanism of inhibition seen with the DNase colicins E7/E9 and from  other nuclease-inhibitor complexes that have been studied.
The  structure of this complex provides valuable insights for the  development of inhibitors for related nonspecific nucleases that  share the DRGH active site motif such as the Streptococcus  pneumoniae nuclease EndA, which mediates infectivity of this  pathogen, and mitochondrial EndoG, which is involved in  recombination and apoptosis.
  Nonspecific nucleases are involved in a broad range of functions that include extra- and intracellular digestion, programmed cell death, defense, replication, recombination, and  repair (13).
They also have proven useful for determining  nucleic acid structures, mapping mutations, studying the interaction of DNA and RNA with various ligands (4), and sequencing of RNA (5).
Most recently, an important role for these  nucleases in microbial infectivity has been demonstrated, based  on their ability to digest the DNA component of host neutrophil extracellular traps (6 8).
Consequently, these nucleases  are now recognized as significant drug targets, and information  related to the inhibition of these enzymes is of potential use for  inhibitor development.
As a result of their ability to degrade  nucleic acids nonspecifically, they also represent an endogenous toxic challenge.
Therefore, regulation of their activity is  critical for the cells that produce them.
  The  Me superfamily of nucleases (9) comprises nonspecific, structure-specific, and sequence-specific enzymes that  share a structurally conserved active site scaffold and utilize a  divalent metal ion.
They can be grouped according to sequence  motifs into three families: His-Cys box nucleases (e.g. I-PpoI  (10)), HNH nucleases (e.g. colicins E7 and E9 (11, 12) and  I-HmuI (13)), and DRGH nucleases (e.g.the extracellular nuclease from Serratia marcescens (14), the DNA entry nuclease  EndA from Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), the Syncephalastrum racemosum nuclease (16), nuclease C1 from Cunninghamella echinulata (17), yeast Nuc1 (18), mitochondrial EndoG  (19), and the Anabaena nuclease NucA (20)).
Whereas the  eukaryotic nucleases of the DRGH family represent the major  mitochondrial nuclease activity, the prokaryotic members of  this family are responsible for extracellular DNA degradation.
  Notably the DNA-entry nucleases EndA from Streptococcus  pneumoniae and the related Streptodornase (Sda1) from Streptococcus sp. allow their host organisms to escape from neutrophil extracellular traps by digesting the DNA scaffold of these  structures, thereby evading the first line of defense against  microbial infection in mammals (6 8).
  NucA, a member of the DRGH family, is one of the most  potent nucleases known, and it degrades both single- and double-stranded DNA and RNA.
Its activity is regulated by a potent  and specific protein inhibitor, NuiA, which forms a tight 1:1  complex with picomolar affinity (21).
The structure of the  active site is closely analogous to that of the Serratia nuclease  (22, 23), whereas the activity of the Serratia enzyme is dependent on the presence of cystine bonds and hence is determined  by the redox level of the medium (24).
A deletion analysis of  NuiA had suggested that N- and C-terminal residues, directly  or indirectly, are involved in the NucA-NuiA interaction (21).
  Nevertheless, the molecular basis for the strong inhibitory  interaction has not yet been determined.
  In comparison with the vast literature on proteinase inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors have received relatively little study.
  The most detailed investigations have focused on the Bacillus  amyloliquefaciens RNase (barnase) inhibitor (barstar) (25), the  RNase A inhibitor (26), and the immunity proteins that protect  Escherichia coli from the colicin DNase activity (27, 28).

8, pp. 56825690, February 23, 2007  Printed in the U.S.A.  5682 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282NUMBER 8FEBRUARY 23, 2007   by guest on March 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from sideration of the structures of these nuclease-inhibitor complexes, as well as the structure of the NucA-NuiA complex  determined in the present study, suggests few common modes  of inhibition.
  Here we present the crystal structure of NucA (28 kDa) in  complex with NuiA (15 kDa) at a resolution of 2.3 . Many of  the features of the NucA-NuiA complex are unique.
NuiA  interacts directly with residues in the active enzyme site displaying target site mimicry and interacting directly with the  active site Mg2 ion through coordination with the C-terminal  Thr-135Nui residue.
Binding of NuiA results in no significant  change of the backbone atoms of NucA (22) but does result in  several minor side chain rearrangements.
The structure of  NucA-complexed NuiA shows some differences relative to the  previously determined solution structure (29) of the uncomplexed inhibitor, primarily in the loop regions.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Protein Expression and PurificationThe recombinant  NucA construct, containing a D121A mutation to reduce activity and related cellular toxicity, lacking the N-terminal export  signal peptide, and containing an N-terminal His tag to facilitate purification, was produced as described previously (22).
  Recombinant NuiA, also containing an N-terminal His tag, was  similarly produced as described previously (29).
E. coli cells  containing the required plasmid were grown to mid-log phase  (A600  0.6) at 37 C in LB medium containing 30 g/ml kanamycin.
NuiA protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 C for 6 h. Cells were  harvested by centrifugation (at 7000  g), resuspended in 20  mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and lysed by sonication  with a Branson Sonifier 200 using a Microtip probe.
The lysate  was centrifuged at 30,000  g for 40 min.
The supernatant was  applied to a Ni2-NTA2 resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with  extraction buffer and eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100  mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole.
The eluted fractions containing  NuiA protein were then concentrated using a Millipore concentrator to a desired volume of 10 ml (10 mg/ml concentration) and applied to the Superdex-75 gel filtration 2.6  60-cm  column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM  NaCl.
The protein corresponding to the major absorbance peak  at 280 nm was found to be NuiA (98% purity) as judged by  SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Based on the same criteria, the purity of NucA was estimated to be 95%.
  The N-terminal His tags on both proteins were cleaved by  overnight incubation of the protein samples with thrombin  (Novagen) at a concentration of 50 units/100 ml at 4 C.
The  preparations were then once again passed through Ni2-NTA  resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200  mM NaCl to remove any residual His-tagged protein as well as  the cleaved N-terminal His tag.
After the cleavage reaction, the  N-terminal residue was glycine, so that the final construct corresponded to NucA 133, P34G (residues 34274).
Similarly,  the NuiA construct that resulted after the cleavage actually corresponded to NuiA M1S (residues 1135).
An additional glycine residue, which theoretically precedes Ser-1 after the  thrombin cleavage, was not observed, and hence has not been  assigned a position in the construct.
The two cleaved proteins  were then mixed together and applied to a Superdex-200 gel  filtration 2.6  60-cm column previously equilibrated with 50  mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, and 2 mM dithiothreitol.
  The peak corresponding to the NucA-NuiA complex was identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
  Determination of Inhibition ConstantsValues of Ki(app)  for the inhibition of NucA by NuiA were determined by  measuring the steady-state rate of supercoiled plasmid DNA  cleavage in the presence of varying NuiA concentrations  using an agarose gel assay.
Reactions were performed at 25 C  in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl,  1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.01% bovine serum albumin,  and 5 mM MnCl2 using a concentration of 5 pM NucA and 25  ng/l plasmid DNA.
Values for Ki(app) were calculated by fitting  the steady-state rates to Equation 1, which describes tightbinding inhibitors,    0  E  I  K  E  I  K  2  4EK  2E (Eq. 1)  where 0 is the steady-state rate of supercoiled plasmid DNA  cleavage in the absence of inhibitor, [E] is the active enzyme  concentration, [I] is the concentration of the inhibitor, and  is  the steady-state rate in the presence of inhibitor (30, 31).
  For mutations other than those involved in phosphate charge  mimicry and metal ion bridging, estimates of Ki(app) were calculated according to Equation 2 (30) by determining the rate of  supercoiled plasmid DNA cleavage by NucA (5 nM) in the  absence (v0) and presence (v) of inhibitor (25 nM).
  K  I  E1  /0  0/  1 (Eq. 2)  All DNA cleavage reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis  on 0.8% agarose gels in Tris borate-EDTA buffer followed by  ethidium bromide staining.
  Crystallization and Data CollectionThe NucA-NuiA complex purified by gel filtration chromatography was concentrated to 9 mg/ml and exchanged into 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100  mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol buffer.
Crystals of the protein  complex were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion  technique at 4 C by mixing 2 l of the protein solution with 2  l of the reservoir solution consisting of 100 mM MES, pH 5.5,  and 1721% PEG 6000.
The crystals were transferred to 100 mM  MES, pH 5.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 20% PEG 6000 buffer and  soaked in 100 mM MES, pH 5.5, 100 mM NaCl, 20% PEG 6000,  and 20% ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant.
  For data collection, crystals were flash-cooled by submersion  in liquid nitrogen and placed on the goniometer in a stream of  nitrogen gas cooled to  180 C.
A lower resolution data set was  collected at 2.9  using a Rigaku 007HF x-ray generator  equipped with a Saturn 92 detector.
A higher resolution data set  was then collected at 2.3  at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-ID beamline at the  Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.

  Structure Determination and RefinementThe crystal structure of NucA (PDB ID code 1ZM8 (22)) was used as the model  for molecular replacement using the 2.9- resolution data set.
  The program Molrep (32) from CCP4 (33) was used to calculate  phases by molecular replacement.
The model for NuiA was  built into the electron density following the trace of the NMR  structure for NuiA (PDB ID code 1J57 (29)) that had been  placed manually into the electron density.
The model was then  refined against the 2.3- data set by iterative cycles of model  building using the program O (34) and refinement using the  program CNS (35).
The quality of the final structure was  assessed using the programs Procheck (36) and Molprobity  (37).
The final model includes residues 34274 of NucA and  1135 of NuiA. The statistics for the data collection and results  from refinement are reported in Table 1.
The structure of the  NucA-NuiA enzyme complex has been submitted to the Protein Data Bank (2O3B).
  RESULTS  Crystal Structure of the NucA-NuiA ComplexThe crystal  structure of the NucA-NuiA complex was determined at 2.3-  resolution using recombinant NucA and NuiA expressed in  E. coli (Table 1).
A ribbon model representing the secondary  structure of the complex is shown in Fig. 1A.
As seen in the  previously determined structure of NucA (22), the secondary  structure is composed of 13 -helices and two -sheets.
The  root mean square deviation between the complexed and free  NucA structure (Fig. 1B) is 0.34  for all C atoms.
A divalent  metal ion is located in the active site of NucA, and two additional divalent metal ions were observed in the secondary metal  ion-binding site previously identified in the NucA structure  (22).
The coordination geometry of the active site metal ion  is consistent with Mg2, the endogenous catalytic metal.
  Alternatively, the identities of the two metal ions at the secondary site were found to be most  consistent with Ni2 ions.
These  were presumably acquired or  exchanged into the NucA molecule as a result of passage through  the Ni2-NTA column (38).
Consistent with the previously determined solution structure (29),  NuiA (Fig. 1B) consists of four helices and a central six-stranded  -sheet arranged as an  sandwich. Helices A, C, and D are positioned on one side of the central  -sheet, and the distorted helix B  is positioned on the other side.
  The three central strands of the  -sheet are located at the C terminus of the protein, and all six of the  strands are antiparallel.
Omitting  the poorly aligned region at the  end of helix 4 of NuiA (residues  7190), the root mean square  deviation for the backbone atoms  of the NuiA structure determined  in solution relative to that in the  crystallized NucA-NuiA complex  was 3.46 . We note that a more  FIGURE 1.

  Structure of NucA-NuiA Complex  5684 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282NUMBER 8FEBRUARY 23, 2007   by guest on March 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from recent structural calculation using the same data set in combination with the program CYANA (39, 40) resulted in much  closer agreement, with the root mean square deviation for  the full structure falling to 3.1 .3  In the previously determined structure of NucA, the secondary metal ion-binding site was found to constitute a lattice contact, with two carboxyl oxygen atoms of a Glu-136Nuc residue  on a symmetry-related NucA molecule making contact with  both metal ions in the secondary metal ion-binding site (22).
In  the structure of the NucA-NuiA complex, there is also a lattice  contact involving the secondary metal ion-binding site on  NucA and the Asp-87Nuiresidue of a second, symmetry-related  NuiA molecule.
  The NucA-NuiA InterfaceThe structure of NuiA can be  described as an open jaw biting into one side of the NucA  molecule in the complex (Fig. 1, C and D).
The Thr-135Nui and  Glu-24Nui residues of the upper jaw enter the NucA active site,  whereas Asp-75Nui and Trp-76Nui residues of the lower jaw  engulf a protruding section of the nuclease that includes a long  loop of NucA running from Arg-93Nuc into the beginning of  -strand 4 (Arg-122Nuc) (Fig. 2A).
Close contact is also made  with several residues on coaxial helices H (Thr-151NucAsn155Nuc) and I (Thr-158NucGln-172Nuc) of NucA, including  Asn-155Nuc and Glu-163Nuc (Fig. 2, B and C).
The major hydrogen-bonding and salt bridge interactions between NucA and  NuiA are summarized in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig. 2A.
  These include salt bridge interactions between Arg-93Nuc and  Glu-24Nui, Arg-93Nuc and the C-terminal Thr-135Nui carboxyl  oxygen, and Lys-101Nuc and Asp-75Nui in addition to a network  of direct and water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions.
  The solvent-accessible surface areas calculated individually are  10,200 2 for NucA and 7488 2 for NuiA. After complex formation, the buried solvent-accessible surface area at the interface is calculated to be 1391 2  .
  The substantial electrostatic contribution to the NucANuiA interaction is illustrated by the GRASP-generated surfaces in Fig. 3.
To reveal the electrostatic potential of the  interface, NucA is represented by its electrostatic surface,  whereas NuiA is represented by a ribbon diagram (Fig. 3A).
  The representation is reversd in Fig. 3B.
The electrostatic  representations in Fig. 3 are consistent with the entries in  Table 2, which include one acidic and five basic residues for  NucA and one basic and seven acidic residues for NuiA. This  electrostatic pattern is consistent with the proposal that, to a  significant extent, NuiA binds to NucA as a substrate mimic.
  The principal hydrophobic contributions to the interface  include Phe-97NucGlu-24Nui (methylenes), Pro-99Nuc  Trp-76Nui, and several other side chain interactions.
However, there is no concentration of hydrophobic residues in  the interface.
The structure of the complex also contains two  bound MES molecules, one of which contacts both NucA  and NuiA. Its primary contacts include Glu-92Nuc and  Arg-106Nui.
  Effect of NuiA Interface MutationsA previous deletion  mutant of NuiA demonstrated the importance of the C terminus for tight binding to NucA (21).
Our structural analysis confirms a critical role for Thr-135 of NuiA in NucA binding and  identifies this residue as being involved in a novel metal ion  bridge as part of the NucA-NuiA interface between the C-terminal end of NuiA and the NucA active site.
Deletion of the  C-terminal residue of NuiA (NuiA-135) resulted in a 600-fold  increase in the inhibition constant (Ki  ) relative to the value for  the wild type inhibitor (Table 3).
This result indicates the significance of metal ion bridging for tight binding of NuiA to  NucA. In addition, our structural analysis indicates that Glu24Nui is inserted into the active site of NucA, apparently mimicking the negative charge of the scissile phosphate.
To obtain  quantitative data on the contribution of this residue to the inhibition of NucA by NuiA we generated three mutants of the  inhibitor with a conservative (Asp), an isosteric (Gln), and a  nonconservative (Ala) amino acid substitution at this position  and determined the Ki values for these variants (Table 3).
The  Ki values obtained show the greatest increase (about 4 orders of  magnitude) for the nonconservative and the isosteric substitutions (variants E24A and E24Q), whereas a wild type-like Ki was  determined for variant E24D.
Thus, a conservative amino acid  exchange that preserves a negative charge at this position produces only a 3-fold increase in the inhibition constant (Table 3).
  Based on initial NMR (28) and subsequent crystallographic data indicating the involvement of residues in the  loop immediately preceding helix D of NuiA in the NucANuiA interface, we investigated the contributions of this  second interaction site by mutating residues Gln-74Nui, Asp75Nui, and Trp-76Nui.
Replacement of Asp-75Nui with asparagine or glutamic acid resulted in dramatically increased Ki  values (Table 3), consistent with an important contribution  of the Asp-75NuiLys-101Nuc salt bridge to the stability of  the complex.
The W76A mutation, which would be expected  to reduce the hydrophobic interaction surface with NucA  residues Pro-99Nuc and Thr-111Nuc, produced a weaker  effect, whereas the Q74A mutation produced the smallest  change in Ki (Table 3).
Interestingly, the double mutant  combining amino acid replacements Q74A and W76A was  found to result in a more significant loss of inhibitory  potency.
The greater effect of the Q74A/W76A double  mutant may result from an additional structural destabilization of this region of NuiA that also interferes with the Asp75NuiLys-101Nuc salt bridge.
  Active Site of NucA in the ComplexThe structure of the  NucA active site observed in the NucA-NuiA complex is essentially identical to that previously determined for isolated NucA  (Fig. 2C) (22).
It is characterized by similar divalent metal ion  coordination geometry and hydrogen bonding network.
The  only significant conformational changes within the NucA molecule upon binding NuiA to the active site were the rearrangements of the side chains of residues Arg-93Nuc and Asp-95Nuc.
  The catalytic divalent metal ion coordinates with both Asn155Nuc of NucA and with the OG1 atom of the C-terminal Thr135Nui (Fig. 2B), as well as with four water molecules.
The Thr135Nui OG1 ligand thus substitutes for the coordinated sulfate  oxygen ligand that was present in the structure of uncomplexed  NucA determined previously and has been suggested to be the  5-phosphate-binding site of the substrate (Fig. 2C) (22).

  Structure of NucA-NuiA Complex  5686 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282NUMBER 8FEBRUARY 23, 2007   by guest on March 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from catalytically important Arg-93Nuc residue, which is positioned  by an extensive secondary hydrogen bonding network, now  forms salt bridges with the Thr-135Nui terminal carboxylate  and with Glu-24Nui OE2.
The other important active site residue of NucA, Asn-155Nuc, which is the only NucA residue  directly coordinating the active site Mg2, also forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu-24Nui OE1 in the NucA-NuiA complex.
  The W1 water molecule, which is coordinated to the catalytic  metal and previously has been suggested to function as the catalytic nucleophile required to break the phosphodiester bond,  forms hydrogen bonds with Glu-24Nui and Thr-135Nui.
In summary, Glu-24Nui and Thr-135Nui apparently play a significant  role in forming the inhibitory complex by interacting with critical active site residues.
  Other active site residues, particularly His-124Nuc and Glu163Nuc, did not make direct contact with NuiA. Replacement of  the mutated Ala-121Nuc residue with a modeled Asp-121 residue increased the computed NucA-NuiA interface area, indicating that this residue may also contribute to complex formation but is apparently not an absolute requirement.
The side  chain of Asp-121 was modeled by adding the preferred rotamer.
  In this position there are no steric conflicts, and the OD1 atom  is 3.3  from OG1 of Ser-25Nui, 3.7  from NE of Arg-156Nuc,  and 3.8  from ND2 of Asn-155Nuc.
Thus, an Asp-121NucSer25Nui interaction may also contribute to the stability of the  complex.
  DISCUSSION  The structure of the NucA-NuiA complex presented here is  the first example of an inhibitor complex for a DNA/RNAnonspecific nuclease.
In the present structure, the C-terminal  threonine residue of NuiA inserts directly into the active site,  binds to the catalytic metal ion, and functionally replaces a  coordinated sulfate molecule previously observed in the structure of uncomplexed NucA (22).
As discussed previously, this  sulfate ion appeared to mimic the 5-phosphate group of the  cleaved product.
The structure of the NucA-NuiA complex is,  to the best of our knowledge, the first example in which the  catalytic divalent metal ion interacts directly with both a nuclease and an inhibitor protein.
In addition, one of the Glu-24Nui  OG oxygen atoms of NuiA occupies a position close to that of a  second sulfate oxygen in the uncomplexed NucA structure (22).
  Thus, the Glu-24Nui side chain presumably mimics the charge  of a DNA phosphate oxygen.
The quantitative importance of  the Glu-24NuiA and Thr-135NuiA residues to the inhibitory  potency of NuiA is indicated by mutational analyses demonstrating that the Ki value for the E24A mutant is increased by a  factor of 104  , and the value for the Thr-135Nui mutant is  increased by 600 (Table 3).
  Comparison of DNA and NuiA Binding by NucAWe previously obtained a useful model for the complex formed with  cleaved or uncleaved DNA by superposition of our NucA structure (22) with the reported structures for DNA-complexed Vvn  nuclease (1OUP) (41).
This superposition places the DNA  chain in a reasonable position relative to the catalytic groups of NucA.  The 5-terminal phosphate group of  a hydrolyzed DNA substrate was  found to superpose closely with the  sulfate anion observed in the NucA  structure (22).
The superposition  shown in Fig. 4 compares the NucADNA complex modeled as described previously with the NucANuiA complex obtained in the  present study.
Based on this comparison, oxygen atoms of Glu-24Nui  and Thr-135Nui in NuiA occupy the  position of the scissile phosphate of  the Vvn DNA product complex.
  Note in particular the similar relative positions of the 5-phosphate  FIGURE 3.

Additionally, the Thr-135Nui carboxyl group  appears to be positioned near a bridging phosphate from the  3-terminus of the cleaved DNA.
The carbonyl oxygen of Glu24Nui is also positioned fairly close to an oxygen atom in a bridging phosphate group at the 5-side of the cleaved DNA.
Thus,  there is a more general mimicry of cleaved DNA by the NuiA  inhibitor.
  Comparison with Other Nuclease-Inhibitor ComplexesAlthough nucleases have often been suggested as drug targets (8,  42, 43), there is considerably less information on nuclease-inhibitor complexes than is available for proteinase-inhibitor  complexes.
Comparisons among these diverse structures reveal  limited homologies.
In general, the active sites of the nucleases  are matched to the hydrophilic properties of the nucleic acid  substrates so that inhibitors that mimic the substrates will  exhibit analogous hydrophilic interactions.
  The ribonuclease A-inhibitor complex studied by Kobe and  Deisenhofer (26) is characterized by a largely hydrophilic interface, which relies primarily on electrostatic interactions.
  Although the inhibitor occupies most of the active site, it only  partially mimics the RNase-RNA interaction and does not utilize the p1 phosphate-binding pocket of ribonuclease A, where  a sulfate ion remains bound.
In this example, the inhibitor  forms a large, concave surface, which surrounds the ribonuclease so that a large contact area compensates for more modest  shape complementarity (26).
The barnase-barstar complex is  the most extensively studied example of nuclease inhibition.
  Similar to the NucA-NuiA interface, the barstar-barnase interaction also relies primarily on electrostatic interactions (44).
  Barnase is base-selective, hydrolyzing at the 3-end of  guanosine in RNA, and also lacks a catalytic metal ion.
  Although NuiA mimics DNA using residues located at the edge  of the central -sheet, barstar inserts helix 2 into the active  site of barnase (Fig. 5A) so that most of the interactions involve  residues on and immediately preceding 2.
Asp-39 on this helix  mimics the charge of the scissile phosphate group, interacting  with barnase residues Arg-83 and Arg-87.
Barstar residues  Thr-42 and Gly-43 at the end of helix 2 form hydrogen bonds  with barnase residues Lys-27 and Arg-83, respectively (Fig. 5B).
  Barnase residue Arg-59, which forms a salt bridge with barstar  Glu-76, is repositioned to stack against the G2 base in the  nucleotide complex.
Base A3, which stacks against barnase residue His-102, is replaced by barstar residue Tyr-29 in the inhibitor complex (Fig. 5B).
Other significant actions that characterize the predominantly electrostatic barnase-barstar interface  are summarized in Buckle et al. (Ref.
44, Table 2 therein).
  Another excellent example of molecular mimicry by an  inhibitor interacting with an enzyme acting on DNA is provided by the uracil DNA glycosylase-inhibitor complex, UDGUgi (45).
The interacting surfaces display near perfect electrostatic and shape complementarity.
A negatively charged ridge  of the Ugi -sheet binds to the positively charged DNA-binding  site of UDG, thereby preventing access of the DNA substrate to  the enzyme.
Mimicry of the phosphate backbone of DNA has  been discovered in a range of other  proteins interacting with DNA (46).
  The E. coli colicin DNase has  been classified as a member of the   Me superfamily so that its  inhibition by the E. coli immunity  proteins might be considered to  more closely approximate the  mode of inhibition of NucA by  NuiA observed here.
However, in  sharp contrast with the barnase  and ribonuclease A-inhibitor  complexes that involve direct  insertion of the inhibitor protein  into the active site, inactivation of  the colicin DNase domains by the  immunity proteins is more indirect, blocking critical binding  interactions without directly filling the active site (47).
  Unlike barstar, which uses interactions from an -helix to mimic  FIGURE 4.
Modeled DNA interaction positioned in the NuiA-NucA complex.
The extent to which NuiA  mimics the substrate is illustrated by this stereo view of a docked model of a cleaved DNA octamer in the active  site of NucA. Selected residues from NucA and NuiA are indicated in lavender and green, respectively.
The  model is based on the alignment of active site residues in the NucA structure (Arg-122Ile-125 and Met-147  Arg-156) with active site residues in the structure of Vvn in complex with DNA (Trp-78 Val-81 and Leu-119   Gly-128; PDB ID code 1OUP).
The coordination of the active site Mg2 (green) to four water molecules as well as  to Asn-155Nuc (lavender) and to a phosphate oxygen of the cleaved DNA strand (yellow) is indicated.
The  complementary strand of the DNA is shown in blue.

  Structure of NucA-NuiA Complex  5688 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282NUMBER 8FEBRUARY 23, 2007   by guest on March 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from DNA binding, the unique feature of the structure of the NucANuiA complex appears to be the insertion of the C-terminal  Thr-135NuiA from the end of a -sheet into the active site.
This  complexation effectively mimics the interaction of the DNA  with the catalytic metal ion.
Although this type of interaction  does not appear to have been reported for other nucleaseinhibitor complexes, a copper-mediated binding interaction  between two proteins has recently been reported (48).
In contrast to the NucA-NuiA complex, the Cu(I) ion mediates the  reversible formation of a weak complex involving the copper  chaperone Atx1 and the copper-binding domain of the Ccc2  ATPase.
  The Second Metal-binding SiteAs noted previously, NucA  contains a second metal ion-binding site remote from the active  site, which is capable of binding two divalent metal ions (22).
  Based on the structural parameters observed for this site, it  appears to have picked up two Ni2 ions from the nickel column used to purify the enzyme.
In the previous study of NucA,  this site contained either two Zn2 ions, when the enzyme was  crystallized in the presence of 10 mM ZnCl2, or two Mn2 ions,  after incubation of the enzyme with Mn2. Interestingly, in  both the previous structure of NucA as well as the present  NucA-NuiA complex, the second metal-binding site is positioned at a lattice contact, although with a different molecule in  each case.
In both cases, a carboxylate ligand from a symmetryrelated molecule interacts such that each carboxylate oxygen  atom binds to a different metal ion.
Although the role of the  second divalent ion-binding site is unknown, its ability to support intermolecular complex formation suggests that metals  may play a role in regulating NucA interactions with other proteins, possibly by anchoring NucA to the periplasm.
Given that,  as noted previously, this second metal site does not appear to be  shared by other nucleases in the  Me nuclease family, it may  represent a unique mechanism for cellular localization of  NucA.  Comparison with Chemical Shift Mapping ResultsThe  identification of the NuiA interface on the basis of the crystal  structure of the NucA-NuiA complex is in reasonable agreement with the previous identification using chemical shift mapping (29).
In that study, the NuiA residues Leu-20Nui, Met22Nui, Ser-68Nui, Gln-74Nui, Trp-76Nui, Leu-107Nui, Gly-108Nui,  Glu-109Nui, Val-133Nui, and Glu-134Nui were identified as  being near the interface on the basis of the amide shift differences observed between uncomplexed and NucA-complexed  NuiA, although the NuiA resonances corresponding to the  complex were not fully assigned (29).
Examination of the structure of the NucA-NuiA complex indicates that most of these  residues are positioned in or near the interface.
In several  instances, residues adjacent to interacting residues are identified, probably because of the use of the amide shift as the  reporter group rather than the resonances of the interacting  side chain.
For example, the Gln-74Nui and Trp-76Nui amides  were identified, whereas the Asp-75Nui side chain carboxyl  forms a salt bridge with NucA. Similarly, the amides of Val133Nui and Glu-134Nui were identified as part of the interface,  although Thr-135Nui interacts most directly with the active site.
  Despite these limitations
, the chemical shift mapping approach  appears to have done a reasonable job of identifying the NuiA  interface.
  The structure of the NucA-NuiA complex presented here  provides unique insights into the basis for inhibition of sugar  nonspecific nucleases of the  Me nuclease superfamily.
  Despite the significant cellular toxicity that expression of this  class of enzymes can pose, little is known about how their activity is controlled; the nuclease-inhibitor complex reported here  defines a structural basis for achieving such control.

44 (see Table 2 therein) are explicitly shown.
This figure shows in particular how barstar residue Asp-39 mimics the scissile phosphate (purple) group  in the active site, interacting with barnase residues Arg-87 and Arg-83.
Barnase residue Arg-59, which in the figure forms a salt bridge with barstar Glu76, is repositioned in the nucleotide complex to stack against the G2 base.
  Base A3, which stacks against barnase residue His-102, is replaced by barstar  residue Tyr-29 in the inhibitor complex.

Based on the recently discovered role of similar nucleases  as mediators of infectivity, resulting from their ability to destroy  the DNA scaffold of neutrophil extracellular traps, these nucleases have emerged as potential drug targets (6 8).
Hence, an  understanding of the structural basis for the inhibition of these  enzymes will be of increasing importance for the development  of strategies to deal with infective microorganisms.
