  A Virus-Binding Hot Spot on Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2  Is Critical for Binding of Two Different Coronaviruses  Kailang Wu,1 Lang Chen,1 Guiqing Peng,1 Wenbo Zhou,2 Christopher A.

Geraghty,2 and Fang Li1  *  Department of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota 554551  ; Center for Drug Design,  University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 554552  ; Cancer Center, Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota,  Minneapolis, Minnesota 554553  ; and Institute for Molecular Virology and Departments of Diagnostic and  Biological Sciences and Microbiology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota 554554  Received 29 October 2010/Accepted 2 March 2011  How viruses evolve to select their receptor proteins for host cell entry is puzzling.
We recently determined  the crystal structures of NL63 coronavirus (NL63-CoV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) receptor-binding  domains (RBDs), each complexed with their common receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  (hACE2), and proposed the existence of a virus-binding hot spot on hACE2.
Here we investigated the function  of this hypothetical hot spot using structure-guided biochemical and functional assays.
The hot spot consists  of a salt bridge surrounded by hydrophobic tunnel walls.
Mutations that disturb the hot spot structure have  significant effects on virus/receptor interactions, revealing critical energy contributions from the hot spot  structure.
The tunnel structure at the NL63-CoV/hACE2 interface is more compact than that at the SARSCoV/hACE2 interface, and hence RBD/hACE2 binding affinities are decreased either by NL63-CoV mutations  decreasing the tunnel space or by SARS-CoV mutations increasing the tunnel space.
Furthermore, NL63-CoV  RBD inhibits hACE2-dependent transduction by SARS-CoV spike protein, a successful application of the hot  spot theory that has the potential to become a new antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV infections.
These  results suggest that the structural features of the hot spot on hACE2 were among the driving forces for the  convergent evolution of NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV.  Host receptor recognition by viruses is the first and essential  step for viral infections.
During the long history of evolutionary  battles between viruses and hosts, viruses have evolved complex strategies for their receptor selections (2).
Despite tremendous efforts to understand these strategies, the current  picture of how viruses recognize their host receptors is still  murky.
Viruses exploit a wide variety of host cell surface molecules as their receptors.
In addition to serving as receptors for  viruses, these molecules are implicated in various host physiological functions such as cell adhesion, immune response,  signaling pathways, proteolysis, and ion transport.
On one  hand, several viruses can share one host receptor.
For example,  coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor, an immunoglobulin (Ig)  superfamily member, is the receptor for both coxsackieviruses  and adenoviruses (3).
On the other hand, one virus can recognize several different host receptors.
For example, herpes simplex viruses use one of at least three protein receptors: HVEM,  which is a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member (23),  and nectin-1 and nectin-2, both of which are Ig superfamily  members (8, 31).
Understanding the pattern of host receptor  recognition by viruses has important implications for viral evolution, pathogenesis, host range, tropism, cross-species infections, emerging viral epidemics, and virus-mediated gene targeting.
  A key question regarding the evolution of host receptor  recognition by viruses is what features of these receptor molecules make them targeted by viruses.
The receptors for viruses can be proteins, carbohydrates, or lipids (2).
Compared  with carbohydrates and lipids, protein receptors in general  have more structural features and thus are engaged in morespecific and high-affinity binding interactions with viruses; they  are the focus of this study.
Among protein receptors, some  (such as cell adhesion molecules) are more abundant than  others (such as proteases and ion transporters).
Although the  availability of abundant protein receptors to viruses is probably  one of the reasons why they were selected by viruses as receptors (30), it is not clear whether receptor proteins, especially  nonabundant receptor proteins, contain any structural features  that make them targeted by viruses.
  The structural features of receptor proteins can be identified  from the atomic structures of virus/receptor interfaces.
Defined structural and functional receptor-binding domains  (RBDs) have been identified in many viral surface glycoproteins.
One or more receptor-binding motifs (RBMs) on these  viral RBDs mediate the interactions with their receptor proteins.
To date several crystal structures are available for viral  RBDs complexed with their receptor proteins (1, 4, 5, 13, 18,  32, 33).
Among these structures, only two reveal how different  viral RBDs can bind to their common receptor protein: the  structures of NL63 coronavirus (NL63-CoV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RBDs, each complexed with their  common receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  (hACE2) (18, 32).
Both NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV are important human viral pathogens.
The former causes prevalent  respiratory diseases (6, 29), whereas the latter was responsible  * Corresponding author.

Coronavirus  spike glycoproteins are envelope-anchored clove-shaped trimers (16).
Each spike trimer contains three monomeric S1  heads, which function in receptor binding, and a trimeric S2  stalk, which functions in fusing the viral envelope and host  membrane.
NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV RBDs are located in  the S1 heads of their respective spike proteins.
There is no  structural homology in their RBD core structures or RBMs  (Fig. 1).
The core structures of NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV  RBDs are a two-layer -sandwich and a single-layer -sheet,  respectively; the RBMs of NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV are  three discontinuous short loops and one continuous long  subdomain, respectively.
Nevertheless, the two viral RBDs  bind to the same three virus-binding motifs (VBMs) on  hACE2 (18, 32).
  Our previous structural studies led to the hypothesis that a  virus-binding hot spot exists on hACE2 and plays an important  role in the binding of both NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV (32).
  This hypothetical hot spot consists of a critical Lys353-Asp38  salt bridge on hACE2, which is surrounded by four hydrophobic tunnel walls (Fig. 2A and B).
Two of the tunnel walls, Tyr41  (top wall) and Asp37 (right wall), are contributed by hACE2,  whereas the other two tunnel walls are contributed by the  viruses: Tyr498 (bottom wall) and Ser535 (left wall) from  NL63-CoV and Tyr491 (bottom wall) and Thr487 (left wall)  from SARS-CoV. Details of how this hypothetical hot spot  may contribute to the virus/receptor interactions are unknown.
  In this study we use structure-guided biochemical and functional approaches to investigate the role of each of the components of the hot spot structure in the virus/receptor interactions.
We then apply the hot spot theory to the development of  FIG. 1.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Protein expression and purification.
Soluble proteins, including NL63-CoV  RBD (residues 461 to 616), SARS-CoV RBD (residues 306 to 527), and hACE2  peptidase domain (residues 19 to 615), were expressed and purified as previously  described (17, 18, 32).
In brief, the proteins were expressed in insect cells using  the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies Inc.).
Each expression construct (Invitrogen) contained an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal sequence and a  C-terminal His tag sequence.
Mutations were introduced by PCR site-directed  mutagenesis to the expression constructs.
Recombinant baculoviruses were generated and amplified in Sf9 insect cells.
The protein to be purified was harvested  from Sf9 cell supernatants, loaded onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)  column, eluted from the Ni-NTA column with 0.5 M imidazole, and further  purified by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare).
  Fractions containing the purified protein were pooled together, loaded into an  Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (10,000-molecular-weight [MW] cutoff)  (Millipore), and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm until the protein concentration  reached 10 mg/ml.
  RBD/hACE2 binding assays.
Surface plasmon resonance assays were carried  out using a Biacore 2000 as previously described (32).
In brief, to measure the  affinities for binding between mutant viral RBDs and wild-type hACE2, hACE2  was immobilized on a C5 sensor chip through direct covalent coupling via amine  groups.
The surface of the sensor chip was activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide  (NHS), the receptor was injected and immobilized to the surface of the chip, and  the remaining activated surface of the chip was blocked with ethanolamine.
  Soluble RBDs were introduced at a flow rate of 20 l/min at different concentrations (62.5 nM, 125 nM, and 250 nM).
The on rate (kon), the off rate (koff), and  the dissociation constant (Kd) were determined for the RBD/receptor binding  interactions using BIA-EVALUATIONS software.
To measure the affinities for  binding between mutant hACE2 and wild-type viral RBDs, RBDs were immobilized on the sensor chip and hACE2 was the soluble analyte.
As negative  controls, soluble RBDs or hACE2 was passed through an empty sensor chip and  buffer alone was passed through sensor chips containing RBDs or hACE2 as  immobilized ligands.
  Transduction assays with pseudotyped virus.
Transduction was assayed using  murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) expressing -galactosidase and pseudotyped  with NL63-CoV or SARS-CoV spike protein.
To prepare pseudotyped viruses,  HEK293T cells were cotransfected with spike protein-encoding pcDNA3.1 and  MLV -galactosidase-transducing vector pBAG (25).
At 2 days posttransfection,  viral supernatants were harvested and concentrated in a spin concentrator.
Approximately 4 ml of supernatant was typically concentrated (10,000-MW cutoff)  to between 100 to 200 l. HEK293T cells transiently expressing hACE2 in  pcDNA3.1 were inoculated in 96-well dishes by adding 5 l of concentrated viral  supernatant to 50 l cell culture medium per well.
Transduction efficiency was  quantified 2 days later by measuring -galactosidase activity.
The inoculated cells  were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% NP-40 and 3  mg/ml o-nitrophenyl--D-glucopyranoside and monitored by spectrometry (optical density at 410 nm [OD410]).
The intracellular C termini of the spike protein  and hACE2 contained a C9 tag and a hemagglutinin (HA) tag, respectively.
The  concentrations of the spike protein packaged in pseudotyped viruses and of  hACE2 expressed on the HEK293T cell surface were detected by Western  blotting using anti-C9 and anti-HA antibodies, respectively.
As a negative control, the plasmid expressing the spike protein was replaced by a plasmid that does  not express any protein.
  RESULTS  To investigate the role of the hot spot structure in the virus/  receptor binding interactions, we mutated each of the components of the hot spot structure.
We then examined how the  mutations affect the affinities for binding between RBDs and  hACE2 using surface plasmon resonance Biacore assays.
We  also investigated how the mutations impact the interactions  between spike proteins and hACE2 by transduction assays  using pseudotyped virus.
  For Biacore assays, we first measured the affinities for binding between the wild-type hACE2 peptidase domain and prototypic NL63-CoV RBD (strain Amsterdam 1) and between  the wild-type hACE2 peptidase domain and prototypic SARSCoV RBD (strain Tor2, which was isolated during the 2002 to  2003 SARS epidemic).
hACE2 was immobilized on the Biacore sensor chip through direct covalent coupling via amine  groups, and NL63-CoV or SARS-CoV RBD was injected over  the chip as the soluble analyte.
The measured Kd for SARSCoV RBD and hACE2 binding was 20.8 nM (Fig. 3A), consistent with the Kd of 16.2 nM measured in a previous study  (19).
The measured Kd for NL63-CoV RBD and hACE2 binding was 34.9 nM (Fig. 3A), the first reported Kd for binding  between the two proteins.
The same RBD fragment used in  this study (residues 461 to 616) also bound to hACE2 with high  affinity in a previous study using a coimmunoprecipitation  analysis (21).
Interestingly, although SARS-CoV and NL63-  CoV RBDs had similar Kds for binding with hACE2, NL63-  CoV RBD bound to hACE2 with significantly lower koff and  kon.
It has been shown that koff and kon are dictated by shortrange van der Waals interactions and long-range electrostatic  interactions between the proteins, respectively (26).
Therefore,  the lower koff and kon of the NL63-CoV-RBD/hACE2 complex  likely reflected a less electrostatic and more hydrophobic interface between the two proteins.
  Using Biacore, we also measured the affinities for binding  between hACE2 and NL63-CoV RBD and between hACE2  and SARS-CoV RBD in a reverse way: NL63-CoV or SARSCoV RBD was immobilized on the sensor chip, and hACE2  FIG. 3.

The measured  Kds were 68.0 nM for NL63-CoV RBD and hACE2 and 137  nM for SARS-CoV RBD and hACE2, both of which were  higher than when hACE2 was immobilized (Fig. 3A).
Such  discrepancies in measured Kd were mostly due to the differences in measured kon.
No matter whether hACE2 or RBDs  were immobilized, koffs remained similar.
When hACE2 was  immobilized, however, kon was significantly higher.
Why did  kon increase when hACE2, instead of RBDs, was immobilized?  This is because hACE2 has a larger molecular weight than  either of the RBDs, and thus when immobilized, hACE2 can  provide more accessible surface area for complex formation,  leading to higher kon.
Therefore, the surface accessibility of the  immobilized protein, but not the dissociation rate, accounted  for the discrepancies in measured Kd.
  To evaluate how mutations of the hot spot structure affect  the affinities for binding between RBDs and hACE2, we introduced single mutations to either RBDs or hACE2 that modified every component of the hot spot structure.
These mutations were K353A, D38A, D37A, Y41A, and Y41F in hACE2,  Y498A, S535A, and S535T in NL63-CoV RBD, and Y491A,  T487A, and T487S in SARS-CoV RBD (Fig. 2A and B).
We  expressed and purified each of the 11 hACE2 and RBD mutants.
To measure the affinities for binding between mutant  RBDs and wild-type hACE2, hACE2 was immobilized on the  sensor chip and mutant RBDs were the soluble analytes.
To  measure the affinities for binding between wild-type RBDs and  mutant hACE2, NL63-CoV or SARS-CoV RBD was immobilized on the sensor chip and mutant hACE2 was the soluble  analyte.
The results were then compared with the affinities for  binding between wild-type hACE2 and wild-type RBDs (Fig.  3B and C).
  In this study we not only measured direct interactions between viral RBDs and hACE2 using recombinant proteins but  also examined the spike/receptor interactions using functional  assays.
To this end, we carried out transduction assays with  pseudotyped virus to investigate whether changes in RBD/  hACE2 interactions could lead to corresponding changes in  viral entry and membrane fusion in the context of the fulllength spike proteins and their receptor protein.
We prepared  retroviral MLVs expressing -galactosidase and pseudotyped  with NL63-CoV or SARS-CoV spike protein.
These MLVs  were incubated with hACE2-expressing HEK293T cells.
The  transduction efficiency of the pseudotyped viruses was measured by determining -galactosidase activity of inoculated cell  lysate.
To measure the interactions between wild-type hACE2  and mutant spike proteins or between mutant hACE2 and  wild-type spike proteins, we introduced single mutations to  hACE2 or the spike proteins that were the same as the mutations used for Biacore assays (Fig. 4A and B).
The expression  levels of the spike proteins in pseudotyped viruses and of  hACE2 molecules on HEK293T cells were detected by Western blotting using antibodies against their intracellular C-terminal C9 and HA tags, respectively.
The Western blotting  results showed that all of the mutant spike proteins and mutant  hACE2 molecules were well expressed, and the expression  levels of these mutant proteins were quantified and calibrated  against those of the wild-type proteins (Fig. 4C).
Finally, the  measured transduction efficiencies for mutant spike proteins  and mutant hACE2 were normalized against the transduction  efficiency of viruses pseudotyped with wild-type spike proteins  in cells expressing wild-type hACE2 (Fig. 4).
  Both Biacore assays and transduction assays with pseudotyped virus yielded results that were highly consistent with  each other (Fig. 3 and 4; Tables 1 and 2).
It is worth noting that  recombinant SARS-CoV and NL63-CoV RBDs are both  monomers in solution, whereas the full-length spike proteins  are trimers on virus surfaces (14).
Thus, the good correlation  FIG. 4.

Transduction efficiency of the pseudotyped viruses  was measured by -galactosidase assays.
After mutations were introduced into the spike proteins or hACE2, the corresponding transduction efficiency was normalized against the transduction efficiency of  viruses pseudotyped with wild-type spike proteins in cells expressing  wild-type hACE2.

   on May 24, 2015 by guest http://jvi.asm.org/ Downloaded from between the RBD/hACE2 binding affinities and the spikemediated transduction efficiency strongly suggests that the  measured RBD/hACE2 binding activities reflect the native  states of the proteins.
Our results showed that all of the targeted mutations produced significantly reduced RBD/hACE2  binding affinities and spike-guided transduction compared with  those for the corresponding wild-type proteins (t test; P  0.01  for both Ka and transduction), with the exception of D37A in  hACE2 (P  0.075 for transduction) and Y498 in NL63-CoV  RBD (P  0.10 for both Ka and transduction).
Here we combine these biochemical and functional data with our previous  structural data and discuss molecular and structural features of  the virus-binding hot spot that make hACE2 a common target  by two different viruses.
  The hot spot structures at the NL63-CoV/hACE2 and  SARS-CoV/hACE2 interfaces have many common features.
  The Lys353-Asp38 salt bridge plays a central role in the hot  spot structure at both of the interfaces.
Because of the hydrophobic environment, the salt bridge not only provides a significant amount of energy to the virus/receptor binding interactions but also fills a critical void in the hydrophobic stacking  interactions at the virus/receptor interfaces.
Correspondingly,  alanine substitution for either Lys353 or Asp38 in hACE2  significantly decreased the RBD/hACE2 binding affinities and  viral transductions (Fig. 3 and 4).
The hydrophobic tunnel  walls of the hot spot structure also make important contributions to the virus/receptor binding interactions; they not only  support the side chain of Lys353 to form the salt bridge but  also provide hydrophobic stacking interactions at the virus/  receptor interfaces.
Some hydrophobic tunnel walls contribute  more energy to the virus/receptor binding interactions than  others (Fig. 3 and 4).
For example, Tyr41 in hACE2 (top wall)  is more important than Asp37 in hACE2 (right wall), probably  because Tyr41 functions better as a tunnel wall with its aromatic ring.
Alanine substitution for Tyr41 significantly decreased RBD/hACE2 binding affinities and viral transductions,  suggesting that the stacking interaction between Tyr41 and  Lys353 is essential for the hot spot structure.
Interestingly,  although a phenylalanine at the 41 position can potentially  function as a tunnel wall with its aromatic ring, the Y41F  mutation also significantly decreased RBD/hACE2 binding affinities and viral transductions.
Detailed structural analysis reveals that the hydroxyl group of Tyr41 forms a hydrogen bond  with receptor Asp355 at the NL63-CoV/hACE2 interface and  two hydrogen bonds with receptor Asp355 and RBD Thr486 at  the SARS-CoV/hACE2 interface (Fig. 2A and B).
Thus, the  side chain of Tyr41 needs to be firmly anchored in order for it  to function properly as a tunnel wall.
Residue 41 is a histidine  in the ACE2 proteins from several bat species (10).
Not only is  His41 a poor hydrophobic stacker, but also it cannot be anchored properly to function as a tunnel wall.
As a result, these  bat ACE2 proteins were poor receptors for human SARS-CoV  strains unless an H41Y mutation was introduced (10).
Overall,  the salt bridge and many of the tunnel walls of the hot spot  structure contribute energy to the virus/receptor binding interactions.
  The hot spot structures at the NL63-CoV/hACE2 and  SARS-CoV/hACE2 interfaces differ in a subtle but functionally important way.
The tunnel structure at the NL63-CoV/  hACE2 interface is more compact than that at the SARS-CoV/  hACE2 interface (Fig. 2A and B).
At the NL63-CoV/hACE2  interface, the closest distances between the two pairs of opposing tunnel walls, Ser535-Asp37 (left to right) and Tyr41-  Tyr498 (top to bottom), are 8.5  and 7.7 , respectively.
At  the SARS-CoV/hACE2 interface, if a serine replaces threonine at the 487 position in SARS-CoV RBD, these distances  become 9.0  and 8.1 , respectively.
Because of the compactness of the tunnel structure at the NL63-CoV/hACE2 interface, S535T mutation in NL63-CoV RBD decreased the tunnel  space and was energetically unstable (Fig. 3B and 4A).
In  contrast, because of the extra space of the tunnel structure at  the SARS-CoV/hACE2 interface, T487S mutation in SARSCoV RBD increased the tunnel space but was also energetically unstable (Fig. 3C and 4B).
Indeed, residue 487 was a  serine in RBDs of some low-pathogenicity SARS-CoV strains  and was largely responsible for the lack of human-to-human  transmission of these viral strains (18, 19, 27).
Thus, although  S535T mutation in NL63-CoV RBD and T487S mutation in  SARS-CoV RBD exerted opposite effects on the same left  tunnel wall of the hot spot structure, they both reduced RBD/  hACE2 binding affinities and viral transductions.
For similar  reasons, compared with Tyr498 in NL63-CoV RBD, Tyr491 in  SARS-CoV RBD provides more support to the hot spot structure as the bottom tunnel wall in a more spacious tunnel space,  TABLE 1.

85, 2011 NL63 AND SARS VIRUSES TARGET A HOT SPOT ON HUMAN ACE2 5335   on May 24, 2015 by guest http://jvi.asm.org/ Downloaded from and hence alanine substitution for Tyr491 decreased RBD/  hACE2 binding affinities and viral transductions (Fig. 3 and 4).
  Therefore, the seemingly small differences in the hot spot  structure at the two virus/receptor interfaces not only have  significant impacts on virus/receptor binding interactions but  also have important epidemic implications.
  One of the direct implications of our study is the possibility  of using NL63-CoV RBD as an inhibitor to block SARS-CoV  infections, because NL63-CoV RBD can compete with SARSCoV for the common virus-binding hot spot on hACE2.
To test  this possibility, we inoculated MLVs pseudotyped with SARSCoV spike protein onto hACE2-expressing HEK293T cells in  the presence of various concentrations of purified NL63-CoV  RBD or SARS-CoV RBD (Fig. 5).
Transduction was shown as  a percentage of -galactosidase activity observed in the absence of any inhibitor.
The results showed that NL63-CoV  RBD indeed inhibited SARS-CoV spike-mediated transductions.
At 10 g/ml (0.47 M), NL63-CoV RBD inhibited  SARS-CoV spike-mediated transductions by over 80%.
This  method has the potential to become a new antiviral strategy  against SARS-CoV infections, as it represents the first case in  which SARS-CoV infection can be inhibited by a protein from  a different virus.
It also represents a successful application of  the common virus-binding hot spot theory derived from the  present study.
  DISCUSSION  Binding to the same hot spot on hACE2 was likely an outcome of convergent evolution by NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV.  Our study provides several lines of evidence to support this  notion.
First, despite no structural homology in their RBDs,  NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV both bind to the hot spot region  and form highly similar and energetically stable tunnel structures (Fig. 1 and 2).
Second, despite no structural homology in  their RBMs, both viruses insert an RBM loop between VBM2  and VBM3 on hACE2 (Fig. 1).
Third, despite being presented  by nonhomologous RBM loops, Ser535 in NL63-CoV RBD  and Thr487 in SARS-CoV RBD (Ser487 in RBDs of some  low-pathogenicity SARS-CoV strains) occupy identical positions as the left tunnel wall in the hot spot structure (Fig. 2A  and B) and contribute energy to the virus/receptor binding  interactions (Fig. 3 and 4).
Last, despite pointing in opposite  directions, Tyr498 in NL63-CoV RBD and Tyr491 in SARSCoV RBD also occupy identical positions as the bottom tunnel  wall in the hot spot structure (Fig. 2A and B).
These data  suggest that NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV likely evolved independent strategies to achieve the same functional goal, supporting a convergent evolutionary relationship between the  two viruses.
  The likely convergent evolution of NL63-CoV and SARSCoV was at least partly driven by the structural features of the  virus-binding hot spot on hACE2.
The general structural features of the hot spot favor virus binding: it is located in a region  on hACE2 that is furthest from the membrane, relatively flat,  free of glycosylation, and thereby easily accessible to viruses  (Fig. 1).
The detailed structural features of the hot spot, such  as its potential to form the energetically stable tunnel structure, also favor virus binding (Fig. 2A and B).
In the unbound  hACE2 structure, where structural restraints from viruses are  absent, Lys353 projects into solution; it does not form a salt  bridge with Asp38 or stack with Tyr41 or Asp37 (Fig. 2C) (15,  28).
Thus, the virus-binding hot spot is not preexistent or  preorganized on hACE2; instead, it is induced to form by virus  binding.
Therefore, while the hot spot is mainly an intrinsic  property of hACE2, it is also a dynamic structure and receives  structural contributions from both hACE2 and the viruses,  although the contributions from hACE2 are more pronounced.
  The virus-binding hot spot on hACE2 is likely different from  the hot spots for host protein/protein interactions.
Host protein partners have coevolutionary relationships (9, 11), and  hence hot spots for host protein/protein interactions are usually preexistent and preorganized in unbound host protein  structures (20, 22).
Viruses and receptors, however, do not  usually have such coevolutionary relationships; viruses evolve  to adapt to host receptors, but receptors do not evolve to adapt  to viruses.
Occasionally, however, if a virus exerts a large  enough impact on a host, the host receptor may evolve away  from virus binding (7).
So far the virus-binding hot spot on  hACE2 is not known for its interaction with any other host  proteins.
Overall, the potential of the hot spot region on  hACE2 to form energetically stable tunnel structures and some  general structural features of this region on the receptor surface were among the possible reasons why the hot spot was  exploited by two different viruses.

  FIG. 5.
Inhibition of SARS-CoV spike-mediated transduction by  NL63-CoV RBD.
MLVs pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike protein  were used to infect hACE2-expressing HEK293T cells in the presence  of various concentrations of purified NL63-CoV RBD, SARS-CoV  RBD, SARS-CoV RBD containing the T487S mutation, hACE2 (positive control), and bovine serum albumin (BSA; negative control).
  Transduction is shown as a percentage of -galactosidase activity observed in the absence of any inhibitor.
Each experiment was repeated  5 times.
The corresponding standard errors are shown.
The results  show that NL63-CoV can efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV spike-mediated transduction.
