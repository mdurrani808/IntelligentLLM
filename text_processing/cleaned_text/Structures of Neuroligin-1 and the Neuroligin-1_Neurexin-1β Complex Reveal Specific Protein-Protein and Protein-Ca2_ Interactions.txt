Neuroligins specify synapses in an  activity-dependent manner, presumably by binding to neurexins.
Here, we present the crystal  structures of neuroligin-1 in isolation and in  complex with neurexin-1b.
Neuroligin-1 forms  a constitutive dimer, and two neurexin-1b monomers bind to two identical surfaces on the opposite faces of the neuroligin-1 dimer to form  a heterotetramer.
The neuroligin-1/neurexin-1b  complex exhibits a nanomolar affinity and includes a large binding interface that contains  bound Ca2+.
Alternatively spliced sites in neurexin-1b and in neuroligin-1 are positioned  nearby the binding interface, explaining how  they regulate the interaction.
Structure-based  mutations of neuroligin-1 at the interface disrupt binding to neurexin-1b, but not the folding  of neuroligin-1 and confirm the validity of the  binding interface of the neuroligin-1/neurexin1b complex.
Our results provide molecular insights for understanding the role of cell-adhesion proteins in synapse function.
  INTRODUCTION  Synapses are asymmetric cell-cell junctions that mediate  communication between neurons.
The formation of an initial synaptic contact is followed either by the maturation or  by the elimination of the synapse, depending on the synaptic activity it experiences.
Synapse specification and  validation is critical for normal functioning of the brain,  and impairments in synapse development are thought to  be a major cause of brain disorders such as autism and  mental retardation (Garber, 2007).
  Neuroligins (NLs) are transmembrane proteins on the  postsynaptic cell surface (Ichtchenko et al., 1995; Ichtchenko et al., 1996).
They were discovered as ligands (or receptors) for neurexins (Nrxs), which are synaptic cell  adhesion proteins on the presynaptic cell surface  (Ushkaryov et al., 1992; Missler et al., 2003).
The extracellular domains of NLs and neurexins interact in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Nguyen and Sudhof, 1997).
Neuroligin1 (NL1) expressed in nonneuronal HEK293 cells induces  presynaptic differentiation in cocultured neurons at the  sites of cell-cell contact (Scheiffele et al., 2000; Fu  et al., 2003; Boucard et al., 2005; Chubykin et al., 2005;  Chih et al., 2006).
Similarly, neurexins expressed in nonneuronal cells induce postsynaptic differentiation in cultured neurons at contact sites (Graf et al., 2004; Nam  and Chen, 2005).
These observations led to the hypothesis that NL and Nrx act as transneuronal signals for the recruitment of synaptic components and might be involved  in initial synapse formation in vivo (Dean and Dresbach,  2006; Craig and Kang, 2007).
However, results from  knockout (KO) mice revealed that neither NLs nor Nrxs  are required for the initial synapse formation in vivo as  no defects in the synapse numbers were observed in  the KO mice (Missler et al., 2003; Varoqueaux et al.,  2006).
On the other hand, NL and Nrx were found to be  critical for synapse function and mouse survival.
Further  studies showed that NLs do not establish, but specify  and validate, synapses via an activity-dependent mechanism, probably by determining whether a synapse will be  excitatory or inhibitory, stable or transient, facilitating or  depressing (Chubykin et al., 2007).
Indeed, physiological  experiments with NL1 and neuroligin-2 (NL2) KO mice in  combination with overexpression experiments showed  that NL1 and NL2 selectively act on excitatory and  992 Neuron 56, 9921003, December 20, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc.inhibitory synapses, respectively, to validate synapses  (Chubykin et al., 2007).
  Mutations in neuroligins and neurexins were described  as rare causes of familial autism spectrum disorders  (Jamain et al., 2003; Laumonnier et al., 2004; Yan et al.,  2005; Szatmari et al., 2007).
Introduction of an autism mutation (R451C on NL3) caused an increase in inhibitory  synaptic activity and produced autism-like behavior in  knock-in mice (Tabuchi et al., 2007).
The identification of  autistic patients with either NL or Nrx mutations suggested that the NL/Nrx interaction and its downstream  signaling pathways might be disrupted in autism disorders.
Consistent with this notion, mutations in Shank3,  a postsynaptic scaffolding molecule that indirectly interacts with NLs, were also found in autism spectrum disorders (Durand et al., 2007).
  Five NL genes exist in humans, and four in rodents  (Ichtchenko et al., 1996; Philibert et al., 2000; Bolliger  et al., 2001; Jamain et al., 2003).
NLs are type-I membrane  proteins with a molecular mass of approximately 95 kDa,  predicted to have a single transmembrane helix.
Their extracellular region consists of a single esterase domain that  is enzymatically inactive.
Although the NL-esterase domain has 34% sequence identity to acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) (Sussman et al., 1991), it has a unique glycosylation pattern, an additional disulfide bond, and alternatively  spliced sites (Comoletti et al., 2003; Hoffman et al., 2004).
  NLs are alternatively spliced at two positions (A and B)  (Ichtchenko et al., 1995; Ichtchenko et al., 1996), with  splice site A containing two distinct inserts in most NLs,  whereas splice site B appears to be only used in NL1 (Comoletti et al., 2007).
  Three Nrx genes are present in humans and rodents,  with each gene producing longer a- and shorter b-neurexins (Ushkaryov et al., 1992).
The extracellular sequences of  b-Nrxs are largely composed of a single laminin/neurexin/  sex hormone binding globulin (LNS) domain, whereas the  extracellular sequences of a-Nrxs contains six LNS domains and additionally include three epidermal growth  factor (EGF) domains (Missler et al., 1998).
The LNS domain of b-Nrxs corresponds to the sixth LNS domain of  a-Nrxs, and its structure has been determined by X-ray  crystallography at 2.6 A resolution (Rudenko et al., 1999).
  The extracellular esterase domains of NLs interact with  a- and b-Nrxs in a Ca2+-dependent manner.
Alternative  splicing of site A and site B in NLs strongly modulates their  affinity for a- and b-Nrxs (Comoletti et al., 2003, 2006;  Boucard et al., 2005).
Likewise, extensive alternative splicing occurs in neurexins as well, and insertion of an insert  into splice site 4 (SS4) of a- and b-Nrxs greatly decreases  their affinity for NLs (Ichtchenko et al., 1996).
Low-resolution X-ray and neutron scattering experiments in combination with mutagenesis studies suggested that the binding  interface is near SSB of NLs and SS4 of Nrxs, although  these experiments lack molecular detail about the interaction (Comoletti et al., 2007; Graf et al., 2006).
  The mechanism by which NLs validate and specify synapses is unknown.
It is the extracellular domain of NLs that  is critical for this activity rather than its cytoplasmic region  (Chubykin et al., 2007).
The only known ligands for the extracellular esterase domain of NLs are a- and b-Nrxs.
The  high affinity of their interaction, their similar synaptic functions, and their common involvement in autism spectrum  disorders strongly suggest that NLs and Nrxs function  by binding to each other.
However, the lack of a high-resolution structure of the NL/Nrx complex hinders the understanding of how these proteins act in synapse function.
  We determined the three-dimensional structures of NL1  in isolation and in a complex with Nrx1b by X-ray crystallography.
The structure of the complex reveals a binding  interface that includes two Ca2+-binding sites and explains the role of alternatively spliced sites in the regulation  of binding.
We then designed multiple mutations on the  Nrx-binding surface of NL1 to disrupt the interaction of  NL1 with Nrx1b.
We confirmed the stability and wildtype-like folding of the mutant NLs.
The mutations disrupt  the NL1/Nrx1b interaction by reducing the affinity by up to  three orders of magnitude.
These mutants confirm the  binding interface revealed by the NL1/Nrx1b complex  structure and could be used as molecular tools to dissect  the NL1/Nrx1b interaction in vivo.
  RESULTS  Structure of Neuroligin-1  The extracellular esterase domain of NL1 (residues 46  638, without inserts in splice sites A and B) was produced  in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system  (residue numbering includes signal peptide and splice  sites even when they are absent, see Figure S1 available  online).
The purified NL1 was analyzed by multiangle laser  light scattering (data not shown), which indicated that NL1  forms a dimer of approximately 150 kDa as reported previously (Comoletti et al., 2006).
Crystals of NL1 were obtained in space group P32 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to dmin = 1.8 A .
The structure  was solved by molecular replacement with an approximate homology model of NL1 (Table 1; a simulated annealing omit map is shown in Figure 1C).
  NL1 has an ellipsoid shape with dimensions 68 A 3  66 A 3 48 A (Figure 1A, location of the SSA and SSB splice  sites are indicated by arrows).
It belongs to the class of  a/b-hydrolases together with acetylcholinesterases, butyrylcholinesterases, and cholesterol esterases, consisting of a twisted b sheet surrounded by multiple helices.
  N-glycosylation is observed at two of the three potential  glycosylation sites (N109 and N343), and a disulfide bond  (C512-C546) is seen that is unique to NLs (Figure 1A).
  The NL1 homodimer is formed by protomers that are related by a two-fold axis, similar to what is observed in the  AChE structure.
The dimer interface comprises a fourhelix bundle composed of two helices from each protomer, with a buried surface area of approximately 1100 A 2  (Figure 1B).
The interaction primarily involves hydrophobic residues L636, L633, L629, V451, F458, W463,  Neuron 56, 9921003, December 20, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 993  Neuron  Interaction between Neuroligin and Neurexinand M459, flanked on one side by two hydrogen bonds  (R466-Q600, H467-K601).
The structure explains the dimer disrupting effect of the E628A/L629A mutation studied by Dean et al. (2003) since it alters residues at the  dimerization interface; the K622A/V623A mutation presumably changes the packing of the dimerization helices  since the mutated residues face into the protein core (mutations correspond to E584A/L585A and K578A/V579A  mutations in Dean et al. who used a different numbering).
  Comparison of NL1 with Other  Esterase Structures  The esterase domains of NLs have 34% sequence identity  with those of AChEs.
Superposition of the structures of  NL1 and AChE from torpedo californica (PDB ID 2ACE) using the program DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993) yielded  a root-mean-square (rms) deviation of 2.2 A for 504 equivalent a carbon atoms (Figure 2A).
Superposition of NL1  with other esterase domains, such as butyrylcholinesterase or cholesterol esterase, produced rms deviations in  the range of 2.22.4 A .
Despite the similar overall fold of  NL1 and esterases, there are major differences in the esterase active site region (Figure 2B).
The catalytic residues  of AChEs are located in a deeply buried cavity that is surface accessible through an entrance.
Both sequence  identity and structural similarity between NL1 and AChE  are very low in the active site region (Figures 2B and S1).
  In addition, the active site residues of AChE are solvent accessible, whereas the homologous residues in NL1 are inaccessible to solvent due to an occluded entrance.
There  are two short helices in NL1 instead of one in AChE, which  occlude the entrance.
Different loop lengths cause major  structural differences in NL1 compared to AChEs (there  are eight extra residues 132139, indicated by 1 in  Figure 2B, and there is a shorter loop in the region indicated by 2 in Figure 2B).
  The C-terminal subdomain containing the EF hand motif  (Tsigelny et al., 2000) is in a different position in NL1 than in  AChEs, and the helices of the EF hand motif are packing  differently (indicated by 3 in Figure 2B).
No electron density was observed at the putative Ca2+-binding sites of the  EF hand motif for NL1 crystals that included Ca2+ (data not  shown), as well as in the Ca2+ containing crystal structure  of the NL1/Nrx1b complex (discussed below), indicating  that the EF hand motif of NL1 does not bind Ca2+, at least  not in isolation or in a complex with Nrx1b.

  994 Neuron 56, 9921003, December 20, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Interaction between Neuroligin and NeurexinStructure of the NL1/Nrx1b Complex  To determine the structure of the complex, the esterase  domain of NL1 without SSA and SSB was coexpressed  with Nrx1b (residues 47299; without an insert in SS4) in  insect cells, and the complex was formed in the presence  of 1 mM Ca2+.
Crystals of the complex were obtained in  space group C2 with four NL1/Nrx1b complexes in the  asymmetric unit and diffracted to dmin = 3.5 A (Table 1  and a simulated annealing omit map is shown in Figure 3D).
  The crystal structure of the NL1/Nrx1b complex comprises a heterotetramer in which two Nrx1b protomers  bind to equivalent sites on opposite sides of the long  axis of the NL1 dimer (Figure 3A).
The NL1 dimer within  the complex is identical to the NL1 dimer observed in  the isolated NL1 structure, and the two Nrx1b molecules  that bind to the NL dimer are not interacting with each  other.
The observed oligomeric state is consistent with solution sedimentation velocity experiments that revealed  a 2:2 stoichiometry (Comoletti et al., 2006).
Electron density is observed for two Ca2+ at the binding interface.
Apart  from side-chain rotamer changes, no major conformational changes are observed when the complex structure  is compared with the individual structures of NL1 and  Nrx1b (rms deviation for Ca atoms is 0.4 A for both NL1  and Nrx1b).
  The Nrx1b-binding site on NL1 is located next to SSB  and on the opposite side of the molecule relative to the  active site entrance (Figure 3B).
The structure reveals  that the presence of the eight-residue SSB on NL1 would  partially occlude the interaction surface, leading to a decrease in binding affinity, which is in agreement with the  observations that the presence of the SSB insert abolishes  a-Nrx binding and reduces b-Nrx binding (Boucard et al.,  2005; Comoletti et al., 2006).
The NL1-binding region on  Nrx1b is located at the rim of the b sheet that is opposite  to its N and C termini.
The 30 residue insert of SS4 in  Nrx1b would be located next to the binding region, explaining why its presence impairs binding to NLs (Ichtchenko et al., 1996).
The SSB of NL1 and the SS4 of Nrx1b  are located on approximately opposite sides across the  binding interface.
This arrangement of the splice sites  could induce an additive effect upon introduction of both  splice sites and would thus allow complex regulation of  the strength of binding between NL1 and Nrx1b.

  Neuron 56, 9921003, December 20, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 995  Neuron  Interaction between Neuroligin and NeurexinMapping the residues that are mutated in some autism  cases (R451C in hNL3, G99S in hNL4, K378R in hNL4,  V403M in hNL4) on the NL1/Nrx1b structure reveals that  these residues are not at the binding interface, and thus  are unlikely to cause a direct defect in binding to Nrx1b  (Figure 3C), consistent with previous data (Chubykin et al.,  2005).
All mutations except for one are located in a buried  region opposite to the Nrx1b-binding surface half way  between the active site and the dimerization interface,  likely causing folding defects of NL (Comoletti et al., 2003).
  The Binding Interface of the NL1/Nrx1b Complex  The high affinity of the NL1/Nrx1b complex (Kd = 97 nM as  determined by isothermal titration calorimetry [ITC];  Figure 4A) is achieved by a combination of several interactions: coordination of two Ca2+ by oxygen atoms, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic and long-range electrostatic  interactions (Figures 3B, 3E, and S2).
Two long parallel  loops on the rim of the Nrx1b b sheet align with a patch  of multiple loops on NL1 to form an extensive interaction  surface with a buried area of 645 A2  .
One of the Ca2+ is coordinated by five oxygen atoms (N238 OD1, D137 OD1,  D137 OD2, V154 O, and I236 O) from Nrx1b and three  oxygen atoms (G396 O, Q395 O, and E397 OE2) from  NL1 (Figure 3E).
This Ca2+-binding site is homologous to  the Ca2+-binding site of the previously reported second  LNS domain of Nrx1a (Sheckler et al., 2006).
The other  Ca2+-binding site is at the edge of the binding interface  and is loosely coordinated by three oxygen atoms (N103  O, D104 OD1, and D104 OD2) from Nrx1b and three oxygen atoms (D402 OD1, D402 OD2, and T569 O) from NL1.
  No Ca2+ binding was observed in this site in the Ca2+-  bound structure of the second LNS domain of Nrx1a  (Sheckler et al., 2006).
Thus, Ca2+ might bind to this second site only in the context of the NL1/Nrx1b complex.
  An extensive hydrogen-bonding network is observed at  the binding interface involving NL1-R597 NE and Nrx1bN103 OD1, NL1-N400 N and Nrx1b-S107 OG, NL1-K306  NZ and Nrx1b-S107 O, NL1-E397 OE2 and Nrx1b-I236  N, and NL1-G396 O and Nrx1b-N238 ND2 (Figures 3E  and S2).
In addition, many residues from NL1 (H294,  E297, K306, Q395, E397, L399, N400, and F499) and  Nrx1b (N103, S107, R109, L135, R232, I236, and N238)  are involved in long-range electrostatic interactions and  hydrophobic interactions.
  Sequence Conservation and Variation  of NL Surface Residues  The sequence identity between NLs is high (70%80%).
  To visualize the conserved and varying regions of NLs,  we mapped the conservation of residues between NL1  and NL2 (Figure 5A), between NL1 and NL3 (Figure 5B),  and between NL1 and NL4 (Figure 5C) on the NL1 structure and colored residues from most conserved (blue) to  least conserved (red).
The binding surface for Nrx1b corresponds to one of the most conserved regions (yellow ovals  in Figure 5).
Specifically, most residues at the NL1/Nrx1b  interface are conserved within NLs but are not in AChEs  (Q395, E397, D402, N400, E397, H294, E297, L399)  (Figure S1).
However, there are some residues at the  edges of the interaction surface that are variable among  NLs (examples are K306, F499, G500, N498, R597,  R311).
These variable residues explain differences in binding affinity to Nrxs (the Kd is 97 and 830 nM for NL1 and  NL2, respectively, as determined by ITC, Figures 4A and  4B; see also Comoletti et al., 2006).
  There are several other regions that are not conserved  among NLs; some of these regions might be important  for the differential activity of different NLs to specify different synapse types.
Interestingly, NL1 has a highly conserved loop insertion that does not exist in AChEs.
It forms  a loop/b sheet fold and lies close to the surface of the  structure away from the active site (residues 576587)  (Figure 2A).

Neuron  Interaction between Neuroligin and NeurexinMutations at the Binding Surface Disrupt  the Interaction of NL1 with Nrx1b  To confirm the validity of the binding interface that is observed in the NL1/Nrx1b complex structure, we designed  NL1 surface mutations that disrupt its interaction with  Nrx1b based on our crystal structures (Figure 5D).

The L399A, N400A, D402N, E297A,  K306A set (NL1-LNDEK) additionally disturbs the two residues that flank SSB.
  To ensure that the mutant proteins are properly folded,  we performed circular dichroism (CD) experiments (Figure 4D).
The CD spectra are characteristic of a mixture  of a-helix and b sheet as expected from the NL1 structure.
  We observed few differences between wild-type and  mutant proteins.
Temperature denaturation experiments  showed that the melting temperature Tm (the temperature  at which 50% of the protein is denatured) of wild-type NL1  and mutant proteins are similar.
Thus, the mutations have  no effect on the folding or the stability of the protein  (Figure 4E).
  It was not possible to obtain a typical ITC binding curve  for the NL1-LND mutant (Figure 4C).
Increasing the injection volumes yielded higher signal but no saturation of the  signal was achieved, indicative of weak binding.
We estimate that the NL1-LND mutant binds to Nrx1b with micromolar affinity.
We did not attempt ITC of the other mutants  that might have even weaker affinities.
  In order to determine the dissociation constants of mutant neuroligins to Nrx1b, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR), a technique that can measure the binding affinities for weak interactions.
The wild-type and mutant  NL1 proteins were immobilized on a surface and different  concentrations of Nrx1b (in the range of 0.18 nM30 mM)  were injected over the NL1 surface.
The binding was detected by the increase in the resonance units (Figure S3)  and the dissociation constants were calculated by plotting  the steady-state binding as a function of Nrx1b concentration (Figure 6).
The dissociation constant of the wild-type  NL1 was measured as 20.9 nM, in good agreement with  the results of the ITC measurements.
The dissociation  constant of the NL1-LND mutant for Nrx1b was measured  as >10 mM, which is 500-fold less than the affinity of wildtype NL1.
The dissociation constants of the NL1-LNDQE  and NL1-LNDEK mutants, that carry LND mutation as  background, are >50 mM and >10 mM, respectively.
These  results show that our mutants decrease the binding of NL1  to Nrx1b up to 2500-fold.
Our properly folded NL1 mutants  that are deficient in binding to Nrx1b confirm the validity of  the binding interface revealed from the NL1/Nrx1b complex structure, and can be used in future experiments as  molecular tools to dissect NL-dependent neuronal events  that are Nrx independent.

  998 Neuron 56, 9921003, December 20, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Interaction between Neuroligin and NeurexinDISCUSSION  Using a combination of biophysical and biochemical approaches, we studied the structure and specificity of the  interaction between NL1 and Nrx1b.
The structure of  NL1 revealed a fold similar to that of other esterase domains, despite the low sequence identity (Figures 1A  and 2A).
However, significant differences were observed  at the active site entrance, which is substrate-accessible in AChEs, but occluded in NL1 (Figure 2B).
The NL1  structure confirms that NL1 is a constitutive dimer.
Two  helices from each monomer form a four-helix bundle at  the binding interface that is primarily composed of hydrophobic interactions but includes a few hydrogen bonds  (Figure 1B).
No Ca2+ binding was observed to the EF  hands of NL1 that were previously proposed to be the  Ca2+-binding sites.
  The structure of the NL1/Nrx1b complex revealed an  arrangement of two Nrx1b protomers bound to identical  surfaces on the opposite sides of a NL1 dimer to form  a heterotetramer with a two-fold symmetry (Figure 3A).
  This organization of the NL1/Nrx1b complex positions  the C-terminal stalk regions of NL1 and Nrx1b at opposite  faces of the heterotetramer and is in agreement with the  biological organization of the molecules to bridge and  cross the 20 nm-wide synaptic cleft between neurons.
  The SSB of NL1 and the SS4 of Nrx1b are positioned at  the edges of the binding interface; as a result, their presence disturbs the interaction between NLs and Nrxs as reported previously (Boucard et al., 2005; Comoletti et al.,  2006; Figure 3B).
Expression of different splice variants  Figure 5.
Sequence Variation of NL Surface Residues and  Conservation of the NL1/Nrx1b Binding Interface  The structure of NL1 shown in surface representation on which the  conservation of residues between NL1 and NL2 (A), between NL1  and NL3 (B), and between NL1 and NL4 (C) are mapped from most  conserved (blue) to least conserved (red) (using the ConSurf server  [Landau et al., 2005]).
The structure is shown in a similar orientation  as in Figure 1A.
The Nrx-binding and dimerization regions are indicated  by yellow and cyan ellipses, respectively.

SPR Analysis of the Binding of Nrx1b to Wild-Type  and Mutant NL1s  Maximum binding of Nrx1b to NL1 measured at steady state during  neurexin injection over immobilized NL1s were plotted as a function  of Nrx1b concentration.
The dissociation constants were calculated  by fitting the curves to a single site binding model.
Each data point  was measured twice, and both measurements are shown on the figure.
  For most data points, the two measurements are very similar and overlap with each other.
  Neuron 56, 9921003, December 20, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 999  Neuron  Interaction between Neuroligin and Neurexincan be a mechanism that determines the strength of binding between NLs and Nrxs to regulate their downstream  events.
Mapping of the mutations of NL genes in autistic  patients on the NL1/Nrx1b complex structure reveals  that they are distant from the NL1/Nrx1b binding interface  but are located mostly within the protein core, suggesting  folding defects (Figure 3C).
  The NL1/Nrx1b binding interface includes two distinct  Ca2+-binding sites (Figure 3E).
The first Ca2+-binding site  is homologous to the Ca2+-binding site that was observed  in the second LNS domain of Nrx1a, which has a 400 mM  affinity for Ca2+ (Sheckler et al., 2006).
The half maximal  binding of Nrx1b to NLs requires approximately 23 mM  free Ca2+ (Nguyen and Sudhof, 1997).
The tighter binding  of Ca2+ to the NL1/Nrx1b complex can be explained by  completion of the Ca2+ coordination sphere by complex  formation.
The second Ca2+-binding site is at the edge  of the interface and is more loosely coordinated.
No  Ca2+ binding was observed at this site in the second  LNS domain of Nrx1a probably because of the few coordination sites contributed by Nrx1a.
  In addition to Ca2+ coordination, the interaction between NL1 and Nrx1b is maintained by multiple side chain  and backbone interactions from both proteins, leading to  the nanomolar affinity of the interaction (Figure 3E).
Thus,  Ca2+ coordination, an extensive hydrogen-bonding network, hydrophobic interactions, and long-range electrostatic interactions contribute to the high-affinity interaction of NL1 with Nrx1b.
Mapping the conserved and  varying residues between NLs on the NL1 structure  shows that the Nrx binding site is conserved throughout  all NLs (Figures 5A5C) but not in AChEs (Figure S1)  and supports a critical role for the NL/Nrx interaction in  synapse function.
However, variation at the edges of the  binding interface contributes to the differential NL1/  Nrx1b affinities.
  To confirm that the binding interface that is revealed by  the NL1/Nrx1b complex structure is correct, we designed  NL1 mutants in order to specifically disrupt the NL1/Nrx1b  interaction (Figure 5D).
ITC experiments showed that mutations located on one half of the binding interface (NL1-  LND) decrease the affinity of NL1 to Nrx1b (Figure 4C).
  Quantitative SPR experiments confirm that NL1-LND mutant has 500-fold less affinity for Nrx1b than wild-type NL1  (Figure 6).
Our more severe mutants disrupted other regions of the binding interface, thereby decreasing the affinity of NL1 for Nrx1b up to 2500-fold (Figure 6), indicating  the importance of the entire binding interface for the  strength of the NL1/Nrx1b interaction.
CD experiments  showed that the mutations have no effect on the proper  folding and stability of the protein.
The disruption of the  binding by these mutations confirms the binding interface  revealed by the NL1/Nrx1b complex structure.
  In conclusion, we describe a structural analysis of the  interaction between NLs and Nrxs, the synaptic cell adhesion proteins that are proposed to be critical for proper  synapse function.
Our crystal structures of NL1 and the  NL1/Nrx1b complex provide the basis for further advances in understanding their mechanism of action in synapse function which may lead to the treatment of diseases  that are caused by mutations in these proteins.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Protein Expression and Purification  The esterase domain of rat NL1 without splice sites (residues 46638)  was cloned into the BamH1 and Xba1 sites of the pAcGP67A vector.
  The LNS domain of rat Nrx1b without splice site 4 (residues 47299)  was cloned similarly.
A His6 tag was added at the C terminus for affinity  purification.
Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with pAcGP67A carrying the gene and linearized AcNPV DNA  (Sapphire Baculovirus DNA; Orbigen) using Cellfectin (Invitrogen).
  Baculovirus was amplified in Sf9 cells in 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum  containing SF900-II medium (GIBCO).
  Large-scale protein expression was performed by infection of  Trichoplusiani (Hi5) cells in Insect-Xpress medium (Biowhitaker) at  a cell density of 2 3 106 cells/ml with an infection course of 72 hr.
  For higher expression yields NL1 and Nrx1b were coexpressed.
  When tunicamycin, a glycosylation inhibitor, was used, no protein  could be obtained.
The media containing the secreted, glycosylated,  recombinant protein was concentrated and dialyzed using tangential  flow filtration system (PALL) and subsequently purified with Ni-NTA  resin (QIAGEN) at 4C.
The proteins were eluted with 200 mM imidazole (pH 7.2).
NL1 and Nrx1b were separated by anion exchange chromatography (Mono Q column) in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl  (buffer A), and 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 M NaCl (buffer B).
NL1 was further  purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer containing 10 mM  HEPES (pH 7.2) and 150 mM NaCl.
The peak corresponding to the  NL1 dimer was then concentrated to 17 mg/ml in 30 kDa Centricon  (Millipore) and used for crystallization trials.
After affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography, Nrx1b was further purified  as described in the literature (Rudenko et al., 1999).
The purified proteins were mixed in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 with a 1:1.3  NL1:Nrx1b ratio.
The complex was purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, and  1 mM CaCl2 and concentrated to 22 mg/ml.
  Site directed mutagenesis for NL1 mutants was performed using the  QIAGEN QuickChange Mutagenesis kit (QIAGEN).
  Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing  Initial screens for crystallization of NL1 were carried out using 96-well  format kits (Hampton Index, Salt and Crystal Screen HT, Hampton Research) on a Phoenix crystallization robot (Art Robbins Instruments).
  Automatic plate scanning by a CrystalPro 2 imaging system (TriTek  Corporation) identified initial hits.
After optimization, crystals of NL1  were grown using hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20C in 24-well  format.
One microliter of 17 mg/ml protein in 10 mM HEPES (pH  7.2), 150 mM NaCl was mixed with equal volume of mother liquor consisting of 1.2 M tri-sodium citrate, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.7), and equilibrated  against 1 ml mother liquor.
Crystals grew to full size (about 0.2 mm 3  0.2 mm 3 0.6 mm) within 3 days.
Crystals were cryoprotected by  transferring the crystals into mother liquor with 5%, 15%, and 22.5%  EG gradually.
Many crystals suffered from cracking and thus produced  extra lattices in the diffraction images.
The best crystals diffracted to  dmin = 1.8 A .
Crystals of NL1 formed in space group P32 with four molecules per asymmetric unit and 61% solvent content.
  Crystallization trials for the NL1/Nrx1b complex were obtained with  a 96-well format kit (Protein Complex, Nextal) at 20C. 22 mg/ml protein in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.2) was mixed  with equal volume of mother liquor consisting of 8% PEG6000, 0.1 M  MgCl2, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0).
Crystals grew to full size (about 0.3 mm 3  0.3 mm 3 0.4 mm) within five days and were cryoprotected with 25%  1000 Neuron 56, 9921003, December 20, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc.  Neuron  Interaction between Neuroligin and Neurexinglycerol.
Crystals diffracted to dmin = 3.5 A .
Crystals of the NL1/Nrx1b  complex formed in space group C2 with four NL1/Nrx1b complexes  per asymmetric unit and 64% solvent content.
Indexing, integration,  and scaling of the diffraction data was performed with HKL2000  (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997).
A summary of the data collection statistics is given in Table 1.
  Structure Determination and Refinement of NL1  The NL1 structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER  (McCoy et al., 2005) using a homology model of the NL1 structure  based on the AChE crystal structure (PDB ID 1J06) (Bourne et al.,  2003).
The NL1 structure was first refined with CNS 1.2 (Brunger  et al., 1998; Brunger, 2007) followed by automatic model building in  ARP/WARP (Perrakis et al., 2001) and RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2003).
  Noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were used during initial refinement cycles but were removed at later stages.
The presence  of a NCS two-fold symmetry axis that coincided with one of the cell  axes would cause the test set to be correlated to the working set.
To  ensure independence of the test set from the working set, the diffraction data was first scaled in the higher symmetry group P6 while generating the test set, then the test set was expanded to lower symmetry  in P32 and transferred to the diffraction data processed in P32.
The  refinement consisted of alternating rounds of simulated annealing, positional minimization, individual restrained thermal factor refinement,  and model building.
Positional minimization was performed using  the MLF maximum likelihood target function.
Water molecules,  N-linked carbohydrates, and alternative conformations were added  in CNS 1.2 and COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004), and refinement  was completed with CNS 1.2.
The bulk solvent model refined to  ksol = 0.4 e/A 3 and Bsol = 55 A 2  .
The final model contains two N-linked  NAG carbohydrate moieties attached to each of the NL1 molecules,  and two bound Ni2+.
  Structure Determination and Refinement  of the NL1/Nrx1b Complex  The NL1/Nrx1b crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement  using PHASER (McCoy et al., 2005) with the high-resolution structure of  NL1 and the structure of Nrx1b (PDB code 1C4R) (Rudenko et al., 1999)  as search models.
An initial solution emerged with three NL1-Nrx1b  complexes, two of which form the dimer that was also found for the  isolated NL1 structure.
Inspection of a sA weighted 2Fo  Fc electron  density map revealed the presence of a weakly ordered fourth NL1/  Nrx1b complex that also had a two-fold relationship with the remaining  well-ordered NL1/Nrx1b complex.
This weakly ordered NL1/Nrx1b  complex was modeled by applying the two-fold relationship to the coordinates of its interacting ordered NL1/Nrx1b complex.
All refinement  calculations were performed with CNS 1.2.
Positional minimization was  performed using the MLF maximum likelihood target function.
Tight  NCS restraints were applied to all atomic positions for the four NL1/  Nrx1b complexes, resulting in rmsds of less than 0.03 A among the  NCS related NL1/Nrx1b complexes.
Individual restrained B-factor  minimization was performed for the three well-ordered NL1/Nrx1b  complex with tight NCS restraints.
The fourth complex was treated separately by using grouped B-factor minimization since it exhibits some  amount of disorder and weak electron density.
The bulk solvent model  refined to ksol = 0.3 e/A 3 and Bsol = 67 A 2  .
Inspection of the electron density maps revealed weak electron density for the following loops:
NL1  577591, NL1 637642, NL1 445450, Nrx1b 289291.
Minor adjustments of the model were performed using COOT, followed by another  round of refinement.
The final model contains three N-linked NAG  carbohydrate moieties attached to each of the NL1 molecules, two  attached to the well-ordered Nrx1b molecules, and two Ca2+ bound  to each of the interfaces of the well-ordered NL1/Nrx1b complexes.
  Isothermal Titration Calorimetry  Wild-type NL1, NL2, NL1-LND mutant, and Nrx1b proteins were dialyzed against a buffer solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2),  150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2 three times for 1 hr, 3 hr, and overnight.
  The final buffer was saved to be used as washing buffer for the ITC instrument.
The ITC experiments were carried out with a VP-ITC MicroCal calorimeter.
Samples were degassed for 10 min before the experiment.
The wild-type or mutant NL1 protein solutions (2030 mM range)  were placed in the MicroCal sample cell.
The Nrx1b protein solution  (200 mM) was placed in a syringe and water was placed in the reference  cell.
The Nrx1b solution in the syringe was added to the cell in a series  of multiple injections of varying injection volumes (2 ml into wild-type  NL1, 5 ml into wild-type NL2, and 10 ml into NL1-LND mutant to optimize the signal level) at 20C.
Titration of Nrx1b into a solution of NL  generated an exothermic reaction, releasing heat upon binding of  Nrx1b to NL.
The raw ITC data was processed and fitted using a model  for single molecule site.
The raw ITC data were deconvoluted using the  ORIGIN software provided by MicroCal.
  CD Spectroscopy  CD measurements were conducted on a Aviv Circular Dichroism  Spectrometer Model 202-01 equipped with a temperature controller.
  Ten micromolar samples of wild-type and mutant NL1 proteins in  20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl buffer solution were scanned in  the 195 nm to 270 nm range, with 1 nm wavelength steps, in a 1 mm  path length cell at 4C.
Temperature denaturation experiments were  performed at 220 nm wavelength by increasing the temperature from  25C to 80C with 2C temperature increments, two minutes temperature equilibration time and 3 s averaging time.
  Surface Plasmon Resonance  Binding of Nrx1b to WT and mutant NL1 was analyzed at 25C using  10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM CaCl2, 150 mM NaCl,  0.005%(v/v) surfactant P20 and 1%BSA, on a BIAcore 3000.
Control  protein, WT, and mutant neuroligin proteins were covalently attached  to carboxymethylated dextran of a research grade CM3 chip (BIAcore,  Uppsala, Sweden) by NHS/EDC amine coupling and a resonance unit  of 600700 was achieved for all samples.
Nrx1b was injected over the  NL1 surfaces as a set of concentrations differing by 3-fold in the range  of 0.18 nM30 mM and each data point was measured twice.
A flow  rate of 50 ml/min was used to minimize sample diffusion and mass  transport limitations.
Reference data obtained using a flow-cell with  immobilized control protein (inactive BotA) were subtracted from the  sample flow channels to obtain a specific Nrx1b binding.
NL1 surfaces  were regenerated by the injection of a regeneration solution (10 mM  HEPES [pH 7.4], 1 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% P20 and 1%BSA).
  For analysis of steady-state binding affinities, the magnitude of the response at the end of each injection were measured and fitted using  a single site stoichiometry model.
