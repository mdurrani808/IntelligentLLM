Cooper, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, and approved December 14, 2005 (received for review September 23, 2005)  The cartilaginous fish are the oldest phylogenetic group in which  Igs have been found.
Sharks produce a unique Ig isotype, IgNAR,  a heavy-chain homodimer that does not associate with light chains.
  Instead, the variable (V) regions of IgNAR bind antigen as soluble  single domains.
Our group has shown that IgNAR plays an integral  part in the humoral response of nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma  cirratum) upon antigen challenge.
Here, we generated phagedisplayed libraries of IgNAR V regions from an immunized animal  and found a family of clones derived from the same rearrangement  event but differentially mutated during expansion.
Because of the  cluster organization of shark Ig genes and the paucicopy nature of  IgNAR, we were able to construct the putative ancestor of this  family.
By studying mutations in the context of clone affinities, we  found evidence that affinity maturation occurs for this isotype.
  Subsequently, we were able to identify mutations important in the  affinity improvement of this family.
Because the family clones  were all obtained after immunization, they provide insight into the  in vivo maturation mechanisms, in general, and for single-domain  antibody fragments.
  immunoglobulin  somatic hypermutation  The canonical view of humoral immunity in warm-blooded  vertebrates is that, after antigen challenge, serum antibodies  improve in specificity and affinity with time (1).
Low-affinity  antibodies produced early in the response are essentially germ-lineencoded, whereas higher-affinity antibodies induced later often use  the same variable (V) genes that are somatically hypermutated.
  Clonal selection of B cells producing higher-affinity antibodies,  known as affinity maturation, occurs in the specialized microenvironment of the germinal center (26).
  Most conventional antibodies possess an antigen-binding site  generated at the interface of the heavy- and light-chain V regions,  and many groups have analyzed the effect of somatic mutation on  binding specificity and the affinity of fragments derived from these  antibodies.
In some instances, the more flexible induced fit  binding observed for germ-line clones was fixed in mutationmatured clones to give a lock-and-key mode of binding and,  consequently, a higher binding affinity and specificity (7, 8). Other  groups have shown that improvements in shape-complementarity  with antigen are responsible for increasing affinity and specificity  (9, 10).
Much less research has focused on affinity maturation in  ectothermic vertebrates.
Furthermore, little is known of how singledomain antibody fragments, which lack one of the V domains, are  matured.
A study of an anti-hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) camel  heavy-chain antibody variable (VHH) domain in its germ line and  mutated form showed that, despite the lack of binding-site plasticity  conferred by pairing with a second domain and the presence of a  complementarity-determining region (CDR)3-constraining disulphide bond, a 300-fold increase in binding affinity was achieved by  increasing VHH-antigen complementarity and apolar buried surface area (11).
However, all but one of the clones in the study were  generated in vitro and, so, tell little of how the antigen-stimulated  repertoire is generated.
  The shark isotype IgNAR is a heavy-chain homodimer that,  similarly, does not associate with light chain (12).
Its V regions act  as independent soluble units to bind antigen.
IgNAR is a paucicopy  (few-copy) gene family arranged in the cluster organization typical  of elasmobranchs; of the four member genes, only two (type I and  type II) are expressed in adult animals.
Type I and type II V regions  are highly similar in sequence but differ in the positions of their  noncanonical Cys residues (13).
The IgNAR V-region primary  repertoire is entirely CDR3-based and is, subsequently, subject to  high levels of apparent antigen-driven mutation (14).
However,  because the IgNAR V region utilizes three diversity (D) regions,  requiring four rearrangement events, the primary repertoire contains clones with an unprecedented diversity of CDR3 length and  amino acid composition (13, 15).
  The crystal structures of both IgNAR V-region types (16, 17)  have recently been solved.
Surprisingly, the IgNAR V region is the  only V domain that lacks a conventional CDR2.
Instead, the  IgNAR V region has a hypervariable loop that forms a belt around  the middle of the molecule, as in a C1- (or S-) type domain.
Because  of its hypervariable yet unusual nature, we christened this loop  hypervariable region (HV)2.
The structures also revealed that the  differential placement of noncanonical Cys residues induces very  different CDR3 conformations in the two types, resulting in remarkably different binding-site topologies.
Moreover, data from  random (not antigen-selected) cDNA clones indicate that there is  selection of mutations in the region of closest proximity to the  CDR3 (i.e., HV2 of type I clones but CDR1 of type II) (15).
  Sequence analysis also revealed an additional HV between HV2  and CDR3 where mutations seemed to be under positive selection  (14).
After crystallographic analysis, this region was found to form  the loop linking D and E strands in a region homologous to HV4  of T cell receptors (14, 18, 19).
Because of its prominent location,  structurally adjacent to CDR1, and its hypervariable nature, it is  conceivable that HV4 may also participate in antigen binding.
  Although most results indicate that affinity maturation in ectothermic vertebrates is poor (20, 21), two studies in nurse sharks  found evidence that affinity maturation of monomeric IgM occurs  after immunization (22, 23).
It is thought that IgNAR (and monomeric IgM) production is a T-dependent response that provides the  specificity of the shark humoral response (23), but, because of its  apparent sensitivity to degradation in vitro (H.D. and M.F.F.,  unpublished work), affinity maturation of IgNAR has yet to be  established.
  Herein, we describe the generation of IgNAR V-region libraries  from the immune tissues of a shark hyperimmunized to HEL.

The members of this family and a putative  ancestral clone were studied with regard to their affinities and  mutational status to try to better understand the role of this  single-domain isotype in vivo.
Surprisingly, the putative ancestral  clone was found to bind antigen with nanomolar affinity.
Nevertheless, through the introduction of somatic mutations, most of the  family members analyzed had further improved their affinities,  offering evidence not only that affinity maturation of the IgNAR  isotype occurs but also demonstrating affinity maturation at the  molecular level in ectotherms.
  Results  Identification of the Type II Anti-HEL Family and Sequencing of Its  Germ-Line Gene.
Phage-displayed minilibraries of IgNAR V regions  were generated from spleen, epigonal (the shark bone-marrow  equivalent), and peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) tissues from  the hyperimmunized animal and were subject to one round of  low-stringency panning on HEL to maximize the diversity of  binders selected.
Of the 400 clones tested after panning, 15% were  found to specifically bind HEL by ELISA.
The vast majority of  HEL-positive clones were obtained from the PBL minilibrary  (24%), with fewer from epigonal (11%) and spleen (1%).
  Eleven different sequences were found, of which five were found  to be closely related (8498% amino acid identity) and to contain  a highly similar CDR3 region (Fig. 1).
Because the IgNAR V region  is generated by four rearrangement events (using 3 D regions), with  associated addition and trimming, it is almost impossible that these  clones were generated by independent rearrangement events.
Indeed, during the sequencing of hundreds of clones picked at  random from similar libraries (before selection), the same CDR3  was seldom encountered twice (ref. 14, and H.D. and M.F.F.,  unpublished work).
Therefore, these clones are derived from the  same ancestral clone but have been differentially mutated in vivo  during expansion.
  The family is derived from a type II clone, containing noncanonical Cys residues in CDR1 and CDR3 (Fig. 1).
Sequencing of  the germ-line genes from this animal enabled identification of the  gene from which the family derived.
All family members are highly  mutated when compared with their germ-line sequence, containing  712 amino acid replacements in framework region (Fr)1Fr3 (84  amino acids).
Although the germ-line sequence encodes a high  proportion of charged amino acids, some of the mutations observed  introduce additional charged residues in place of uncharged ones.
  Thus, although solubility is encoded in the germ line, there seems  to be an enhancement of this feature after mutation.
The substitutions T9R and T44R exemplify this enhancement, both being  solvent-exposed residues distant from the binding region.
A similar  acquisition of acidic residues was observed in IgNAR V-region  families discovered during sequencing of random cDNA clones  (14); why this further solubilization should be favored is unknown  but may be important under the high-salt (1,000 mosmol), high-urea  (350 mM) conditions in vivo in sharks.
The family CDR3, at 19  amino acids, is longer than average for type II clones (14).
All three  D regions were found in each of the clones and the noncanonical  Cys residue in CDR3 is encoded by D2 from its preferred reading  frame (Fig. 1) (13).
The CDR3 of the family also contained a  number of charged amino acids that are under-represented in  conventional antibody HCDR3s (24, 25).
CDR3 also contains two  tyrosine residues, which, through their ring structure and hydroxyl  R group, usually increase the surface area available for antigen  interaction and hydrophilicity (26).
The Tyr-92 codon carries  synonymous mutations, indicating negative selection on this residue  in the HEL-binding clones, thus suggesting that T92 plays an  important role in antigen interaction.
Synonymous mutations were  also observed in other residues known to be vital to IgNAR  V-region structure: Gly-52 (in the turn from HV2 into Fr3) Arg-82  (increases solubility), Cys-83, and Cys-96 (disulfide bonding) (indicated in bold in Fig. 5, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site).
  Amplification of Additional Type II Family Members.
Because of the  cluster organization and paucicopy nature of IgNAR, we thought  that by targeting this rearrangement event, we could find other  clones in this family.
A D3-J region boundary-specific primer  (A8JCDR3) was designed and used for RT-PCR on epigonal,  spleen, and PBL RNA, resulting in amplification of 10 previously  unidentified members (Fig. 2).
Some of the initial family members  (isolated through binding) were found a second time by RT-PCR,  and many clones were amplified from multiple tissues, giving us  confidence that our PCR strategy was working as expected.
Mirroring the antigen-binding results, more family clones were isolated  by RT-PCR from PBL (n  10) and epigonal (n  9) than from  spleen (n  3).
  In general, the extended-family clones fall roughly into two  groups; the first group (encompassing clones Epi6, Epi7, Epi8,  Epi10, Epi13, and Epi14) appeared to have undergone one round  of mutation, targeted mainly to CDR1-Fr2.
The second group  (PBLA8 and all remaining clones) were more highly mutated, with  replacements in both CDR1-Fr2 and HV2.
The clone PBLB5, with  mutations in HV2 but not CDR1, does not conform to the mutation  pattern observed for the other family members (Figs. 2 and 5).
  Especially noticeable is the presence of germ-line residues A30 and  Fig. 1.

Analysis of  the nucleotide alignment (Fig. 5) indicates that PBLB5 is either  derived from a gene-conversion event or (more likely) is a PCR  chimera that arose during library construction and is derived from  the Fr1-Fr2 of a (differently mutated) nonfamily clone fused to the  Fr2-Fr4 of the family (with the actual swap probably occurring  around amino acid 39).
Despite its probable origin as a PCR  chimera, we decided to include PBLB5 in the analysis because of its  usefulness for determining the role of CDR1 mutations in improving affinity.
  The type II germ line from which the family is derived encodes  11 conventional mutation hotspot motifs (RGYW or WRCY),  distributed throughout the domain but with a slight clustering in and  around CDR1 (see Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site).
An additional 45 hotspots are  encoded within the CDR3 of the family clones.
A WuKabat plot  was drawn to examine family variability in the context of mutation  hotspots (see Fig. 7, which is published as supporting information  on the PNAS web site).
Half the positions identified as highly  variable (scores 4) are located at mutational hotspots (n  5 of  10), whereas the other positions had been identified by Diaz et al.  (27) as nonconventional hotpots; amino acids 4041 and 4445 are  encoded by runs of adenines, which are prone to mutation, presumably as a consequence of polymerase slippage; position 51 falls  within a hairpin loop generated by a palindrome across Fr2HV2.
  Many mutations were tandem in nature (nontemplated mutation of  tandem bases), a mutational pattern specific to shark Ig genes (14,  28).
Not all mutational hotspots gave rise to positions that were  highly variable; for instance, of the hotspots identified within  CDR3, only one has a variability 4.
Antigen-binding is generally  CDR3-dependent; mutations in this region could disrupt the binding site, resulting in counterselection in vivo.
The highly variable  residue in CDR3 is adjacent to the noncanonical Cys, which forms  the constraining disulfide bond with that of CDR1.
Thus, this  residue is unlikely to be involved in antigen binding and be more  permissive as to which amino acids may be tolerated in this  position.
In two members of the extended family (PBL3 and Epi7),  the Tyr-92 residue postulated to have a role in antigen binding was  mutated to Phe.
Further study of these clones would tell whether the  tyrosine-specific hydroxyl group is vital to antigen binding.
  We instigated this PCR-based approach in the hope of finding  less-mutated family clones, enabling us to study the order of  mutation introduction and its effect on binding affinity.
However,  all of the clones found were too highly mutated to enable the  analysis we desired. Because RNA had been prepared from PBLs  taken just as this shark showed an increase in HEL-specific IgNAR  (23), we tried to amplify family members from these samples  instead.
Repeated attempts at RT-PCR amplification of family  members with the primer A8JCDR3 (anneals to D3-J of PBLA8)  and a second primer A8JCDR3-long (anneals to D2-D3-J) failed to  isolate additional family members.
A number of nested RT-PCR  approaches were also attempted, with little success.
From the clones  obtained, we saw other (nonfamily) V regions that used the same  D3-J rearrangement but different V-D1 and D1-D2.
Thus, family  clones were either not present in the peripheral blood at this point  in the immunization course or were too few to amplify.
  Ancestral Clone Reconstruction. Because we were unsuccessful in  finding less-mutated family clones by PCR, a putative ancestral  clone was constructed, based on the type II germ-line sequence.
  The Fr1Fr3 region of the genomic clone was PCR amplified and  a family CDR3-Fr4 grafted onto this fragment by successive rounds  of PCR extension.
The strategy worked well, and a clone was  Fig. 2.

  Determination of Specificity and Affinity.
Affinity-purified protein  was produced for the original family members, Epi6, and the  ancestral clone.
All clones were checked for antigen binding by  ELISA (data not shown) and selected clones subjected to analysis  by BIAcore (Uppsala, Sweden).
Of the clones chosen for analysis,  PBLA8 was selected as an example of a clone with both CDR1 and  HV2 mutations.
It was not surprising that the highly similar  clones PBLA8, PBL2E7, and PBLE4 all bound equally by ELISA.
  Clones PBLB11 and Epi6 were chosen for their unique HV2  mutation pattern and lack of HV2 mutation, respectively.
Despite  its probable origin as a PCR artifact, we decided to include PBLB5  as a fortuitous example of a clone mutated in HV2 but not CDR1  to gauge the effect of CDR1 mutation on binding.
The real-time  kinetics data obtained are shown in Table 1.
The affinity of the  putative ancestral clone was much higher (nM) than we had  expected for an unmutated clone.
However, we have reported a  similarly high affinity for another HEL-binding IgNAR V region  that had only a single amino acid replacement compared with its  germ line (29).
The 10-fold increase in affinity observed for PBLA8  when compared with ancestral is mainly a consequence of a slower  dissociation rate (5-fold slower than ancestral), whereas the  association rate is only fractionally improved (2-fold).
  To generate the secondary repertoire, IgNAR V genes mutate  extensively in an antigen-driven manner (14).
From randomly  sequenced clones, it was noted that type II clones showed selection  of mutations in CDR1 (15).
The very similar affinities of ancestral  and Epi6 clones seem to indicate that the presence mutations in  HV2 has little influence on antigen binding.
In contrast, the lower  (comparative) affinity of PBLB5 seems to indicate that mutations  in CDR1 are important in modulating antigen binding.
It is unlikely  that the drop in affinity shown by PBLB5 is because of steric  hindrance at the antigenantibody interface, because all the mutations in this clone map away from the top of the molecule.
Rather,  it may be that one or more changes alter the take-off angle or  flexibility of a CDR-bearing loop in a way that hinders antigen  binding.
  Structural Analysis.
Because we had generated a model for the type  II IgNAR V region (in ref.
16, confirmed by ref.
17) it was possible  to map the position of various changes to gain insight into how, or  whether, the changes influence binding.
Mapping of changes between PBLA8, which had the highest affinity and most amino acid  replacements, and ancestral clone sequences showed that most  mutations mapped to the top of the molecule around the CDR31  border.
Very few mutations were found in the vicinity of HV2, but  (curiously) there was a cluster of mutations at the very bottom of  the molecule (Fig. 3).
The PBLA8-specific S61R substitution was  mapped to the tip of the HV4 region (16), the hypervariable loop  structurally adjacent to CDR1 (Fig. 4).
We thought that this residue  was ideally placed to influence antigen binding and that it may be  partly responsible for the higher affinity of PBLA8.
In a similar  comparison of Epi6 and the ancestral clone, most of the changes  were, again, located in or around the CDR31 region at the apex  of the molecule (data not shown).
Immediately apparent was the  interesting position of the CDR1 change A30V, adjacent to CDR3  at the top of the molecule (Fig. 4), in an ideal position to influence  antigen binding.
Again the front of the molecule, across which  HV2 runs, showed very few mutations, but the cluster of mutations  at the bottom of the molecule was once again apparent.
  Ancestral Clone with A30V or S61R Substitutions.
As described above,  the two mutations A30V in CDR1 and S61R in HV4 could  contribute to the increase in affinity between the ancestral clone  and PBLA8.
Although Gly-34 and Pro-40, present in all family  clones, were also initially considered for analysis, they were discarded when they were mapped to the bottom of the domain,  distant from the binding site.
Another candidate, N28R, which, like  A30V, lies within CDR1 at the top of the molecule, was thought  unlikely to be influencing affinity, because this residue is mutated  to proline in clones PBL2E7 and PBLE4, which bind by ELISA with  exactly the same profile as PBLA8.
  To test our hypothesis, we generated ancestral clones carrying  either the A30V or S61R mutations alone and analyzed the affinity  Table 1.

Kinetic data showed that the A30V  substitution did not contribute to the increase in affinity, despite the  close spatial proximity of CDRs 1 and 3.
Conversely, the introduction of the S61R mutation into the ancestral clone improved affinity  for antigen 3-fold, equally contributed by small (1.5-fold) increases in both association and dissociation rates.
These data prove  that the HV4 region can also be involved in antigen binding in the  IgNAR V region.
However, the affinity of this mutant is still 3-fold  lower than that of PBLA8, indicating the presence of other unidentified mutations that also contribute to affinity improvement by  further slowing the dissociation rate.
  Discussion  The canonical model of affinity maturation is that of a fine-tuning  process.
Antibodies are formed from unmodified germ-line segments; thus, the pool from which antigen-binders can be selected is  limited by the number of these segments in the genome and how  efficiently they are rearranged.
In most organisms, this germ-lineencoded diversity is complemented by rounds of somatic hypermutation and selection to incrementally improve the binding specificities selected from the primary repertoire.
However, the degree  to which different organisms rely on the fine-tuning conferred  through somatic hypermutation appears to somewhat of a sliding  scale. According to recent publications, the camel single-domain  VHH repertoire seems structurally limited (30), so low- (M)  affinity binders are selected from the primary repertoire, and  mutation is required to significantly (1,000-fold) improve binding  affinity (11).
In contrast, the study of an IgNAR V-region family  presented here demonstrated that high-affinity (nM) binders could  be selected directly from the primary repertoire.
The presence of  these high-affinity binders is probably a consequence of the huge  structural diversity imparted through the rearrangement of three D  regions (the likes of which is not found in any other shark or  nonshark Ig isotype) and the different CDR3 conformations forced  by differential disulfide bonding in the two V-region types (13, 15).
  After the in vivo introduction of somatic mutations, we see incremental increases in affinity, strongly indicative of affinity maturation, but these improvements are comparatively small (10-fold).
  All evidence to date indicates that sharks do not have (conventional) germinal centers (31).
However, because the frequency of  mutation of IgNAR is known to be very high, in some instances  exceeding that of mammalian Igs, it may be that it is the selection  of mutants that is suboptimal.
The generation of such an extensive  primary repertoire in sharks may be compensatory for the absence  of the strongly selective environment of the germinal center.
  Analysis of random cDNA clones showed differential selection of  mutations in HV2 and CDR1 (15), indicating that they could  contribute to antigen binding with CDR3; this finding was subsequently confirmed for CDR1 through structural analysis of a type  I clone (16) and for CDR3 by in vitro mutation of a type II clone  (32).
Because of a similar selection of mutations, combined with its  position neighboring CDR1, the loop designated as HV4 might also  modulate antigen binding (14, 27).
In this study, the introduction of  the mutation S61R, mapped to the tip of HV4, into the ancestral  background was able to improve affinity 3-fold.
The IgNAR V  region, consequently, has a total of four hypervariable regions  (CDR1, CDR3, and HV4 at the top and HV2 on the front of the  domain) that it can use, in various combinations, to generate an  enormous surface over which antigen-binding can occur.
As more  structures for this single domain are solved, we hope to uncover how  much of the potential binding surface is actually used in vivo.
  It was clear during the analysis of the family clones that some  clones carried a high number of mutations which, because of their  location, were unlikely to participate in antigen binding.
A similar  observation has been made in studies of affinity-matured antibodies  from mammalian species (33).
This high load of mutations is likely  the result of repeated cycles of somatic mutation and indicates that  mutations that do not adversely affect antigen binding will be  tolerated.
Indeed, during analysis of extended-family members, we  thought there had been a stepwise acquisition of mutations, with  some clones seeming to have undergone a single cycle of mutation  and others at least two cycles.
The first round of selection seems to  have been targeted to CDR1, and many of these mutations appear  to be under selection.
The selection of mutations in CDR1 is almost  certainly a consequence of its role in antigen-binding in this family.
  It is also apparent that the replacements in CDR1 are the result of  only a few (three or four?) mutational events, some of which  introduce tandem mutations (Fig. 5).
The next round(s) of mutation are targeted to HV2 (which, in this family, is not involved in  antigen binding) and, therefore, are under less selection (positive or  negative) than those in CDR1.
As an aside, it would seem that the  introduction of tandem mutations may be used by sharks to achieve  their extremely high mutation rate; animals with slow rates of B cell  replication would undergo fewer rounds of replication in a set time  than those with a high rate of replication.
Thus, to attain a sufficient  rate of mutation, shark B cells may need to introduce more  mutations per round of replication by changing multiple bases in a  single mutational event.
  As mentioned, during a previous study of random cDNA clones  derived from amplification of secretory IgNAR, three similar  V-region families were identified (14), allowing analysis of mutation  acquisition; however, because the stimulating antigen was unknown, the role of these mutations in affinity maturation could not  be studied.
In addition, after the selection of a different library for  binders to an unrelated protein antigen, we isolated two more  (smaller) families.
The ability to easily isolate such families of clones  seems to be specific to IgNAR V regions, possibly because of a  combination of its cluster organization, paucicopy nature, and  extensive primary repertoire.
In the discovery of such families,  combined with the single-domain nature of the V region (lacking  a second domain, which complicates analysis), we appear to have  fortuitously stumbled on an ideal system for studying somatic  hypermutation in the context of antigen binding.
  Materials and Methods  Sequencing of Unrearranged, Germ-Line IgNAR V Regions.
Genomic  DNA was isolated from erythrocytes of the immunized animal.
  PCR amplification of the unrearranged IgNAR V regions was  conducted by using 250 ng of DNA and the IgNAR V-region  primers NAR F4For1, NAR F4For2, and NAR Fr1Rev (29).
PCR  products were cloned into pCR-2.1 by using the TA-cloning system  (Invitrogen) and insert-positive clones identified for sequencing by  bluewhite selection.
  Minilibrary Construction and Clone Isolation.
To induce an anti-HEL  response, an adult nurse shark was immunized once with 20 mg of  HEL in complete Freunds adjuvant s.c. in the lateral fin.
Four s.c.
  boosts of 20 mg of HEL in incomplete Freunds adjuvant were given  over the subsequent 7 months.
Additional boosts of 250 g of  soluble HEL were given i.v. at 10 and 24 months (1 month before  killing) to ensure a high titer of antigen-specific antibody (23).
Total  RNA was prepared from PBLs, epigonal, or spleen.
RNA from  each tissue was used separately at 1 gl as template for IgNAR  V-region amplification and minilibrary construction (each of 5   104 members) (29).
A single round of nonstringent panning was  Table 2.

Before elution, the immunotubes were washed 10 times with PBS to remove nonspecifically  bound phage.
Phage were rescued as detailed in ref.
29. Clones were  tested by ELISA for binding by using monoclonal phage supernatant.
Binding was detected with anti-M13 horseradish peroxidaseconjugated monoclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
  Plasmid was prepared from HEL-positive clones and their inserts  sequenced.
  Amplification of Additional Type II Family Members.
Additional  family members were amplified from RNA for each tissue by using  the D3-J region-specific primer A8JCDR3 (5-GCC ACC TCC  GTA CTG GTC ATT AAG CGC AGC-3) and the Fr1 primer  NAR Fr1Rev (29).
The PCR product of 350 bp was cloned into  pCR-2.1 and insert-positive clones identified for sequencing as  above.
For samples where no clones were obtained with A8JCDR3,  a longer primer, A8JCDR3 long (5-GTC ATT AAG CGC AGC  ACA CTC AGC ATC GTA CGA TCC ATA TCG-3), was  designed that anneals through D2-J of the family CDR3.
  Reconstruction of Epi6.
Clone Epi6 was PCR-amplified from TA  vector with the primers NAR Fr1Rev and NAR F4For2 to graft the  Fr4 region back onto the end of the clone.
  Ancestral Clone Reconstruction.
Plasmid was prepared for the  genomic clone containing the unrearranged V-region sequence  from which the type II family is derived.
The CDR3-Fr4 of the  family clone PBLE4 was grafted onto the corresponding germ-line  Fr1Fr3 by overlapping PCR extension.
Four rounds of PCR were  used to reconstruct the CDR3, each primer being used with the  NAR Fr1Rev primer (as above).
Extension primers used were as  follows: round 1, H29 extend (5-CGA AGC ATA TCG GCT TTC  GGG CTT GCA TCG ATA CGA-3); round 2, A8JCDR3 long;  round 3, A8JCDR3; and round 4, NAR Fr4For2 (as above).
  Generation of Ancestral A30V and S61R Mutants.
Nucleotide sequences encoding the germ-line gene but incorporating the  mutations A30V (GCA to GTA) or S61R (AGC to CGT) and  flanked by NcoI and NotI restriction enzyme sites to aid cloning into pIMSHuC were synthesized commercially (www.  blueheronbio.com).
  Protein Expression and Purification.
For expression, V regions were  cloned into the vector pIMSHuC through their NcoI and NotI  restriction enzyme sites.
Upon induction with IPTG, this vector  produces soluble protein tagged with a hexa-histidine tail.
Protein  was harvested from the periplasmic fraction (method detailed in  ref.
34 but omitting lysozyme from the fractionation buffer) and  purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography.
Subsequent affinity-purification was performed by passage over a HELSepharose column, eluting with 100 mM glycineHCl, pH 2.8, and  neutralizing with 1M TrisHCl, pH 8.
Protein was dialyzed against  PBS and quantified by BCA assay.
Concentrations were verified  and purity established to be 95% by SDSPAGE.
  Determination of Affinity.
Real-time interaction measurements  were performed on a BIAcore 3000 biosensor (Amersham Pharmacia) as detailed in ref. 29.
HEL-coating density on the CM5 chip  was 265 resonance units (RU), and samples were run over this  surface at a range of concentrations between 200 and 0.75 nM. RUs  for the control surface (activated and blocked with ethanolamine)  were removed before analysis and the resultant sensorgrams analyzed with the program BIAEVALUATION 3.2.
  Molecular Modeling.
The IgNAR Type II domain was modeled on  the Type I structure, with the CDR3 region based on that of the  camel VHH domain AMD10 (detailed in ref.
16).
