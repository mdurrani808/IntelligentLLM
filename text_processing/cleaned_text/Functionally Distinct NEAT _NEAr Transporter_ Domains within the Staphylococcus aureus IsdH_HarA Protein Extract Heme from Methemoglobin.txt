Clubb4  From the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, UCLA-DOE Institute for Genomics and Proteomics and the Molecular Biology  Institute, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095  The pathogen Staphylococcus aureus uses iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins to scavenge the essential nutrient iron from host hemoproteins.
The IsdH protein (also known  as HarA) is a receptor for hemoglobin (Hb), haptoglobin (Hp),  and the Hb-Hp complex.
It contains three NEAT (NEAr Transporter) domains: IsdHN1, IsdHN2, and IsdHN3.
Here we show  that they have different functions; IsdHN1 binds Hb and Hp,  whereas IsdHN3 captures heme that is released from Hb.
The  staphylococcal IsdB protein also functions as an Hb receptor.
  Primary sequence homology to IsdH indicates that it will also  employ functionally distinct NEAT domains to bind heme and  Hb.
We have used site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance methods to localize the Hp and Hb binding surface on IsdHN1.
High affinity binding to these structurally unrelated proteins requires residues located within a conserved  aromatic motif that is positioned at the end of the -barrel  structure.
Interestingly, this site is quite malleable, as other  NEAT domains use it to bind heme.
We also demonstrate that  the IsdC NEAT domain can capture heme directly from Hb,  suggesting that there are multiple pathways for heme transfer  across the cell wall.
  Staphylococcus aureus causes a wide range of life threatening  diseases such as pneumonia, septicemia, osteomyelitis, toxic  shock syndrome, and cardiomyelitis (1).
The rise of antibiotic  resistance has created a pressing need for new drugs to treat  infections caused by this microbe as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) now accounts for up to 65% of all clinical isolates, and new multidrug resistant strains have emerged that are  resistant to vancomycin, the preferred antibiotic of last resort  to treat MRSA infections (2).
Bacterial growth is limited by the  availability of iron, which is an essential cofactor for enzymes  involved in microbial metabolism.
Although the human body  contains large quantities of iron, little is directly available to  S. aureus because it is sequestered intracellularly or bound to  the carrier glycoproteins transferrin and lactoferrin.
To overcome this bacteriostatic limitation, S. aureus has evolved a variety of mechanisms to assimilate iron (3, 4).
Of special interest are recently discovered iron-regulated surface determinant  (Isd)5 proteins, which extract heme bound iron from host  hemoproteins (5 8).
The Isd system likely plays a significant  role in virulence as heme contains 75% of the bodys total  iron, and it is the S. aureus preferred source of iron (9).
As  sequence homologs of Isd proteins are also found in a number  of other important pathogens (e.g. Listeria monocytogenes,  Bacillus anthracis, and Streptococcus pyogenes), a greater  understanding of the Isd system could lead to the development  of new therapeutically useful anti-infective agents (1012).
  Hemoglobin (Hb) in red blood cells contains large quantities  of heme iron to which S. aureus gains access by secreting cytolytic toxins (leukocidin and - and -hemolysin) (13).
Release of  Hb from lysed erythrocytes significantly dilutes the protein,  causing it to dissociate and oxidize into methemoglobin  (MetHb), a dimeric form of Hb that contains single  and   globin chains as a heterodimer, each bound to a ferric heme (14,  15).
Because heme readily dissociates from MetHb and it can  cause severe oxidative damage to host tissues or serve as a  microbial nutrient, several host mechanisms exist to remove it  from circulation (16).
First, heme-laden MetHb present in the  blood is tightly bound by the serum glycoprotein haptoglobin  (Hp), and the Hp-MetHb complex is cleared from circulation  by receptor-mediated endocytosis in the liver parenchymal  cells (17, 18).
Second, free heme in the blood is eliminated when  it binds to hemopexin and serum albumin proteins (15).
Recent  studies have begun to elucidate how S. aureus circumvents  these clearance systems to gain access to heme iron.
Free heme  present in the blood can be scavenged by the heme transport  system, a membrane protein complex that pumps heme into  the cytoplasm (9).
Heme is also aggressively acquired by capturing it from circulating MetHb and the Hp-MetHb complex  using the Isd system (6, 19).

  The Isd pathway consists of nine proteins that work in concert to acquire heme (5 8).
Three receptor proteins are  covalently anchored to the cell wall by the SrtA sortase and are  displayed on or near the cell surface (IsdA, IsdB, and IsdH (also  known as HarA (haptoglobin receptor A))) (6, 19, 22).
In addition, a fourth receptor, IsdC, is attached to the cell wall by the  SrtB sortase enzyme (21).
MetHb is captured by IsdH and IsdB  (6, 19, 20).
Although these proteins share a high degree of  sequence homology with one another, only IsdH is capable of  binding Hp (19, 23).
In addition, full-length IsdB binds to heme  (6), whereas it is unknown if IsdH can also bind to this molecule.
  The IsdA protein binds heme and may play a general role in  bacterial adhesion, as the isolated protein interacts with an  array of extracellular matrix proteins (22).
After capture by the  surface receptors, heme is thought to be transferred to IsdC,  which is presumably embedded within the cell wall because it  resists proteolytic degradation in whole cell digestion studies  (6).
The IsdC protein then passes the heme molecule to the  membrane transporter IsdDEF complex where it is imported  into the cytoplasm.
Finally, iron is released when the tetrapyrrole ring is cleaved by the monooxygenase IsdG or its paralog  IsdI (24).
Recent studies also suggest that heme imported by the  Isd system can be directly incorporated in microbial proteins  (8).
  The Isd receptors IsdA, IsdB, IsdC, and IsdH bind to proteins  and heme using NEAT (NEAR iron transporter) domains.
  These conserved binding modules are 125 residues in length  and are named for their prevalence in bacterial genes whose  genomic positioning is proximal to putative Fe3 siderophore  transporter genes (10).
NEAT domains are also found in putative surface proteins in a number of other Gram-positive pathogens where they presumably function in iron import.
Studies of  isolated NEAT domains from S. aureus have revealed that different domains bind to distinct ligands.
For example, some  NEAT domains only bind heme (e.g. IsdC) or only to other  proteins (e.g. the first and second domains of IsdH), whereas  other NEAT domains can bind both of these ligands (e.g. IsdA)  (19, 22, 23, 25).
NMR and crystallography studies have revealed  that NEAT domains adopt a -sandwich fold that shares structural homology with immunoglobin-like proteins (23, 2528).
  In addition, the structures of the IsdC- and IsdA-heme complexes have revealed the mechanism of heme binding (2628).
  However, it remains unknown how NEAT domains interact  with other proteins.
  The IsdH protein captures MetHb and Hp on the cell surface  (19).
Sequence analysis indicates that it contains three NEAT  domains: IsdHN1, IsdHN2, and IsdHN3 (Fig. 1A).
Although the  IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains bind to MetHb and Hp, the function of the C-terminal IsdHN3 domain is unknown (19).
In this  study we systematically investigated the functions of NEAT  domains within IsdH. We show using alanine scanning  mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) that Hp and  MetHb bind at the same site on IsdHN1.
Interestingly, this site is  also used by the IsdA and IsdC NEAT domains to bind heme,  suggesting that that this surface is particularly well suited for  recognizing a range of distinct ligands (2628).
We also show  that the previously uncharacterized IsdHN3 domain binds  heme and that it can capture this molecule from MetHb.
A  model of heme transfer is proposed in which domains IsdHN1  and IsdHN2 first bind MetHb or the Hp-MetHb complex on the  cell surface.
Heme is then captured by the adjacent IsdHN3  domain before subsequent transfer through the cell wall.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Protein Expression and PurificationThe first NEAT  domain from IsdH consists of residues Ala86 to Leu229 and is  referred to as IsdHN1 (Fig. 1A).
Two versions of IsdHN1 were  studied.
For the heme transfer assay, untagged IsdHN1 was produced from a pet11a vector (Novagen) and purified as previously described (25, 29).
For the binding studies using SPR, a  histidine-tagged fusion of IsdHN1 was used (his-IsdHN1, residues Ala86 to Leu229 with the sequence Met-Gly-Ser-Ser-HisHis-His-His-His-His-Ser-Ser-Gly-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-SerHis-Met at its N terminus).
Briefly, the DNA for IsdHN1 was  PCR-amplified from S. aureus chromosomal DNA (strain  RN4220) using primers that incorporated NdeI and BamHI  restriction sites at the 5 and 3 ends of the DNA, respectively.
  This PCR product was then digested with NdeI and BamHI and  ligated into a similarly cut pET15b vector.
Plasmids encoding  single amino acid mutants ofHis-IsdHN1 were constructed  from the pET15b vector bearing the IsdHN1 sequence using the  QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturers specifications.
Escherichia coli  BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmids of either His-tagged  wild-type or mutant IsdHN1 were harvested 4 h after the addition of isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 rpm at 4 C in a JA-10 rotor,  resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 2.5 mM  benzamidine (Acros), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride  (Sigma-Aldrich), protease inhibitor mixture II (Roche Applied  Science)), and lysed by 3 cycles of sonication.
The lysed cells  were centrifuged at 4 C for 1 h at 12,000 rpm in a SS-34 rotor.
  The supernatant was then applied to Talon nickel affinity beads  (Clontech), and the His-tagged fusion proteins were purified  according to the manufacturers instructions.
All His-IsdHN1  mutants were checked for proper folding using one-dimensional NMR (data not shown).
  Two proteins were used as heme receptors in the heme transfer assay, histidine-tagged IsdC (His-IsdC, residues Ser25 to  Gly150), and histidine-tagged C-terminal NEAT domain from  IsdH (His-IsdHN3, residues Thr540 to Gln664).
Both proteins  were expressed from pET15b plasmids (Novagen) and contained the amino acid sequence Met-Gly-Ser-His-His-HisHis-His-His-Ser-Ser-Gly-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser-His-Met  at their N termini.
Plasmid construction and protein purification procedures were identical to those used forHis-IsdHN1  (described above).
The amount of heme associated with HisIsdC and His-IsdHN3 was determined using a pyridine hemochrome assay (30).
After purification, 23% of His-IsdHN3  and His-IsdC was bound to heme.
  Enzyme-linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA)An ELISA  was used to test His-IsdHN3 binding to a variety of proteins.
  NEAT Domains Extract Heme from Methemoglobin  JANUARY 9, 2009VOLUME 284NUMBER 2 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 1167   at University of Sydney on May 1, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from ELISA plate wells (Nunc microwell plates, Fisher Scientific)  were coated with a 150-l solution containing 20 g/ml lyophilized bait protein.
The bait proteins were dissolved in PBS  buffer (10 mM phosphate-buffered saline, 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.0)  and included fetuin (Sigma), apotransferrin (Sigma), holotransferrin (Sigma), Hp (Athens  Research), or Hb (Sigma).
Additionally, commercially available  fibronectin precoated plates  (Sigma) were used to test fibronectin interactions.
After the bait proteins were incubated at room temperature for 1 h on a Nutator, the  wells were washed 3 times with PBS  buffer and blocked with 100 l of a  bovine serum albumin solution (10  g/ml) (Sigma) dissolved in PBS  buffer for 1 h with nutation.
The  wells were then washed 3 times with  PBS to remove excess blocking solution, and varying amounts of HisIsdHN3were added to each well (0 to  30 pmol/well).
Interactions between  His-IsdHN3 and protein ligands  were then detected by adding nickel-labeled horseradish peroxidase  according to the manufacturers  directions (Express Detector Nickel-HRP, KPL).
After incubating for  1 h at 37 C, the wells were washed  with PBS to remove unbound nickel-labeled horseradish peroxidase,  and the binding of His-IsdHN3
was  quantified by measuring the conversion of the substrate 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich)  dissolved in citric phosphate buffer,  pH 5, to a colored product using an  automated ELISA reader (Molecular Devices, SpectraMax M5).
As a  positive control similar experiments  were performed using His-IsdHN1  protein instead of His-IsdHN3.
  Metalloprotoporphyrin Affinity  MeasurementsUV and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to  determine the affinity of IsdHN3 for  metalloprotoporphyrins.
In the UV  assay the soret band of His-IsdHN3  at 402 nm was monitored as a function of heme (iron protoporphyrin  XI) added.
The concentration of  His-IsdHN3 was held constant at 1  M in buffer A (50 mM Tris HCl, pH  7.5, 100 mM NaCl), and hemin was  added in small aliquots froma1mM  stock solution (hemin dissolved in  0.1 M NaOH).
After pH adjustment,  the UV absorbance was measured and plotted as a function of  heme concentration to yield a binding curve.
All UV measurements were performed using a PharmaSpec UV-1700 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu).
The affinity of IsdHN3 for the heme  analog zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) was determined using  FIGURE 1.

Domains are shaded based on their relatedness.
  Domains shaded gray share 46  65% primary sequence identity (IsdHN1, IsdHN2, and IsdBN1).
Non-shaded  domains share 49% primary sequence identity (IsdHN3 and IsdBN2).
Based on studies of the isolated  NEAT domains within IsdH, the gray- and non-shaded domains bind Hb and heme, respectively.
Both proteins  also contain a cell wall sorting signal motif at their C termini that is covalently attached to the cell wall by the  SrtA sortase enzyme.

  NEAT Domains Extract Heme from Methemoglobin  1168 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 284NUMBER 2JANUARY 9, 2009   at University of Sydney on May 1, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from fluorescence spectroscopy.
In this assay the concentration of  ZnPPIX was held constant, and its fluorescence was monitored  as a function of protein added.
Binding reactions contained 150  l of 7.5 M ZnPPIX (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in binding  buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate; 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5).
  Aliquots of His-IsdHN3 from a 125 M stock solution were  added to a final concentration of 50 M. Fluorescence was  measured using a Quanta Master Model QM5 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International) at room temperature.
  The excitation and emission wavelengths were 365 and 585 nm,  respectively.
Binding data were fit to the equation A  Af  (Aa   Af  )(Ka[L]/1 Ka[L]), where A is the fluorescence emission, Af  is the fluorescence emission of free ZnPPIX, Ab is the fluorescence of bound ZnPPIX, L is the concentration of ligand (heme)  added, and Ka is the association constant (31).
Data were fit  using the program SigmaPlot 2000.
  SPR Affinity MeasurementsBinding of IsdHN1 to immobilized MetHb was measured by SPR.
MetHb was immobilized on  a CM5 chip using the following procedure.
First, a 0.1 mg/ml  stock solution of MetHb was prepared by dissolving commercially available MetHb (Sigma) in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH  6.2, 100 mM NaCl.
The stock solution was then diluted to 1  g/ml in Biacore binding buffer (10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5)  and immobilized on a CM5 chip using N-ethyl-N-(dimethylaminopropyl)carboiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide according to  the manufacturers instructions.
After MetHb immobilization,  the final measured response units (RU) of the CM5 chip was  1000.
Measurement of IsdHN1 binding was performed at  10 C.
Wild-type and mutant IsdHN1 was flowed over the  MetHb-conjugated surface at a rate of 85 l/min with a contact  time of 150 s and a dissociation time of 300 s. SPR measurements were taken at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400,  500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 nM IsdHN1 using buffer A (50 mM  sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, 100 mM NaCl) as the flow buffer.
A  similar procedure was used to measure IsdHN1 binding to Hp.
  Haptoglobin from pooled human plasma (Athens research) was  immobilized on a CM5 chip using the aforementioned methods.
This protein consists of two alleles of haptoglobin, -1 and  -2.
These proteins differ in their oligomerization state as a  result of differences in their amino acid sequence.
A 100 g/ml  solution of Hp dissolved in Biacore binding buffer was immobilized so as to yield a haptoglobin conjugated chip with a RU of  1000.
SPR experiments were performed on a Biacore T100  instrument, and the data were analyzed using the program  BIAevaluation 4.01 (Amersham Biosciences).  Heme Transfer AssayA total of 0.3 mol of either HisIsdHN3 or His-IsdC was incubated with 750 l of Talon beads  (Clontech) dissolved in buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH  6.0, 100 mM NaCl) for 1 h. The beads were then centrifuged,  washed, and equilibrated in buffer B (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2,  300 mM NaCl, 0.8% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich)).
UV measurements and SDS-PAGE analysis of the wash and beads confirmed that the protein was bound.
The beads were then incubated on a rotary with a 5 M solution of MetHb dissolved in 10  ml of buffer B. The incubation time was varied from 0 to 300  min.
The beads were then centrifuged, and the absorbance of  the supernatant at 411 nm was measured.
For transfer experiments that included IsdHN1, MetHb was first incubated with 3  mol eq of IsdHN1 for 90 min.
The program SigmaPlot 2000 was  used to fit the transfer data to the equation A  (Af  A0)(1   etkobs)  A0, where A0 is the initial absorbance of the MetHb  solution prior to incubating with IsdHN3, and Af is the final  absorbance of MetHb in the eluate.
  Under the conditions we have used kobs is approximately  equal to the rate of heme release from the  subunit.
This is  because at the end of the assay 50% of the MetHb dimers  contain a single heme molecule, and previous studies have  shown that the  chain within MetHb binds heme less tightly  that the  chain (32).
Under these conditions the heme transfer  reaction is, therefore, described by the following equilibrium  equation,  MH2 L|;  kH  kH  MH  H  N |L;  kN  kN  NH (Eq. 1)  where MH2 is MetHb containing two heme molecules, MH is  MetHb with a single heme molecule bound to its  chain, N is  the IsdHN3 NEAT domain, H is free heme, and NH is IsdHN3  bound to a single heme molecule.
As described by Hargrove  et al. (32), a simple expression for the rate of change of MH2 can  be derived by assuming that d[H]/dt  0 and that the concentration of free heme is much smaller than the concentration of  heme bound to protein (i.e. [H] [tlt] [MH2]  [MH]  [NH]   [H]total).
When these conditions are met the observed rate constant shows the following dependence.
  k   kH kN  kH MH  kN N   1    kH MH  kN N  (Eq. 2)  This equation indicates that the initial kinetics of transfer are  described by a single exponential where the observed rate constant is equal to the rate at which heme is released from the   subunit of MetHb (kobs  kH) because [MH]/[N]  0.
In principle, more complex binding behavior will be observed in which  the data is biphasic.
For example, as the ratio of [MH]/[N]  increased, the reaction could accelerate if kN   kH, decelerate if kN   kH, or remain the same if kN  kH. However,  these effects are expected to be small and difficult to detect  experimentally.
  RESULTS  The Same Site on IsdHN1Binds to MetHb and the Structurally  Unrelated Hp ProteinPrevious studies have shown that the  IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains within IsdH bind MetHb and Hp  (19, 23, 25).
Despite the determination of the three-dimensional structure of IsdHN1, the surface that mediates binding to  Hp and MetHb remains unknown because samples of the  IsdHN1-Hb and IsdHN1-Hp complexes have thus far proved  unsatisfactory for chemical shift mapping by NMR (23, 25).
  Therefore, we used alanine scanning mutagenesis combined  with SPR to probe the surface of IsdHN1 that binds MetHb and  Hp.
A total of 22 single amino acid mutants were constructed  that alter surface-exposed side chains in IsdHN1.
The majority  of amino acid substitutions are located in the loops that connect  NEAT Domains Extract Heme from Methemoglobin  JANUARY 9, 2009VOLUME 284NUMBER 2 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 1169   at University of Sydney on May 1, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from strands 1b to 2 (1-2 loop), 3-4 (3-4 loop), and 7 to  8 (7-8 loop) (see Fig. 5A).
The rationale behind altering  these sites is based on the solution structure of IsdHN1 and  sequence alignments of IsdHN1 with other NEAT domains  known to bind MetHb (described under Discussion).
Each  single amino acid mutant contained a histidine tag to facilitate  purification and was shown to be properly folded by one-dimensional NMR (data not shown).
Fig. 2Ashows representative  SPR data of wild-type IsdHN1 binding to MetHb adhered to a  CM5 chip.
These data were interpreted quantitatively by plotting the maximal SPR RU obtained at varying concentrations of  IsdHN1 (Fig. 2B).
Curve-fitting indicates that wild-type histidine IsdHN1 binds MetHb with a KD of 17  10 nM. Importantly, the presence of the histidine tag does not affect protein  binding, as similar affinities for MetHb have been measured for  glutathione S-transferase-tagged (23) and untagged variants of  IsdHN1 (data not shown).
Binding affinities for the mutants  were obtained in a similar manner and are listed in Table 1.
The  most significant changes in affinity occur when residues within  the 1-2 loop are altered, as mutation of 5 of the amino acids  in this loop result in a greater than 40-fold reduction in affinity.
  Alanine substitutions in adjacent loops also cause affinity  reductions, albeit to a lesser extent.
An interpretation of this  data is presented under Discussion.  The surface mutants of IsdHN1 were also tested for their ability to bind to immobilized Hp using SPR.
As shown in Fig. 2C,  the SPR data acquired for Hp contains more noise than the  MetHb data (0.5 and 3 RU for Hp and MetHb, respectively).
  The increase in noise is likely caused by heterogeneity in the  commercially acquired Hp protein, which consists of distinct  allelic forms that differ in their oligomerization state.
However,  the binding affinity of IsdHN1 for Hp could still be measured  quantitatively from plots of the maximal signal intensity of each  sensogram as a function of IsdHN1 concentration (Fig. 2D).
The  results of this work are reported in Table 1 and reveal that the  wild-type protein binds Hp with a KD of 35  10 nM. Alanine  substitution of Tyr-125, His-127, Phe-128, and Phe-129 within  the 1-2 loop completely abrogates binding to Hp, whereas a  Y125A mutation causes a 21-fold reduction in affinity.
All other  substitutions had a negligible effect on Hp binding.
These same  five residues within the 1-2 loop are also important for  MetHb binding, indicating that Hp and MetHb bind to the  same site on IsdHN1.
  IsdH Contains a Third NEAT Domain That Selectively Binds  HemeInspection of the IsdH amino acid sequence suggests  that it contains a third NEAT domain at its C terminus (IsdHN3,  residues Thr-540 to Gln-664) (Fig. 1A).
This putative domain  has not been characterized previously and shares only 15%  sequence identity with the IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains.
Moreover, it shares limited sequence homology with all other NEAT  domains of known function (23 and 15% sequence identity with  IsdA and IsdC, respectively, Fig. 1C).
To investigate its function, a histidine-tagged variant of IsdHN3 was overexpressed  and purified (His-IsdHN3, residues Thr-540 to Gln-664 containing a 21-residue histidine tag at its N terminus).
Centrifuged cell pellets overexpressing His-IsdHN3 were colored red,  a phenomena characteristic of many hemoproteins (data not  shown).
Heme binding was further substantiated by the UVFIGURE 2.

The amount of heme bound to HisIsdHN3 was quantified using a pyridine hemochrome assay and  revealed that after purification from E. coli, 23% of the protein contains heme (assuming 1:1 binding of heme to protein).
  NMR spectra of 15N-labeled IsdHN3 indicate that it is folded  and that it binds heme but is of insufficient quality for detailed  structural studies using this technique.
  The affinity of His-IsdHN3 for metalloprotoporphyrins was  measured using two techniques.
Initially, binding of HisIsdHN3 to heme (iron-substituted protoporphyrin IX in its ferric form) was measured by monitoring changes in the Soret  band of the protein-heme complex after the addition of varying  amounts of hemin (data not shown).
Analysis of this data  yielded an approximate dissociation constant (KD) of 120  M; however, a more quantitative analysis could not be performed because heme aggregates at higher concentrations  needed to saturate this protein.
Therefore, a fluorescencebased assay was used to monitor the binding of His-IsdHN3 to a  close analog of hemin that replaces the iron atom with zinc  (ZnPPIX).
In this assay the concentration of ZnPPIX is held  constant at 7.5 M, and changes in its fluorescence spectrum  are monitored after adding varying amounts of His-IsdHN3.
As  shownin Fig. 3B, the addition of protein caused a concentrationdependent increase in the fluorescence of ZnPPIX that saturates when 10 M His-IsdHN3 is present.
A plot of the fluorescence change as a function of the protein:ligand ratio revealed a  binding stoichiometry of 1:1 (data not shown), whereas curvefitting of the data in Fig. 3B yielded a KD of 2.8  0.1 M. Similar  experiments performed using an untagged variant of IsdHN3  yielded a KD of 2.3  0.4 M, indicating that the presence of the  histidine tag does not affect metalloprotoporphyrin binding.
  We also performed an ELISA to determine whether IsdHN3  was capable of binding to proteins previously demonstrated to  interact with other NEAT domains.
These included holo-transferrin, apotransferrin, fetuin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, Hp, and  FIGURE 3.

  NEAT Domains Extract Heme from Methemoglobin  JANUARY 9, 2009VOLUME 284NUMBER 2 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 1171   at University of Sydney on May 1, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from MetHb (19, 22).
When probed by ELISA, IsdHN3 did not interact with MetHb (Fig. 3C, closed squares) nor did it bind to any  of the other proteins tested (data not shown).
This is in marked  contrast to IsdHN1, which as expected binds MetHb when  tested by ELISA (Fig. 3C, closed diamonds).
Thus far we have  only shown that IsdHN3 binds heme.
  IsdHN3 and IsdC Capture Heme from MetHbBecause the  IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 NEAT domains within IsdH binds to  MetHb, we wondered whether the IsdHN3 domain could capture heme from MetHb.
To measure heme transfer, His-IsdHN3  was adhered to a cobalt resin (Talon beads, Clontech) and then  incubated with MetHb (6:1 molar ratio of His-IsdHN3 to  MetHb).
The two proteins were then separated by washing the  resin to elute MetHb.
Maximum absorbance of the eluate at 411  nm is diagnostic for the presence of MetHb bound to heme, as  free heme does not absorb maximally at this wavelength, and  IsdHN3 and the IsdHN3-heme complex should remain bound to  the beads.
When a solution of heme-saturated MetHb is incubated with only the cobalt resin, 96% of the heme bound  MetHb is recovered in the eluate (Fig. 4A).
In contrast, incubation of MetHb with apoIsdHN3 for 60 min significantly reduces  the amount of MetHb-bound heme that is obtained in the eluate when the resin is washed (Fig. 4A).
Two control experiments verify that heme loss from MetHb is a result of transfer to  IsdHN3.
First, SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluate indicates that  similar levels of MetHb are recovered in either the presence or  absence of IsdHN3 on the cobalt resin (data not shown).
This  indicates that the proteins do not interact with each another,  consistent with the ELISA data (Fig. 3C).
Second, when HisIsdHN3 is eluted from the resin with imidazole after incubation  with MetHb, the UV spectrum of the eluate indicates that  IsdHN3 has acquired heme (data not shown).
Taken together  these results indicate that the IsdHN3 domain is capable of  acquiring heme from MetHb and that heme transfer to IsdHN3  does not require stable protein-protein interactions.
  The rate of heme transfer from MetHb to IsdHN3 was determined by varying the amount of time the proteins were incubated with one another before separation (Fig. 4B, open circles).
  The transfer data can be adequately fit to the single exponential  equation A  (Af  A0)(1  etkobs)  A0, where A0 is the initial  absorbance of the MetHb solution before incubating with  IsdHN3, and Af is the final absorbance of MetHb in the eluate.
  This yields a rate constant (kobs), which under the experimental  conditions used describes the rate at which a single heme molecule is released from the  subunit of the MetHb heterodimer  (detailed under Experimental Procedures).
The value of kobs is  4.4  0.33 h1  , which is similar to the previously reported rate  of spontaneous heme release from the  chain of MetHb (7.8   2.0 h1 at pH 7.0, 37 C) (32).
We next investigated whether  IsdHN1 binding to MetHb accelerates the rate at which heme is  transferred to IsdHN3.
The heme transfer assay was repeated  where MetHb was first preincubated with a 3-fold molar excess  of IsdHN1. At this ratio we have previously shown that a  IsdHN1-MetHb complex forms that has a stoichiometry of 2:1  (25).
Thus, in this experiment the rate of transfer from the  IsdHN1-MetHb complex to His-IsdHN3 is measured.
As shown  in Fig. 4B, closed circles), IsdHN1 binding to MetHb increases  FIGURE 4.

  NEAT Domains Extract Heme from Methemoglobin  1172 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 284NUMBER 2JANUARY 9, 2009   at University of Sydney on May 1, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from the rate of hemin transfer to His-IsdHN3 by 2-fold (kobs   10.9  0.65 h1  ).
  To determine whether the IsdC NEAT domain also acquires  heme from MetHb, the transfer assay was repeated using HisIsdC as the receptor attached to talon beads instead of HisIsdHN3 (Fig. 4C, open squares).
Again, the transfer data can be  adequately fit to a single exponential equation with a rate constant of transfer equal to 3.8  0.42 h1  .
Intriguingly, the rate of  heme capture is similar to that observed for IsdHN3 and is compatible with the rate at which heme is released from the  subunit of MetHb (see above).
Similar experiments were performed after preincubating MetHb with IsdHN1.
The rate of  hemin transfer from the MetHb-IsdHN1 complex to His-IsdC  was 10.0  0.84 h1  .
Similar to the case for capture by IsdHN3,  this rate is 23-fold faster than from MetHb.
  DISCUSSION  To cause disease, S. aureus needs to acquire iron from its  human host.
Heme is the preferred source of iron and is harvested from hemoglobin using Isd proteins (57, 9).
One of the  first steps in this process is the capture of Hb or the Hb-Hp  complex on the cell surface by the IsdH and IsdB proteins (6,  19).
These bacterial proteins are closely related to one another  yet are structurally distinct from microbial Hb and Hp receptors found in Gram-negative bacteria (23, 25).
Thus far, only  IsdH has been studied in detail in vitro (19, 23, 25).
Analysis of  its primary sequence reveals that it contains three NEAT  domains: IsdHN1, IsdHN2, and IsdHN3 (Fig. 1A).
Previously, the  structure of IsdHN1 has been determined, and the isolated  IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains have been shown to bind Hb and  Hp (19, 23, 25).
However, the mechanism of Hb or Hp binding  is not known because the structure of IsdHN1 was solved in  isolation.
  Because IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 are closely related to one  another, we hypothesized that they would use a common set of  surface-exposed side chains to mediate Hb and Hp binding.
To  identify these residues, we compared the primary sequences of  NEAT domains whose ligand specificities had been determined  experimentally; that is, IsdHN1,  IsdHN2, and the NEAT domains  from the IsdA and IsdC proteins,  which do not bind Hb with high  affinity (22, 25).
This comparison  revealed the presence of an aromatic motif within IsdHN1 and  IsdHN2 (Fig. 1B, boxed residues).
A  related motif was also found in the  N-terminal domain of IsdB  (IsdBN1).
In IsdHN1, the motif consists of residues 125YYHFF129,  which in the NMR structure are  located within a loop that connects  strands 1b to 2 (1-2 loop) (Fig.  5A).
In conjunction with the surface  loops that connect strands 3 to 4  (3-4 loop) and strands 7 to 8  (7-8 loop), it forms a large surface  located at the end of the -barrel  structure.
Intriguingly, the backbone atoms of many of the residues within this area of the protein are undetectable in the  NMR data of IsdHN1, presumably because they undergo slow  time scale motional fluctuations that are characteristic of ligand  binding sites (23, 25).
  Our results indicate that residues within the aromatic motif  and the surrounding surface loops are important for binding  MetHb (the oxidized dimeric form of Hb that is prevalent in  blood serum after erythrocyte cell lysis) (Fig. 5B).
The most  important binding surface is formed by the exposed side chains  of Tyr-125, Tyr-125, and His-127 within the aromatic motif.
As  compared with the wild-type protein, which binds MetHb with  a KD of 17  10 nM, mutation of these residues causes more  than a 100-fold decrease in binding affinity (Fig. 5B, in red).
  However, not all residues in the 1-2 loop that houses the  aromatic motif are important, as amino acids immediately  before the motif in the primary sequence can be altered without  affecting binding (tan surface near the 1-2 loop in Fig. 5B,  N120A, T123A, and Q124A mutations).
In the structure, the  3-4 and 7-8 loops are in close proximity to the aromatic  motif (Fig. 5A).
Surface-exposed residues within these sites also  contribute to MetHb binding, although to a lesser extent.
The  3-4 loop appears to be more important as mutations in it  reduce binding 10-fold (Fig. 5B, dark purple) as compared  with 3 4-fold reductions when residues within the 7-8 loop  are altered (Fig. 5B, pink).
Because mutations that alter surfaceexposed side chains elsewhere in the protein have little effect on  binding, we conclude that the primary interface for MetHb  binding is located at the end of the -barrel structure.
IsdHN1  and MetHb form a complex that has a stoichiometry of 2:1 (25).
  This suggests that IsdHN1 interacts with both the  and  subunits of MetHb.
Residues within the aromatic motif may adaptively recognize the distinct binding surfaces of these subunits,  as NMR studies suggest that residues in the motif are mobile in  the apo state (2628).
  IsdH is also the sole Hp receptor in S. aureus asisdH strains  are unable to bind Hp (19).
Because Hp binds MetHb with a KD   1015 M, IsdH binding to Hp may enable S. aureus to coat  FIGURE 5.

  NEAT Domains Extract Heme from Methemoglobin  JANUARY 9, 2009VOLUME 284NUMBER 2 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 1173   at University of Sydney on May 1, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from itself with this high affinity MetHb receptor.
It is also possible  that Hp coating of the cell surface enables the bacterium to  disguise itself immunologically to prevent targeting by the host  immune response (23).
Our results indicate that IsdHN1 binds  Hp with a KD of 35  10 nM. This affinity is higher than previously reported values determined by SPR (23).
Presumably this  difference is caused by the way we performed the binding assay.
  In our assay, Hp is conjugated to a CM5 chip, and binding is  measured by passing different concentrations of IsdHN1 over it.
  In contrast, previous studies have used the reverse approach;  IsdHN1 was adhered to the chip, and Hp was passed over it (23).
  With this prior approach a biphasic association curve was  observed that contained both a fast and slow association phase.
  The slower phase describes a weaker binding event with a  measured KD of 5M, whereas the faster phase characterizing  a stronger interaction was not quantified.
Because our sensograms have single phase behavior, they enable us to determine  the dissociation constant for the high affinity interaction and  reveal that IsdHN1 is capable of binding Hp and MetHb with  similar nanomolar affinities (35 and 17 nM, respectively).
  Interestingly, residues in the aromatic motif required for Hb  binding also play an essential role in Hp recognition (Table 1  and Fig. 5C).
The most important residues are Tyr-125, His127, Phe-128, and Phe-129, which when mutated completely  disrupt binding.
Surprisingly, amino acid mutations in the surrounding 3-4 and 7-8 loops as well as in other regions of  IsdHN1 have no detectable effect on Hp binding (Fig. 5C, tan).
  This suggests that the interface between IsdHN1 and Hp is  largely restricted to residues in the aromatic motif, in contrast  to the MetHb binding surface, which also includes residues  located in the surrounding loops (compare Figs. 5, B and C).
  Interestingly, the residues in the aromatic motif of IsdHN2 and  IsdBN1 are identical (see Fig. 1B, boxed sequence).
However,  only IsdHN2 binds Hp, whereas the full-length IsdB protein  does not (19, 23, 25).
This argues against the 1-2 loop being  the sole binding surface for Hp.
It is possible that more drastic  non-conservative amino acid substitutions are required to  identify residues important for Hp that are located outside of  the aromatic motif.
  Our finding that the same surface on IsdHN1 contacts MetHb  and Hp is surprising considering that these proteins are structurally unrelated to one another.
Although their names imply  that they both adopt a globin fold, only the  and  subunits  within the MetHb heterodimer possess a globin structure.
In  contrast, the structure of Hp is not known; however, based on  primary sequence homology, its -chain may adopt a fold  related to the serine proteases (33).
Previous modeling studies  of Hp have suggested that it contains two hydrophobic surfaces  that may enable it to function as a protein chaperone (34).
To  further investigate how IsdHN1 might interact with MetHb and  Hp, we used the program ClusPro to model the structures of the  IsdHN1-MetHb and IsdHN1-Hp complexes (35).
The docking  calculations made use of the NMR structure of IsdHN1, the  crystal structure of carboxyhemoglobin (pdb 1IRD), and a  model of the structure of Hp generated using the structure of  the human complement C1S protease as a template (pdb 1ELV,  which shares 33% sequence identity with residues 91 to 406 of  Hp) (36, 37).
In both sets of docking calculations, the predominant solution obtained positioned the aromatic motif within  IsdHN1 at the protein-protein interface.
In addition, this structural element tended to be inserted between the  and   domains of Hb and the protease-like and complement-like  modules in Hp (data not shown).
However, a molecular level  understanding of recognition will require the determination of  the three-dimensional structures of the IsdHN1-MetHb and  IsdHN1-Hp complexes by either NMR spectroscopy or x-ray  crystallography.
  Our results indicate that IsdH contains a third, previously  uncharacterized heme binding NEAT domain at its C terminus  (IsdHN3) (Fig. 3C).
Its mode of heme binding can be predicted  from the recently determined structures of the metalloprotoporphyrin complexes of the IsdA and IsdC NEAT domains  (2628).
Although IsdHN3 shares only 1523% sequence identity with IsdA and IsdC, residues that form the heme binding  pocket in these proteins are generally conserved (residues are  underlined in Fig. 1C).
Of particular interest is the presence of  an invariant tyrosine residue that coordinates the central metal  ion of the heme: Tyr166 (IsdA), Tyr132 (IsdC), and Tyr642  (IsdHN3) (2628).
Assuming that IsdHN3 adopts a conventional  NEAT domain fold, it seems likely that it will bind heme in a  similar manner through an exposed pocket located at the end of  a -barrel structure.
The walls of the heme binding pocket  would be formed by residues within strands 7 and 8 as well as  residues within the loops that connect strands 1b to 2 (1-2  loop) and strands 3 to 4 (3-4 loop).
Our data indicate that  IsdHN3 binds metalloprotoporphyrins with a KD  2.8  0.1  M. The IsdC proteins from S. aureus and B. anthracis also bind  heme weakly (12, 28).
This is compatible with the IsdH and  IsdC physiological role in heme transport, because they presumably need to rapidly bind and release heme as it is transferred across the cell wall (12, 28).
The weak affinity of these  proteins is also consistent with the recently determined structures of IsdA and IsdC, as in them only 35% of the solventaccessible surface area of the protoporphrin ring is contacted by  the protein (2628).
  An overview of how the NEAT domains within IsdH might  function in heme capture is shown in Fig. 6.
Upon erythrocyte  lysis large quantities of tetrameric ferrous Hb is released into  the blood, which rapidly oxidizes and dissociates into dimeric  MetHb (14).
The IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains bind MetHb  with nanomolar affinity, tethering it to the cell surface (step 1).
  Heme is then released and captured by the adjacent IsdHN3  domain (step 2).
This process is passive as the measured rate of  transfer from MetHb to IsdHN3 is 4.4/h (Fig. 4B), which is  similar to the rate at which heme spontaneous dissociates from  MetHb (12, 28).
Heme bound to IsdHN3 then presumably dissociates where it can be either recaptured by MetHb or transferred to either IsdA or IsdC within the cell wall (step 3).
It is  also conceivable that heme is directly transferred from IsdHN3  to IsdA and/or IsdC through activated protein-protein complexes, as this mechanism of transfer has been shown to occur  between the IsdA and IsdC proteins (38).
In addition, our  results indicate that IsdC can also directly capture heme that is  released from MetHb (Fig. 4C); however, this process would  seem to occur less frequently as IsdC is presumably positioned  more distal to MetHb than IsdHN3.
This model of heme transNEAT Domains Extract Heme from Methemoglobin  1174 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 284NUMBER 2JANUARY 9, 2009   at University of Sydney on May 1, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from fer is compatible with recent studies by the Lei and co-workers  (39), which have shown that the IsdA and IsdC proteins can  acquire heme that is released from MetHb.
  The IsdB protein also functions as a MetHb and heme receptor in S. aureus (19, 23, 25).
As shown in Fig. 1A, it contains two  NEAT domains, IsdBN1 and IsdBN2.
The IsdBN1 domain is most  closely related to the IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains.
In contrast,  the C-terminal IsdBN2 domain is most closely related to  IsdHN3, and it contains conserved residues that presumably  enable it to bind heme (Fig. 1B).
This suggests IsdB and IsdH  capture heme from MetHb through a similar mechanism;  MetHb is bound by IsdBN1, and released heme is scavenged by  the IsdBN2 domain.
Interestingly, Lei and co-workers have  shown that heme transfer from MetHb to the full-length IsdB  protein occurs at rates that are much faster than the rate of  spontaneous heme release from MetHb (38, 39).
This suggests  that MetHb binding to the full-length IsdB protein stimulates  heme release.
Our finding that binding of the isolated IsdHN1  domain to MetHb only modestly increases the rate of heme  transfer to IsdHN3 may explain why IsdB has been proposed to  play a more important role than IsdH in the in vivo capture of  heme from hemoglobin (19, 23, 25).
Alternatively, it suggests  that the NEAT domains within IsdH and IsdB need to be part of  the same polypeptide, that is, act in cis to effectively capture  heme.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to test the degree of  synergy between the NEAT domains within IsdH because the  full-length protein degrades during purification.
  In conclusion, we have shown that IsdH captures heme from  MetHb using three NEAT domains that have different ligand  binding specificities.
The IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 bind MetHb and  Hp, whereas a third C-terminal IsdHN3 domain captures  released heme.
Analogous NEAT domains are present in IsdB  based on primary sequence homology, suggesting that it will  capture heme from MetHb through a similar mechanism.
We  have also shown that IsdHN1 employs a common surface  located at the end of its  structure to interact with the structurally distinct Hp and MetHb proteins.
Interestingly, structural studies of the IsdA and IsdC proteins indicate that they use  the same site bind heme.
This suggests that this part of the  protein scaffold is acquiescent to change that ultimately determines the function of the NEAT domain.

Schematic showing how the IsdH protein may capture and  transfer heme from hemoglobin.
Step 1, MetHb is tethered to IsdH via the  N-terminal IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 NEAT domains.
MetHb is shown as two hexagons representing the  and  globin chains.
Heme molecules are represented by five-pointed stars.
Step 2, heme is released from MetHb.
Our data  indicates that this process is passive when NEAT domains are in isolation.
Step  3, heme diffuses and is captured by the C-terminal IsdHN3 NEAT domain.
Step  4, heme is released from IsdHN3 and subsequently captured by IsdC located  within the cell wall.
Our results also indicate that IsdC can directly capture  heme that is passively released from MetHb (dashed line).
Note that IsdH and  IsdC are covalently attached to the cell wall by the SrtA and SrtB sortases,  respectively.
