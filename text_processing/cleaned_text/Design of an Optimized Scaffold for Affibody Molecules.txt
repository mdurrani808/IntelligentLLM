Here, we describe the  design process of an optimized Affibody molecule scaffold with improved  properties and a surface distinctly different from that of the parental  scaffold.
The improvement was achieved by applying an iterative process  of amino acid substitutions in the context of the human epidermal growth  factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific Affibody molecule ZHER2:342.
Replacements in the N-terminal region, loop 1, helix 2 and helix 3 were guided by  extensive structural modeling using the available structures of the parent Z  domain and Affibody molecules.
The effect of several single substitutions  was analyzed followed by combination of up to 11 different substitutions.
  The two amino acid substitutions N23T and S33K accounted for the most  dramatic improvements, including increased thermal stability with  elevated melting temperatures of up to + 12 C.
The optimized scaffold  contains 11 amino acid substitutions in the nonbinding surface and is  characterized by improved thermal and chemical stability, as well as  increased hydrophilicity, and enables generation of identical Affibody  molecules both by chemical peptide synthesis and by recombinant bacterial  expression.
A HER2-specific Affibody tracer, [MMA-DOTA-Cys61]-  ZHER2:2891-Cys (ABY-025), was produced by conjugating MMA-DOTA  (maleimide-monoamide-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic  acid) to the peptide produced either chemically or in Escherichia coli.
ABY025 showed high affinity and specificity for HER2 (equilibrium dissociation  constant, KD, of 76 pM) and detected HER2 in tissue sections of SKOV-3  xenograft and human breast tumors.
The HER2-binding capacity was fully  retained after three cycles of heating to 90 C followed by cooling to room  temperature.
Furthermore, the binding surfaces of five Affibody molecules  targeting other proteins (tumor necrosis factor , insulin, Taq polymerase,  epidermal growth factor receptor or platelet-derived growth factor receptor  ) were grafted onto the optimized scaffold, resulting in molecules with  improved thermal stability and a more hydrophilic nonbinding surface.

Introduction  Affibody molecules are small and robust affinity  ligands based on the three-helical-bundle Z domain,  which is a stabilized variant of the B domain of  staphylococcal protein A (SPA).1 Thus, Affibody  molecules are not related to and do not share  sequence or structural homology with antibodies.
  The Z domain was chosen as the starting point for  the construction of novel binding proteins because  this small protein (58 amino acids, approximately  6.5 kDa) was known to have excellent biophysical  propertiesincluding high melting temperature,  reversible and rapid folding, a binding surface as  large as that of an antibody, high solubility in aqueous  solutionsand because it could be produced at high  levels in Escherichia coli.
  24 The exceptional nature of  the Z domain scaffold is further highlighted by the  shortest folding time yet reported for a protein, that is,  3 s.5 Combinatorial libraries containing different  Affibody molecules have been generated by randomizing 13 surface-exposed amino acids located in  helices 1 and 2 of the Z domain.4,6 Affibody molecules  with nanomolar and picomolar affinities have been  selected from these libraries to a large range of targets,  including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  (HER2),7,8 epidermal growth factor receptor  (EGFR),9,10 tumor necrosis factor  (TNF)11,12 and  amyloid- (A) peptide.6,13  Multimeric Affibody molecules (i.e., head-to-tail  gene fusions of two or more Affibody molecules),12,14,15 bispecific Affibody molecules (i.e.,  fusion of two Affibody molecules having separate  target specificities16 and fusions of Affibody molecules with other proteins and toxins1720 have been  shown to be functionally active.
Since the Affibody  scaffold lacks cysteines, homogenous site-specific  modifications are possible by the introduction of a  unique cysteine.
This has been done to achieve sitespecific labeling with, for example, different radionuclides and fluorescent dyes.2125 Thus, Affibody  molecules have been shown to be amenable for a  wide range of additional modifications, including  fusions at the N- or the C-terminus.
  Each domain of protein A contains a large surface  interacting with the Fc portion of immunoglobulin  (Ig) G and a partially overlapping surface responsible for interaction with the variable domain of  antibodies containing a heavy chain from the VH3  family.
The latter surface has been defined in the  crystal structure of the D domain of SPA in complex  with a Fab fragment of a human IgM.26 The amino  acids most important for the VH3 interactions are  G29, F30, S33, D36, D37 and E47.
These amino acids  are conserved in all five domains of protein A,  although the B domain has been reported to have  little or no Fab-binding activity.27 The Z domain was  based on the B domain and stabilized by the G29A  substitution, removing a hydroxylamine-sensitive  site in position N28G29.1 This replacement in the Z  domain scaffold has been shown to essentially  remove the Fab binding.28 Amino acid residues in  the Fc-binding surface are randomized in Affibody  libraries, which removes the Fc binding.
The only  amino acid (Q32) implicated to be directly involved  in both the Fc and the VH3 interactions is among the  13 randomized residues.
Although Affibody molecules are derived from the Z domain, weak  interaction with immunoglobulins cannot be excluded, for example, through interaction with the VH3  domain.
  Three-dimensional structures of the Z domain  determined by NMR spectroscopy have shown that  the protein is composed of three nearly perfectly  antiparallel -helices.29,30 This fold is indeed conserved in the NMR-derived structures of the free  ZTaq and anti-ZTaq Affibody molecules.31 Furthermore, structural analysis of the anti-idiotypic Affibody molecule ZSPA-1 in complex with the Z  domain32,33 and the ZTaqanti-ZTaq complex31 has  confirmed the ability of these Affibody molecules to  retain the three-helical-bundle structure upon target  binding.
Thus, the Z domain has been shown to  accommodate an exchange of 22% (13 of 58) of all  amino acids.
  The goal of the present investigation was to  remodel the nonbinding surface of the Affibody  molecules to further reduce similarity to the Z  domain and to reduce any residual interactions  with immunoglobulins while increasing the overall  hydrophilicity, improving thermal and storage  stability, enhancing amenability for peptide synthesis and retaining target binding capability and  folding properties.
Here, we report the design of  an optimized scaffold for Affibody molecules.
In  the new scaffold, 11 amino acids have been  substituted in the nonbinding surface.
Together  with the 13 randomized positions, 41% (24 of 58)  of all amino acids in the parent Z domain have been  substituted.
  Results  Rationale, molecular modeling and procedure  The development of an optimized scaffold was an  iterative process based on substitutions of one or  several amino acids of the HER2-binding Affibody  molecule ZHER2:342.
  8 The results of several single-site  substitutions were used as a starting point, followed  by constructs with various combinations of 2, 3, 4, 5,  6, 8, 9 and 11 amino acid exchanges.
Several points  were considered in the selection of alternative amino  acids for a given position.
A structural model for  ZHER2:342 was generated on the basis of the refined  NMR structure of the Z domain [Protein Data Bank  (PDB) ID 1Q2N],30 and extensive analysis and  modeling were employed to identify amino acids  that might be replaced without disturbing the overall  structure.
In addition, the co-crystal structure of the  SPA domain D with the Fab fragment of a human  IgM antibody was used to select amino acid  replacements that might further diminish the binding  to VH3 domains.26 The amino acids buried in the  hydrophobic core and surface-exposed amino acids  Second-Generation Affibody Molecules 233potentially involved in stabilizing the overall threehelical fold of the Affibody molecules were not  considered for modification.
In addition, experiences  gained from scaffold amino acid substitutions made  in other Affibody molecules, that is, ZTNF:185 (J. G.,  N. H., C. L., J. F., and L. A., unpublished results), or  the Z domain34 were taken into consideration.
  For most positions, several substitutions were  possible.
Increased hydrophilicity and enhanced  amenability to peptide synthesis were considered  in selecting amino acid replacements to analyze  experimentally.
Furthermore, the final molecule  should be detectable by its light absorbance at  280 nm.
Thus, the following amino acids were  avoided if possible: (1) the  branched amino acids  V, I or T, which are not preferred in peptide  synthesis; (2) amino acids with risk for side reactions  in peptide synthesis, such as D, N and H; (3) R and  other amino acids with bulky side-chain protection  groups, because these Fmoc amino acids may lead to  reduced yield in peptide synthesis; and (4) hydrophobic amino acids such as W, L, I, V and F. The  amino acids S, E, K, Y and A were regarded as most  favorable in the majority of the positions.
  All constructs were analyzed by surface plasmon  resonance for their capacity to bind HER2, CD  spectroscopy to assess the thermal stability and  melting temperature (Tm), ELISA to assess weak  interactions with human or cynomolgus Ig or  polyclonal IgM, respectively, and hydrophobicity  plots to visualize changes in hydrophobic regions.
  The measurement of the weak interaction between  the Affibody constructs and immunoglobulins (Ig or  IgM) was possible at high concentrations of immunoglobulins, that is, at serum dilutions starting from  1 in 100 or polyclonal IgM dilutions starting with  0.4 mg/mL. In human sera, approximately 50% of  polyclonal IgM and 15% of IgG bind to SPA and this  binding is VH3 specific.26,35 Therefore, polyclonal  IgM is more suitable than IgG for assessing residual  interactions with VH3, such that a difference between  these two assays in terms of the effect of a  Table 1.
Summary of ZHER2:342 mutations  The amino acid substitutions were made in the Affibody molecule scaffold only, leaving the 13 amino acids of the binding site for HER2  unchanged.
Constructs 1 to 29 have an N-terminal His6 tag.
Constructs 30 and 31 have identical peptide sequences lacking the His6 tag  but differ by the modification at the C-terminal (NEM or MMA-DOTA, respectively).
Results are given for binding kinetic parameters  determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis, the melting point Tm determined by CD and the interaction with Ig or IgM  determined by ELISA.

Values displayed are the mean of two or three measurements.
The  absolute difference or the standard error of the mean was in the range of 1% to 10%.
  234 Second-Generation Affibody Moleculesreplacement may reflect dominating effects on the  VH3 interaction.
  The results obtained for the different constructs  are given below for each individual amino acid  position and summarized in Table 1.
Construct  numbers (e.g. no. 5) are used throughout the text.
  Increased or decreased melting temperatures for  various constructs are given as Tm values in  relation to that of the parent molecule ZHER2:342,  which has a Tm of 65 C.
  Improved stability, hydrophilicity, peptide  synthesis  Asparagine in position 23  Previous experience showed that the sequence  NLNNQQ (aa 2126 in ZHER2:342) was problematic  in peptide synthesis.
Residues N24 and Q25 (bold  letters in the sequence above) are among the amino  acids randomized in Affibody molecule libraries and  thus differ between Affibody molecules with different target binding specificities.
Structural analysis of  the Z domain indicates a hydrogen bond between  N21 and N52 and between Q26 and Q55.
In addition,  the N21A mutation was reported to decrease  resistance to alkali treatment.34 L22, which is  completely conserved in the five SPA domains, is  buried and has several hydrophobic contacts with  the protein core.
The double mutant L22G/N23G  was found not to display secondary structure in the  CD spectrum and has a Tm of b20 C (data not  shown), whereas the N23G substitution alone (no. 3)  caused less destabilization of the structure (Tm,  8 C).
Thus, changes in positions 21, 22 and 26 may  interfere with the overall structural integrity of the  protein domain, and N23 is the most promising  position for replacement in this region.
N23 is  surface-exposed and conserved in all SPA domains  except the C domain, having a threonine in this  position.
Besides the N23G substitution, N23T (no.  2) and N23A (no. 4) were analyzed.
Whereas N23T  stabilized the protein (Tm + 6 C), N23A destabilized it (Tm 8 C).
All three N23 substitutions  led to decreased interaction with human Ig and  IgM. Since the single N23T replacement (no. 2)  showed increased thermal stability in combination  with slightly improved target binding affinity, all  further replacements were investigated in this  background.
  Asparagine in position 3  N3 is part of the N-terminal amino acid portion  having undefined structure in the various structures  and is most likely tolerant to a range of replacements.
  Only the N3A substitution was analyzed in the  current study, because earlier results with the Z  domain and ZTNF:185 indicated that this change  increased storage stability but did not affect target  binding.
The N3A substitution was analyzed only in  the context of 5, 6, 7, 8 or 10 other amino acid  replacements (nos. 911, 2331).
Data from all  constructs analyzed indicated that the N3A substitution had no effect on target binding affinity or on  stability.
  Phenylalanine in position 5  F5 is surface-exposed and conserved in all SPA  domains, except the E domain, having a histidine in  this position.
In the modeled ZHER2:342 structure, F5  is in contact with Y35 (in helix 2) and P38 (in loop  2).
Analysis of the structural model of ZHER2:342  suggested that replacements with Y, W, V, A, T or  H would be preferred.
Only the most favorable  mutation F5Y was analyzed in the context of 2, 6,  8 or 10 other amino acid replacements (nos. 7, 11,  27 and 2931).
Data analysis showed that the F5Y  substitution did not have any effect on target  binding affinity or thermal stability.
Comparison  of constructs 9 and 11 indicated increased interaction with human Ig and IgM in the presence of  F5Y.
However, a decreased or similar interaction  with Ig was seen with constructs 27 and 29 containing F5Y compared to the corresponding constructs  26 or 28 having F5 retained.
A stabilizing effect of  F5Y was seen in constructs also containing E47A  Fig. 1.

  Second-Generation Affibody Molecules 235(compare nos. 28 and 29).
The CD spectrum of these  two variants before and after heat treatment  revealed that the partially irreversible refolding  seen with E47A was neutralized by the addition of  F5Y (Fig. 1).
  Asparagine in position 6  N6 is surface-exposed and conserved in all SPA  domains, except the E domain having an aspartic  acid in this position.
An alkaline-stabilized Z  domain variant contains the substitution N6D.34  However, D is unfavorable in peptide synthesis.36  Therefore, two other substitutions were analyzed,  N6E (no. 5) and N6A (no. 6).
Neither of these  substitutions had any effect on thermal stability,  but both reduced the HER2-binding affinity [a  twofold increase in KD (equilibrium dissociation  constant) value, caused by slightly slower association (ka) and faster dissociation (kd) rates].
Either of  the substitutions in combination with N23T showed  a similar reduction of Ig interaction as N23T alone.
  In the context of the replacements N3A, N23T,  A42S, A46S and A54S (nos. 9 and 10), the N6E  substitution led to a slightly increased KD compared to N6A.
Therefore, in further constructs with  multiple replacements, only the N6A substitution  was investigated.
  Alanines in positions 42, 46 and 54  These three amino acids are surface-exposed and  reduce the overall hydrophilicity of Affibody  molecules.
They are located in the beginning, the  middle or the end of helix 3, respectively.
Analysis  of structure models suggested several possible  amino acid substitutions of which the most  promising, A42S, A46S and A54S, were experimentally investigated.
This triple replacement was  analyzed in combination with 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and  8 other amino acid substitutions (nos. 811 and 23  31).
Analysis of the mutant protein derived from  construct 8 showed that the three alanine replacements had no effect on HER2 binding but abrogated the stabilizing effect of N23T, resulting in a Tm  close to that of ZHER2:342.
  Reduced interaction with immunoglobulins  The co-crystal structure of the SPA domain D with  a Fab fragment of a human IgM antibody26 highlights the amino acids involved in VH3-mediated  binding of Fab fragments.
These amino acids are  conserved in all five SPA domains and in the  engineered Z domain.
Amino acid substitutions  having the potential to reduce VH3 binding were  investigated as described below.
  Serine in position 33  S33 is surface-exposed on helix 2.
Analysis of the  co-crystal structure of the D domain and the Fab  fragment suggested that replacement with K, R, A,  T or aromatic amino acids might be tolerated.
Two  substitutions, S33A (no. 12) and S33K (no. 13), were  experimentally analyzed.
None of the amino acid  exchanges reduced target binding affinity.
However, the thermal stability was further improved  with a Tm of + 10 or + 12 C for S33A and S33K,  respectively, compared to the N23T substitution  alone.
The weak interaction with Ig and IgM was  dramatically reduced with a slightly larger reduction generated by S33K.
On the basis of these  results, S33K was chosen for combination with 6, 7,  8 or 10 other amino acid replacements (nos. 2331).
  Combination of S33K with the other six substitutions N3A, N6A, N23T, A42S, A46S and A54S  (no. 23) did not have any effect on binding affinity  nor on interaction with Ig or IgM. However, the  thermal stability was reduced to the level obtained  with N23T alone (Tm of + 6 C), but higher compared to construct 8 containing the four replacements N23T, A42S, A46S and A54S (Tm of  1 C).
  Aspartic acid in position 36  D36 is surface-exposed, located at the end of helix  2 and involved in VH3 binding.
Analysis of the cocrystal structure of the SPA domain D and the Fab  fragment suggested replacements with E, K, R, A,  N, Q, S or G. Only the two most favorable  mutations D36A (no. 14) and D36K (no. 15) were  experimentally analyzed in the current study.
None  of the replacements affected thermal stability.
However, binding to HER2 is weakened, as shown by  KD values increased by a factor of 3.3 for D36A and  8.2 for D36K.
Both mutations led to reduced  interaction with Ig and IgM. Combination of  D36A with S33K and six other replacements (no.  24) did not further reduce the interaction with Ig or  IgM (compared to no. 23).
Furthermore, the affinity  for HER2 was still reduced, as shown by an  approximately 2.2-fold increased KD value.
Additional combinations of D36A or D36K with other  replacements were not considered for the final  optimized scaffold.
  Aspartic acid in position 37  D37 is surface-exposed, located at the beginning of  loop 2 and involved in VH3 binding.
Analysis of the  SPA domain structures indicates a hydrogen bond  between D37 and S39.
Analysis of the co-crystal  structure of the SPA domain D and the Fab fragment  suggested replacements with E, N, S or G. In  ZTNF:185, the substitution of D37 with S led to  reduced thermal stability, with a Tm of 7 C and  partially irreversible refolding upon heat treatment  (J. G., N. H., C. L., J. F., and L. A., unpublished  results).
Thus, only the most promising D37E  substitution (no. 16) was analyzed.
The resulting  protein showed slightly reduced HER2 binding,  lower thermal stability (Tm of + 2 C) and reduced  interaction with Ig and IgM. Combination of D37E  with S33K and six other replacements (no. 25) did  236 Second-Generation Affibody Moleculesnot further reduce the interaction with Ig or IgM  (compared to no. 23).
  Asparagine in position 43  N43 is surface-exposed, located at the beginning  of helix 3, conserved in all SPA domains except the C  domain having a glutamic acid in this position and  involved in VH3 binding.
Analysis of the structure of  the SPA domain D and the Fab fragment complex  suggested possible replacements with E, D, Q, R or  A. Only the most promising N43E mutation was  analyzed and only in the context of 2, 7, 8 or 10 other  replacements (nos. 20, 2627 and 3031).
Neither  HER2-binding affinity nor thermal stability was  affected, but the interaction with Ig and IgM was  reduced (compare nos. 20 and 7).
Combination of  N43E with S33K and six other replacements (no. 26)  did not further reduce the interaction with Ig or IgM  (compared to no. 23).
However, the replacement of  N with E added an amino acid with a higher helix  propensity to helix 2 and reduced the risk for  deamidation.
  Glutamic acid in position 47  E47 is surface-exposed, located in the middle of  helix 3 and involved in VH3 binding.
Analysis of the  co-crystal structure of the SPA domain D and the  Fab fragment suggested replacements with A, D, Q,  S and T. Only the most promising E47A mutation  was analyzed (no. 17).
The replacement did not  affect HER2-binding affinity or thermal stability, but  reduced the interaction with Ig and IgM. Combination of E47A with S33K and six other replacements  (no. 28) did not further reduce the interaction with Ig  or IgM (compared to no. 23).
However, the CD  spectrum revealed that refolding of the peptide  derived from construct no. 28 was partially irreversible after heat treatment, even though the Tm was  only slightly reduced (compare nos. 23 and 28).
  Addition of the F5Y substitution (no. 29) antagonized this effect, as indicated by the similar CD  spectra before and after heat treatment (Fig. 1).
  Leucine in position 51  L51 is surface-exposed, located at the end of helix  3 and involved in VH3 binding.
Analysis of the cocrystal structure of the SPA domain D and the Fab  fragment suggested possible replacements with Y,  T, W, K and R. Two substitutions were investigated, L51T and L51Y (nos. 18 and 19).
None of the  amino acid exchanges affected HER2-binding  affinity, but both led to reduced thermal stability  (Tm of 3 and 5 C, respectively).
Both replacements showed the largest reduction of interaction  with IgM. This reduction was also similar in  combination with the two additional substitutions,  A42S and A46S (nos. 21 and 22); however, the  thermal stability was further reduced (Tm of 8  and 10 C, respectively).
Therefore, leucine was  retained in position 51.
  Amino acid replacements for the optimized  scaffold  As described in the preceding sections, two  different combinations of nine amino acid substitutions yielded two Affibody molecules with retained  HER2-binding activity, similarly improved Tm and  decreased interaction with Ig and IgM (nos. 27 and  29).
Both constructs differ from the original sequence  in only one amino acid substitution, that is, N43E  (no. 27) and E47A (no. 29).
Since construct 27 with  the N43E substitution is more hydrophilic, the nine  amino acid substitutions present in this construct  were chosen as the basis for an optimized Affibody  scaffold.
  Optimization for flexible production  One aim of the current investigation was to allow  the production of identical Affibody molecules  regardless of the choice of recombinant expression  or peptide synthesis, as well as to introduce a unique  cysteine for site-specific modifications.
Therefore,  further changes were made at the N- and Cterminus, that is, the replacements V1A and D2E  and addition of a C-terminal cysteine in the form of  the sequence V59D60C61.
Combining these changes  with the nine other replacements made in construct  27 resulted in the Affibody molecule ZHER2:2891-Cys  (no. 30).
Conjugation of MMA-DOTA (maleimidemonoamide-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-  tetraacetic acid) to the C-terminal cysteine yielded  [MMA-DOTA-Cys61]-ZHER2:2891-Cys (ABY-025, no.  31), a potential tracer for molecular imaging of  HER2-overexpressing tumors.
  Characterization of ABY-025  The kinetic binding constants for constructs 27 and  30 [the latter blocked with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)  to prevent dimerization] and ABY-025 (no. 31) were  determined, yielding KD values of 18, 60 and 76 pM,  respectively (Table 1).
The binding specificity of ABY025 was assessed with a filter-binding assay (dotblot).
Only binding to HER2 (dot 21) was detected,  but not to any of the other three proteins of the HERfamily, the 16 abundant plasma proteins, or to three  control proteins (Fig. 2).
The specificity of ABY-025  was also assessed by immunohistochemical staining  of frozen tissue sections from HER2-overexpressing  SKOV-3 xenograft tumors and human breast cancer  tissues.
SKOV-3 tumor sections showed positive  staining with ABY-025 but not with the negative  control, a Taq-polymerase-specific Affibody molecule  (Fig. 3a and b).
Only the tumor cells in the section, but  not the mouse connective tissue, were stained (Fig.  3a).
Positive membrane staining was obtained with  ABY-025 in human breast tumors with a HER2 score  of 3+.
Tumors with no expression (HER2 score 0)  were negative (Fig. 3c and d).
The thermal stability, as  assessed by Tm measurements, was 71 C for  construct 27 and 69 C for both ZHER2:2891-Cys (no.  30) and ABY-025 (no. 31), that is, +6 or +4 C higher  Second-Generation Affibody Molecules 237than the that of the HER2-specific Affibody molecule  ZHER2:342 in the original scaffold.
Because labeling of  DOTA peptides with radionuclides requires elevated  temperatures, the stability of ABY-025 to heat  treatment was assessed by the application of three  cycles of heating to 90 C, followed by cooling to room  temperature.
As shown in Fig. 4a, the CD spectrum  was very similar before and after heat treatment, with  minima at 207 and 221 nm, indicating -helicity.
In  addition, the HER2-binding activity of ABY-025 is  retained after three cycles of heating to 90 C (Fig. 4b).
  Figure 5 illustrates the interaction of the parent  Affibody molecule ZHER2:342 and constructs 27, 30  (in the form of ZHER2:2891-Cys-NEM) and 31 (ABY025) with human Ig.
The weak interaction with Ig was  reduced by approximately one log for ABY-025 (no.  31) and an additional twofold for constructs 27 and 30  (Table 1).
  Peptide synthesis  The HER2-specific Affibody molecules ZHER2:342-  Cys in the original scaffold and ZHER2:2891-Cys in the  optimized scaffold were made chemically by peptide  synthesis as 61-mers with AE in positions 1 and 2 and  VDC in positions 5961.
The use of pseudoproline  precursors was possible in some positions for  ZHER2:2891-Cys but not for the parent Affibody  molecule ZHER2:342-Cys.
Reversed-phase chromatography analysis of Affibody molecules synthesized  with or without the use of pseudoprolines is shown  in Fig. 6.
The yield of ZHER2:2891-Cys produced with  pseudoprolines was 22%, which is significantly  higher than the yield of 13% obtained for ZHER2:342-  Cys produced by standard Fmoc synthesis.
In  addition, the number of side products was reduced  in the synthesis of ZHER2:2891-Cys, as shown by  comparison of the reversed-phase HPLC chromatograms in Fig. 6.
The shift of the retention time for  ZHER2:2891-Cys (47.6 min) proved that the optimized  scaffold had an overall higher hydrophilicity compared to that of the parent molecule ZHER2:342-Cys  (51.1 min).

  238 Second-Generation Affibody MoleculesAffibody molecules having other binding specificities, that is, targeting TNF, insulin, Taq polymerase, EGFR (HER1) or platelet-derived growth factor  receptor  (PDGFR), respectively (Table 2).
Grafting the binding surface amino acid residues from  these Affibody molecules into the optimized scaffold resulted in Tm increases of + 4 to + 7 C in four of  the Affibody molecules, comparable to the improvement seen in the HER2-specific Affibody molecule.
  The interaction with Ig was reduced in all but one  Affibody molecule with the optimized scaffold.
The  reductions were in the range of 1.4- to 2.0-fold for  human Ig and 1.4- to 11.7-fold for cynomolgus Ig.
  Discussion  Here we describe the design of an optimized  Affibody molecule scaffold with improved properties and a surface distinctly different from that of the  parent Z domain.
The improvements include increased hydrophilicity, higher thermal stability and  further reduced interactions with immunoglobulins,  improved photometric detection and full production flexibility.
  The effects of different scaffold amino acid  replacements were studied in the context of the  HER2-binding Affibody molecule ZHER2:342.
Later,  the final set of amino acid replacements in the  improved scaffold was also studied in five additional Affibody molecules targeting TNF, insulin,  Taq polymerase, EGFR (HER1) or PDGFR, respectively, confirming the results obtained for the  optimized HER2-binding Affibody molecule.
  Eleven amino acids outside of the binding surface  of the 58-residue protein domain were substituted.
  Substitutions were restricted to surface-exposed  residues with no or minimal known interaction  with other amino acids.
Amino acids buried in the  core of the three-helical bundle or amino acids  having one or several interactions with other amino  acids were left unchanged.
An overview of the  amino acid substitutions and a comparison to the  parent Affibody molecule ZHER2:342 are given in  Figs. 7 and 8.
  Together with the 13 randomized positions  involved in target binding, 41% (24 of 58) of all  amino acids are substituted in the optimized Affibody molecules compared to the Z domain.
This  result further supports the suggestion that natural  Fig. 4.

  Second-Generation Affibody Molecules 239proteins show sequence plasticity, that is, robustness toward replacements, as a result of the  evolutionary process.37 In another natural three helical protein, 43% of all amino acids were replaced  with retained fold,38 and it was suggested that  additional replacements might be possible.
Further  mutagenesis of this protein was based on comparison of the structures of the parent protein and a  highly mutated variant, resulting in a protein with  46% of all amino acids replaced.
In analogy, it is  highly probable that additional positions for replacement in the HER2-binding Affibody molecule  would become apparent from analysis of a structure  determined by, for example, NMR.
However,  introduction of additional replacements that may  improve biophysical properties, for example, thermal stability combined with preserved functionality,  is more challenging.
This was one important goal of  the present studyin contrast to the study of He  et al. which aimed to understand the relationship  between a protein's sequence and its folding into a  three-helix bundle or an /-fold.38  Analysis of the crystal structure of the complex  between SPA domain D and the Fab fragment of a  human IgM suggested that the weak binding of  ZHER2:342 to IgM might be reduced by disrupting the  salt bridges and hydrogen bonds formed between  the amino acids in positions 33, 36, 37 and 47 of the  Affibody molecule and the VH3 domain of IgM.  These assumptions were supported by data on the  proteins having replacements in these positions,  which showed reductions of the weak interaction  with IgM. The largest reduction was obtained with  the replacements L51T and L51Y.
This was not  expected from the structure of the complex, because  L51 is located at the periphery of the interaction  surface.26 Thus, the weak interaction of ZHER2:342  with IgM cannot result solely from interactions with  the VH3 domain because all other amino acid  substitutions made in ZHER2:342 reduced the interaction with IgM, although to a lesser extent.
  Similarly, each investigated amino acid replacement resulted in a reduction of the weak interactions  with immunoglobulins (Ig).
In some cases, increased  hydrophilicity may be the most important factor,  such as replacements in position 51.
Reduced  surface hydrophobicity is believed to be beneficial  for any biopharmaceutical, because this should lead  not only to higher solubility and a reduced tendency  to aggregate, but can also influence in vivo properties, for example, improved tumor targeting, imaging sensitivity and contrast.
For example, increased  hydrophobicity results in higher protein binding  and thereby slower clearance and lower imaging  contrast, as well as higher liver uptake and elevated  hepatobiliary excretion.39 The effect of the chemical  properties of the surface has only been systematically studied for nanoparticles, where it was shown  that a purely anionic or purely cationic surface was  associated with higher absorption to blood proteins  Fig. 6.

  240 Second-Generation Affibody Moleculescompared to a zwitterionic surface.40 However, this  knowledge may not be directly transferred to a  protein, and a systematic study of this parameter for  a protein is incompatible with the requirement to  retain a specific binding surface.
In this study, we  chose the strategy to reduce hydrophobicity and  increase hydrophilicity by introducing a number of  new hydroxyl groups, for example, replacing  alanines by serines and a phenylalanine by a  tyrosine.
However, as discussed above, this study  also shows that hydrophobicity is not the only factor  influencing interactions with Ig.
Reducing interactions with Ig is desired for most biopharmaceuticals,  as this also contributes to reducing the risk for crossreactivity.
  Another goal of the current investigation was to  increase the thermal stability of Affibody molecules.
  For most proteins used as therapeutics or in  diagnostic imaging and biotechnology applications,  increased thermal stability is regarded as beneficial.
  It not only influences drug storage stability, but is  also a general prerequisite for proteins modified  with a macrocyclic chelator, for example, DOTA,  because stable coordination of radionuclides  requires elevated temperatures during the labeling  reaction.
  The surface-exposed residues as replaced in this  study may affect the stability of the protein via  several mechanisms.
Such mechanisms could be  general, for example, a reduction of the exposed  hydrophobic surface area, or more specific, due to  the local environment of the amino acid residue.
  Another fundamental property is the helix propensity of the amino acid sequence.
This has previously  been demonstrated to be of critical importance for  the stability of Affibody molecules.41 Considering  only the constructs with substitutions in the helical  segments (i.e., constructs 8, 1215 and 1722 in  Table 1), we find an obvious correlation between the  helix propensity determined with the software  Agadir42 and the change in thermal stability (correlation coefficient R2= 0.76 for a linear correlation).

  Second-Generation Affibody Molecules 241Both theoretical and experimental foldingunfolding  studies suggest that helix 3 is the most stable of  the individual helices in both the B and the Z  domains, containing 30% -helix as isolated fragments compared to 0% for either of the other two  helices.4345 Most likely, the unaltered helix 3  contributes to the basic stability of Affibody  molecules based on the original scaffold allowing  for several replacements in helices 1 and 2.
In the  current study, the effect of additional substitutions  in helix 3 on thermal stability was investigated with  replacements made in 6 of the 13 amino acid  positions in this helix.
Indeed, some substitutions  that reduced helix propensity, for example, in  position 51, led to strongly reduced thermal  stability, although some of the negative effects of  L51T or L51Y could also be due to impairment of  the interactions between L51 and L22, Q26 and F30.
  The triple replacement A42S/A46S/A54S made in  helix 3 (no. 8) resulted in a smaller reduction of the  melting temperature.
However, as discussed below,  this triple replacement was included in the optimized scaffold together with eight other replacements.
In this context, the negative effect on melting  temperature is compensated for by other replacements, most importantly, N23T and S33K, situated  outside of helix 3 and, potentially, N43E, increasing  the helix propensity of helix 3.
The beneficial effect  of the optimized scaffold on melting temperature  was also seen in the context of four out of five other  binding surfaces (Table 2), with Tm improvements  ranging from + 4 to + 7 C.
The unaltered Tm  observed for the PDGFR-binding Affibody molecule might result from incompatibility of some of  the amino acid residues selected for target binding  with the scaffold alterations.
Notably, the optimized  scaffold does not decrease the thermal stability of  any of the investigated Affibody molecules.
  There was a dual rationale for including the triple  replacement A42S/A46S/A54S in the optimized  scaffold.
Firstly, these replacements increase the  surface hydrophilicity.
Secondly, serines enable the  introduction of pseudoprolines during peptide  synthesis, which prevent beta-sheet formation of  the protected peptide chains.
Reproducible synthesis of long peptides at high yields depends on both  the length of the peptide and the primary amino acid  sequence.
The current study aimed at improving  sequence features common to all Affibody molecules.
During chemical synthesis, long peptides may  adopt secondary structures, reducing coupling  yield.46 One way to prevent this is by using  dipeptide building blocks called pseudoprolines,  abbreviated Fmoc-Xxx-Yyy-OH.
In these building  blocks, Yyy is serine, threonine or cysteine, and Xxx  is any amino acid except R, C, H, M, P and T.47 The  substitutions N23T, A42S, A46S and A54S in the  optimized scaffold enable application of this alternative synthesis strategy in the corresponding  positions.
Furthermore, the replacements V1A and  D2E were done to enable production of the same  molecule by peptide synthesis and recombinant  bacterial fermentation.
The replacement V1A results  in efficient removal of an N-terminal methionine  from soluble peptides in E. coli.
The D in position 2 is  not favorable for peptide synthesis36 and was  replaced by E, as previously done in Affibody  molecules made by peptide synthesis.48,49 The effect  of the substitutions described above on peptide  synthesis was investigated by comparative synthesis of an Affibody molecule in the improved and in  the original scaffold.
Analysis of the crude peptide  mixture obtained after synthesis with or without the  use of pseudoprolines revealed that the yield  increased and the number of peptide side products  decreased for ZHER2:2891-Cys in the optimized  scaffold compared to ZHER2:342-Cys in the original  scaffold.
  Only four amino acid substitutions in ZHER2:342  reduced the HER2-binding affinity.
The largest  reduction was seen with D36K and D36A (approximately three- and eightfold, respectively) and, to a  lesser extent, with N6E and D37E.
Neither the  structure of the SPA B domainFc fragment complex  nor that of the Ztaqanti-Ztaq complex indicates an  involvement of D36 in target binding.2,31 However,  this residue is present in the ZZSPA-1 binding  interface.32,33 In the structural model of ZHER2:342,  D36 is located in close proximity to R32 and Y35, that  is, two of the randomized amino acids differing  between Affibody molecules with different target  binding specificities (Fig. 8).
The results from the  D36K/A substitutions indicate that D36 is either  directly involved in HER2 binding or indirectly  through contacts with one or both of these residues.
  Similarly, N6 is part of the interaction surface of the B  domain, the ZSPA-1, the ZTaq and the anti-ZTaq, in the  corresponding complex structures.
The interaction is  specific in some cases (H-bond) and unspecific in  other cases.
The N6D mutation has been used earlier  to obtain stabilization of the Z domain toward  alkaline conditions.34 In the present study, N6A  and the N6E substitutions were analyzed, because D  is not a favorable amino acid in peptide synthesis.36  Both replacements reduced the binding affinity to  HER2 corresponding to a twofold increase in KD  value.
Because current data indicate that the amino  acid residue in position 6 can be involved in or  influence target binding, it was concluded that  replacement with a negatively charged residue  might bias the binding specificity of new Affibody  molecules.
Therefore, N6A was chosen for the new  scaffold.
  Two different combinations of nine amino acid  replacements resulted in Affibody molecules with  similar HER2-binding affinity, improved Tm and  decreased interaction with Ig and IgM (nos. 27 and  29).
The KD values were 18 and 20 pM, respectively,  compared with 23 pM of the parent molecule  (Table 1).
Constructs 27 and 29 have eight replacements in common and differ only in the replacements  N43E or E47A, respectively.
Thus, in the former, a  polar uncharged amino acid was replaced by a  charged hydrophilic amino acid, whereas in the latter,  a negatively charged hydrophilic amino acid was  replaced by a hydrophobic uncharged amino acid.
  242 Second-Generation Affibody MoleculesThe more hydrophilic Affibody molecule (no. 27) was  chosen as the basis for an optimized scaffold.
The  sequence V59D60C61 was added at the C-terminus  to introduce a unique cysteine (no. 30), allowing sitespecific modifications, for example, with the chelator  MMA-DOTA for labeling with radionuclides (no. 31).
  Conjugation with DOTA did not interfere with the  folding properties of the resulting molecule, ABY025.
The binding affinity of ABY-025 (KD, 76 pM) was  comparable to the affinity of DOTA-ZHER2:342-pep2  (ABY-002) described earlier.49 Thus, selective and  high-affinity HER2 binding was retained for the final  molecule, including binding to HER2-overexpressing  tumor tissue sections.
  In conclusion, an optimized Affibody molecule  scaffold with improved properties and a surface  distinctly different from the parent Z domain has  been designed.
Combination of 11 amino acid  replacements, that is, V1A, D2E, N3A, F5Y, N6A,  N23T, S33K, A42S, N43E, A46S and A54S, resulted  in higher hydrophilicity, higher thermal stability  and diminished interactions with immunoglobulins,  improved photometric detection and full production flexibility, as well as retained binding affinity.
  Fully retained in vivo functionality and very  favorable properties for molecular imaging were  confirmed in a parallel study (Ahlgren et al.,  submitted).
In addition, the results described here  for Affibody molecules in the improved scaffold  confirmed the hypothesis of sequence plasticity for  the naturally evolved proteins, that is, their robustness toward amino acid replacements, as long as  core residues or residues with contacts to other  amino acids are avoided.
In conclusion, Affibody  molecules with the optimized scaffold are designed  proteins with 41% (24 of 58) of all amino acids  substituted compared to the starting point, the Z  domain.
  Materials and Methods  Cloning  Affibody molecules were cloned into expression  vectors derived from pAY00442 containing a T7  promoter,50 a sequence coding for a hexahistidine (His6)  tag, a multiple cloning site and a kanamycin resistance  gene.
Affibody molecules without His6 tag were cloned  into pAY00457, which is similar to pAY00442 but does  not contain the sequence coding for a His6 tag.
All  oligonucleotides used in this study were from Thermo  Electron Corp. (Ulm, Germany).
  ZHER2:342 variants were created by three different  methods depending on position and the number of  mutations in the construct.
Site-directed mutagenesis  was performed with the QuickChange Site-Directed  Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to  the manufacturer's instructions using a vector coding for  His6-ZHER2:342 as template.
  AccI sticky-end PCR was performed with primers  designed in Vector NTI 9 (InforMax/Invitrogen, Frederick,  MD) in two separate reactions.
Equal amounts of  complementary amplification products from PCR1 and 2  were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit  (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and hybridized to each other  through initial strand separation at 95 C for 3 min  followed by a lowering of the temperature from 95 to 25 C  during approximately 40 min.
The AccI sticky-ends  fragment could then be ligated into AccI-cleaved vector  pAY01448.
  Overlap extension PCR was performed by amplification  of overlapping 5 and 3 regions in two separate PCR  reactions.
The overlapping PCR products from the 5 and  3 reactions were combined, purified and used as template  in AccI sticky-end PCR amplifications.
All Z constructs  were ligated into AccI-cleaved pAY01448.
  Expression and purification of Affibody molecules  Expression plasmids were transformed to E. coli BL21  (DE3) cells by electroporation.
Bacteria containing expression plasmids were picked from agar containing kanamycin  and grown at 37 C in 800 mL of TSB+YE medium [tryptic  soy broth (30 g/L)+yeast extract (5 g/L)] supplemented  with kanamycin (50 mg/L) by means of a multifermentor  system (System Greta, Belach Bioteknik AB, Sweden).
At an  optical density (OD600nm) of 1, the expression of Affibody  molecules was induced through the addition of 0.5 mM  IPTG.
Five hours later, the cultures were automatically  cooled to b12 C.
The cultures were then harvested through  centrifugation (20 min at 15,900g) and the bacterial cell  pellet (510 g) was stored in a freezer (20 C).
  For purification of His6-tagged Affibody molecules, E.  coli cell pellets were disrupted in 7 M urea, 100 mM  NaH2PO4, 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0) and Benzonase (100  U/mL; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
After 30 min of  incubation, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation and  purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography  on a 1.5-mL Superflow Ni-NTA column (Qiagen).
The  column was washed with 7 M urea, 100 mM NaH2PO4  and 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 6.3) and eluted with 8 M urea,  100 mM NaH2PO4 and 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 4.5).
Finally,  the buffer was exchanged with phosphate-buffered saline  (PBS) [2.68 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, 1.47 mM KH2PO4 and  8.1 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4)] by using a PD-10 column (GE  Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden).
For purification of Affibody molecules without His tag, E. coli cell pellets were  disrupted by sonication in 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5) and  3000 U Benzonase and heated to 75 C for 10 min.
The  clarified lysate was purified by anion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare)  equilibrated with 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5).
The flowthrough was collected and Affibody molecules with a Cterminal cysteine were incubated with 20 mM DTT for 1 h  at room temperature.
Further purification was by  reversed-phase chromatography on a Resource 15RPC  column (GE Healthcare) using acetonitrile (ACN)/trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/water as mobile phase.
Bound  proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 532% ACN  and 0.1% TFA in water during 20 column volumes.
  Fractions containing Affibody molecules were collected  and the buffer was exchanged with PBS by on a HiPrep  26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare).
  Modification of the C-terminal cysteine  The unique thiol group in Affibody molecules with an  introduced single C-terminal cysteine was blocked with  NEM [Pierce (Fisher Scientific) Gteborg, Sweden] to  prevent dimerization of the molecules.
Briefly, Affibody  molecules were reduced with 20 mM DTT in 10 mM Tris  Second-Generation Affibody Molecules 243HCl (pH 8.5) for 2 h at room temperature.
Excess DDT  was removed by gel filtration on NAP5-columns (GE  Healthcare), and a 20-fold molar excess of NEM was  added to the protein in coupling buffer [100 mM sodium  phosphate, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.0)], followed by 1-  h incubation at room temperature.
Excess NEM was  removed on NAP5 columns as described above, but with  PBS as equilibration buffer.
Coupling of MMA-DOTA  (Macrocyclics, Dallas, TX) was performed as described  earlier.51  Biosensor analysis  The recombinant human HER2/Fc (ErbB2/Fc) chimeric protein, consisting of the extracellular domain of  ErbB2 (HER2, Met1Thr652) fused to the Fc region of  human IgG1 (Pro100Lys330) with a C-terminal His6 tag  (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), was immobilized [1800  resonance units (RU)] onto a surface of a CM5 sensor  chip by amine coupling chemistry.
One surface on the  chip was activated and deactivated for use as reference  cell.
Affibody molecules diluted in HBS-EP buffer  [10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 0.005% surfactant P-20  (pH 7.4)] were used as analytes.
For analysis of the  binding kinetics, three analyte concentrations were  injected in duplicates over the chip at a constant flow  rate of 50 L/min.
The association phase was 5 min  followed by a long dissociation phase (30 min) to account  for the slow off-rate of the Affibody molecules.
The  equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), the association  rate constant (ka) and the dissociation rate constant (kd)  were calculated using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model  with mass transfer correction of the BIAevaluation 4.1  software (GE Healthcare).
  CD spectroscopy  The CD analysis was performed on a Jasco J-810  spectropolarimeter in a cell with an optical path length  of 1 mm.
Affibody molecules were diluted in PBS  [2.68 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM  Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4)] to a final concentration of approximately 0.5 mg/mL. In the variable temperature measurements (VTMs), the absorbance was measured at 220 nm  from 20 to 90 C, with a temperature slope of 5 C/min.
  The melting temperatures (Tm) were calculated by  determining the midpoint of the transition in the CD  versus temperature plot.
CD spectra were taken between  195 and 250 nm at 20 C, before and after VTM.
  Ig and IgM interaction ELISA  Half-area, 96-well ELISA plates (Corning/Costar, no.  3690, Amsterdam, Netherlands) were coated with Affibody molecules (2 g/mL, 100 L/well) diluted in  carbonate buffer (15 mM Na2CO3 and 35 mM NaHCO3).
  The parental molecule ZHER2:342 was included as the  standard on all ELISA plates.
The plates were coated  overnight at +4 C and subsequently blocked with PBS  + 0.1% casein for 2 h at room temperature.
Twofold  dilution series of pools of human or cynomolgus serum or  serum-derived human IgM (Sigma I8260) was added to  the plates starting at a 1:100 dilution (serum pools) or at  0.4 mg/mL (IgM).
PBS + 0.5% casein was used as negative  control.
After 1 h of incubation, the plates were washed  three times in PBS+ 0.5% Tween 20 and goat anti-human  Ighorseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Southern Biotechnology, no. 2010-05, Birmingham, AL) diluted 1:5000, or antihuman IgM (Southern Biotechnology, no. 2020-05) diluted  1:10000 in PBS + 0.1% casein was added.
The plates were  incubated for 50 min, washed and developed for 12 min in  the dark with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as  substrate (ImmunoPure TMB kit, Pierce, no. 34021).
The  reaction was stopped by the addition of stop solution  (2 mM H2SO4), and the absorbance at 450 nm was recorded  with a Victor3 ELISA reader (Perkin Elmer).
Data analysis  was performed with GraphPad Prism5 and an XY nonlinear regression (sigmoidal dose response) formula to  obtain a relative value that represents the level of human/  cynomolgus Ig or IgM molecules binding to mutant  Affibody molecules compared to standard ZHER2:342.
The  serum dilution or concentration of IgM giving an OD of 0.3  was calculated.
The dilution/concentration value obtained  for standard ZHER2:342 was set to 100%.
The calculated  dilution/concentration for the mutants was correlated to  the standard.
A value below 100% indicated reduced  interactions of immunoglobulins with the mutant Affibody molecules compared to ZHER2:342.
  Dot blot  The specificity of ABY-025 for HER2 was analyzed on a  dot blot containing 16 common human plasma proteins,  the four members of the HER receptor family, that is,  HER1 (EGFR), HER2, HER3 and HER4, and three control  proteins.
Dot blot membranes were prepared by immobilizing 0.1 g of each protein onto a 0.45-m nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad).
The following proteins were  immobilized: HSA (Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB), IgG  (Sigma), IgM (Sigma), IgA (Bethyl, Montgomery, TX),  -2-macroglobulin (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), fibrinogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Swansea, UK),  holotransferrin (Sigma), -1-antitrypsin (RDI, Flanders,  NJ), complement C3 (RDI), haptoglobulin (RDI), -1-acid  glycoprotein (RDI), -1-antichymotrypsin (RDI), complement C4 (RDI), IgE (Fitzgerald, Concord, MA), hemopexin  (Agilent), transthyretin (Sigma), streptavidin (Pierce),  neutravidin (Pierce), human Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch  Europe Ltd., Suffolk, UK), human EGFR-Fc (R&D  Systems), HER2-Fc (R&D Systems), HER3-Fc (R&D  Systems) and HER4-Fc (R&D Systems).
The membranes  were blocked in 0.5% casein in PBST (PBS+ 0.1% Tween 20)  overnight at 4 C, followed by incubation with ABY-025  (2 g/mL) in PBST + casein for 1 h at room temperature.
  The membranes were washed in PBST three times for 5 min  and subsequently incubated with affinity-purified polyclonal goat anti-Affibody Ig (1 g/mL, Affibody, no.  20.1000.01.0005) followed by anti-goatHRP secondary  antibody (1:10000 dilution, Dako, Denmark; no. P0449).
  Immunoreactivity was visualized by chemiluminescence  using SuperSignal Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce).
  A ChemiImager 5500 system (Alpha Innotech, San  Leandro, CA) was used for image analysis.
  Immunohistochemistry  The specificity of ABY-025 for HER2 receptors was  assessed by immunohistochemistry using SKOV-3 xenograft tumors and human breast cancer tissue.
  Xenografts of HER2-expressing human SKOV-3 cells  were generated by subcutaneously implanting 107 SKOV3 cells into the right hind leg of BALB/c nu/nu mice as  described earlier.49 Frozen tissue sections of SKOV-3  xenograft tumors were incubated with ABY-025 or the  244 Second-Generation Affibody MoleculesTaq-polymerase-specific Affibody molecule [MMADOTA-Cys61]-Ztaq:3638-Cys as negative control, both at a  concentration of 0.1 g/mL. HER2-scored frozen tissue  sections from human breast cancer patients (ProteoGenex)  were stained with ABY-025 (1 g/mL).
The sections had  previously been scored as HER2 0 and 3+, respectively, by  the provider using HercepTest.
The tissue sections were  subsequently incubated with goat anti-Affibody Ig followed by anti-goat IgGHRP (Dako).
Bound Affibody  molecules were visualized by addition of DAB (3,3-  diaminobenzidine; Pierce).
Cell nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin.
The slides were mounted with  Mountex and examined with a Leica DMLA microscope  equipped with a live imaging camera.
  Peptide synthesis  Affibody molecules ZHER2:342-Cys and ZHER2:2891-Cys  containing 61 amino acids were assembled by means of  the Fmoc strategy on a fully automated peptide synthesizer with an integrated microwave oven (Liberty, CEM  Corporation, Matthews, NC). N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone  (NMP) was used for washing and as main solvent, if not  stated otherwise.
Synthesis was performed at a 0.1-mmol  scale using fivefold excess of Fmoc amino acids (FmocAA) relative to the NovaPEG Rink Amide LL resin  (0.17 g/mmol, Merck Chemicals, UK).
For deprotection,  the resin was treated with 20% piperidine under microwave irradiation.
For the coupling, O-benzotriazole-N,N,  N,N-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU)  and N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in dimethylformamide and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in NMP  were added to the resin at a molar ratio of 1:1:1:2 (FmocAAHBTUHOBtDIPEA).
After each coupling procedure, an automatic acetic anhydride capping was performed using 0.5 M acetic anhydride, 0.125 M DIPEA and  0.015 M HOBt.
For the cleavage, the peptide resin was  treated with 94:2.5:2.5:1 TFA/ethanedithiol/water/triisopropylsilane for approximately 2 h at room temperature.
  The crude purity of the peptide was determined by HPLC  and online mass spectrometry (HPLCMS) using an  Agilent 1100 HPLC/MSD equipped with electrospray  ionization and a single quadropole.
The HPLC was run  using a Zorbax 300SB C18 (2.1 m, 150  4.6 mm) column  and 0.1% TFA/water and 0.1% TFA/ACN as solvent A  and B, respectively.
The column oven temperature was  set to 30 C.
The column was eluted with a linear gradient  of 15% to 40% solvent B in 100 min at a flow rate of  0.5 mL/min.
UV detection was at 220 and 280 nm.
The  purity was calculated by area normalization.
The software used for the mass analysis and evaluation was  ChemStation Rev. B.03.02 (Agilent Technologies, Kista,  Sweden).
  Structural analysis and molecular modeling  Structural analysis modeling of amino acid substitutions was based on the available structures of SPA  domains or Affibody molecules and was carried out  with MOLMOL52 and Swiss PDB Viewer53 software.
The  structures were analyzed in terms of accessible hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface area and specific interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and salt bridges.
Potential  amino acid replacements were selected based on the  desired properties (e.g., reduced hydrophobicity) and  modeled into the available structures.
Models resulting in  steric clashes were discarded, and the remaining models  were ranked using the energy minimization function in  Swiss PDB Viewer.
Each substitution was modeled using  several different starting structures.
Experimental data  were considered whenever available.
The co-crystal  structure of the SPA domain D with a Fab fragment of a  human IgM antibody (PDB ID 1DEE) revealed the  molecular basis of this interaction.26 In order to reduce  any residual interaction between Affibody molecules and  Fab, we identified amino acid substitutions that would  introduce steric clashes or destroy electrostatic complementarities.
The Affibody molecules ZHER2:342 and  ZHER2:2891 were modeled on the Z domain structure  (PDB ID 1Q2N) using Swiss PDB Viewer.
The models  are displayed in Fig. 8 using the 3D Mol viewer included  in the Vector NTI Suite 9.0.0 (InforMax).
