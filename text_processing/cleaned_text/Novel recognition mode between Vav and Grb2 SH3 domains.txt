Growth factor receptor-bound  protein 2 (Grb2) has been proposed to play important  roles in the membrane localization and activation of  Vav through dimerization of its C-terminal Srchomology 3 (SH3) domain (GrbS) and the N-terminal  SH3 domain of Vav (VavS).
The crystal structure of  VavS complexed with GrbS has been solved.
VavS is  distinct from other SH3 domain proteins in that  its binding site for proline-rich peptides is blocked by  its own RT loop.
One of the ends of the VavS b-barrel  forms a concave hydrophobic surface.
The GrbS  components make a contiguous complementary interface with the VavS surface.
The binding site of GrbS  for VavS partially overlaps with the canonical binding  site for proline-rich peptides, but is denitely different.
Mutations at the interface caused a decrease in  the binding afnity of VavS for GrbS by 4- to 40-fold.
  The structure reveals how GrbS discriminates VavS  specically from other signaling molecules without  binding to the proline-rich motif.
  Keywords: crystal structure/growth factor receptorbound protein 2/proteinprotein interaction/Srchomology 3 domain/Vav  Introduction  The Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain is a family of  molecular modules conserved among diverse proteins  (Birge et al., 1996), which functions in proteinprotein  interactions for intracellular signal transduction.
These  interactions are mediated commonly among the SH3  domain-containing proteins through the recognition of a  short proline-rich sequence embedded in proteins (Feng  et al., 1994; Lim et al., 1994; Terasawa et al., 1994).
To  accomplish the high specicity and proper afnity for the  SH3 domain, the peptide must adopt a polyproline-type II  (PPII) helical conformation.
The most famous example of  this recognition is the interaction of growth factor  receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) with son of sevenless  (Sos), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras.
  Grb2 is an adaptor protein consisting of one SH2 domain  anked by two SH3 domains.
It has been well established  that Grb2 transmits the upstream signal through its  association with proline-rich regions of Sos, via the SH3  domains (Egan et al., 1993).
As other targets of the Grb2  SH3 domains, proline-rich proteins such as Cbl, dynamin  and WASP have been reported (reviewed in Buday, 1999).
  Vav is among the proposed targets of Grb2 (Machide et al.,  1995; Hanazono et al., 1996; Miyakawa et al., 1997).
  Vav is a protein with a molecular mass of 95 kDa, which  is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells (Katzav  et al., 1989).
Vav contains a calponin-homology domain, a  Dbl-homology domain, a pleckstrin-homology domain, an  SH2 domain and two SH3 domains.
Numerous biochemical studies have established that Vav plays pivotal roles in  lymphocyte cell differentiation and proliferation, lymphokine production and cytoskeletal reorganization (reviewed  in Bustelo, 2000).
These cellular responses are induced  by extracellular stimuli to various receptors, most of  which trigger rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav.
  The C-terminal region of Vav arranged in the order  SH3SH2SH3 is required for its transforming activity  (reviewed in Bustelo, 1996).
The downstream molecules  of Vav include members of the Rho/Rac family of small  G proteins.
The Dbl-homology domain of Vav is the  guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 that activates  the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (Crespo et al., 1997).
  As suggested by its structure, an array of signaling proteins  is associated with Vav.
In manners that are dependent or  independent of the extracellular stimuli, Vav is recruited to  the multiple protein assemblies at the plasma membrane  together with some of these proteins.
Such signaling  proteins include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Lahesmaa  et al., 1995), Slp76 (Tuosto et al., 1996) and Shc (RamosMorales et al., 1994; Pedraza-Alva et al., 1998) in T cells,  Slp65 (Wienands et al., 1998) in B cells, and Raf1 and  mitogen-activated protein kinase (Song et al., 1996) in  mast cells.
It is notable that Grb2 also participates in these  multiple protein assemblies, supporting the importance of  Grb2 as an assembler of Vav and other molecules in the  signaling complexes.
Recent studies have focused on the  transition mechanisms of Vav from the cytoplasm to  cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains (GEMs)  (Simons and Ikonen, 1997).
Vav is proposed to be tethered  to GEMs by Grb2 (Kim et al., 1998; Salojin et al., 2000).
  The Grb2 recognition of Vav is notable as compared  with the classical SH3 recognition of peptide ligands,  because it is mediated through the dimerization of the SH3  domains in both molecules.
Using a yeast two-hybrid  Novel recognition mode between Vav and Grb2  SH3 domains  The EMBO Journal Vol. 20 No. 12 pp.
29953007, 2001   European Molecular Biology Organization 2995screening and a lter-binding assay, it was conrmed that  Vav binds to the Grb2 C-terminal SH3 domain via its own  SH3 domain located on the N-terminal side of the SH2  domain (Ye and Baltimore, 1994; Ramos-Morales et al.,  1995).
To understand further the role of the Vav SH3  domain in signal transduction in the immune system, and  to elucidate how Vav is recognized by Grb2 in the context  of the entire domain, we have solved the crystal structure  of the N-terminal SH3 domain of Vav complexed with the  C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2.
On the basis of the  crystal structure of the complex and the mutagenesis  study, we present details of the proteinprotein interaction  by the SH3 domains independent of the recognition of the  PPII helix.
  Results  Structure determination  The crystal structure of the N-terminal SH3 domain of Vav  (VavS: residues 595660 of mouse Vav) (Adams et al.,  1992) complexed with the C-terminal SH3 domain of  Grb2 (GrbS: residues 159217 of human Grb2) was  determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR)  (Table I).
The complex was crystallized as one VavS and  two GrbS molecules contained in an asymmetric unit.
The  nal model at 1.68 A resolution was rened to an R-factor  of 20.7% (Table II).
All of the non-glycine residues are  located within the most favored or additionally allowed  regions on the Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan and  Ramachandran, 1965).
The crystal structure of GrbS-free  VavS was also solved by molecular replacement utilizing  the structure of GrbS-bound VavS. The GrbS-free VavS  crystal contains four VavS molecules in an asymmetric  unit, and the model at 2.1 A resolution was rened to an  R-factor of 19.6%.
  Overall structure of GrbS-bound VavS  The three-dimensional structure of GrbS-bound VavS and  a stereo view of its a carbons are shown in Figure 1A and  B, respectively.
VavS is folded into the canonical topology  conserved among all SH3 domain-containing proteins  (Noble et al., 1993).
Two antiparallel b-sheets, each  consisting of three b-strands, are folded together so as to  form a b-barrel as a whole.
bA forms the smaller b-sheet  together with bE and bB, while bC together with bB and  bD forms the larger one.
The two b-sheets are packed  against each other at an approximate right angle.
In  accordance with previous reports, the loops consisting of  residues 600623, 630635 and 642646 are designated as  the RT, n-Src and distal loops, respectively.
There are two  remarkable features of VavS as compared with known  SH3 domain proteins.
  First, the RT loop of VavS is particularly notable for its  unusual extension (Figure 2).
The loop is arranged against  the b-barrel such that it caps one of the ends (Figure 1A),  and contains a continuous tetraproline sequence  (607610).
The tetraproline region, which is in the PPII  helical conformation, forms a close hydrophobic contact  on the surface of the b-barrel (Figure 3).
The pyrrolidine  ring of Pro609 packs tightly into a hydrophobic pocket that  is formed on the b-barrel surface as framed by Tyr603,  Phe613, Gly614, Phe616 and Trp636, and thus is a pivot of  this contact.
Pro607 is located proximately to the side  chains of Tyr603, Trp636 and Arg654.
Pro610 that  immediately succeeds Pro609 stacks closely against the  side chains of Phe613 and Trp636.
A hydrogen bond  between the carbonyl group of Pro607 and the side chain  of Tyr603 appears to be important for the stability of the  backbone conformation of the tetraproline region.
In  contrast, the side chain of Pro608 is projected to the  direction opposite to the b-barrel surface and does not  contribute to any intra-domain interaction.
  Next, on another end of the b-barrel, the N- and  C-terminal parts and the n-Src loop are assembled  (Figure 1).
This region includes the concave surface,  which can be compared with a valley (Figure 5A and B).
  The valley runs on the base of the b-barrel and its  dimensions are 15 A in length, 8 A in width and 5 A in  Table I.

The valley is lined at its bottom with hydrophobic  residues, Met597, Leu627, Ala630 and Trp637, and is  bordered by two side walls, one of which is dened by the  N- and C-terminal residues of Pro595 and Pro657, and  the other by residues 631634 in the n-Src loop.
Regarding the four VavS molecules in the GrbS-free form,  their structures are essentially identical to that of the  GrbS-bound form.
The most deviating regions from  the GrbS-bound form are in the RT (611613) and n-Src  loops (631634) (Figure 1B).
  Implications for the recognition of proline-rich  peptides  In principle, the PPII helix of the peptide ligand is  recognized by the SH3 domain, with one face of the  trigonal prism packing into the hydrophobic pockets  named P3, P1, P0, P+2 and P+3 (notated by Yu et al.,  1994).
The PxxPxR motif (x = any amino acid) (minus  orientation) is conserved as a minimum consensus in the  proline-rich peptides, and two prolines and an arginine  within the motif occupy the P+2, P1 and P3 sites,  respectively (Feng et al., 1994; Lim et al., 1994; Terasawa  et al., 1994).
To clarify the features of the corresponding  region of VavS, a mouse Sos-derived peptide (PPPVPPR),  which is bound to the C-terminal SH3 domain of Sem-5 in  the minus orientation (Lim et al., 1994), was placed on the  expected binding site on the VavS surface (Figure 3B).
  Note that the numbering of the sites runs counter to the  direction of the peptide ligand.
Some structural features of  VavS must make it impossible to bind to proline-rich  peptides.
  First, the binding of VavS to the external peptides would  be occluded due to the steric hindrance with its own  tetraproline region (Figure 3B).
In order to recognize the  proline-rich peptide, detachment of the tetraproline region  from the molecular surface is necessary.
However, the  intra-domain interactions around Pro609 are tight and  seem to contribute signicantly to the stability of the VavS  core (Figure 3).
Indeed, the mutation of Tyr603 to  phenylalanine, which disrupts the hydrogen bond between  the side chain of Tyr603 and the carbonyl group of Pro607,  caused a large decrease in the protein's solubility (our  unpublished result).
The crystal structures of the GrbS-free  VavS molecules also support this idea, because the  structures and the intra-domain recognition modes of the  tetraproline region of the four molecules are identical to  those of the GrbS-bound form (Figure 1B), suggesting that  this region remains rigid irrespective of the crystallization  conditions.
Next, even if the tetraproline region was  detached from the intra-domain binding site, VavS could  not bind to the peptide ligand because it lacks some  prerequisites for PPII helix binding.
The acidic residue,  which is indispensable for the peptide binding through  electrostatic interactions with an arginine of the peptide  ligand, is absent at the expected P3 site of VavS. The  aromatic amino acids dening the P+2 and P+3 sites, which  are phenylalanine or tyrosine in general, are also replaced  by Arg654 and Gln601 in VavS. As a result, the  hydrophobic interactions between the conserved aromatic  side chains and the proline of the peptide ligand at the P+2  site, which are essential for the recognition of the peptide  ligand, are lost (Nguyen et al., 1998).
  Biochemical studies are also consistent with this view  derived from the present crystal structure.
The C-terminal  SH3 domain of Vav has been reported to bind to some  proline-rich proteins (reviewed in Bustelo, 1996), whereas  no targets for VavS other than Cbl-b have yet been  proposed.
For the binding of Cbl-b, both SH3 domains of  Vav might function synergistically (Bustelo et al., 1997).
  Therefore, we have demonstrated that the functional  signicance of VavS is not in the binding to proline-rich  molecules.
  Interfaces between the VavS and GrbS molecules  in the complex crystal  In the complex crystal, VavS closely contacts two GrbS  molecules, GrbS A and GrbS B, at two separate interfaces  (Figure 4).
The structures of GrbS A and GrbS B are  essentially identical to those determined in a previous  report (Maignan et al., 1995).
The areas of the solventaccessible surface of VavS that decrease through contacts  with GrbS A and GrbS B are 1044 and 877 A 2, respectively (calculated using a 1.4 A radius probe).
  The VavSGrbS A interface  At the VavSGrbS A interface, the N-terminal part of the  RT loop, a 310 helix between bD and bE, and bE of GrbS  A are assembled together (Figure 4).
This assembly forms  a convex surface as a whole, which packs against the  valley formed at the base of the VavS b-barrel (Figures 5B  and 6A).
The side chains of three GrbS residues, Leu164,  Phe165 and Thr211, protrude from the convex surface into  the valley. They are lined along the valley in the order  Thr211, Leu164 and Phe165 from the entrance to the exit.
  In particular, Leu164 and Phe165 in the RT loop are in  close contact with the hydrophobic cluster at the bottom of  the VavS valley, thereby forming a core of the interdomain interface.
The side chain of Leu164 is positioned  in close proximity to those of Leu627, Ala630 and Trp637  Table II.

  Complex of Vav and Grb2 SH3 domains  2997of VavS. As for Phe165, its aromatic ring is tightly locked  into the crevice formed by the side chains of Met597,  Trp637 and Pro657.
These three GrbS residues are not  only in contact with the bottom of VavS, but are also  grasped by both side walls of the valley.
On one of the side  walls, three successive GrbS residues, Arg207, Asn208  and Try209 in the 310 helix, are placed.
The guanido group  of Arg207 loosely covers the face of the side chain of  Pro595, while the aromatic ring of Tyr209 surrounds  Pro657 together with Phe165 (Figures 5B and 6A).
Of  particular note is the space between the side chains of  Phe165 and Tyr209 that is occupied by VavS Pro657,  because it is utilized ordinarily as the P+2 and P+3 sites for  PPII helix binding.
On another side wall, three hydrogen  bonds are formed between the polypeptide backbone of  Ala632 and the side chains of Gln162 and Arg179.
The  side chain of Arg179 is juxtaposed with Phe165 and  partially occludes the exit of the VavS valley.
  The VavSGrbS B interface  The VavSGrbS B interface consists of two sites, which  are discontinuous.
The VavS component of each site is the  RT loop and the n-Src loop, respectively (Figure 4).
The  RT loop of VavS accounts for three-quarters of the overall  area of the VavSGrbS B interface through interactions  with the PPII helix-binding site of GrbS B (Figure 6B).
  The tetraproline region in the RT loop is bound to GrbS B  in a manner similar to that of the proline-rich peptide  bound to the SH3 domain in the minus orientation.
  Namely, Pro607, Pro608 and Pro610 occupy the pockets  on GrbS that dene the P+3, P+2 and P0 sites, respectively.
  The interactions at these sites exactly follow the canonical  mode.
It should be noted that the P1 site of GrbS is  occupied by Gly611 from VavS, which is surrounded by  Asn192, Trp193, Pro206 and Asn208 of GrbS. In general,  this site is occupied by a consensus proline residue of the  peptide ligand.
The polypeptide backbone of Gly611,  however, packs into the P1 site and makes tight contact  with the four surrounding residues.
The electrostatic  interactions expected at the P3 site are decient, since  the VavS residues succeeding Gly611 are separated from  the GrbS B surface and turn back to the VavS core.
Note  that Pro609 is recognized by the VavS core from the  direction opposite to the GrbS B interface (Figure 3).
In  another site at the VavSGrbS B interface, the n-Src loop  of VavS interacts with the RT loop of GrbS (Figure 4).
The  interactions in this site are not as close as those in the  former site, and are rather hydrophilic.
The side chains of  His634 and Asn635 hydrogen-bond to those of Glu171 and  Asp168 of GrbS, respectively.
The backbone amide group  of Asn635 also hydrogen-bonds to the side chain of  Gln170 (Figures 2 and 4).
  Mutagenesis study of the VavSGrbS A interface  To investigate which interface in the complex crystal has  physiological signicance, we analyzed the effect of point  mutations at each interface on the binding afnity of VavS  for GrbS by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements.
GST-fused GrbS was immobilized on a sensor chip,  and VavS solutions ranging from 1 to 500 mM were  injected into the cells sequentially for the measurements.
  As the sensorgram of wild-type VavS shows, the association and dissociation rates of VavS for the immobilized  GrbS were so rapid that the binding afnity was estimated  based on the number of response units at equilibrium  (Figure 7A).
The Scatchard plot indicates that the binding  of VavS to GrbS is monovalent (Figure 7B).
As the targets  for point mutations on VavS, we selected some residues  based on the crystal structure.
The elution proles of size  exclusion chromatography and CD spectra proles  (l = 200260 nm) of all the mutants indicated that they  maintain the folded architecture (data not shown).
The  results of the afnity measurements are summarized in  Table III.

  M.Nishida et al.  2998First, since Trp637 is the major component at the  bottom of the GrbS-binding valley, replacement of its side  chain by a smaller one is supposed to abolish the interdomain interactions.
In addition, the importance of Trp637  for supporting one of the side walls is emphasized, because  it forms a hydrogen bond with the polypeptide backbone of  His634 via its side chain (Figure 6A).
As expected, the  substitution of Trp637 for tyrosine caused a large decrease  (~40-fold) in the binding afnity.
Secondly, two prolines  dening one side wall, Pro595 and Pro657, were mutated  to alanine.
The large decrease (~9-fold) in the afnity  caused by the Pro657Ala mutation agrees well with the  tight interactions of its pyrrolidine ring with Phe165 and  Tyr209 of GrbS. On the other hand, the side chain  interaction of Pro595 with the GrbS residues is less tight  than that of Pro657, and its mutation was relatively  tolerable.
Finally, to investigate the role of the n-Src loop  in GrbS binding, we mutated Ala632 to glycine.
Ala632 is  located at the tip of the n-Src loop, and its polypeptide  backbone and methyl group both closely contact the GrbS  residues at the side of the valley.
The mutation resulted in  an afnity decrease of ~10-fold.
This large decrease might  be caused not only by the loss of the side chain  interactions, but also by the change of the backbone  conformation around Ala632 to the forms unsuitable for  GrbS binding as a result of the glycine replacement.
  Mutagenesis study of the VavSGrbS B interface  Among the VavS residues at the VavSGrbS B interface,  Pro608 and Gly611 are in the closest contact with GrbS B.  The mutation of each residue to alanine or valine was  expected to reduce the binding afnity, if the VavSGrbS  Fig. 2. Sequence alignment of VavS with other SH3 domain-containing proteins.

If available, their three-dimensional structures were used for the sequence alignment.
  Complex of Vav and Grb2 SH3 domains  2999B interface has physiological signicance.
The Pro608Ala  mutation would remove the side chain interactions at the  P+2 site of GrbS. On the other hand, the Gly611Val  mutation could distort the backbone conformation of  Gly611 to the forms unsuitable for GrbS binding by  repulsion between the side chain and the carbonyl oxygen,  or otherwise would introduce steric hindrance at the P1  site (Figure 6B).
However, both mutants retained binding  afnities similar to that of wild-type VavS. Next, although  the side chain of Pro609 does not face toward the GrbS  residues, this residue is one of the key residues at the  interface.
The anchorage of its pyrrolidine ring in the  hydrophobic pocket on VavS appears to support the  backbone conformation around the residues interacting  with GrbS, Pro607, Pro608, Pro610 and Gly611, from the  back (Figure 3).
However, the alanine substitution of  Pro609 barely affected the binding afnity, as also found  with the mutations of Pro608 and Gly611.
  Discussion  Physiological binding site for GrbS  To provide the transient nature of the proteinprotein  interactions in signal transduction, recognition of the  downstream proteins with the correct afnity is crucial  (Nguyen et al., 1998).
The binding afnity of GrbS for  VavS, estimated by SPR measurements, is of the same  degree as those of the SH3 domains for proline-rich  peptides (5.773 mM; Feng et al., 1994; Yu et al., 1994).
  The VavSGrbS B interface includes the inter-domain  interactions that are reminiscent of classical PPII helix  binding, albeit not in the optimal manner.
Since there are  previous reports on the intramolecular interactions of the  c-Src (Sicheri et al., 1997) and Hck (Xu et al., 1997)  tyrosine kinases in which the PPII helix recognition does  not follow the canonical mode precisely, we predicted at  rst that the VavSGrbS B interface has physiological  relevance.
Feng (1994) indicated that an alanine substitution of each proline located at the P1 and P+2 sites caused  an ~10-fold decrease in the binding afnity of the Sosderived peptide for the Sem-5 SH3 domain, thus  emphasizing the requirement of the pyrrolidine ring at  each position.
Pro608 and Gly611 occupy the P+2 and P1  sites of GrbS, respectively, with the former interacting  with GrbS residues in the canonical manner, and the latter  mimicking the prolineprotein interactions by use of the  polypeptide backbone.
However, neither mutation caused  a decrease in the afnity.
These results indicate that the  VavSGrbS B interface is an artifact resulting from the  high protein and precipitant concentrations under the  crystallization conditions.
Ramos-Morales et al. (1995)  reported that the truncated version of Vav, which spanned  the VavS region with the multiple mutations of the four  prolines (607610) to alanine, failed to bind to Grb2 in the  yeast two-hybrid system.
However, they reported that the  double mutation of Pro608 and Pro610 did not disrupt  the binding afnity in the same system.
As the tetraproline region is part of the VavS core (Figure 3), it is  probable that the multiple mutations of this region  resulted in structural instability, and thus disrupted the  binding afnity indirectly.
In clear contrast to the  VavSGrbS B interface, all the four point mutations at  the VavSGrbS A interface caused a decrease in the  binding afnity at a physiological concentration, which  can be rationalized in terms of the crystal structure.
Based  on these results, we have demonstrated that the  VavSGrbS A interface actually reects the interaction  Fig. 3.

  M.Nishida et al.  3000between VavS and GrbS. The signicance of the involvement of the tetraproline region in the VavS core might be  in strengthening the folded architecture so that it is rigid  enough to expose its large hydrophobic surface to the  solvent for GrbS binding.
Among the GrbS-bound and  four GrbS-free VavS molecules, there are few differences  in the positions of the residues at the VavSGrbS A  interface except for the n-Src loop.
In the n-Src loop,  which approximately retains the backbone conformation,  the positions of the Ala632 Ca of the GrbS-free forms  deviate from that of the GrbS-bound form by 1.64.2 A  toward the direction opposite to the VavSGrbS A  interface (Figure 1B).
This indicates that some plasticity  is tolerated around the region when VavS is free from  GrbS.  Structural elements required for GrbS binding  Since members of the SH3 family share the same folded  architecture, it is tempting to suppose that GrbS could  recognize some SH3 domains other than those of VavS in  a manner similar to that observed in the crystal structure.
  However, considering the stringent regulation of the  immune system, mismatch in the recognition of downstream molecules must not be allowed.
Using a set of SH3  domains as a probe (N- and C- terminal SH3s of Grb2 and  Vav, SH3s of tyrosine kinases Abl, Btk, Fyn, Hck, Lck,  Lyn and c-Src) (Figure 2), Ye and Baltimore (1994) tested  the interactions between VavS and other SH3 domain  proteins.
In their report, only the interaction between GrbS  and VavS was detected.
What are the structural elements  that confer on VavS the high specicity required for GrbS  binding?
In Figure 2, the N-terminal SH3 domains of four  Vav members are listed.
Vav2 and Vav3 are recently  identied isoforms of Vav, and their biological functions  are still not clear relative to Vav.
However, most of the  VavS residues crucial for the domain architecture are also  conserved or type-conserved among them, suggesting that  they share similar structural features.
Vav3 also forms a  complex with Grb2 in vivo (Zeng et al., 2000).
Among the  ve residues of VavS that are in closest contact with  GrbS A, Pro595, Met597, Ala632, Trp637 and Pro657,  four residues are conserved in the Vav members.
The  exception is in Vav2, where Ala632 is replaced by proline.
  Although the binding of Vav2 has yet to be reported, the  proline can be modeled into the VavSGrbS A interface  with only a minor movement of the Gln162 side chain of  GrbS. This set of hydrophobic residues is not conserved  among other SH3 domains.
For a comparison, the  molecular surfaces of the Abl and Hck SH3 domains that  correspond to the GrbS A-binding site of VavS are shown  in Figure 5C.
In GrbS recognition, the importance of  Trp637 and Pro657 of VavS is remarkable, as proved by  the mutagenesis study.
Since both residues are the key  elements for forming the surface complementary to GrbS,  the substitution of either for any other amino acid would  prevent binding (Abl, Cys100 for Trp637 of VavS; Hck,  Arg135 for Pro657 of VavS).
Substitutions of Pro595 for  longer side chains (Abl, Asn64; Hck, Ile81) should also  perturb the entrance of the VavS valley, thereby hampering the docking of Leu164 and Thr211 of GrbS into the  valley.
In the same context, small residues at the Ala630  location should also be a prerequisite for GrbS binding.
  However, most of the SH3 domain proteins other than Vav  have a bulkier residue at the corresponding location (Abl,  Tyr93; Hck, Glu110).
Moreover, the n-Src loop must be  in the conformation to dene one of the side walls of  the valley.
This loop is the most divergent region, in  addition to the RT loop, among the members of the SH3  family.
In the SH3 domain proteins other than Vav, the  polypeptide backbone of the n-Src loop largely moves  back from the binding surface, and is not in a conformation  suitable for forming the complementary surface to GrbS.  Fig. 4.

  Complex of Vav and Grb2 SH3 domains  3001Comparison of the recognition of VavS by  GrbS with the classical recognition of the  proline-rich peptide  As shown in Figure 8, the VavS-binding site of GrbS and  its recognition in the VavSGrbS A interface are denitely  different from those of the classical peptide binding of the  SH3 domain.
The binding of proline-rich peptides to SH3  domains is mediated through the recognition of some  steric features of the PPII helix by a relatively narrow area  of the domain surface (~350 A 2) (Figure 8B).

Water molecules are drawn as circles.
  Complex of Vav and Grb2 SH3 domains  3003the global architecture of the VavS molecule is essential  for assembling the key structural elements into the proper  positions required for recognition by GrbS. The high  specicity of GrbS for VavS is thus accomplished in the  context of the entire domain architecture.
  Among the GrbS residues that form the PPII helixbinding site, Phe165, Asn208 and Tyr209 participate in  VavS binding (Figure 8A).
Most of the VavS components  contact these three residues at GrbS sites different from  that for PPII helix binding.
The exception is Pro657.
The  VavS-binding site of GrbS partially overlaps with its PPII  helix-binding site at Pro657.
The pyrrolidine ring of  Pro657 packs into the pocket between the side chains of  Phe165 and Tyr209, which is utilized as the P+2 and P+3  sites in the canonical recognition of the peptide ligand.
A  dipeptide moiety of the ligand, Px or xP, is recognized at  these sites by the aromatic side chains corresponding to  Phe165 and Tyr209 of GrbS (Figure 8B).
Although the  disposition of VavS Pro657 toward them is not in  agreement with either in the dipeptide moiety, it still  interacts closely with the GrbS residues, and thus has a  pivotal role in binding to GrbS, as shown by the  mutagenesis study.
As a consequence, it is explicit that  GrbS could not simultaneously recognize Vav and other  downstream molecules containing the proline-rich sequence such as Sos and WASP.
  Conclusions  Responding to T-cell stimulations, Vav is translocated to  GEMs, where it transmits the signals from upstream  molecules to small G proteins.

Determination of the dissociation constant of wild-type  VavS for GrbS. (A) Sensorgrams for SPR measurements, which were  corrected after subtracting the background signals, are superposed.
  For clarity, only those for the loading of 1, 5, 10, 20, 60, 150 and  500 mM VavS are shown.
The disorder at the end points of the  injections stems from the subtraction procedure, since there was a  time gap between the responses of the sample and blank cells with  each injection.
(B) Using the corrected response unit (cRU) and  including all measurements, the dissociation constant was derived  from the Scatchard plot.
The SPR data are best tted by a line dened  by the equation, y = 16.8x + 333, and have a correlation coefcient  of 0.998.
  M.Nishida et al.  3004brane-bound protein, is among the upstream targets of  Vav, and its tyrosine phosphorylation by ZAP-70 is  essential for the Grb2Vav complex to be recruited into  GEMs (Salojin et al., 2000).
Since the SH2 domain of  Grb2, but not that of Vav, binds to phosphorylated LAT,  the GrbSVavS dimerization is postulated to serve as the  molecular glue for assembling multiple proteins into the  signaling complexes in GEMs.
Likewise, Grb2 is proposed  to transmit the signals from CD28 to Vav in GEMs  through GrbSVavS dimerization (Kim et al., 1998).
The  mutation on CD28 that causes the loss of its binding to the  Grb2 SH2 domain blocks the phosphorylation of Vav and  the activation of JNKs.
  Recent studies have extended the repertoire of SH3  recognition beyond the classical proline-rich peptide  domain recognition.
As precedents for the proteinprotein  interactions in which the SH3 domains are involved, the  crystal structure of the complex of the Fyn SH3 domain  and HIV-1 Nef (Lee et al., 1996), and that of the 53BP2  protein and the core domain of the p53 tumor suppressor  (Gorina and Palvetich, 1996) have been reported.
In both  complexes, other regions in the protein bear the major  responsibility for accomplishing the high afnity binding  in conjunction with the PPII helix-binding site.
More  recently, a peptide motif, RkxxYxxY, which deviates from  the canonical category of peptide ligands, was also  reported to bind to SH3 domains in a manner distinct  from that of the canonical mode (Kang et al., 2000).
To  recognize such a peptide motif or to function as part of a  multiprotein assembly, the SH3 family utilizes its hydrophobic surface with considerable versatility.
  Materials and methods  Protein preparations  The region encoding VavS was inserted into the pET-28a (+) vector  (Novagen) using the NdeIEcoRI restriction sites with the addition of a  hexahistidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site at its N-terminus.
The  expression and the Ni2+-afnity column chromatography of the product  were performed according to the protocol recommended by the  manufacturer.
After the hexahistidine tag was removed, VavS was  puried by chromatography on Superdex 75 gel ltration and Mono Q  anion-exchange columns (Pharmacia).
The nal yield of puried VavS  was 5.0 mg from a 1 l culture.
The sample was ash-frozen and stored at  80C.
The VavS mutants were prepared using the QuickChange sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the constructs used for SPR  measurements were puried in the same way without thrombin cleavage.
  All the mutations were checked by protein sequence analysis or mass  spectrometry.
The preparation of GrbS was according to the previously  reported procedure (Kohda et al., 1994).
  Crystallization and data collection of GrbS-bound VavS  Both VavS and GrbS solutions were exchanged with a crystallization  buffer consisting of 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 9.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1020 mM  dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mM EDTA.
A plate-shaped crystal appeared  within 2 weeks after the protein mixture containing 1.5 mM VavS and  3.0 mM GrbS was equilibrated against a reservoir consisting of 100 mM  imidazole pH 6.5, 67% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 75 mM  MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT at 20C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion  method.
The crystal was grown to 0.5 3 0.3 3 0.1 mm by macroseeding.
  Mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analysis conrmed that the  crystal contained VavS and GrbS molecules in a molar ratio of 1:2.
This  crystal is orthorhombic, belonging to the space group C2221 with unit cell  dimensions of a = 48.05 A , b = 126.82 A and c = 83.37 A , and has a  solvent content of 57.5%.
Diffraction data up to 1.68 A resolution were  collected from a frozen crystal in a nitrogen cryostream at 100 K on a  MarCCD165 detector (Mar research) at beamline 41XU of the Japan  Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (Nishi-Harima, Hyogo).
A gold  derivative was prepared by soaking a crystal in the harvesting buffer  containing a heavy atom reagent at 4C.
Both data sets of the native and  gold derivative crystals were collected at 1.0375 A , integrated using  MOSFLM (Leslie, 1993), and scaled and merged by SCALA in the CCP4  program suite (CCP4, 1994).
The other derivative crystals were subjected  to CuKa radiation generated by a Rigaku rotating-anode X-ray generator  in the home laboratory.
All data sets were collected by an imaging plate  detector, and were processed by DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski  and Minor, 1997).
The results of the data collections are summarized in  Table I.  Structure determination of GrbS-bound VavS  The initial phasing was performed by MIR using ve derivative crystals.
  All of the programs used for phasing were incorporated in the CCP4  program suite.
After scaling was applied to the derivative data sets by  FHSCAL, the heavy-atom parameters were rened and the MIR phases  were calculated by MLPHARE using the data between 10 and 2.5 A  resolution.
The two gold derivatives, collected by a synchrotron light  source or in the home laboratory, were treated as different derivatives.
  The anomalous dispersion data of the gold derivative collected at a  1.0375 A wavelength were also incorporated into the phasing.
The mean  gure of merit for 8915 reections included in the phasing is 0.574  (Table I).
After density modication by solvent attening and histogram  matching was applied to the MIR map using DM (Cowtan and Main,  1996), an initial model consisting of one VavS and two GrbS molecules  was placed on the modied electron density map.
Renement of the  model was performed by conjugate gradient minimization and simulated  annealing with the slow-cooling protocol in X-PLOR version 3.1  (Brunger, 1992).
For each cycle, the model was rebuilt manually by the  molecular modeling program, Turbo-Frodo (Roussel and Cambillau,  1991).
The nal model consists of VavS with the vector-derived  sequence, GSHM, at the N-terminus, GrbS A with the vector-derived  serine at the N-terminus, GrbS B, one MPD molecule and 189 water  molecules.
Residue 660 of Vav, and residues 216217 and 214217 of  Grb2 were omitted from VavS, GrbS A and GrbS B, respectively, because  they were not dened on the electron density map.
  Crystallization and data collection of GrbS-free VavS  A protein solution containing 5.0 mM of VavS was equilibrated against  a reservoir consisting of 100 mM TrisHCl pH 8.5, 30% (w/v) PEG  4000 and 9% (v/v) isopropanol at 4C.
A monoclinic crystal of the space  group P21 (a = 32.21 A , b = 101.12 A , c = 39.71 A and b = 91.34) grew  within 12 weeks.
The crystal contains four VavS molecules in an  asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 39.1%.
After immersion in a  cryoprotectant containing 15% (v/v) glycerol, diffraction data up to 2.1 A  resolution were collected by the home source from a ash-frozen crystal.
  The data set was processed by DENZO and SCALEPACK.
  Structure determination of GrbS-free VavS  The VavS molecules in the monoclinic crystal were located by molecular  replacement using VavS in the GrbS-bound form as a probe.
Using the  data between 10 and 2.5 A resolution, four solutions with a correlation  coefcient of 0.56 were obtained by rotation and translation function  searches in AMoRe (Navaza, 1994).
After rigid-body renement, the  model was rened in a manner similar to that used for GrbS-bound VavS.  Throughout the renement, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints  (300 kcal/mol/A 2) were imposed on the main chain atoms of the four  VavS molecules, except for the regions of residues 609614, 631633,  642646 and 658660.
After the resolution was extended to 2.1 A and  159 water molecules were incorporated into the model, the restraints were  lifted.
The nal model consists of three VavS molecules with Pro595  being omitted, one VavS with the vector-derived methionine at the  N-terminus, and 190 water molecules.
  SPR measurements  GST-fused GrbS was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip via an anti-GST  antibody as recommended by the manufacturer (BIAcore).
The fusion  protein includes a linker of eight residues.
The amount of the fusion  protein on the chip was adjusted to ~1300 RU (resonance units) by  monitoring the change in the refractive index.
The ow rate and the  temperature were kept at 5 ml/min and 25C.
Prior to each injection of  the VavS solution, the sensor chip was washed with loading buffer  [10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% (v/v)  polysorbate 20, and 2.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol] for 20 min, which was  sufcient for the recovery of the baseline of the sensorgram.
The level of  the SPR response was conrmed to be constant using a standard VavS  solution before and after the 15 programmed runs.
To measure the  background response signal at equilibrium, a control experiment was  Complex of Vav and Grb2 SH3 domains  3005performed in parallel using a blank cell in which the same molar amount  of GST as that of GSTGrbS was immobilized on the sensor chip.
A set of  the programmed runs was performed three times for calculating the mean  dissociation constant.
Prior to each set run, the cells were regenerated  with 10 mM glycine pH 2.2, and GST and GSTGrbS were newly  immobilized.
