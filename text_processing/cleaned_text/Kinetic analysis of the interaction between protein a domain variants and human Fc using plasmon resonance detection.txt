Experimental BIA data were used to calculate association rate constants (/con),   dissociation rate constants (korr) and affinity constants (Kd.
The divalent form (ZZ) showed a higher affinity for   Fc, mainly because of a slower off rate.
Out of the five mutant Z proteins, four (L17D, N28A, I31A, K35A)   showed a decreased affinity to Fc, compared to the parent Z molecule.
Surprisingly, two (L17D, I31A) of these   four had the major effect of a decreased binding energy as a lowered k,,, while the other two (N28A, K35A)   mutant proteins showed an increased &,,as the major kinetic difference from Z in their binding to Fc,.
For five of   the six different 2 variants, as well as for the ZZ molecule, calculated K,, and calculated differences in binding   free energies relative to the parent Z molecule (AAG), are in good agreement with the corresponding values   obtained in a competitive displacement assay using radioactivelly labeled Z as a tracer (Cedergren et al., (1993)   Prot. Eng. 6, 441-448).
However, the I31A variant, with a measured k,. that was more than three orders of   magnitude lower than that of Z in the BIA assay, showed a significantly weaker affinity to Fcl when calculated   from the BIA data compared to the competitive displacement assay.
The discrepancy between these two methods   for Z(I3IA) is discussed as well as possible explanations for the unexpected large effect of lowered k,,, for two of   the mutant Z proteins.
  Keywords: association rate affinity; biospecific interaction analysis; dissociation rate; kinetics; protein engineering; staphylococcal protein A.   Introduction   Staphylococcal Protein A (SpA) is a cell wall associated   pathogenicity factor displayed on the surface of the   bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.
SPA acts by binding   the constant region of class G immunoglobulins (IgG)   from many mammals, including man (for a review see   Langone, 1982).
The extracellular part of SpA contains   five highly homologous (about 80% at the amino acid   level) IgG-binding domains (E, D, A, B and C) of   Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.
  Abbreviations used: BIA, biospecific interaction analysis; CD, circular dichroism; Fc,, Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G subclass I; Fc,,   Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G subclass 3; Gdn-HCI, guanidine   hydrochloride; hGH, human growth hormone; IgG,, immunoglobulin G subclass 1; Kart, affinity constant; k,,,f, dissociation rate constant;   k,,, association rate constant; SpA, staphylococcal Protein A.   In this paper, amino acid residues are numbered according to their   position in the corresponding protein from its N-terminus.
The   numbering of Z is as described in Cedergren ef 01.
(1993) and the   numbering of Fc, is according to Deisenhofer (1981).
Amino acid   substituted positions in mutant proteins are given by the amino acid   residue type in the wild type protein, amino acid number followed by   the amino acid residue substitution, e.g., K3SA for lysine 35 substituted with an alanine residue.
  approximately 58 amino acid residues (Uhlkn et al.,   1984).
These domains are individually capable of binding to Fc (Moks et al., 1986).
SPA also possesses a weak   Fab-binding activity (Langone, 1982; Ljungberg et al.,   1993).
The crystal structure of domain B from SpA in   complex with human polyclonal Fc fragment of IgG   subclass 1 (Fc,) has bep solved by x-ray diffraction to a   resolution of 2.8 A (Deisenhofer et al., 1978;   Deisenhofer, 1981).
The structure suggests that 9   amino acid residues on Fc, and 11 residues on domain   B constitute the intermolecular binding surface.
Two   anti-parallel a-helices were found in the SpA domain in   the crystal structure.
However, recent structural studies   of domain B by 2-D NMR spectroscopy suggest that the   B domain in solution in fact has a three helix bundle   motif (Torigoe et al., 1990b; Gouda et al., 1992) (Fig. 1)   and it has also been suggested that there might be a   structural change in domain B upon binding to Fc   resulting in the disruption of helix 3 in the complex   (Torigoe et al., 1990a, b).
Further, by increasing the   valency of a analogue of SPA, going from one to two   domains, the affinity for Fc, increases by almost two   orders of magnitudes (Eliasson, 1990), but no further   Received 12 January 1995   Accepted (reoised) 9 March 1995 ccc 0952-3499/95/040270-09   0 1995 by John Wiley & Sons.

A MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) ribbon representation of   the model of the structure of domain B from amino acids 5-58.
  In this region, the only difference between domain B of SPA and   domain Z used in this study is amino acid residue 29, which is a   glycine in domain B and an alanine residue in domain Z. The   displayed structure of helix 1 and 2 (in the front) are from the cocrystal structure between domain B of SPA and Fc (co-ordinates   lfc2 in the Brookhaven structural data base) (Deisenhofer,   1981).
The third helix (in the back) was built based on the   secondary structure assignments derived from the 3-D structure   in solution obtained by NMR spectroscopy (Torigoe et a/.,   1990a; Gouda eta/., 1992; Lyons eta/., 1993).
The positioning of   the third helix has not been optimized or minimized.
Here, the   purpose is only to display its approximate location.
All displayed side chains, except F30, have been suggested to be   involved in the Fc interaction (Deisenhofer, 1981).
  Non-hydrogen atoms of side chains of residues that were   mutated in this study (L17, N28, F30, 131, K35) are displayed in   grey and those of residues that were not mutated (F5, 09, 010,   N11, F13, 114, 032) are shown in black.
  significant increase in affinity was detected going to five   domains.
  We are employing a protein engineering strategy to   dissect the importance of domain valency and individual amino acid residues in SPA on its binding to Fc,.
  Recently a one domain analogue based on SPA, designated Z, and five mutant forms thereof, were analyzed   in their binding thermodynamics to human IgG, and a   fusion protein consisting of CD4 and human Fc, using a   competitive displacement assay (Cedergren et af.,   1993).
Four of the mutations in Z were in amino acid   residues which were suggested from the co-crystal   structure to be involved in binding to IgG (Deisenhofer, 1981).
These mutant proteins were designated   Z(L17D), Z(N28A), Z(I31A) and Z(K35A), respectively (Figs 1 and 2) and all four Z mutant proteins   showed, as predicted, decreased affinities to human   IgG, and CD4-Fc1 (Cedergren et al., 1993).
One of the   Z mutant proteins, Z(F30A) (Figs 1 and 2), had an   amino acid substitution in a phenylalanine residue   situated in the hydrophobic core of the Z domain   (Gouda et al., 1992) (Fig. 1).
This mutant protein   showed an unaffected affinity to IgG or Fc,, but the   mutation caused a conformational destabilization of 3.5   kcal/mol (Cedergren et al., 1993).
In order to study   kinetic binding properties of the set of Z mutant proteins, BIA was performed.
  Here, we describe the kinetics of binding of a one   domain analogue of SPA, designated Z (Nilsson et af.,   1987) in mono- (Z) and divalent (ZZ) forms, and five   single amino acid substituted Z variants.
The kinetic   analysis was performed utilizing an automated realtime biospecific interaction analysis (BIA) technique   which combines surface plasmon resonance detection   (Kretschmann and Raether, 1968) with micro fluid   techniques (for reviews see Karlsson et af., 1991 and   Malmquist, 1994).
Conceptionally, the method   provides for a general real-time kinetic analysis with no   labels and need for only limited amounts of materials.
  BIA has been utilized to map relative binding sites of   proteins and to study the kinetics of intermolecular   interactions, such as antibody-antigen interactions   (Karlsson et af., 1991; Malmquist, 1994), small peptides   binding to a protein (Altschuh et af., 1992), proteinDNA interactions (Bondeson et af., 1993) and the   assembly of a multi-protein complex (Schuster et af.,   1993).
The method has also been used to compare a set   of single amino acid substituted mutants of human   growth hormone (hGH) in their binding to the hGH   binding protein (Cunningham and Wells, 1993).
Here,   we have used BIA to monitor the interaction between   seven different variants based on the one domain analogue (Z) of SPA and the Fc portion of human IgG,.
  The obtained data were used to calculate association   and dissociation rate constants.
Most surprisingly, two   of the mutant Z proteins showed dramatic lowered onrates of binding, providing the basis to propose a   structural change in the SPA domain upon binding.
  Further, the kinetic rate constants were utilized to   calculate affinity constants which were compared to   previously determined affinity constants for this set of   Z variants (Eliasson, 1990; Cedergren et af., 1993).
  Experimental   Materials   The BIAcorem, Sensor Chip CM5, Surfactant P20 and   Amine coupling kit containing N-ethyl-N-(dimethylaminopropy1)-carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and ethanolamine hydrochloride   were obtained from Pharmacia Biosensor (Sweden).

Z, Z(L17D), Z(N28A), Z(F30A),   Z(I31A) and Z(K35A) were produced intracellularly in   Escherichia coli and purified as described (Cedergren ef   al., 1993).
ZZ was produced in E. coli by secretion to   the periplasm directed by the SPA signal peptide (Nilsson et al., 1987; Nilsson and AbrahmSen, 1990).
The   produced ZZ protein has a C-terminal extension of 17   amino acids (VDANSRGSVDLQPSLSK) .
This short   peptide sequence has no detectable effect on the circular dichroism spectrum or Fc affinity (L. Jendeberg and   B. Nilsson, unpublished data).
In this paper, amino   acid residues are numbered according to their position   in the corresponding protein from its N- terminus and   the numbering of Z is as defined by Cedergren et al.   (1993) and the numbering of Fcl is according to   Deisenhofer (1981).
Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid composition analysis   by hydrolyzing each Z protein in 6 M HCl at 155C for   45 mins.
The samples were subsequently analyzed on   an ion-exchange column and the amino acids were   detected with ninhydrin.
The composition analysis was   performed on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer,   equipped with a System Gold data handling system   (Beckman, USA).
Fusion proteins, composed of the   two N-terminal Greek-key domains from T-cell surface   antigen CD4 fused to the Fc portion of human monoclonal IgG, or IgG3 (Traunecker et al., 1989), designated CD4-Fc1 and CD4-Fc3, respectively, were   provided by Dr K. Karjalainen. It has earlier been   shown that CD4 does not bind to SpA (Eliasson, 1990),   and the result of the competitive displacement assay of   these mutant proteins showed indistinguishable affinities of the Z variants to either CD4-Fc1 or IgG,,   respectively (Cedergren et al., 1993).
We selected   CD4-Fc,, instead of a full-length IgG molecule, as a   target molecule for the BIA since SPA is known to   possess a weak interaction with Fab (Langone, 1982),   even though this interaction was recently shown to be   particularly weak for domain Z (Ljungberg et al.,   1993).
  Driving buffer, lxDB (137m~ NaC1, 2.7m~ KCl,   1.5 mM KH2P04, 8.1 mM Na2HP0,, 0.05% Surfactant   P20, pH 7.3), was used in the buffer flow of the   BIAcore.
To overcome problems of losing materials in   the pipetting and/or injection of the most diluted samples, the lxDB buffer was supplemented with 1%   Gelatine IGSS to dilute the samples that were subsequently used in the association experiments.
All solutions were prepared from Milli Q (MiHipore, USA)   water which was filtered through 0.22 pm filters (Millipore, USA).
  Preparation of sensor surfaces   Immobilization of CD4-Fcl was performed via primary   amine groups as previously described (LofAs and   Johnsson, 1990) utilizing carbodiimide coupling.
  CD4-Fc1 was injected into the BIAcore system at a   concentration of 20 p,g/mL and a constant flow of 5 p,L/   min.
After immobilization, unreacted diimide groups   were blocked by the injection of excess of ethanol   amine.
After conditioning with 15 pL of 5 mM HCl, the   surface was ready for binding studies.
Immobilizations   were performed to approximately 5000 RU.
KINETICS OF PROTEIN A/FC INTERACTION 273   Kinetic measurements and data analysis   A resonance signal is determined relative to the baseline.
The relative resonance signal (RU) is approximately proportional to the immobilized protein mass   (Karlsson et al., 1991).
In the binding experiments, the   RU signal vs time is monitored.
  Each of the seven Z samples were passed by the   CD4-Fc, surface at the following different concentrations; Z, ZZ, Z(N28A), Z(F30A) at 488, 244, 122, 61   and 30n~; Z(L17D) at 2000, 1000, 500 and 2.5011~;   Z(I31A) at 150,75 and 38 PM and Z(K35A) at 488,244,   122 and 61 nM. Association and dissociation were monitored at a flow rate of 5 yllmin.
  The evaluations of BIAcore data to calculate kinetic   binding parameters have previously been described in   detail (Karlsson et af., 1991).
Errors were estimated   from the combined errors expected in the quantitative   amino acid analysis, pipetting and in the calculations.
  The association rate constant (kcj,) was calculated   using the equation:   dRldt = constant - {[(ken x C) + kCjff] x R} (1)   The dRldt is the relative change in resonance signal per   time unit, C is the concentration of ligand in the flow,   kc,ff is the dissociation rate constant, R is the relative   response in the resonance signal and the constant is   k,, x CX R,,, as previously has been elucidated in   detail in Karlsson et al. (1991).
  An approximate koff could be obtained in the analysis   of the association phase [see Eqn (1) above].
However,   this value can be more accurately determined by analyzing ligand dissociation in a buffer flow.
From such   data, kOf, can be calculated using the equation:   In(R,JR,) = koff x (tn - 4,) (2)   The parameter Ro is the relative response at time to and   R, is the relative response at time t,,.
  The affinity constant, Kaff, was calculated from the   kinetic constants using the equation:   Kaff = kon/koff (3)   Differences in binding free energy (AAG) between   each Z variant, respectively, and Z were calculated   using the equation:   AAG= -RTIn[Kaff(Zvariant)lKaff(Z)] (4)   The temperature in the binding experiments was 298 K.   Results   Here, the kinetics of binding were determined for a set   of six Z variants, and the divalent ZZ, using a biosensor   system (BIA) with plasmon resonance detection.
The   objective of the analysis of the different Z domains was   to determine kinetics in the interactions of the different   Z analogues and Fc,.
In addition, the affinity constants   calculated from the kinetic BIA were compared with   affinity constants which previously had been determined in the competitive displacement assay (Eliasson,   1990; Cedergren et af., 1993).

  BIA of the seven Z variants   Recombinant CD4-Fc, protein was immobilized into   the dextran layer on the sensor chip using carbodiimide   coupling.
BIA were performed for the seven different   proteins at various concentrations.
As an example of   generated primary data, sensorgrams for Z at different   concentrations are shown in Fig. 3.
The association   phases were used to calculate k,, (Table 1) as shown for   Z in Fig. 4.
The dissociation of ligand in buffer flow was   used to determine koff (Table 1) for the different Z   variants as shown in Fig. 5.
  Similar association and dissociation curves were   obtained for four of the six other Z variants; ZZ,   Z(N28A), Z(F30A) and Z(K35A), using protein concentration ranging from 50 to 400 nM. For two of the Z   mutants, Z(L17D) and Z(I31A), the slower association   rates had to be analyzed at higher ligand concentrations.
For Z(L17D), the concentrations in the analysis   were 0.25 to 2 PM.
However, for Z(I31A).
the rate of   association was too slow and the ligand concentrations   needed for determining k,, ranged from 38 to 150 PM.
  Calculation of rate constants of binding   The obtained binding BIA data were used to calculate   k,, and koff of the different Z variants (Table 1).

For all concentrations of Z(L17D) and   Z(I31A), which both possess slow on-rates of binding,   contact times between 10 s and 230 s were utilized in   calculating kc,".
The data of the dissociation phases are   shown in Fig. 5.
All except the Z(I31A) show a simple   Langmuir interaction.
The Z(I31A) dissociation phase   (Fig. 5) cannot be interpreted in a simple model and   therefore the intitial dissociation rate was used.
  Specific binding of Z(I31A) to Fc,   A control experiment was performed to address possible non-specific interactions, or possible interactions   with CD4, of Z(I31A) at the rather high concentration   (up to 150 VM) that was needed in the analysis.
In this   control experiment, BIA was performed of Z(I31A) to   a surface coupled with CD4-Fc3. It is well established   that SPA does not bind to human Fc, (Langone, 1982;   Eliasson, 1990), and this inability has been suggested to   be caused by a single amino acid residue difference   between Fc, and Fc, (histidine 435 in Fc, is replaced by   an arginine residue in Fc,) located in the binding   surface to SPA (Deisenhofer, 1981).
In our BIA of   Z(I31A) to a surface with immobilized CD4-Fc3, it was   demonstrated that Z(I31A) does not bind to Fc, in the   50-350 p~ concentration range (data not shown).
  Thus, we conclude that the calculated binding rate   constants for Z(I31A) to Fc, are determined for a   specific Fc interaction.
  Reproducibility of the analysis   In a set of experiments, the reproducibility in the BIA   was studied.
Eight complete sets of association curves   of domain Z at five different concentrations were   collected on the same surface of immobilized Fc, (data   not shown).
Each set of data was used to calculate k,,,   and k,,rt.
All calculated rate constants were within 1%,   showing that the experimental reproducibility is high.
  Calculation of affinity constants   
The kinetic parameters for the seven Z variants were   used to calculate their respective affinity constants   (Table 2).
These values were compared to affinity   constants obtained in a competitive binding assay using   radioactively labelled Z as a tracer (Table 2).
Also,   changes in binding free energies (AAG) between the   mutant proteins and the parent Z molecule were determined for each method, respectively (Table 2).
  DISCUSSION   the dissociation of Z analyzed on the same surface as that of all rn this paper, we have studied the kinetics of binding   using BIAcore of an analogue based on staphylococcal the mutant monovalent Z variants while Z, refers to the dissociation of Z on the same surface as that was used for the   dissociation of ZZ.
Values of In(R,IR,) vs time are shown and protein A, designated z (Nilsson et a[. , 1987;   the slope will constitute kofi (see Experimental for equations).
Cedergren et al., 1993), as a monomer (Z) and a dimer KINETICS OF PROTEIN A/FC INTERACTION 275   (ZZ), and five single amino acid substituted Z variants,   respectively, to recombinant human CD4-Fc,.
Two of   the mutant Z proteins are exclusively effected in their   k,,lf [Z(N28A) and Z(K35A)l and two are effected   mainly in their k,,, [Z(L17D) and Z(I31A)I. These   results are interesting in light of a recent study of the   kinetics of binding of hGH and several mutants of hGH   to binding site 1 of the hGH receptor using BIA.
All   determined k,,,, values for the set of molecules were   within a factor of 3 identical, and the major effects on   lowered affinities for all mutant hGH molecules were   observed as increased k,ff (Cunningham and Wells,   1993).
Thus, these hGH results are in contrast to the   much larger effects in k,, determined for the L17A and   I31A mutants of Z (Table 1).
  The increased k,,ff resulting from the N28A and   K35A mutations can be explained in a straightforward   way since both residues are suggested to participate   directly in binding (Deisenhofer, 1981).
The aliphatic   side chain of K35 may participate in hydrophobic interactions with H310 and I253 of Fc.
Also, in the cocrystal structure, the charged side chain of K35 interacts with a possible sulfate group bridging over to K288   on Fc.
In the present BIA study, and in the competitive   binding study (Cedergren et af., 1993), no sulfate was   added to the buffer.
Therefore, it is less likely that a   bridged sulfate group participated in the binding of Z to   Fc, in the performed analysis.
However, binding   energy calculations using the GRID method (Goodford, 1985) suggest that the sulfate group may very well   be replaced by a phosphate ion at this binding site (data   not shown), and phosphate is abundant in all utilized   buffers for the binding assays.
By mutating K35 to an   alanine, all mentioned possible interactions will be   removed and, according to the binding experiments,   also a rather large penalty in binding free energy will be   paid (Table 2).
In the kinetic analysis, this effect is   found as an increased k,,tr in the Z(K35A) mutant   protein (Table 1).
Similarly, N28 makes a possible   hydrogen bond to the side chain amide group of Q311   on Fc.
According to our analysis, this hydrogen bond is   rather weak, and the lowered affinity in the Z(N28A)   protein (Table 2) is found in a faster off-rate compared   to what was found for the parent Z molecule (Table 1).

  An explanation for the slower association rates found   for Z(L17D) and Z(I31A) compared to Z is that a   structural change, large or small, is needed for their   binding to Fc, respectively.
This becomes even more   interesting in light of the fact that these residues are   part of the helix 1-helix 2 packing surface of the   complexed protein A domain (Fig. 6).
L17 participates   in the helix 1-helix 2 packing in the bound state of the   Z domain by making an intramolecular hydrophobic   contact with I31 of helix 2.
L17, which is situated in   helix 1 (Figs 1, 2 and 6) of the SpA domain, is possibly   also involved directly in Fc interaction by making   hydrophobic contacts with main chain (Ccl and C,) of   Q311 (Deisenhofer, 1981).
By the L17D mutation,   both the possible interaction with Q311 will be disrupted and the contact with the C6 methyl group of I31   will be removed (Fig. 6).
An alternative explanation for   the lowered k,, observed in the Z(L17D) mutant could   be the result of a charge repulsion between the introduced acidic side chain (aspartic acid) and the negatively charged dextran layer in the BIAcore.
However,   this is less likely at the rather high salt concentration   used in the experiment and since the parent Z is   negatively charged at the experimental pH by itself [the   PI of Z has been determined to 4.5 (data not shown)].
  Further, charge repulsion effects from individual acidic   side-chains in BIA measurements have previously been   shown to be much smaller (within a factor of three) as   was found in the hGH/hGH receptor system (Cunningham and Wells, 1993).
Also, the calculated Kaff is in   good agreement with the Kaff determined by a competitive binding assay performed in polystyrene plates   Figure 6.
Computer graphics display of the involvement of 116,   L17 and 131 in the packing between helix 1 and 2 of one domain   SPA.
For the analysis, the coordinates from the co-crystal   structure between domain B and Fc were used (Deisenhofer,   1981).
The graph was generated using lnsi ht II (Biosym, USA).
  Dashed atomic distances are displayed in 8. 276 L. JENDEBERG ETAL.
  (Table 2), where a charge repulsion is not expected   with the hydrophobic surface.
Similarly, I31 is situated   in helix 2 (Figs 1 and 2) and is also possibly interacting   with Fc on the aliphatic portion of Q311 (C, and C,,),   but none of the distances between hydrogen atoms on   these carbon atoms and the closest hydrogen atoms on   I31 (C, and C,) are within 2.5 A [as previously analyzed in (Cedergren et al., 1993)l.
In fact, a detailed   analysis of the crystal structure reveals that the side   chain of I31 is involved in intramolecular hydrophobic   contacts with residues I16 (CYJ and L17 (C, and C,) on   helix 1 of Z (Fig. 6).
Thus, the two mutations (L17D   and I31A) that specifically are effecting k,,, are also   situated in the helix 1-helix 2 interface of the bound   SpA domain (Deisenhofer, 1981; Cedergren et al.,   1993).
  Since the k,, determined for Z (Table 1) to Fc is at   least two orders of magnitude slower than expected for   a simple diffusion limited interaction of Z with immobilized Fc, (von Hippel and Berg, 1989), the rate-limiting   step for association of Z to Fc may involve a large or a   small structural change in the SPA domain.
  Speculatively, amino acid residues L17 and I31 are   important to stabilize the bound state of Z and by   mutating either of these residues, the association rate   will decrease.
In fact, a structural change involved in   the binding of SpA to Fc has previously been discussed   by others (Deisenhofer, 1981; Torigoe et al., 1990a, b;   Gouda et al., 1992).
Each IgG- binding domain of SPA   contains three a-helices packed into a three helix bundle motif in an anti-parallel fashion (Torigoe el al.,   1990a; Gouda et al., 1992) (Fig. 1).
Since only two   helices were found in the SpA domain in the co-crystal   structure, it has been proposed that the third helix is   disrupted in the complex (Torigoe et al., 1990a, b;   Gouda et al., 1992).
However, Z(F30A) shows no   significant difference in either k,,, koff or K,,, compared   to the parent Z molecule (Tables 1 and 2) by any of the   methods used to study its Fc interaction.
This is particularly interesting since F30 is involved in the hydrophobic packing between helix 2 and helix 3 (Gouda et al.,   1992) and, indeed, it has been shown that the F30A   lowers the conformational stability of Z by 3.5 kcal/mol   (Cedergren et al., 1993).
Therefore, we conclude that   the packing between the second helix and the third   helix is not directly involved in the rate limiting step of   binding to Fc.
Instead, our results suggest that a structural change in the helix 1-helix 2 interface is rate   limiting in the binding of Z to Fc, but this model does   not exclude a disruption of the third helix as part of the   binding mechanism.
In fact, it is possible that a third   helix unwinding is a subsequent event to binding.
  However, more experiments will be needed to further   elucidate the details of the binding mechanism between   SPA and Fc.
  The ZZ molecule has previously been found to bind   tighter than Z to Fc, in a displacement assay (Eliasson,   1990).
We have noted by modeling (data not shown),   that the proposed binding mechanism involving   unwinding of the third helix (Torigoe et af., 1990b)   would allow neighboring domains of the five domain   SpA to bind on both sides of Fc simultaneously.
There   are two symmetric binding sites on the homodimeric Fc   molecule for the SPA domains and a partially unwound   third helix of the ZZ molecule could conceivably span   these two sites.
This hypothesis could explain the fact   that a molecule composed of two fused domains of Z,   designated ZZ, binds almost two orders of magnitudes   tighter than Z to Fc, although the affinity constant does   not increase significantly more up to five domains of Z   (Eliasson, 1990).
In order to analyze the kinetic component responsible for the tighter binding of ZZ to Fcl   compared to Z, BIA was performed.
This analysis   (Table 1) demonstrates that the higher affinity is mainly   due to a slower off-rate.
Thus, the koff of ZZ is about six   times lower than the knff of Z. Even though this result   corroborates binding on both sides of Fc, an alternative   explanation is that the uncomplexed Z domain of the   ZZ molecule may either interact weakly with the bound   Z domain or with Fc, itself at a second binding site.
  Either of these possibilities could provide increased   binding free energy and could result in a lowered k,,,.
  However, more experiments will be necessary to completely characterize this co-operative binding effect of   going from one to two SPA domains.
  It is tempting to speculate that the Z domain itself is   a poorly packed protein molecule with flexible helices.
  However, we believe that this is not the case.
  Equilibrium unfolding experiments using guanidine   hydrochloride (Gdn-HCI) show a normal two-state   transition with a mid-point of 3.9 M Gdn-HC1 and a   calculated AGn of -7 kcal/mol (Cedergren et af.,   1993).
The temperature stability is very high (the midpoint of thermal unfolding exceeds 90C at neutral pH),   which is consistent with what is expected for a well   folded small domain protein (Alexander et af., 1992).
  In addition, Z is extremely soluble in aqueous buffer   systems (Samuelsson et al., 1994).
Further, the NMR   spectrum of Z indicates that the molecule is well folded   (Lyons et al., 1993).
Thus we conclude that Z itself has   a well folded structure.
In addition, this conclusion   could expand to all Z variants discussed in this paper   since their circular dichroism spectra are essentially   indistinguishable (Cedergren et al., 1993).
  The kinetic binding parameters were used to calculate equilibrium binding constants, and these were   compared with affinity constants determined previously   (Cedergren er al., 1993) using a competitive displacements assay (Table 2).
A comparison of the determined   K,,, for the set of Z molecules reveals that the determined affinity constants by the two methods are similar   within a factor of 4 for six out of the seven variants   analyzed.
From this comparative analysis we conclude   that the results obtained by the two rather different   methods are surprisingly similar.
This is consistent with   a similar comparison made for hGH mutant proteins   (Cunningham and Wells, 1993).
In addition, the affinity constant between a Z-fusion and human polyclonal   IgG has been determined to 0.7 x ~O/M by titration   calorimetry (It0 and Kurosawa, 1993) and to 2.5 x   ~O/M between domain B and human IgG in a competition radioimmunoassay (Huston er al., 1992).
Both   these values are similar to the one determined by   BIAcore for the binding of Z to CD4-Fc, (Table 2).
KINETICS OF PROTEIN   However, in this BIAcore study, for one mutant Z   protein, Z(I31A), the relative affinity constant calculated from the kinetic methods is a factor of 25 lower   than the affinity constant determined by the equilibrium displacement assay (Table 2).
This discrepancy is   by far outside any estimated experimental errors (Table   1).
An explanation is probably found in experimental   differences between the two methods; in surfaces,   methods of immobilization and in differences in protein   concentrations used in the analysis.
It is noteworthy   that a concentration of up to 150 ~LM of Z(I31A) had to   be used to determine its k,, in the BIAcore experiment.
  Although there were no observations of precipitates, it   is possible that the concentration of active Z(I31A) is   significantly lower due to the formation of soluble   aggregates.
Presumably, these aggregates would be in   equilibrium with the active monomers and this equilibrium would be continuously shifted by binding of the   monomers to immobilized Fc,.
Thus, the actual k,,of   Z(I31A) would be higher.
In contrast, in the displacement plate assay, the concentration of Z(I31A) that   was used to compete with labeled Z tracer did not   exceed 4 p~ (Cedergren et al., 1993).
However, kOff   could be determined for Z(I31A), and was found to be   within a factor of 2 similar to the parent Z molecule.
  Assuming that the determined K,, from the displacement assay and k,,fr from BIA are accurate, k,, can be   calculated from these two values to 1.2~ 10(MIS),   which is still more than two orders of magnitude slower   than the parent Z molecule.
Thus, we conclude that the   Z(I31A) mutant protein shows the weakest binding to   Fc out of all seven analyzed Z variants and by both   applied methods.
Further, the observed decreased   affinity is mainly found in a lowered k,,,.
However, the   determined k,,,, with BIA may be less accurate because   of the high concentrations used.
We also conclude that   A/FC INTERACTION 277   the comparison between the two methods for the   Z(I31A) protein demonstrates the importance of evaluating the BIAcore data with alternative methods if the   binding experiment had to be performed using extreme   protein concentrations.
  In conclusion, we have demonstrated the added   value of determining kinetic binding constants for the   interaction of Z mutant proteins to Fc and that the   results enhance our understanding of the SPA-Fc interaction.
Even though the different possible detailed   mechanisms of binding must be determined by more   experiments, we conclude that the presented results   have opened a new and interesting field of research in   this area.
At present, we are utilizing circular dichroism   spectroscopy to study possible changes in the a-helical   content of Z upon its binding to Fc, and more mutations are being introduced into the Z domain to further   test the hypothesis of a structural change upon binding   to Fc.
In addition, we are utilizing 13C, N enriched Z   to collect NMR data to generate a large number of   structural constraints (Lyons et al., 1993) to be used to   calculate a high resolution structure of Z in solution.
  This structure may be used to compare the positioning   of helix 1 and 2 with the x-ray structure of the B:Fc,   complex.
