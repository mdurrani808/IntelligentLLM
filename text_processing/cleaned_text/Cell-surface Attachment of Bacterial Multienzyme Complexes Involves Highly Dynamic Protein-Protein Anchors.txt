  Results: The structures of novel Coh-Doc complexes reveal a dual binding mode.
  Conclusion: A dual binding mode is present in Coh-Doc interactions supporting cell-surface attachment.
  Significance: The dual binding mode introduces flexibility into highly populated multienzyme complexes attached to the cell  surface.
  Protein-protein interactions play a pivotal role in the assembly of the cellulosome, one of natures most intricate nanomachines dedicated to the depolymerization of complex carbohydrates.
The integration of cellulosomal components usually  occurs through the binding of type I dockerin modules located  at the C terminus of the enzymes to cohesin modules located in  the primary scaffoldin subunit.
Cellulosomes are typically  recruited to the cell surface via type II cohesin-dockerin interactions established between primary and cell-surface anchoring  scaffoldin subunits.
In contrast with type II interactions, type I  dockerins usually display a dual binding mode that may allow  increased conformational flexibility during cellulosome assembly.
Acetivibrio cellulolyticus produces a highly complex cellulosome comprising an unusual adaptor scaffoldin, ScaB, which  mediates the interaction between the primary scaffoldin, ScaA,  through type II cohesin-dockerin interactions and the anchoring scaffoldin, ScaC, via type I cohesin-dockerin interactions.
  Here, we report the crystal structure of the type I ScaB dockerin  in complex with a type I ScaC cohesin in two distinct orientations.
The data show that the ScaB dockerin displays structural  symmetry, reflected by the presence of two essentially identical  binding surfaces.
The complex interface is more extensive than  those observed in other type I complexes, which results in an  ultra-high affinity interaction (Ka 1012 M).
A subset of ScaB  dockerin residues was also identified as modulating the specificity of type I cohesin-dockerin interactions in A. cellulolyticus.
  This report reveals that recruitment of cellulosomes onto the  cell surface may involve dockerins presenting a dual binding  mode to incorporate additional flexibility into the quaternary  structure of highly populated multienzyme complexes.
  The dynamic nature of plant cell walls is of growing environmental and industrial significance as the demand for renewable  sources for energy and novel molecules for the chemical industry increases.
Plant cell wall polysaccharides, primarily cellulose  and hemicelluloses, are a major reservoir of carbon and energy  (1).
The deconstruction of the plant cell wall requires an extensive array of hydrolytic enzymes to attack the heterogeneous,  insoluble, and highly recalcitrant substrate, which requires the  catalytic entities to act in synergy to degrade this composite  structure (2).
Anaerobes have adopted an elegant alternative  strategy for degrading structural plant carbohydrates, through  the organization of enzymes into multiprotein complexes  termed cellulosomes.
The cellulosomal organization of Clostridium thermocellum is the most well defined and characterized system, and it is therefore used as a blueprint for typical  cellulosome assembly.
In this system, assembly occurs through  the binding of type I cohesin modules found in a primary scaffoldin subunit to enzyme-borne type I dockerin modules.
Primary scaffoldins are large noncatalytic cohesin-containing proteins, which characteristically include a carbohydrate-binding  module that directs the cellulosome and therefore the cellulosomal enzymes to its cellulosic substrate.
A sequence-divergent  type II dockerin, located at the C terminus of some primary  scaffoldins, tethers the cellulosome to the peptidoglycan layer  of the bacterial cell envelope through an interaction with type II  cohesin modules located in cell-surface anchoring scaffoldins  (1, 3).

21, pp. 13578 13590, May 22, 2015   2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Published in the U.S.A.  13578 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290NUMBER 21MAY 22, 2015   at University of Otago (CAUL) on July 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from somes are therefore orchestrated by the specificity of the different cohesin and dockerin modules (4).
Cohesin-dockerin (CohDoc)3 pairs exhibit one of the strongest protein-protein  affinities found in nature, and their interaction is crucial for  both cellulosome assembly and cell-surface attachment (5, 6).
  The mesophilic anaerobic bacterium Acetivibrio cellulolyticus produces a highly efficient cellulosome capable of hydrolyzing a range of cellulosic materials, including crystalline cellulose, with a higher activity than that of Aspergillus niger and  Trichoderma viride systems (7, 8).
Initial sequencing of an A.  cellulolyticus gene cluster identified four tandem scaffoldin  genes (scaA, scaB, scaC, and scaD (9, 10)).
The primary scaffoldin (where the enzymes of the cellulosome are recruited), ScaA,  contains an internal carbohydrate-binding module, bordered  by seven type I cohesin modules and a single X module that  provides structural stability to the neighboring C-terminal type  II dockerin domain.
Intriguingly, ScaA also contains an N-terminal family 9 glycoside hydrolase, a unique property within  primary scaffoldins (11), although in the corresponding fungal  cellulosomes, it has been proposed that the dockerins of the  catalytic subunits bind to a GH3 enzyme, which acts as a scaffoldin (12).
Downstream of scaA are genes encoding an adaptor  scaffoldin and an anchoring protein, ScaB and ScaC, respectively.
ScaB contains four type II cohesin modules, which interact with the C-terminal type II dockerin of ScaA, and a divergent C-terminal type I dockerin, which specifically interacts  with the type I cohesin modules found in ScaC. ScaC, in turn,  acts as an anchoring scaffoldin by virtue of its C-terminal SLH  module (Fig. 1) (9).
The recent sequencing of the A. cellulolyticus CD2 genome identified numerous additional cellulosomal  components, gene regulatory elements, and cell anchoring  modules (identified by the presence of dockerins or cohesins),  suggestive of a much more elaborate and sophisticated cellulosome system than originally observed (13).
Analysis of the  genome uncovered 41 putative cohesin modules distributed  among 16 scaffoldins (including ScaA, ScaB, ScaC, and ScaD),  some of which have both cohesins and dockerins in the same  polypeptide chain.
All of the identified scaffoldins, with the  exception of ScaI, appear to contain a signal peptide, suggesting  that these proteins are secreted (13).
The genome of A. cellulolyticus encodes 143 dockerin-containing proteins, which is  about twice the number of such proteins in clostridial bacteria,  but fewer than the 220 cellulosomal proteins encoded by the  Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 genome (13, 14).
  Although structurally related, there is no cross-specificity  between type I and type II Coh-Doc partners, which allows for  the efficient assembly and cell-surface attachment of bacterial  cellulosomes (15, 16).
Structural studies on type I Coh-Doc  complexes of C. thermocellum (6, 17) and Clostridium cellulolyticum (18) provided insights into the molecular determinants  of the interaction responsible for cellulosome assembly.
It is  now known that the sequence duplication displayed by type I  dockerins, from a variety of organisms beyond C. thermocellum, supports a dual binding mode within Coh-Doc complexes  (5, 18).
The sequence and structural symmetry within the type I  dockerin module from C. thermocellum support a dual binding  mode with the main Coh-contacting residues at positions 11  and 12 in the N-terminal (Ser-11 and Thr-12) or C-terminal  (Ser-45 and Thr-46) helix of the protein domain (17).
This symmetry is evident in the enzyme-borne dockerins of A. cellulolyticus that interact with ScaA, where the specificity residues in  3 The abbreviations used are: Coh-Doc, cohesin-dockerin; NGE, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ITC, isothermal  titration calorimetry; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.
  FIGURE 1.
Schematic representation of the A. cellulolyticus cellulosome.
Type I dockerin modules located in A. cellulolyticus cellulosomal enzymes bind  reiterated cohesin modules located in the primary scaffoldin ScaA. ScaB plays the role of an adaptor scaffoldin with its cohesins binding the type II dockerin of  ScaA. ScaB also contains a type I dockerin that specifically binds the complementary type I cohesins of the anchoring scaffoldin ScaC. The entire complex is  tethered to the bacterial cell surface via the resident SLH module of ScaC. ScaA also contains a carbohydrate-binding module and a GH9 catalytic module.
The  structures of the ScaB dockerin in complex with the third cohesin of ScaC, solved here, are highlighted with a black dot.
  Type I Coh-Doc Complexes from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus  MAY 22, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 21 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 13579   at University of Otago (CAUL) on July 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from the two helices are Ser-Ile (or Ser-Leu).
In the type I ScaB A.  cellulolyticus dockerin, the specificity residues at positions 11  and 12 of the two duplicated segments consist of a conserved  Ile-Asn motif.
Thus, a lack of cross-specificity between the type  I-Doc interactions that modulate the binding of ScaB into ScaC  or the cellulosomal enzymes into ScaA (9, 19) may be related to  differences at these key residues.
  Nevertheless, the striking symmetry of the duplicated segments does not directly constitute evidence that both modes of  the wild-type dockerin will bind the cohesin.
In this context,  mutagenesis studies, combined with structural and affinitybased binding data, serve to verify the dual mode of binding  between a given cohesin-dockerin pair.
Here, we investigated  the molecular determinants for type I Coh-Doc interactions in  the A. cellulolyticus cellulosome.
We describe structures comprising the third type I cohesin from the anchoring ScaC scaffoldin in complex with the type I dockerin of the adaptor ScaB  scaffoldin in which the dockerin is in two different orientations.
  The data reveal that the type I Coh-Doc interaction between  adaptor scaffoldins and anchoring proteins in A. cellulolyticus  cellulosome displays a dual binding mode.
  Experimental Procedures  Gene Synthesis and DNA CloningTo promote stability, the  A. cellulolyticus ScaB type I dockerin module (DocScaB) was  co-expressed in vivo with the third type I A. cellulolyticus ScaC  cohesin module (CohScaC).
The genes encoding the two proteins were synthesized (NZYTech Ltd., Lisboa, Portugal) and  cloned into the same plasmid under the control of separate T7  promoters.
Additionally, a cloning strategy was developed to  engineer hexahistidine tags either at the N terminus of the  dockerin module or the C terminus of the cohesin module.
In  total, three DNA fragments were synthesized comprising the  following sequences (from the 5 to the 3 end): dockerin DNA,  T7 terminator, T7 promoter, and cohesin DNA.
Genes were  designed to encode DocScaB (residues 868942) and CohScaC  (residues 326 467) with codon usage optimized for expression  in Escherichia coli.
The three constructs encode wild-type  CohScaC for co-expression with wild-type DocScaB (Coh_  DocScaB), DocScaB mutated at positions I15S/N16I (Coh_  DocI15S/N16I), and DocScaB mutated at positions I51S/N52I  (Coh_DocI51S/N52I).
The three DNA constructs contained 5-  and 3-engineered restriction sites for cloning into pET28a in  two different forms.
The first had an engineered hexahistidine  tag located at the N terminus of the dockerin (NheI-SalI), and  the second had the hexahistidine tag positioned at the C terminus of the cohesin (NcoI-XhoI).
In total, six recombinant  pET28a derivatives were generated from the three DNA constructs synthesized.
  To produce recombinant A. cellulolyticus type I cohesin and  dockerin modules individually, the following approaches were  utilized.
The gene encoding CohScaC was isolated in pET28a  by excising the DocScaB sequence in a BglII DNA fragment  from a plasmid containing the two genes, followed by re-ligation.
CohScaC contained an engineered C-terminal hexahistidine tag.
DocScaB constructs were expressed fused with  thioredoxin to improve solubility and stability The genes  encoding DocScaB, DocI15S/N16I, and DocI51S/N52I were  amplified from the respective plasmids encoding the protein  complexes described above by PCR using NZYProof polymerase (NZYTech Ltd.) and primers described in Table 1.
DocScaB  genes were subsequently ligated into EcoRI-XhoI-digested  pET32a (Novagen).
Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create DocI15S/N16I/I51S/N52I with putative recognition residues at positions 11 and 12 of the two duplicated segments  changed from IN to SI (Tables 1 and 2).
  To identify the dockerin residues that modulate type I CohDoc specificity in A. cellulolyticus, various dockerin derivatives  were designed.
The type I GH5 dockerin (residues 502573,  ZP_09464781; DocGH5) and six mutant derivatives of DocScaB  (DocR14N/K50N, DocI15S/I51S, DocN16I/N52I, DocA18F/  A54F, DocL20Y/L56Y, and DocD23Q/D59Q) were synthesized  (NZYTech Ltd.) with codon usage optimized for expression in  E. coli (Table 2).
The genes contained engineered EcoRI and  XhoI recognition sequences at the 5 and 3 ends, respectively,  and were subcloned into the pET32a vector (Novagen).
The  gene region encoding the sixth cohesin of the primary scaffoldin ScaA (residues 14721611; CohScaA) was also isolated  through PCR using the primers described in Table 1 and cloned  into the NcoI-XhoI sites of pET28a.
  Expression and Purification of Recombinant ProteinsPreliminary expression screens revealed that higher levels of  CohScaC-DocScaB complexes were obtained when the hexahistidine tag was located at the C terminus of CohScaC (data  not shown).
The respective pET28a derivatives were used to  transform E. coli Tuner cells, which were grown at 37 C to an  A600 of 0.5.
Recombinant protein expression was induced by the  addition of isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final  concentration of 0.2 mM followed by induction at 19 C with  shaking for 16 h. Cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm  at 4 C and resuspended in 20 ml of binding buffer (50 mM  HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM imidazole, 1 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2).
Cells  were disrupted by sonication, and cell-free extract was recovered by centrifugation at 15,000  g. Prior to crystallization  trials, SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown) indicated that  expression levels of free CohScaC were higher than those of  TABLE 1  Primers used to obtain the genes encoding the cohesin and the dockerins used in this study  Engineered restriction sites are shown in bold and mutations are underlined.

CohScaC-DocScaB complexes and unbound CohScaC were  initially purified by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography using Sepharose columns charged with nickel  (HisTrapTM) following conventional protocols and a 025 mM  imidazole gradient.
Fractions containing the CohScaC-DocScaB  complex and unbound CohScaC were buffer-exchanged into 20  mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM CaCl2 using a PD-10 Sephadex  G-25 M size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences).
A further anion-exchange chromatography purification step was  performed to separate the CohScaC-DocScaB complexes  from free CohScaC using a gradient elution with 01 M NaCl  (Amersham Biosciences).
Fractions containing the purified  CohScaC-DocScaB complex were pooled and concentrated  using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal devices with a 10-kDa cutoff  membrane (Millipore) and washed three times with 1 mM  CaCl2.
The final protein concentration was adjusted to 42  mg/ml (Coh-DocI15S/N16I) and 30 mg/ml (Coh-DocI51S/  N52I), in a storage buffer consisting of H2O (Sigma) and 0.5 mM  CaCl2.
Recombinant DocScaB, DocI15S/N16I, DocI51S/N52I,  DocI15S/N16I/I51S/N52I, DocGH5, and the mutant derivatives of DocScaB were expressed in E. coli Origami cells.
  Recombinant CohScaA and CohScaC were expressed in E. coli  Tuner cells.
Growth was performed at 37 C to an A600 of 0.5 in  Luria broth.
Recombinant protein expression was induced with  1 mM (Origami) or 0.2 mM (Tuner) isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for 16 h at 19 C.
The individual  cohesin and dockerin constructs were purified using immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography as described above.
  Unless otherwise stated, the recombinant cohesin and dockerin constructs were buffer-exchanged to 50 mM HEPES, pH  7.5, 2 mM CaCl2, and 0.5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine  hydrochloride.
  X-ray Crystallography, Structural Determination, and RefinementCrystallization conditions were screened by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method using an Oryx8 robotic  nanodrop dispensing system (Douglas Instruments) for the  three protein complexes (CohScaC-DocScaB,CohScaC-DocI15S/  N16I, and CohScaC-DocI51S/N52I).
Crystals of CohScaCDocI15S/N16I (42 mg/ml) grew over a period of 21 days at  19 C in 0.5 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 30%  (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and were cryoprotected with  30% (v/v) glycerol (20).
Crystals of the Coh-DocI51S/N52I  complex (30 mg/ml) grew over a period of 21 days at 19 C in  1 M sodium citrate, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, and were cryoprotected  with 30% (v/v) glycerol.
Crystals were harvested in rayon fiber  loops and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Data were collected  for both constructs using single crystals at the Diamond Light  Source (beamline IO4) to a resolution of 1.49  for the  CohScaC-DocI15S/N16I crystals and 1.81  for the CohDocI51S/N52I.
A summary of the data processing statistics is  given in Table 3.
BALBES was used for the CohScaC-DocI15S/  N16I data to carry out molecular replacement (21).
In total, 42  structures with a sequence identity greater than 15% for either  cohesin or dockerin or both modules were found.
The best  solution was found using the mutant cohesin-dockerin complex from C. thermocellum (Protein Data Bank code 2ccl (17)).
  Two copies of the heterodimer Coh-Doc complex are present  in the asymmetric unit in the space group P41212, with final  Rfactor/Rfree of 39.8/41.2 and Q-factor (22) of 0.706 after  REFMAC5 at the end of the BALBES run.
This model was  adjusted and refined using REFMAC5 (23) interspersed with  model adjustment in COOT (24) to give the final model (Protein Data Bank code 4uyp; Table 3).
The final round of refinement was performed using the TLS/restrained refinement procedure using each module as a single group.

A successful solution was obtained in space  group P43 with a TFZ score of 34.2 and LLG of 3308.
The structure was refined as above.
The root mean square deviation of  the bond lengths, bond angles, torsion angles, and other indicators was continuously monitored using the validation tools in  COOT (24) and MOLPROBITY (26).
A summary of the refinement statistics for both structures is shown in Table 3.
  Nondenaturing Gel Electrophoresis (NGE)For NGE experiments, dockerin constructs (DocScaB, DocI15S/N16I, DocI51S/  N52I, DocGH5, DocR14N/K50N, DocI15S/I51S, DocN16I/  N52I, DocA18F/A54F, DocL20Y/L56Y, DocD23Q/D59Q, and  DocI15S/N16I/I51S/N52I) at a concentration of 25 M were  incubated in the absence and presence of 25 M CohScaC for  1 h at room temperature and separated on a 10% native gel.
  Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature.
Gels  were stained with Coomassie Blue, and protein complexes were  detected by the presence of an additional band displaying a  lower electrophoretic mobility.
  Isothermal Titration CalorimetryIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were carried out as described previously (17, 18), with the exception that the titrations were performed at 35 C.
During titrations, the dockerin constructs (25  M) were stirred at 307 revolutions/min in the reaction cell and  titrated with 27 successive 10-l injections of CohScaC (180M  for dual binding experiments and 120 M for specificity experiments) at 220-s intervals.
Integrated heat effects, after correction for heats of dilution, were analyzed by nonlinear regression  using a single site-binding model (Microcal Software, ORIGIN,  Version 7.0).
  Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)The interactions between DocScaB, DocI15S/N16I/I51S/N52I, DocGH5, and  mutant derivatives of DocScaB and CohScaC were analyzed  using a BIAcore X100 (GE Healthcare).
CohScaC was diluted to  10 g/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and immobilized  (150 resonance units) on a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare)  containing a dextran matrix with free carboxylic groups.
The  chip surface was prepared using conventional carbodiimide  coupling chemistry and subsequent deactivation of excess  active esters with ethanolamine (EDC/NHS coupling kit, GE  Healthcare).
Immobilization followed the procedure guidelines  provided by the vendor (BIAcoreTM, GE Healthcare).
The  dockerin constructs were diluted in running buffer (10 mM  HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20)  and allowed to interact with the sensor chip surface during a  180-s injection.
In all experiments, five different concentrations  (0.05, 0.1, 1, 5, and 15 nM) of the ligand were injected at a flow  rate of 30 l/min.
The sensor chip surface was regenerated with  10 mM glycine, pH 1.8.
The association rate constant (kon) and  dissociation rate constant (koff) were each calculated using the  BIAcore X100 evaluation software, version 2.0.1.

  Results and Discussion  Expression and Crystallization of A. cellulolyticus Coh-Doc  ComplexesBecause the two different type I cohesin-dockerin  interactions in A. cellulolyticus are not cross-reactive, DocScaB  mutations were designed to replace the putative recognition  residues in positions 11 and 12 (Ile-Asn) with those of the  enzyme-borne dockerins (Ser-Ile), rather than the commonly  applied alanine substitution.
  Preliminary experiments thus evaluated the levels of expression of the following three Coh-Doc complexes: the wild-type  Coh_DocScaB, Coh_DocI15S/N16I, and Coh_DocI51S/N52I  mutants, wherein the hexahistidine tag was located at either the  N terminus of the dockerin or the C terminus of CohScaC. The  data (not shown) revealed that the levels of expression of  the protein complexes were higher when the affinity tag was  located at the C terminus of CohScaC. The recombinant plasmids encoding complexes with this latter cohesin construct  were therefore selected to produce highly pure Coh-Doc complexes for crystallization.
Initial attempts to crystallize the A.  cellulolyticus type I CohScaC-DocScaB complex failed.
Analysis of the DocScaB sequence revealed a high degree of internal  symmetry, which suggested that this dockerin contained two  identical cohesin binding interfaces.
Failure to crystallize the  complex may have reflected the lack of conformational homogeneity resulting from the two potential binding modes of  DocScaB to CohScaC. It is well established that in type I dockerins  residues at positions 11 and 12 of each of the two duplicated  segments dominate cohesin recognition.
In ScaB dockerins, Ile  and Asn occupy these positions, which is in contrast with  enzyme-borne dockerins of this bacterium that contain a SerIle (or Ser-Leu) pair and specifically bind the ScaA cohesins.
To  generate proteins where only one of the cohesin-binding sites  in DocScaB was functional, two variants of the protein complex, Coh-DocI15S/N16I and Coh-DocI51S/N52I, were generated to enforce conformational homogeneity within the complex.
Replacement of one of the Ile-Asn pairs with Ser-Ile would  result in a single conformation, therefore facilitating crystal formation.
Diffracting crystals of CohScaC in complex with either  DocScaB mutant derivative were obtained.
  Structure of the Type I Coh-Doc A. cellulolyticus Complex  The structures of the Coh-DocI15S/N16I and Coh-DocI51S/  N52I complexes were solved by molecular replacement using  the crystal structure of C. thermocellum type I Coh-Doc complex (17, 20) as a search model for Coh_DocI15S/N16I and for  Coh_DocI51S/N52I to resolutions of 1.49 and 1.81 , respectively (Fig. 2).
The Coh-DocI15S/N16I model included two  molecules of the heterodimer with each dockerin coordinating  two calcium ions and a total of 640 water molecules.
The two  complexes in the asymmetric unit overlay with an r.m.s.d of 0.7   for 176 C atoms.
Although the Coh-DocI15S/N16I complex  behaved as a monomer in solution (i.e. no oligomerization  occurs, as determined by size exclusion), in crystal it is a dimer  resulting from interactions established between two CohScaC  modules, although the biological relevance of these interactions, if any, is unclear.
In contrast, the Coh-DocI51S/N52I  crystal structure consisted of one heterodimer in the asymmetric unit together with two calcium atoms, bound to the dockerin, and 319 water molecules.
  Structure of A. cellulolyticus ScaC Type I Cohesin in Complex  with Its Cognate DockerinScaC type I cohesin in complex  with its cognate dockerin displayed an elliptical structure comprising two -sheets aligned in an elongated -sandwich with a  classical jellyroll fold (Fig. 2).
The two sheets included -strands  9, 1, 2, 7, and 4 on one face and -strands 5, 6, 3, and 8 on the  other face.
-Strand 8 is predominantly aligned with -strand 3  but, at its N terminus, also makes interactions with -strand 9.

  Type I Coh-Doc Complexes from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus  MAY 22, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 21 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 13583   at University of Otago (CAUL) on July 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from There is a disorganization of the secondary structure of  -strand 8 between Asn-115 and Ser-120, which leads to the  above-mentioned capacity of -strand 8 to contact both  -sheets.
Strands 1 and 9 are aligned parallel to each other,  whereas the other -strands are antiparallel.
As described  above, the structure of CohScaC is essentially identical in the  two protein complexes.
Significantly, the A. cellulolyticus  CohScaC also displays striking structural similarities to the type  I cohesin modules of C. thermocellum (r.m.s.d. 1.41 ) and C.  cellulolyticum (r.m.s.d. 1.31 ).
  Structure of A. cellulolyticus ScaB Type I DockerinIn both  complexes, the ScaB dockerin displays an identical structure  that comprises two helices arranged in an antiparallel orientation comprising residues Ile-15 to Gly-27 (helix-1) and Ile-51 to  Gly-63 (helix-3), respectively, whereas the loop connecting  these secondary structures contains a six-residue -helix  extending from Glu-35 to Asp-42 (helix-2) (Fig. 2).
The overall  structure of A. cellulolyticus DocScaB is very similar to both C.  thermocellum (r.m.s.d.
1.2 ) and C. cellulolyticum (r.m.s.d. 1.1  ) type I dockerin modules.
In both complexes, DocScaB contains two Ca2 ions coordinated by several amino acid residues,  similar to canonical EF-hand loop motifs.
The Ca2 ion located  at the dockerin N terminus is coordinated by the side chains of  residues Asp-6, Asp-8, Asn-10, and Asp-17 (both the O1 and  O2), the latter belonging to the N-terminal -helix (helix-1) of  this module.
The octahedral geometry of the coordination of  this Ca2 ion is fulfilled by the main chain carbonyl of Ser-12  and by a water molecule, which hydrogen bonds to Asn-16.
The  second Ca2 site stabilizes the loop connecting the internal and  C-terminal -helix (helix-3) of the dockerin module.
This Ca2  ion is coordinated by the side chains of residues Asp-42, Asp44, Asn-46, and Asp-53 (both the O1 and O2), as well as by  the carbonyl of Ser-48, and by a water molecule, which is hydrogen-bonded to Asn-52.
Thus, both Ca2 sites show coordination to residues n, n  2, n  4, n  6 (main-chain O atom), and  n  11, with a water molecule bridging to residue n  10.
  A. cellulolyticus Type I Coh-DocI15S/N16I and Coh-DocI51S/  N52I InterfacesDocScaB interacted with the 83-5 6 sheet  of the CohScaC -sandwich, which presents a predominantly  flat surface.
The structures of the Coh-DocI15S/N16I and CohDocI51S/N52I complexes were found to be very similar to each  other, with a backbone r.m.s.d.
of 0.7  (Fig. 2C).
In addition,  helix-1 and helix-3 of DocI15S/N16I overlapped almost perfectly with helix-3 and helix-1, respectively, of DocI51S/N52I as  a result of a 180o rotation on dockerin DocI51S/N52I upon  binding (Fig. 2C).
This internal structural conservation within  DocScaB has been previously observed in other type I dockerins  and results from the near-perfect 2-fold dyad symmetry of the  dockerin module (6, 17).
In contrast, helix-2 that links the two  duplicated segments exhibited a different spatial position when  the two complexes were overlaid.
Thus, the internal structural  symmetry presented by the dockerins enables cohesin recognition through two highly similar protein ligand-binding surfaces, complexes that have a buried surface area of 820 2 and  that are described below.
  Hydrophobic interactions play a key role in Coh-DocI15S/  N16I and Coh-DocI51S/N52I complex assembly and are displayed in Fig. 3A.
The intermolecular interface also includes 10  direct polar interactions, including two salt bridges (Table 4  and Fig. 3B).
The number of polar and apolar interactions identified at the complex interface is at least 1.25 times greater than  that of other type I Coh-Doc complexes (6, 17, 18).
The  DocScaB residues at the complexinterface arelocatedin both helices 1 and 3 and remain unchanged upon the 180 rotation of the  dockerin module on the CohScaC surface, reflecting the internal symmetry of the ScaB dockerin.
However, the two dockerin  helices provide different contributions for cohesin recognition.
  Although only the C-terminal region of DocScaB helix-3 interacts with the CohScaC, the entire length of the dockerin helix-1  contacts its protein partner in Coh-DocI51S/N52I and vice  versa in Coh-DocI15S/N16I.
Henceforth, the helix interacting  through its entire length with CohScaC is defined as helix-A,  FIGURE 3.

  Type I Coh-Doc Complexes from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus  13584 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290NUMBER 21MAY 22, 2015   at University of Otago (CAUL) on July 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from and the helix only making interactions with the cohesin exclusively at one of its termini is termed helix-B (see below and Fig.  4).
C atoms of the DocScaB helix contacting CohScaC along  its entire length (helix-A) are 67  away from the C atoms of  the respective complementary contact residues located at the  cohesin surface.
In contrast, C atoms of the dockerin helix  only contacting the cohesin at one of its termini (helix-B) are  distant from their corresponding binding partners by 5  at the  region in closer proximity with CohScaC and more than 14   from the distal helix region that faces away from the cohesin  module.
  The interactions between helix-A of DocScaB and CohScaC  are dominated by the Arg-14/Lys-50, Ile-15/Ile-51, and Asn16/Asn-52 of DocScaB and Thr-76 and Tyr-122 of CohScaC  (Fig. 3).
N1 of Arg-14/Lys-50 contributes an important salt  bridge with O1 of Glu-128 located in -strand 8 of CohScaC.  The Ile-15/Ile-51 side chain occupies the hydrophobic pocket  formed by Leu-34 and Ala-33.
The more distal helix-A Arg-22/  Arg-58 and Asp-23/Asp-59 pair contributes an important  hydrogen bond network with the CohScaC residues Ala-79 and  Tyr-32, whereas the aliphatic side chains of Asp-23/Asp-59  make comprehensive hydrophobic contacts with Val-81.
In  helix-B, the contacts are dominated by the important salt  bridge established between N1 of Arg-58/Arg-22 and O1 of  Glu-78 of CohScaC. In addition, Leu-62/Leu-26 located at the  extremity of helix-B, which is in closer proximity with  CohScaC, makes nonpolar contacts with Thr-63, Thr-64, Tyr65, Ser-74, and Thr-76.
Val-61/Val-25 forms van der Waals  interactions with the side chain of CohScaC Tyr-118.
The carbonyl groups of these two dockerin residues (of each of the  rotated modes) also form hydrogen bonds with the side-chain  groups of Arg-37 and Ser-74 in CohSacC. Collectively, these  observations suggest that DocScaB presents two cohesin-binding interfaces that span through helix-A and -B and are revealed  by the 180 rotation of the dockerin module on the 83-5 6  face of CohScaC. Dockerin residues at the interface of both  FIGURE 4.

  TABLE 4  Main hydrogen-bound contact residues at the cohesin-dockerin interfaces of complexes Coh_DocI15S/N16I and Coh_DocI51S/N52I  Type I Coh-Doc Complexes from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus  MAY 22, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 21 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 13585   at University of Otago (CAUL) on July 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from structures are conserved, suggesting that affinities would be  similar, if not identical (see below).
Thus, these structural data  strongly support the presumed dual binding mode of DocScaB  to CohScaC.  Exploration of the A. cellulolyticus proteome revealed that  there are no homologues of DocScaB within the bacterium.
  However, Blast analysis revealed that the cellulosome of Clostridium clariflavum contains an adaptor scaffoldin in which the  C-terminal type I dockerin shares 85% identity with DocScaB  (27).
The dockerin residues described above, which mediate  cohesin recognition, are conserved in the two orthologous proteins suggesting that the two dockerins share identical ligand  specificities.
In contrast, CohScaC is highly homologous with  the other two cohesin modules found in this anchoring scaffoldin.
The residues that participate in dockerin recognition are  mostly invariant in the three cohesins (data not shown), suggesting that ScaC can accommodate three ScaB proteins via the  recognition of the C-terminal dockerin module.
In addition, a  second A. cellulolyticus protein termed ScaJ, accession number  WP_010243813, contains a single N-terminal cohesin module  that shares extensive similarity with the ScaC cohesins, primarily at the residues important for protein recognition (13, 19).
  ScaJ also contains a C-terminal SLH domain, which suggests  that, like ScaC, it constitutes an anchoring scaffoldin with the  ability to recognize a single ScaB molecule.
  Comparison of A. cellulolyticus with C. cellulolyticum and C.  thermocellum Type I Coh-Doc ComplexesIt was previously  observed that the A. cellulolyticus type I DocScaB specifically  recognizes type I cohesins of ScaC and will not bind type I  cohesins of ScaA or type I cohesins from C. thermocellum or C.  cellulolyticum (19).
This lack of cross-specificity between CohDoc pairs of different species may assist accurate and efficient  assembly of a coherent set of enzymes into each cellulosome.
  The Coh-Doc interactions in A. cellulolyticus, C. thermocellum,  and C. cellulolyticum provide insight into the molecular basis  for the distinct specificities displayed by these protein module  pairs.
When compared, A. cellulolyticus, C. cellulolyticum, and  C. thermocellum type I Coh-Doc complexes reveal significant  structural conservation with an overall r.m.s.d.
of 1.5  (for  both cohesin and dockerin).
The location of the interface  between the two protomers within the heterodimers is also  conserved, despite a lack of cross-specificity between the three  complexes (6, 17, 18).
Therefore, subtle yet distinct residuespecific changes at the cohesin and dockerin surfaces modulate Coh-Doc specificity (Fig. 4).
In contrast to what was  previously observed in C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum complexes, the residue that precedes helix-A in the A.  cellulolyticus dockerin (Arg-14/Lys-50) participates in cohesin  recognition through the establishment of two important polar  interactions with cohesin residues Tyr-122 and Glu-128.
In  Clostridia, this dockerin position is usually occupied by an  asparagine, in which the side chain is exclusively involved in the  coordination of the Ca2 ions.
The position occupied by Tyr122 in the A. cellulolyticus cohesin is replaced in C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum by Ala and Gly residues, respectively,  where the side chains would be unable to produce a salt bridge  with A. cellulolyticus Arg-14/Lys-50.
This major change at the  Coh-Doc interface may explain, in part, why A. cellulolyticus  DocScaB is unable to interact with Clostridia type I cohesins.
  Inspection of the Coh-Doc intermolecular interfaces provided  further evidence for the species-restricted protein-protein  specificity.
The Ala-(Leu/Phe)-(Phe/Leu) triplet (dockerin  positions 1112-14) that dominates cohesin recognition by  helix-A of the C. cellulolyticum dockerin is accommodated  by a hydrophobic platform that is absent in A. cellulolyticus  CohScaC. In addition, the bulky Phe/Leu side chains at position  12 inC. cellulolyticum dockerins would cause a steric clash with  Tyr-122 of the A. cellulolyticus cohesin, further supporting the  lack of cross-species recognition between these protein partners.
In addition, the Ser-Thr pair that dominates cohesin recognition in helix-A of C. thermocellum through the provision of  a hydrogen binding network, primarily with the side chains of  the cohesin residues Asn-37 and Asp-39, will be unable to bind  theA. cellulolyticus cohesin modules as the equivalent residues,  Ala-33 and Ser-35, do not contribute sufficient hydrogen-binding sites.
As stated above, in A. cellulolyticus DocSacB the specificity determinants at position 11 and 12 of helix-A, Ile-15/51  and Asn-16/52, occupy a hydrophobic pocket and make a  single hydrogen bond with CohSacC, respectively.
Finally, an  arginine located in the loop preceding helix B of the C. thermocellum dockerin (a glycine in the A. cellulolyticus dockerin),  which forms a hydrogen bond with the C. thermocellum cohesin, would cause a steric clash with A. cellulolyticus cohesin  residues Arg-37 and Tyr-118.
Detailed analysis of the other  complexes suggests that polar contacts are scarce in the C. cellulolyticum complex, where the interactions are predominantly  hydrophobic, and in C. thermocellum the Coh-Doc interface is  largely dominated by hydrogen bonds.
In contrast, the number  of both polar and hydrophobic interactions in the A. cellulolyticus protein complexes are much more extensive, in helix-A and  -B, when compared with their Clostridia counterparts.
Therefore, although different from type II complexes, where both  dockerin helices (A and B) contact the cohesin surface over its  entire length, the number of polar and apolar contacts identified in the protein complex formed between DocScaB and  CohScaC is intriguingly more comparable with a type II interaction.
Because of the higher number of contacts observed in  the A. cellulolyticus Coh-Doc interface, the affinity between the  two modules is predicted to be significantly higher than that  observed in other type I complexes as further discussed below.
  Type I Coh-Doc Complexes That Anchor A. cellulolyticus Cellulosomes into the Cell Surface Present a Dual Binding Mode  NGE and SPR showed that DocSacB, and the mutant derivatives DocI15S/N16I and DocI51S/N52I bound to CohScaC  (Fig. 5A and Table 5) with very similar affinities.
In contrast,  NGE, SPR, and ITC showed that DocI15S/N16I/I51S/N52I was  unable to interact with CohScaC (Fig. 5, A and C, and Table 5)  suggesting that DocScaB does, in fact, contain two cohesinbinding interfaces and that complete abrogation of cohesin recognition requires the inactivation of both of these binding faces.
  Overlaying the structure of DocSacB in protein complexes  DocI15S/N16I and DocI51S/N52I indicates that two cohesin  molecules would be unable to bind to a single dockerin molecule simultaneously because residues in the cohesin loop  extending from Ile-56 to Phe-62 will make steric clashes.
Titrations of wild-type, DocI15S/N16I, and DocI51S/N52I DocScaB  Type I Coh-Doc Complexes from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus  13586 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290NUMBER 21MAY 22, 2015   at University of Otago (CAUL) on July 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from constructs with the CohScaC, at 25 C, revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry and H values ranging between 25 and 35 kcal  mol1  .
Because of the very high affinity (Ka  109 M1  ) of  DocSacB for CohSacC, an accurate Ka value could not be determined by ITC (see below).
These data suggest that substitution  of the helix-A Ile/Asn residues for Ser/Ile disrupts cohesin recognition, which is consistent with the structural data showing  that CohSacC recognition is dominated by the Ile/Asn pair.
  DocScaB of A. cellulolyticusis involved in the attachment of the  cellulosome to the bacterial cell surface through its interaction  with the type I cohesin modules of the ScaC anchoring scaffoldin.
This is in contrast to the majority of other type I Coh-Doc  FIGURE 5.

  Type I Coh-Doc Complexes from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus  MAY 22, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 21 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 13587   at University of Otago (CAUL) on July 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from interactions, which are usually involved in the binding of  enzymes into cellulosomes.
It is believed that the dual binding  mode displayed by type I Coh-Doc complexes may introduce  quaternary flexibility into cellulosomes thus promoting substrate targeting and enzyme synergism.
Considering this, the  dual binding mode displayed by the A. cellulolyticustype I complex may further contribute to overall cellulosome architecture  by reducing steric constraints that are undoubtedly imposed in  the assembling of a large number of cellulosomes onto the bacterial cell surface.
  Structural Determinants of Type I Coh-Doc Specificity in A.  cellulolyticusThe A. cellulolyticus cellulosome has evolved  two different co-existing type I Coh-Doc specificities as follows:  the first one is responsible for assembling dockerin-bearing  enzymes onto ScaA, and the second one, described here at the  structural level, is responsible for the attachment of cellulosomes and poly-cellulosomes to the cell surface (Fig. 1).
These  two different type I subclasses do not cross-react (19, 28).
To  identify the residues that modulate type I Coh-Doc specificity  in A. cellulolyticus, a mutagenesis study, based on the crystal  structure of DocScaB and the alignment of this dockerin with  the primary consensus sequence of type I dockerins of A. cellulolyticus cellulosomal enzymes (100 primary sequences of A.  cellulolyticus enzyme dockerins were used), was initiated (Fig.  6A).
The analysis suggests that there are six main amino acid  differences that may explain the observed specificity as follows:  R14N/K50N, I15S/I51S, N16I/N52I, A18F/A54F, L20Y/L56Y,  and D23Q/D59Q (ScaB dockerin versus the enzyme dockerin  that targets ScaA).
These amino acid residues are all located in  helix-A of DocScaB, as helix-A seems to be remarkably conserved in the two type I dockerin subclasses.
To probe the  importance of these residues for type I specificity, the DocScaB  backbone was altered at the above-mentioned positions to  reflect the sequence of enzyme dockerins.
Because a dual binding mode is likely to operate in both A. cellulolyticus Coh-Doc  FIGURE 6.
Residue determinants of type I cohesin-dockerin specificity in A. cellulolyticus.
A, identifies the residues that may modulate type I Coh-Doc  specificity in A. cellulolyticus (DocScaB) aligned with the primary consensus sequence of a type I enzyme dockerin (Doc_Enzy) of A. cellulolyticus.
Key residues  located in either helix-A or helix-B, are highlighted in bold, within these sequences.
The two cohesin-binding faces were revealed by rotating each dockerin by  180, demonstrating the highly symmetrical nature of dockerin sequences.
The importance of the proposed residues of type I specificity have been probed by  producing DocScaB mutant derivatives (DocR14N/K50N to DocD23Q/D59Q) with single amino acid changes at both helices.
The changes (highlighted in bold  and shaded gray) were made to reflect those of the type I enzyme dockerin (Doc_Enzy).

The affinity of the resulting variants for CohScaC  was evaluated initially by NGE.
The qualitative data revealed  that all six mutated DocScaB derivatives efficiently recognized  CohScaC (Fig. 6B).
Although NGE may detect Coh-Doc interactions with Ka 105 M1  , the data suggest that the changes  introduced into helix-A of DocScaB have a marginal effect on  the capacity of the dockerin to recognize its cognate cohesin.
  To quantify the effect of the amino acid changes on the affinity  of the different dockerins to CohScaC, Coh-Doc interactions  were evaluated by SPR.
The data revealed a calculated dissociation constant of the DocScaB-CohScaC interaction of 1.3   1011 M (Table 5; Fig. 7), which is significantly higher than the  affinities reported for clostridial type I Coh-Doc interactions  that were found to display KD values of  109 M. With respect  to the DocScaB mutants, a marginal decrease in affinity was  observed with DocR14N/K50N when the basic Arg/Lys residues were replaced by Asn, the residue at the first position  before helix-A in the enzyme-borne dockerin modules.
This  may reflect the capacity of Asn to participate in the hydrogen  bond network established by Arg/Lys.
Similarly, DocL20Y/  L56Y displayed an affinity similar to wild-type DocScaB suggesting that the tyrosine residue identified in several enzymeborne dockerins may contribute to the hydrophobic nature of  the interaction.
A more pronounced reduction in affinity,  100-fold, was observed with DocI15S/I51S, suggesting that  nonpolar properties of Ile in helix-A make a significant contribution to the affinity of the interaction.
However, 1000-fold  lower affinity relative to the wild-type DocScaB was observed  for dockerins DocN16I/N52I, DocA18F/A54F, and DocD23Q/  D59Q.
Thus, the important hydrogen bonds contributed by  DocScaB Asn-16/Asn-52 are removed by the Ile replacement.
  In addition, introduction of the bulky side chains (i.e. Phe)  within helix-A causes steric clashing with those residues on the  dockerin-binding surface of CohScaC. Finally, when the Asp  residue located in helix-A is replaced by a Gln, the critical  hydrogen bonds established by this residue will be compromised.
Overall, the data suggest that residues Asn/Ile, Ala/  Phe, and Asp/Gln (ScaB/Enzyme dockerin, respectively)  located at dockerin positions 12, 14, and 19 in helix-A  (DocScaB residues 883, 885, and 890, respectively) are the most  important modulators of type I Coh-Doc specificity in A. cellulolyticus cellulosome.
  ConclusionsIn nature, type I Coh-Doc interactions are  essential for the assembly of cellulosomal enzymes onto a primary scaffoldin, which in turn attaches to the cell surface via a  type II Coh-Doc pair.
Generally, type I Coh-Doc interactions  are remarkably flexible as exemplified by the capacity of type I  dockerins to present a dual binding mode resulting from the  incidence of two identical cohesin-binding faces.
However, in  contrast, cell-surface attachment does not appear to require  this increased flexibility, as type II dockerins were shown to  display a single binding mode.
The structure of DocScaB  revealed an internal symmetry that supports the presence of  two virtually identical cohesin-binding faces.
Thus, in conjunction with previous studies of the C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum cellulosome, this report shows that flexibility in cohesin recognition seems to be a general feature of type I dockerin  modules, including those that recruit cellulosomes into the cell  surface.
Although flexibility resulting from a dual binding mode  may not be universal to all cellulosomes, in A. cellulolyticus it  seems to be essential not only for enzyme incorporation, but  also when the multienzyme complexes are targeted to the cell  surface.
In this context, the three ScaC cohesins are positioned  at the N terminus of the scaffoldin without any detectable linker  segment between them.
The dual mode of binding may therefore provide the conformational plasticity required for sufficient attachment of three ScaB adaptor subunits, together with  its complement of enzyme-laden ScaA complexes.
All of these  components must fit en masse into the spatial confines of the  particularly elaborate cellulosome architecture that characterizes the surface of this bacterial species.
