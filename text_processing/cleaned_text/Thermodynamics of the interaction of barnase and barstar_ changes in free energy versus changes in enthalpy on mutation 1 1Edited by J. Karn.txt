Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and  Barstar: Changes in Free Energy versus Changes in  Enthalpy on Mutation  Christian Frisch, Gideon Schreiber, Christopher M. Johnson  and Alan R. Fersht*  Cambridge Centre for Protein  Engineering, Medical Research  Council Centre, Hills Road  Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK  We have studied the thermodynamics of the interaction between the ribonuclease barnase and its natural polypeptide inhibitor barstar.
The contribution of specic residues and interactions within the barnase-barstar  interface to the enthalpy of binding has been examined using isothermal  titration calorimetry and protein engineering.
The enthalpy of association  of the wild-type proteins is 18.9 (0.1) kcal/mol at pH 8 and at 25C.  The enthalpy of binding remains favourable for 31 different combinations  of mutations in the interface.
The effects on the binding enthalpy upon  replacing a side-chain involved in the interaction of barnase and barstar  are, however, always unfavourable and in most cases larger than the  effects on the free energy of binding.
Interaction enthalpies calculated by  double mutant cycle analysis are in some cases much larger than the  interaction free energies.
The interaction enthalpies for complexes  between different barnase mutants with amino acid substitutions of the  general base residue glutamic acid 73 and a barstar variant (D39A) vary  by as much as 8.3 kcal/mol while the coupling free energies differ only  by 1 kcal/mol.
The use of enthalpies for the analysis of structure-activity  relationships appears to be complicated by enthalpy-entropy compensation of weak intermolecular interactions.
These tend to cancel out in  measurements of free energy, which is thus the preferred quantity for  simple analysis of interactions.

Barstar inhibits barnase by binding to its active site, forming a  1:1 complex (Figure 1: Hartley & Smeaton, 1973;  Buckle et al., 1994).
The crystal structure of the  complex of barnase with the barstar (C40A/C82A)  double mutant has been solved by Guillet et al.  (1993) at 2.6 A resolution and by Buckle et al.  (1994) at 2.0 A resolution.
The three-dimensional  structures of the free proteins are also known: for  barnase both from X-ray crystallography (Mauguen et al., 1982) and from NMR studies in solution (Bycroft et al., 1991); and for barstar from  NMR studies in solution (Lubienski et al., 1994).
  Detailed protein engineering studies on the interaction of barnase and barstar have revealed the apparent contributions of specic residues to the free  energy and kinetics of binding (Hartley, 1993;  Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a, 1995; Schreiber et al.,  1994).
In this study, we complete the thermodynamic characterisation of this interaction using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the  enthalpy of formation of barnase-barstar complexes with single amino acid substitutions in the  Present address: G.

Coupling enthalpies{were determined by the double mutant cycle method (Carter  et al., 1984; Horovitz, 1987; Fersht et al., 1992) and  compared with the corresponding coupling free  energies.
Changes in protonation on the interaction  of barnase with barstar were measured as were the  heat capacity for the interaction and its change on  mutation.
  These direct calorimetric measurements reveal  the contributions of enthalpy and entropy to the  free energy of binding.
Changes in the free energy  and enthalpy on mutation are generally not correlated (Sturtevant, 1994), however, and any interpretation of the effects on enthalpy and entropy  in structure-activity relationships is complicated by  the involvement of solvent (Hammett, 1940; Jencks,  1969).
Mark & van Gunsteren (1994) have stated  that the theoretical basis for the assignment of enthalpic contributions to the free energy to specic  atom-atom or residue-residue interactions is rm  while the free energy of these interactions can not  be determined but this has been challenged by Boresch & Karplus (1995) and Brady & Sharp (1995).
  The binding enthalpy of the association of barnase  and barstar can be determined as accurately as  the binding free energy using isothermal titration  calorimetry.
The barnase-barstar complex constitutes, therefore, an ideal system to compare experimentally determined values of coupling enthalpies  and coupling free energies for residue-residue  interactions.
  Results  Enthalpy and stoichiometry of interaction of  barnase and barstar  The enthalpy of association of barnase and barstar at 25C and at pH 8 is 18.9 (0.1) kcal/mol.
  The stoichiometry and enthalpy of interaction of  barnase and barstar are independent of protein  concentration (data not shown) or whether barnase  is titrated with barstar or vice versa (Table 1).
These  observations indicate that all the proteins are fully  folded and capable of binding the other component.
More importantly, it eliminates the possibility that one component of the system is  aggregated.
It also conrms the accuracy of the extinction coefcients of mutant barnase and barstar  proteins.
The average value for the stoichiometry  of binding (n) from all ITC measurements  performed in this study is 0.95 (standard  deviation   0.03; total number of experiments  was 220).
  The ITC measurements shown in Table 2 were  performed at an ionic strength of 0.018 M while all  other ITC measurements and all measurements of  association and dissociation rate constants were at  an ionic strength of 0.029 M. The difference in  binding enthalpy between the two ionic strengths  for the barnase-barstar and barnase-barstar(D39A)  complexes was in both cases 0.4 kcal/mol with the  lower (more negative) binding enthalpy being at  low ionic strength (see Tables 2 and 3).
The H of  the interaction of barnase and barstar increases  further at ionic strengths of 0.2 and 0.5 M, respectively (Table 3).
This is in good agreement with the  ionic strength dependence of the free energy of  binding (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a).

  Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 697Protonation changes during the interaction of  barnase and barstar  The contribution of the heat of protonation to  the heat of binding of barnase and barstar can be  determined from the binding enthalpies obtained  from ITC measurements of interaction of barnase  and barstar in buffers with different heats of ionization.
Association of barnase and barstar was  measured at 25C in three different buffers at pH 8  (Table 3).
The enthalpies of ionization (for the process HA ! H  A) at 25C for these buffers are:  7.7 kcal/mol for Tes, 4.9 kcal/mol for Hepes and  0.8 kcal/mol for phosphate buffer (Cooper &  Johnson, 1994a).
The binding enthalpies measured  in Hepes and phosphate buffer were virtually identical, whereas in Tes buffer H was decreased by  0.6 kcal/mol, which is slightly larger than the experimental error.
A similar difference of 0.7 kcal/  mol and 0.4 kcal/mol in Tes buffer was found for  the complexes between barstar and barnase(E73Q)  and barstar and barnase(E73W), respectively  (Table 3).
This decrease, however, is not very high  and since the binding enthalpies of the interaction  of barnase and barstar in Hepes and sodium phosphate buffer were the same, no correction for the  contribution of buffer titration to the observed H  was made.
The net ux of protons for the interaction of barnase and barstar at pH 8 must be  around zero, which means that the inuence of the  heat of buffer ionization is negligible.
  Association constants for the interaction of  barnase and barstar  Binding was too strong for most of the complexes to allow the association constant to be determined by ITC measurements (Figure 2).
For  complexes where Ka could be determined (barnasebarstar (D39A) and barnase(K27A)-barstar(D39A))  there is good agreement with values determined  from kinetic measurements of the association and  dissociation rate constants (Table 2).
For one complex between barnase(H102A) and barstar(D39A),  however, these Ka values were different.
This may  reect the difculty in determining Ka from ITC  measurements when the H of the interaction is  small.
  Effects of mutation on the thermodynamics  of interaction  The thermodynamic parameters of complexes  between barnase and barstar mutants of which the  free energy of interaction had been determined  previously (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995) are summarized in Table 2.

  698 Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstarbinding enthalpy (i.e. less favourable) upon mutation of one residue of the barnase-barstar binding  site, which is in most cases larger than the corresponding increase of binding free energy.
This indicates that there must be a compensating gain in  the entropy of binding.
The exceptions are the  complexes between barnase(R87A) and barstar,  and between barnase(R87A) and barstar(D39A),  where the increase of free energy of binding is  larger than the increase of binding enthalpy.
  The interaction enthalpy (Hint) between several pairs of residues was determined using the  double mutant cycle method (Carter et al., 1984;  Horovitz, 1987; Fersht et al., 1992).
In this procedure, two residues, X and Y, are mutated singly  and pairwise and the interaction energy (Gint)  is calculated as:  Gint  GXY  GX!A  GY!A  GX!A;Y!A 1  where GXY is the free energy of the wild-type,  GX ! A and GY ! A are the free energies of the  two single mutants and GX ! A, Y ! A the free energy of the double mutant.
If the effects of the two  mutations are independent, Gint should be zero.
  If the effects are coupled, the change in energy  for the double mutant should be different from  the sum of the changes in G of the two single  mutants.
A negative value of Gint indicates a  favourable interaction.
Interaction free energies between residues on barnase and barstar have been  observed only between residues that are located  at a distance of less than 8 A from each other,  suggesting that possible changes in structure or  solvation resulting from mutagenesis are limited to  a short distance from the site of mutation (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995).
The double mutant cycle method can also be used to calculate an interaction  enthalpy or interaction entropy (Sint).
In an  ideal situation, the interaction energies of X and Y  with the rest of the protein and with solvent and  possible reorganisation energy terms will cancel  out to leave just the interaction energies between X  and Y (Fersht et al., 1992).
The coupling enthalpies  between residues His102(bn) and Tyr29(b*) and  between Lys27(bn) and Asp39(b*) are 7.6 and  9.4 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 3A).
((bn) indicates that the residue is in barnase, and (b*) indicates that it is in barstar).
These are 4.3 and  4.6 kcal/mol higher than the corresponding free  Table 2.

  For the G values obtained from the association and dissociation rate constants, the standard error of the  mean (s) was calculated from three to ve repetitions of each experiment for all of the data for mutant proteins  and for more measurements on wild-type proteins.
The standard error of the mean for association and dissociation rate constants is about 12%.
Accordingly, 2s, the 95% condence level, for G is 0.2 kcal mol1  , for  Gwt-mut the 2s is 0.2 kcal mol1 (since the error for the wild-type data is substantially smaller).
  For the H and G values obtained by ITC, the standard error of the mean was calculated from at least three  repetitions of each experiment and the 2s is between 0.1 and 0.4 kcal mol  1 as is for 2s for Hwt-mut.
For  complexes where both possible calorimetric titrations have been performed (see Table 1), all data were averaged.
  Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 699energy interaction values.
The interaction between  Arg87(bn) and Asp39(b*) has an interaction enthalpy of 8.0 kcal/mol while the Gint is  6.1 kcal/mol.
These enthalpy values are far too  high for the interaction of His102(bn) with the phenyl ring of Tyr29(b*) or for the long-range electrostatic interaction (charged atoms are 4.5 A apart)  between Lys27(bn) and Asp39(b*) or the hydrogen  bond between Arg87(bn) and Asp39(b*).
There are,  therefore, probably additional effects (solvent or  other reorganisation effects) that lead to a decrease  in binding enthalpy in the complexes between the  barnase and barstar single mutants (``double mutant complexes'') compared with at least one of  the corresponding complexes between barnase or  barstar wild-type and a single barstar or barnase  mutant (``single mutant complexes'') that does not  cancel out in the double mutant cycle.
  Values of Hint of the barnase(H102A)-barstar(Y29F) and barnase(R59A)-barstar(D39A) complexes should be zero, since the side-chains of  Arg59(bn) and Asp39(b*) are too far apart to interact and the hydroxyl group of Tyr29(b*) does not  interact with His102(bn) (Buckle et al., 1994;  Schreiber & Fersht, 1995).
In both cases, however,  signicant interaction enthalpies of 1.6 kcal/mol  for barnase(H102A)-barstar(Y29F) and 1.7 kcal/  mol for barnase(R59A)-barstar(D39A) were found.
  The free energy of association of the latter complex  was determined only by ITC, which could not be  done very accurately, since the enthalpy of association is only 1.7 kcal/mol.
For this reason, no  interaction free energy has been determined for  this complex.
  Changes in H and G of binding for different  barnase(E73) mutant-barstar complexes  To investigate possible contributions of solvent  and reorganisation to the measured binding enthalpy that do not seem to cancel out in the double  mutant cycles, the binding energetics of a series of  barnase mutants at one position in the binding interface were determined.
Glutamic acid 73 of barnase was chosen for this study since its side-chain  reaches into a large water-lled cavity at the centre  of the barnase-barstar interface (Buckle et al., 1994).
  The side-chain of Glu73 makes three interactions  with water molecules that are buried in the interface but it is not involved in a direct interaction  with barstar (Figure 1; Buckle et al., 1994).
Computer modelling suggests that Glu73 could even be  substituted by tryptophan without causing clashes  with neighbouring residues.
Glu73 was substituted  by Gln, Trp, Tyr, Phe, Ser, Cys and Ala (unpublished results).
The binding thermodynamics of the  complexes between these barnase mutants and barstar and barstar mutants are summarized in  Table 3.

  700 Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and BarstarTable 3.
While the destabilizing effect on G for  the interaction of the different barnase(E73) mutants with barstar varied only between 1.4 and  3 kcal/mol, the change in H was between 8.2  and 11.6 kcal/mol.
Considering the large change  in H in all the barnase(E73) mutant-barstar complexes (compared with the barnase-barstar complex), the differences between them are relatively  small.
  The values of Gint of the complexes between  different barnase(E73) mutants and barstar(D35A)  or barstar(E76A) are all around zero within experimental error (Figure 3B).
The values of Hint for  these complexes are on average slightly higher but  they are in all cases lower than 1 kcal/mol.
This is  the expected result because these residues are not  involved in direct interactions (and Asp35(b*) does  not interact with Lys27(bn), which might be affected by the mutation of Glu73(bn)).
The value of  Gint of the complexes between different barnase(E73) mutants and barstar(D39A) is on average  2.5 kcal/mol and varies only between 1.9 and  2.9 kcal/mol for the four different barnaseE73  mutants analysed (Figure 3B).
This interaction free  energy could result from either a perturbation of  the water network within the binding site or a loss  (or a weakening) of the interaction of residues  Arg83(bn), Arg87(bn) and Lys27(bn) with barstar  (especially with Asp39(b*)) caused by reorganisation.

  G and H values were taken from Table 2 and  Table 3, respectively.
For Gint the standard error (2s)  is 0.3 kcal/mol and for Hint it is between 0.2 and  0.5 kcal/mol.
  Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 701and Glu76(b*) suggests a reorganisation conned  to the region around residue 73 of barnase, which  should be similar in all cases.
  In contrast, the value of Hint of the complexes  between different barnase(E73) mutants and barstar(D39A) is very large and varies between 8.2  and 16.5 kcal/mol (Figure 3B).
This results from  a decrease in binding enthalpy of the double mutant complexes compared with at least one of the  single mutant complexes of the cycle, as has been  observed for the other double mutant cycles with a  very high interaction enthalpy (Tables 2 and 3).
  The heat capacity of the interaction of barnase  and barstar  The change in heat capacity, Cp, is related to  solvation changes between two states of a system  and it can be determined from ITC measurements  performed over a range of temperatures from the  relationship (Privalov & Potekhin, 1987):  Cp  dH  dT 2  ITC measurements of the interaction of barnase  Figure 4.Enthalpy of the association  of barnase and barstar as a function  of temperature.

e Total buried accessible surface area (Lee & Richards, 1971: polar and non-polar, respectively) upon complex formation calculated  with the program GRASP (Nicholls, 1992) using a probe size of 1.4 A .
Polar atoms are N and O. The structure of the barnase-barstar(C40A/C82A) complex (Buckle et al., 1994) has been used.
The buried accessible surface area of this complex should not be very  different from that of the barnase-barstar wild-type complex, since the two cysteine residues in barstar are relatively buried  (Lubienski et al., 1994) and the structures of wild-type barstar and barstar(C40A/C82A) are identical (Wong et al., 1996).
For the barnase(E73)-barstar complexes, Glu73 was replaced by the respective residue using the software package Insight II (Biosym Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA), and the buried accessible surface area was calculated as for the complex between the wild-type proteins.
f In 10.25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 1 mM DTT (m  0.029 M).
  702 Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstarand barstar and for six different barnase(E73) mutant-barstar complexes were performed at ve  different temperatures (8, 16.5, 25, 31 and 37C).
  The H of binding of all of these complexes depends strongly on temperature.
The binding enthalpies were plotted against temperature (Figure 4)  and the data were t both to a linear function and  to a second-order polynomial to obtain values for  Cp.
All the data t better to a second-order polynomial, indicating a small temperature dependence  of the Cp of binding.
The slight curvature in the  plots becomes especially apparent on examining  the residuals of the linear and the polynomial ts  (Figure 4); the residuals of the polynomial ts are  randomly distributed while the residuals of the  linear ts show a systematic curvature.
The differences, however, between the Cp values from  the linear t and the Cp values at 25C from  the second-order polynomial t are very small  (Table 4).
  The Cp values of the complexes analysed are  relatively large and negative and they are all very  similar (the Cp values are almost all smaller  than the experimental error: Table 4).
Glu73 contributes only 11 A 2 to a total of 1600 A 2 of accessible surface area buried upon complex formation  between barnase and barstar.
Hence, the expected  changes in the burial of polar and non-polar accessible surface area on mutation of Glu73 are small  (Table 4).
The very similar Cp values suggest that  there is no large structural perturbation within  the interface of the barnase-barstar complex on  mutation of Glu73(bn).
  Discussion  The binding enthalpy of the interaction of barnase and barstar can be measured accurately by  isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).
The values  do not depend on protein concentration and the  same values are obtained for both the calorimetric  titration of barnase with barstar and vice versa.
  There is only a negligible protonation change upon  association at pH 8, which is, according to the theory of linked functions (Wyman, 1964), consistent  with the nding that the dissociation constant of  the barnase-barstar complex between pH 7 and 9 is  practically invariant (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a).
  For two complexes (barnase-barstar(D39A), barnase(K27A)-barstar(D39A)) the Ka values could be  determined accurately by ITC.
These are in good  agreement with the Ka values determined independently from the association and dissociation rate  constants (Table 2; Schreiber & Fersht, 1995).
The  ITC measurements have, therefore, conrmed the  proposed scheme of complex formation, in which  one association/dissociation equilibrium for barnase-barstar complex formation is involved (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a).
Hence, Ka values of the  interaction of barnase and barstar from direct  measurements should be generally the same as  the Ka values determined from the association and  dissociation rate constants.
  The Cp value represents the difference in heat  capacity at constant pressure that is related to solvation changes between two states of a system.
It  was shown that most of the heat capacity change  associated with the unfolding of the native state of  a protein can be expressed as a linear combination  of the differences in polar and non-polar solventaccessible surface areas between those states (Murphy & Freire, 1992; Spolar et al., 1992), and it was  suggested that this approach applies also to protein-protein interactions, since the atomic interactions involved are similar in both cases (Murphy  et al., 1993; Gomez & Freire, 1995).
The following  equation, derived from model compound studies,  relates Cp to the polar (Ap) and non-polar  (Anp) surface area buried upon folding or interaction (Murphy & Freire, 1992; Murphy et al.,  1993):  Cp  0:45Anp  0:26Ap cal mol1 K1 3  For the barnase-barstar complex the polar and  non-polar surface area buried between the interface  is about 894 A 2 and 706 A 2  , respectively (Table 4).
  Hence, the calculated Cp is 85 cal mol1 K1  .
  The Cp of binding of the barnase-barstar complex, however, was estimated to be 363 cal  mol1 K1 assuming that it is independent of temperature and 384 cal mol1 K1 (at 25C) assuming it is temperature dependent.
A lack of  correlation between the measured and the calculated Cp values (using the same equation) was  also found for other protein-protein interactions  (Raman et al., 1995; Schwarz et al., 1995; Pearce  et al., 1996).
This suggests that while the heat capacity change for protein folding often correlates  well with the burial of non-polar and polar surface  area, a similar correlation may not apply to protein-protein interactions.
  For most of the mutant complexes between barnase and barstar the increase of the enthalpy of  binding is larger than the increase of the free energy of binding.
This indicates enthalpy-entropy  compensation, which seems to be a characteristic  of weak intermolecular interactions (Dunitz, 1995).
  Coupling enthalpies of non-interacting residues are  on average larger than the corresponding coupling  free energies, which are all smaller than 1 kcal/  mol, but none is larger than 1.7 kcal/mol.
Coupling enthalpies of directly or indirectly (through  stabilization of neighbouring residues) interacting  residues are, however, in most cases much larger  than the corresponding coupling free energies and,  in contrast to the interaction free energies, they  vary considerably for the different barnase(E73)  mutant-barstar(D39A) complexes.
  Mark & van Gunsteren (1994) claim that,  whereas the enthalpy of interaction of individual  residues may in principle be determined by calculation or experiment, the associated free energies  cannot, because of difculties in the calculation of  Thermodynamics of the Interaction of Barnase and Barstar 703entropy: there are changes in the entropy of the  protein and solvent on mutation that are non-additive.
Thus, the total free energy of a system cannot  be expressed in terms of a sum of components.
  Boresch & Karplus (1995) and Brady & Sharp  (1995) have set out the counter arguments that G  can be usefully calculated and measured.
There is  also an experimental justication of why measurements of G are more meaningful than those of  H because of entropy-enthalpy compensation.
  For over 50 years, G has been preferred by physical-organic chemists for analysing reactions in solution and is even considered a more accurate  measure of changes in enthalpy than is the  measured value of H (Hammett, 1940).
This  stems from the large number of observations, summarized by Jencks (1969) and Lumry & Rajender  (1970), that changes in values of H (and S) on  changes in structure for processes in solution contain contributions from changes in the enthalpy  and entropy of water that are compensating. It has  also been shown theoretically that on forming a  cavity in water to accommodate a solvent molecule, the change in the enthalpy of water (the solvation or cavity term) is exactly balanced by the  entropy of the cavity (Ben-Naim, 1975; Yu &  Karplus, 1988).
Thus, measured values of H and  S contain contributions from H(solv) and S(solv),  which may obscure them but cancel out in G because G(solv) (H(solv)  TS(solv)) is zero.
Dunitz  (1995) has analysed entropy-enthalpy compensation semi-quantitatively and has shown that it  extends to all weak interactions so that there is  nearly complete enthalpy-entropy compensation at  300 K for interactions of about 5 kcal mol1  .
The results in this study show that the changes in G are  reasonable and rational, but that those in enthalpy  can be large and erratic, as are those for changes in  protein stability (Sturtevant, 1994).
Thus, measurements of G are preferable to those of H for  analysing structure-activity relationships.
  Materials and Methods  Protein expression and purification  Barnase and barstar were expressed and puried as  described (Mossakowska et al., 1989; Serrano et al., 1990;  Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a; Lubienski et al., 1994).
All barnase and barstar mutants used in this study have been  described (Schreiber & Fersht, 1995; G.S., C.F. & A.R.F.,  unpublished results).
  Isothermal titration calorimetry  Barnase and barstar samples were dialysed exhaustively at 4C against the same batch of buffer, previously  ltered using 0.2 mm lters (Sartolab V-500, Sartorius,  Gottingen, Germany).
After dialysis, the proteins were  centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for ten  minutes and then diluted with dialysis buffer to the required concentration.
Protein samples were degassed  under vacuum for ve minutes with gentle stirring immediately before use.
Experiments were performed in  Hepes buffer (pH 8), 1 mM DTT because barstar tends to  aggregate in the cell of the calorimeter in Tris buffer at  pH 8 (data not shown).
Tris buffer was used for  measurements of the interaction of barnase and barstar  in previous studies (Schreiber & Fersht, 1993a, 1995,  1996; Schreiber et al., 1994).
The DTT was added to the  buffer to prevent oxidation and dimerization of barstar  (Frisch et al., 1995).
  Measurements were also performed in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8), 1 mM DTT and Tes buffer (pH 8),  1 mM DTT, to examine the contribution of the heat of  buffer ionization to barnase-barstar binding.
Measurements were not routinely performed in phosphate buffer  because the active site of barnase binds phosphate with  a Kd of 1.3 mM (Meiering et al., 1992), which could complicate the determination of the binding enthalpy of  barstar and barnase.
  ITC measurements were performed as described  (Wiseman et al., 1989; Cooper & Johnson, 1994a) using  an OMEGA isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal,  Northampton, MA, USA).
The protein concentration in  the cell of the calorimeter ranged from 0.01 to 0.06 mM,  while the titrant solutions were about nine times higher.
  Figure 2 shows data from a typical calorimetric titration  experiment of the association between barnase and barstar.
The binding data were analysed using OriginTM  software (Microcal, Northampton, MA, USA) and were  tted either with a xed value of Ka, which was calculated from independently measured values of the association and dissociation rate constants to obtain values for  the stoichiometry of binding (n) and H, or with no  parameters xed to obtain n, H and Ka.
  The calculation of the enthalpy of association from  ITC measurements is based on the concentration of the  titrant (sample in the injection syringe).
Errors in its concentration or the presence of aggregated and/or inactive  material can lead to large deviations from the true enthalpy of association.
Hence, for a number of combinations of mutants, barnase was titrated with barstar  and vice versa (see Table 1).
  The protein concentration was determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm, corrected for light scattering (Drake, 1994).
Extinction coefcients (e280  M1 cm1),  determined by the method of Gill & von Hippel  (1989), are: barstar, 22171 M1 cm1  ; barstar(Y29A),  20643 M1 cm1  ; barstar(Y29F), 20798 M1 cm1  ; barnase,  27404 M1 cm1  ; barnase(E73W), 33863 M1 cm1  ; and  barnase(E73Y), 28769 M1 cm1  .
The extinction coef-  cients of all other mutants were calculated from the  wild-type values.
(The amino acid substitution(s) of mutant proteins are indicated in parentheses).
  Kinetic and equilibrium measurements  Association and dissociation rate constants for the barnase-barstar complexes were measured in 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8) at 25C as described (Schreiber & Fersht,  1993a, 1995, 1996; Schreiber et al., 1994).
