Structure of Slitrk2PTP complex reveals mechanisms for splicing-dependent trans-synaptic adhesion Selective binding between pre- and postsynaptic adhesion molecules can induce synaptic differentiation.
Here we report the crystal structure of a synaptogenic trans-synaptic adhesion complex between Slit and Trk-like family member 2 (Slitrk2) and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) .
The structure and site-directed mutational analysis revealed the structural basis of splicing-dependent adhesion between Slitrks and type IIa RPTPs for inducing synaptic differentiation.
 Synapse formation is initiated at contact sites between axon terminals and dendrites, where pre- and postsynaptic adhesion molecules form trans-synaptic complexes to induce synaptic differentiation.
Presynaptic type IIa receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) (PTP, PTP and LAR in mammals) can induce synaptic differentiation by binding to various postsynaptic adhesion molecules such as IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1), IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), netrin-G ligand-3 (NGL-3), neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinases C (TrkC) and Slit- and Trk-like (Slitrk) proteins.
In mammals, the Slitrk family consists of at least six members (Slitrk1-6).
Mutations in SLITRK genes have been reported to be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.
All Slitrk members except Slitrk3 can induce both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, whereas Slitrk3 selectively induces inhibitory synapses through binding to PTP.
Therefore, it has been proposed that the selective binding between Slitrk proteins and PTP plays a role in balancing excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
 Selective binding between the type IIa RPTPs and their cognate postsynaptic partners is regulated in part by alternative splicing of the type IIa RPTPs.
PTP expressed in the developing brain consists of three immunoglobulin-like (Ig) and four fibronectin type III (Fn) domains in the extracellular region, where two splice sites exist within Ig2 and between Ig2 and Ig3 (Fig. 1a).
Peptide insertions (termed mini-exon peptides) at these two splice sites (referred hereafter to as meA and meB) generate splice variants of PTP.
In this study, we determined the crystal structure between the first leucine-rich repeat (LRR1) of mouse Slitrk2 and the Ig1Fn1 domains of PTP containing both meA and meB. The structure showed that Slitrk2 LRR1 directly recognizes meB but not meA. Further structure-based mutational analyses using surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and synaptogenic co-culture assay demonstrated that binding of Slitrk2 to PTP depends on meB. Results and Discussion Overall structure For structural studies, we initially examined the PTP-binding region of Slitrk4 and found that mouse Slitrk4 LRR1 is sufficient for binding to the extracellular domain of PTP (PTP-ECD) (Supplementary Figure 1a).
However, our co-crystallization trials using Slitrk4 LRR1 and the full-length or truncated PTP-ECD failed.
We then screened other Slitrk members in terms of their expression level in FreeStyle293F cells and their binding activities to PTP-ECD and selected mouse Slitrk2 LRR1 as the next candidate for crystallization.
After optimization of the length of PTP-ECD (Supplementary Figure 1b), we finally determined the crystal structure of a complex between Slitrk2 LRR1 and PTP Ig1-Fn1 at 3.35 resolution (Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Figure 2a and Table 1).
The asymmetric unit contains one complex, where Slitrk2 LRR1 binds to PTP Ig1-Fn1 at a ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figure 2b).
Slitrk2 LRR1 interacts with PTP Ig2-3.
The overall structure of PTP Ig1-Fn1 exhibits an elongated shape.
PTP Ig1-2 forms a compact V-shaped unit, similarly to LAR or PTP Ig1-2.
Ig3 is spatially separated from Ig1-2 by meB. The following Fn1 is linearly aligned to Ig3.
Slitrk2 LRR1 comprises a central LRR with seven parallel -strands flanked by N- and C-terminal caps, which are stabilized by disulfide bonds (Fig. 1c).
The total nine -strands in the N-terminal cap and LRR form a concave surface of Slitrk2.
The interior of the convex side is rich in completely conserved phenylalanine residues, which form a Phe spine structure as observed in the Nogo receptor (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figure3).
 Binding interface The concave surface of Slitrk2 LRR1 surrounds two strands in PTP Ig2 and meB (234ELRE237) with a buried surface area of 6442 (Fig. 2a).
Asp167 and Glu215 of Slitrk2 hydrogen bond with Arg236 of PTP (the third residue of meB) (Fig. 2b).
In addition, Asp142, Asn166 and Asp187 of Slitrk2 hydrogen bond with Arg233 of PTP (one-residue upstream of meB).
Surrounding these interactions, Arg114 and Arg189 of Slitrk2 hydrogen bond with Gln209 and Glu145 of PTP, respectively, whereas Arg114 and His185 of Slitrk2 hydrogen bond with the main-chain O atoms of PTP Val232 and Leu141, respectively.
Furthermore, Tyr138 of Slitrk2 is stacked with Tyr231 of PTP.
These Slitrk2 residues involved in the interaction with PTP Ig2-meB are mostly conserved in all mouse Slitrk members (Supplementary Figure 3), suggesting that they can potentially recognize PTP Ig2-meB in the same manner as Slitrk2.
 Slitrk2 LRR1 also interacts with PTP Ig3 with a buried surface area of 4502 (Fig. 2c).
Phe247 and His250 of Slitrk2 hydrophobically interact with Tyr273 of PTP, which hydrogen bonds with the main-chain O atom of Slitrk2 Glu244 (Fig. 2d). Phe247 of Slitrk2 also hydrophobically interacts with Met289 of PTP and appears to play a central role in the Slitrk2 LRR1PTP Ig3 interface.
However, this phenylalanine residue is replaced by Thr, Ser or Pro in Slitrk1, 4 or 6, respectively (Supplementary Figure 3), which are inadequate to form hydrophobic interactions with Tyr273 and Met289 of PTP.
In addition, His250 of Slitrk2 is not conserved in Slitrk1, 4 or 6 (Supplementary Figure 3).
Therefore, the observed Slitrk2PTP Ig3 interactions may be specific to Slitrk2, 3 and 5.
 Splicing-dependent interactions and synaptogenic activity In the crystal structure of the Slitrk2PTP complex, Slitrk2 LRR1 directly recognizes the meB insertion of PTP, whereas the meA insertion is distant from Slitrk2 LRR1 (Fig. 2a).
Therefore, the present structure clearly indicates that binding of PTP to Slitrk2 depends on meB but not on meA. To ensure this finding, we examined the binding of Slitrk2 LRR1 to the PTP variants containing either or both meA and meB (meA9B-, meA-B+ and meA9B+) by surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy (Fig. 3a).
As expected, the meA9B+ and meA-B+ variants bound to Slitrk2 LRR1 with similar affinities, whereas the meA9B- variant hardly bound to Slitrk2 LRR1 (Fig. 3a, c and Supplementary Figure 4).
We next assessed the observed Slitrk2PTP interactions by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figure 4).
The R236E mutation of PTP and the D167A and E215A mutations of Slitrk2, which disrupt the meB-specific interactions, abolished the binding between Slitrk2 and PTP.
The D187A mutation of Slitrk2, which disrupts the hydrogen bond with Arg233 of PTP (one-residue upstream of meB), also abolished the binding.
Accordingly, the D167A, D187A or E215A mutant of Slitrk2 abolished or significantly reduced their synaptogenic activities in our co-culture assay (Fig. 4).
On the other hand, the R114A mutation of Slitrk2 (PTP Ig2-mediated interface), the Y273A mutation of PTP or the F247A H250A double mutation of Slitrk2 (PTP Ig3-mediated interface) hardly affected the binding.
Therefore, the R114A or F247A H250A mutant of Slitrk2 exhibited the synaptogenic activity comparable to wild-type Slitrk2 (Fig. 4).
These results perfectly support the finding that binding of PTP to Slitrk2 depends on meB (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figure 4).
 Structural comparison with the Slitrk1 LRR1PTP complex Recently, the crystal structure of the complex between Slitrk1 LRR1 and PTP Ig1-3 has been reported.
The main-chain structure of Slitrk1 LRR1 is almost identical to that of Slitrk2 LRR1 with an rmsd of 1.3 (Supplementary Figure 5a).
Slitrk1 LRR1 interacts with PTP Ig2-meB in a similar manner to Slitrk2 LRR1 (Supplementary Figure 5b and c).
The hydrophilic interactions between PTP Ig2-meB and Slitrk LRR1 are essentially the same, consistent with the sequence conservation between Slitrk1 and 2 (Supplementary Figure 3).
On the other hand, the relative position and orientation of PTP Ig3 to PTP Ig2-meBSlitrk LRR1 are substantially different between the complexes of Slitrk1 and 2 (Supplementary Figure 5d).
Concomitantly, the PTP Ig3-mediated interfaces are different between the Slitrk1 and 2 complexes (Supplementary Figure 5e).
Physiological significance of this difference remains obscure, because the PTP Ig3-mediated interface appears unlikely to contribute to the affinity to Slitrk proteins as mentioned above.
 Trans-synaptic clustering of the Slitrk1PTP complex has been proposed on the basis of the lateral interaction between neighboring complexes in the crystal.
This lateral interaction involves Arg72, Phe74 and Arg143 of Slitrk1 and Glu237 and Glu286 of PTP.
On the other hand, no higher-order clustering was observed in the crystal of the Slitrk2PTP complex (Supplementary Figure 2b).
Arg143 of Slitrk1 corresponds to Ser147 of Slitrk2, which is exposed to the solvent (Supplementary Figure 5f).
Arg72 and Phe74 of Slitrk1 correspond to Arg76 and Tyr78 of Slitrk2, respectively, which interact with Asp378 of the neighboring PTP Fn1 but appear unable to form higher-order clustering (Supplementary Figure 5f).
 In conclusion, we revealed that binding of Slitrk2 to PTP depends on meB but not on meA, based on the crystal structure and mutational studies at the molecular and cellular levels.
Our previous analysis of cDNA from the developing mouse brain showed that PTP and LAR also have the splicing variants containing a four-residue insert as meB with the conserved third arginine residue, suggesting that the meB-containing variants of all type IIa RPTPs can potentially bind to all Slitrk proteins.
In fact, a recent study showed that the meB-containing variant of LAR can bind to Slitrk1 (ref. 17).
Other example of splicing-dependent regulation of trans-synaptic adhesion through the type IIa RPTPs is the adhesion between PTP and IL1RAPL1 or IL-1RAcP. Further studies for these complexes, together with the present study, will lead to complete understanding of splicing-dependent regulation of trans-synaptic adhesions for synaptic differentiation.
 Methods Protein expression and purification The gene encoding mouse PTP Ig1-Fn1 (residues 28418) was amplified from cDNA (accession No. NM_011211.3) by PCR and cloned into pEBMulti-Neo vector (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) with the N-terminal signal sequence derived from pHLsec vector and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag.
The gene encoding mouse Slitrk2 LRR1 was cloned into pEBMulti-Neo vector with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag.
The proteins were transiently expressed in Freestyle293F cells and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography.
Slitrk2 LRR1 was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography with Superdex200 increase (GE healthcare).
 Crystallization and structure determination We tested the interaction between the various truncation mutants of mouse Slitrk proteins and PTP by pull down experiments using Fc-fused PTP.
Consequently, we found that first LRR domain (LRR1) of Slitrk proteins and PTP extracellular regions containing Ig1-Fn1 are sufficient for their binding.
Slitrk2 LRR1 and PTP Ig1-Fn1 were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1.
Prior to the crystallization, the sample was treated with neuraminidase for trimming N-linked glycans.
Crystallization was carried out with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 293K by mixing the equal volumes (1L) of the protein solution and the mother liquor containing 15% PEG4000, 0.1M sodium acetate, 0.1M MES (pH 6.0).
The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after soaking in the mother liquor containing 25% ethylene glycol for cryoprotection.
 Diffraction data were collected at 100K at BL41XU in SPring-8 and processed with HKL2000.
The structure of Slitrk2 LRR1 and PTP Ig1-Fn1 was solved by the molecular replacement method using the program MolRep.
For PTP Ig1-Fn1, Ig1-2 of PTP (PDB ID:2YD6), Ig3 of PTP (PDB ID:2YD9) and Fn2 of LAR (PDB ID:2DJU) were used as the search model.
For Slitrk2 LRR1, the Nogo receptor LRR domain (PDB ID:1OZN) was used as the search model.
Model building was carried out using the program Coot.
The model was refined using the program Phenix to the final Rwork/Rfree factors of 23.46/28.65%.
The stereochemistry of the final model was assessed by Procheck.
Data collection and refinement statistics were summarized in Table 1.
The buried surface area was calculated using the program PISA.
All structural figures are prepared using the program PyMol (Schrdinger, LLC).
 SPR analysis SPR experiments were carried out by using Biacore T200 (GE healthcare) at 25C in 10mM HEPES-Na buffer (pH 7.9) containing 150mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20.
The wild-type or mutant Slitrk2 LRR1 (D167A, D187A, E215A, R114A or F247A H250A) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor tip by the amine-coupling method.
The splicing variant (meA9B+, meA9B- or meA-B+) or mutant (R236E or Y273A) of PTP Ig1-Fn1 was injected at concentrations ranging from 15.625 to 4,000nM. 10mM NaOH was used as a regeneration buffer.
 Synaptogenic assay Primary cortical cultures were prepared from mice at E18 essentially as described previously.
Expression vectors for the mutated forms of Slitrk2-LRR1-Fc were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis using pEB6-Slitrk2-LRR1-Fc as a template.
Fc and the mutated forms of Slitrk2-LRR1-Fc in FreeStyle293F cell culture medium were bound to Protein A-conjugated magnetic particles (smooth surface, 4.04.5m diameter; Spherotech).
Beads coupled with Fc or the Fc fusion proteins were added to cortical neurons at days in vitro 16.
After 24hours, cultures were fixed for immunostaining with mouse anti-Bassoon antibody (Stressgen, 1:400) and rabbit anti-human Fc (Rockland, 1:1000).
 Image acquisition and quantification Images of bead-neuron co-cultures were collected from at least two separate experiments.
Image acquisition and quantification for the co-culture assays were performed essentially as previously described.
Briefly, the intensities of immunostaining signals for Bassoon were measured as the optical mean density within a circle of 7-m diameter enclosing coated-bead.
Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukeys test.
