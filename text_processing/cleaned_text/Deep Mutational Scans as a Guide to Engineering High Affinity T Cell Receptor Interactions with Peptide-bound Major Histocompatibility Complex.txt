For example,  many studies have used phage- or yeastdisplay libraries of mutants within   complementarity determining regions (CDRs)  to affinity mature antibodies and T cell   receptors (TCRs).
However, these  approaches do not allow rapid assessment or   evolution across the entire interface.
By   combining directed evolution with deep   sequencing it is now possible to generate   sequence fitness landscapes that survey the  impact of every amino acid substitution   across the entire protein-protein interface.
  Here we used the results of deep mutational   scans of a TCR:peptide-major   histocompatibility complex (pepMHC)   interaction to guide mutational strategies.
The   approach yielded stable TCRs with affinity   increases of over 200-fold.
The substitutions   with the greatest enrichments based on the   deep sequencing were validated to have   higher affinity, and could be combined to   yield additional improvements.
We also   conducted in silico binding analyses for every   substitution to compare with the fitness   landscape.
Computational modeling did not   well predict the impacts of mutations distal to   the interface, and did not account for yeast   display results that depended on   combinations of affinity and protein stability.
  However, computation accurately predicted   affinity changes for mutations within or near   the interface, highlighting the complementary   strengths of computational modeling and   yeast surface display coupled with deep   mutational scanning for engineering high   affinity TCRs.
  The process of increasing the affinity   of a protein occurs naturally with antibodies,   where somatic mutation within the variable   region genes is followed by antigen-driven   selection of B cells that express membranebound antibodies.
In contrast, T cell receptors   (TCRs) do not undergo somatic mutations   and bind to their antigen, a peptide:MHC   The latest version is at http://www.jbc.org/cgi/doi/10.1074/jbc.

However, improvements in TCR   affinity to the same levels of antibodies can   be achieved by in vitro approaches involving   the generation of mutant TCR libraries   followed by antigen selection (1-3).
  For therapeutic purposes, the affinity   of a variety of protein-protein interactions,   and especially antibody:antigen interactions,  have been enhanced using in vitro directed   evolution approaches including phage, yeast,   ribosomal, and mammalian display (e.g. (4-  7)).
These methods rely on the generation of   large libraries of mutants at residues within  the protein-protein interface, followed by   several rounds of selection for desired   parameters (such as affinity, stability and   expression levels) (8,9).
  While directed evolution using larger   degenerate libraries has been successful, the   most recent techniques involving deep   sequencing of single-codon libraries have the   potential to provide both mechanistic   structural information about a binding site and   at the same time provide leads for affinity   improvements.
Sequence fitness landscapes   have successfully been utilized to map   protein-DNA interactions (10), protein-peptide   interactions (11), and protein-protein   interactions (12).
Furthermore, using a PDZ   protein domain as a model system,   McLaughlin and colleagues were able to   manipulate ligand-binding specificity through   key mutations identified using sequence   fitness landscapes (13).
Additionally, a   sequence fitness landscape of an influenzabinding protein inhibitor was used to enhance   affinity and redirect specificity towards a   single H1 hemagglutinin subtype (14).
  A major goal in protein engineering is   to be able to accurately identify mutations   that yield improvements in stability or affinity.
  In addition to directed evolution and   sequence fitness landscapes, when the   protein structures are known, structure-based   computational design has also been used to   achieve these goals.
Although there have   been inspiring successes (reviewed in (15)),   advances in computational approaches   require a thorough understanding of the   relationships between protein structural and   physical properties, as well as increases in   the ability to rapidly and accurately sample   different conformational and configurational   states (16).
  In the present study, we focused on   TCRs because they have evolved to bind to a   diverse repertoire of clinically relevant targets  and thus represent a class of molecules with   significant therapeutic potential.
In addition,   because of their naturally low affinities they   represent protein-engineering targets for both   stability and affinity.
Previously, we reported  successful affinity engineering of TCRs by   directed evolution using yeast display (2,17-  21) and mammalian cell display (7,22).
We   also described structure-guided design   strategies that estimated the binding energies   of both favorable and unfavorable mutations   and led to the design of additional highaffinity TCRs (23,24).
  More recently, we reported the use of   single-codon libraries with two different TCRs   to generate sequence fitness landscapes that   allowed analysis of the impact of each   residue on binding to their cognate pep-HLAA2 complexes (25).
Sequence fitness   landscapes offer a powerful perspective of   protein-protein interactions not available from   structural data alone by experimentally   determining, on a residue-by-residue basis,   which amino acids contribute to binding as   well as the most optimal amino acids at each   position (11,26).
Accordingly, the two higher   affinity TCRs, A6-c134 and RD1-MART1HIGH,   that are specific for Tax/HLA-A2 and   MART1/HLA-A2 respectively, were examined   both structurally and by deep scanning  mutagenesis to determine the basis of   specificity and binding (25).
  Here we further studied the mutations   that were highly enriched in the sequence   fitness landscape of the cancer antigenspecific TCR, RD1-MART1HIGH, interacting   with its target peptide-MHC by yeast surface   display.
We demonstrate that the mutations   that exhibited the highest levels of   enrichment acted both individually and in   synergy to significantly increase the affinity   and yeast surface levels of the RD1-  MART1HIGH TCR.
We also compared   strategies that involved individual    by guest on September 30, 2016 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Engineering protein-protein interactions  3!  combinations of mutations versus   construction and selection of multi-codon   libraries, both based on the sequence fitness   landscape.
These approaches were further   compared to computationally predicted   affinity enhancing mutations using a   previously described in silico approach  (24,27).
Some of the highest enriched   residues identified in the sequence fitness   landscape were successfully identified by the   in silico approach, but these were not   distinguished from many other substitutions   that did not yield substantial enrichment.
This   is likely due in part to the sensitivity of yeast   surface display to not only changes in   binding, but also changes in protein stability.
  The in silico approach nonetheless performed   well when focused on mutations   experimentally shown to improve binding and   proved advantageous for providing structural  interpretations.
Overall, we show that deep   sequencing methods combined with yeast   display provides for significant opportunities   for enhancing TCR affinity while also   controlling for impacts on stability, and   demonstrate the utility of computational   modeling in providing structural   interpretations for affinity gains.
  RESULTS   Approaches to engineering a   TCR/MHC interaction for higher affinity - The   A6 TCR was previously used as a template  for directed evolution of a novel peptide   specificity, whereby the specificity was   switched from Tax/HLA-A2 to the completely   distinct cancer peptide, MART1/HLA-A2 (21).
  The resulting TCR, called RD1-MART1, was   further affinity-matured to yield the RD1-  MART1HIGH TCR, with a KD value of about   100 nM. Recently, we generated a sequence   fitness landscape of RD1-MART1HIGH by deep   sequencing analysis of antigen-selected,   single-codon libraries (25).
For the sequence   fitness landscape and the work conducted in   the present study, RD1-MART1HIGH and   various mutants were displayed on the   surface of yeast as single-chain TCRs   containing the V and V domains linked by   a flexible linker (Fig. 1A).
Hemagglutinin (HA)   and c-myc tags were attached at the Nterminus and C-terminus, respectively.
  In order to understand the most   expeditious strategy to generate higher   affinity binding leads from a protein, here we   explored three approaches.
The first two   were based on the substitutions from the   single-codon libraries that yielded increases   in the number of antigen-selected TCR,   characterized as enrichment values (Fig. 1B).
  In the third, the results of these experimental   approaches were compared to an in silico   computational approach using the structure of   the RD1-MART1HIGH:MART1/HLA-A2   complex to predict the structural   consequences and the energetic impacts of   every individual substitution in the CDRs.
  The individual enrichment values for   the top substitutions of the RD1-MART1HIGH  TCR are plotted in Fig. 1C.
To explore the   robustness of these results from the   sequence fitness landscape, we tested eight   individual mutants (arrows in Fig. 1C) within   this range of enrichment values, from 10- to   51-fold (T91Q, A99Y, V50D,   G28E, S51G, Y50W, N28G, K97Q).
  The top binders among this group were then  tested in combination to determine if there   was binding additivity (Fig. 1B, left).
  It is possible that the individual   mutation approach, followed by combination   of improved mutations, will not identify those   collections of mutations that act additively or   cooperatively to yield the highest affinity   TCRs.
Furthermore, positions where there   were multiple enriched substitutions (e.g.   positions 91 and 99) would not be fully   sampled by analyzing only eight of the  individual mutations.
Accordingly, we took an   alternative approach in which a combinatorial   library at four residues with the highest   enrichment values was generated.
This   combinatorial library was sorted with   MART1/HLA-A2 by fluorescence activated   cell sorting (FACS) (Fig. 1B, right) to yield   clones that bound with higher affinity.
  Site-specific mutants act individually   and in combination to enhance affinity and   expression - Based on the sequence fitness   landscape of RD1-MART1HIGH, 8.3% of the   mutations showed enrichment above the wild-   by guest on September 30, 2016 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Engineering protein-protein interactions  4!
  type TCR (25).
As indicated, eight mutations   with enrichment values ranging from 10- to   51-fold (Fig. 1C, arrows) were expressed   individually on the surface of yeast and tested   for binding to the MART1/HLA-A2 ligand.
  Interestingly, the four residues with the   highest enrichment values were each in   different CDR loops (Fig. 2A), raising the   possibility that the combined mutations could   yield additive effects.
Mutants on yeast were   stained with various concentrations of   MART1/HLA-A2 monomer to determine   affinities (Fig. 3A and Table 1).
Previous   studies with TCR domains or scFv fragments   have shown that KD values determined by   such flow cytometry-based titrations are   similar to KD values determined for the   soluble proteins by surface plasmon   resonance, at least in the nanomolar KD  range (e.g. (18,28,29)).
  In some cases we also stained yeast   with an excess of MART1/HLA-A2 tetramer to   compare relative surface levels of the TCR   mutants (Table 1) because surface levels of  properly folded TCRs in the yeast display   system are known to be influenced by  stability of the proteins (18,30-36), and the   multimeric form would be able to assess total   surface levels even with lower affinity   mutants, due to avidity (37).
We also used   high levels of the multimeric ligand for this   purpose, rather than antibodies to the Cterminal c-myc tag, because the yeast quality   control machinery may allow expression of  full-length fusions even if mis-folded or   partially folded domains are present (38).
  This would allow us to address the possibility   that the enrichment of TCRs with mutations in   the single-codon libraries were due to  enhanced affinity or higher surface levels of   the folded protein, or both.
  Of the eight mutations, five showed   significant improvements in affinity compared   to the RD1-MART1HIGH TCR (Fig. 3A and   Table 1).
The five mutants exhibited 3-fold   (Y50W) to 11-fold (A99Y) increases in   affinity above the wild-type protein.
While the   other three mutants did not exhibit affinity   increases, they did appear to be expressed at   higher surface levels which likely accounts for   the enhancement values observed in the   deep mutational scan.
  To test whether the mutations could   be combined to yield further improvements,   four double mutants and a triple mutant were   generated (Figs. 3 and 4, Table 1).
The   double mutants yielded increases of 10- to   20-fold, while the triple mutant yielded an   increase of almost 100-fold, to an estimated   KD value of 2 nM. Furthermore, combination   of these mutations also led to increased TCR   surface levels (Table 1), indicating that the   mutations also may operate by stabilizing the   TCR domains.
A plot of affinities (KD values)  versus enrichment value (Fig. 4C) supports   the view that the highest enhancement   values in a deep mutational scan can be   used to reliably generate higher affinity   variants of a protein.
Indeed, when the eight   mutants were viewed as changes in binding   free energy relative to wild-type RD1-  MART1HIGH, there is a linear relationship   between enrichment and G, with a   correlation coefficient (R) of -0.82 (Fig. 4C,   inset).
This relationship is also apparent   based on the finding that the three top   mutations could be combined to yield an   additive effect of 100-fold higher affinity.
  Selection of a combinatorial library   yields further improvements and correlates   with the sequence fitness landscape - To   compare with individual site-specific  mutagenesis, we generated a combinatorial   library at the four residues (28, 91, 50,   99) with the most highly enriched mutations   in the deep mutational scan (Figs. 1C and   2A).
Selection of this library could yield   improved combinations that were not   identified in the one-by-one mutational   approach.
The combinatorial library was   sorted three times with MART1/HLA-A2   monomer at concentrations ranging from 1   M to 1 nM, and the top 1% fluorescent   population was collected (Fig. 5A).
After the   third sort, eight clones were sequenced and   there were three unique sequences identified   (represented by clones S3-2, S3-7, and S3-8)  (Table 2).
Titrations of these three clones   were performed and compared to the triple   mutant described above (Fig. 5B,C).
Mutants   S3-7 and S3-8 were similar in affinity to the    by guest on September 30, 2016 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Engineering protein-protein interactions  5!
  triple mutant, but clone S3-2 consistently   appeared to have a slightly higher affinity and   a higher surface level (Table 1).
Based on   this result, the combinatorial library/selection   approach can yield modest but significant   improvements above the single mutation   approach (e.g. when there are positions   where multiple substitutions yield high   enrichment values).
  The sequences of the mutants were   interesting when considered in regards to the   sequence fitness landscape, and the triple   mutant.
For example, the T91Q mutation  had one of the highest affinities and   expression levels among individual mutants   (Table 1), and this mutation was present in all   three clones from the combinatorial library.
  Position 50 had either an aspartic or   glutamic acid in all three clones isolated,   consistent with the nearly four-fold   improvement of V50D (Table 1) and the   deep mutational scan results (Fig. 1C).
While   all three clones identified in the combinatorial   library did not contain the A99Y mutation  that showed the highest affinity individually   (Table 1), each had a different highly  enriched mutation (A99D, A99E, A99V)   (Fig. 1C).
Interestingly, in clones S3-2 and   S3-8, the G28 position was mutated to   arginine despite this residue having a strong   preference for glutamic acid in the deep   mutational scan (Fig. 1C) and the   improvement in affinity of the G28E mutant.
  In fact, the G28R mutation was not enriched   compared to wild-type in the deep mutational   scan, suggesting that this mutation may have   operated only in the context of one or more of   the other three CDR mutations.
  In conclusion, the combinatorial   approach yielded the greatest improvement   as shown by the S3-2 mutant which exhibited  a KD value of 0.7 nM, an increase in affinity of  about 250-fold compared to RD1-MARTHIGH.
  The improvement in affinity of the S3-2   mutant was also validated by a separate   approach using soluble single-chain TCRs   refolded from E. coli inclusion bodies.
  Previous surface plasmon resonance (SPR)  measurements of soluble RD1-MARTHIGH  TCR yielded a KD value of 250 nM (21).
Here   we examined soluble S3-2 TCR by SPR,   which yielded a KD value of 2.2 nM (Fig. 5D).
  Evaluation of the sequence fitness   landscape and individual mutations via an in   silico approach - We next evaluated the same   residues from the sequence fitness   landscape computationally, examining all 20   amino acids at the 39 CDR loop positions   explored in the RD1-MART1HIGH TCR.
We   used our previously described in silico  structure-guided design approach and   scoring function developed and trained using   TCR-pMHC binding data (24,39) (Note:   values less than 1 considered candidates for   improved affinity).
There was a general,   qualitative agreement between prediction and   experiment, as the majority (92%) of the   mutations predicted to weaken affinity were   also selected against (Fig. 6A).
However,   25% of the negatively enriched mutations   were also predicted to improve binding.
  The majority (78%) of the negatively   enriched mutations predicted to improve   binding were mutations that reduced polarity,  with 62% involving introduction of a   hydrophobic amino acid.
This suggests that   some of the discrepancy between   computational prediction and sequence   enrichment can be attributed to changes in   protein stability.
As noted above this is a wellcharacterized selection parameter in yeast   display (18,30-36), but is not an output of a   computational design approach focused   solely on improving affinity.
A good example   is found in the mutation of A99.
Mutation of   A99 to Tyr improved affinity as shown in   Table 1.
Mutation of A99 to Trp was   predicted to have an even more substantial   impact on affinity as the modeling indicated   the Trp side chain would pack more tightly   against the peptide.
However, substitution of   A99 with Trp is predicted to result in the   added exposure of ~50 2 of hydrophobic   surface area when the TCR is displayed on   the yeast surface (compared to substitution   with Tyr).
Using well-recognized estimates of   20-30 kcal/mol in free energy per 2 of   exposed hydrophobic surface area (40,41),   the resultant destabilization could be as high   as ~1.5 kcal/mol.
   by guest on September 30, 2016 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Engineering protein-protein interactions  6!  A wider comparison of enrichment vs.   predicted changes in hydrophobic solvent   accessible surface further suggested that   sequence enrichment in the fitness   landscapes was at least in part associated   with reduced exposed hydrophobic surface   area, and vice versa (Fig. 6B).
Of the   residues with log2 enrichment ratios 1, 68%   are predicted to have reduced solvent   exposed hydrophobic surface.
In contrast, for   those residues with enrichment ratios 1,   66% are predicted to have increases in   exposed hydrophobic surface.
  We attempted to compute changes in   protein stability and incorporate them into   binding predictions as performed previously  (14).
We used multiple approaches to   compute stability changes, including   quantifying energetic costs of changes in   hydrophobic surface exposure and computing   stability using both our TCR-specific as well   as more general scoring procedures.
These  approaches however did not provide   additional insight beyond that obtained from   qualitatively assessing hydrophobicity as   noted above and in Fig. 6C.
This result may   be related to recognized difficulties in   computing protein stability (42),! especially! in!  loop!structures, as well as an intrinsically low   stability of the single-chain RD1-MART1HIGH  protein coupled with kinetic, rather than   thermodynamic, stability effects that may lead   to low yeast surface expression levels (43).
  To test if reduced yeast surface levels   of the properly folded mutants were in part   responsible for lower enhancement values,   we examined four individual mutants.
These   mutants were predicted to have higher  affinities, yet they were observed to have   negative enrichment values (Fig. 5A, green).
  The four mutants (A99W, S94M, G28W,   G28F) were compared to the wild-type RDMART1HIGH TCR for binding to MART1/HLAA2 monomers (Fig. 7A for mutants, and Fig.   3A for wild type) and tetramers (Table 1)  using flow cytometry.
Consistent with the   notion that negative enrichment values could   be due to lower surface levels of the properly   folded proteins, all four mutants, and   especially the S94M, G28W, and G28F  mutants, were expressed at significantly   lower surface levels than wild-type RDMART1HIGH TCR.
Although the A99W  mutant appeared to have a similar affinity to   the wild-type RD-MART1HIGH TCR, based on   the monomer titrations (Fig. 7B), it was not   possible to estimate affinities for the other   three mutants due to their low surface levels.
  Computational analysis of mutations   that yielded higher affinities - If we restrict the   focus solely to mutations with binding   measurements, after computing binding G  relative to RD-MART1HIGH using the values in   Table 1, moderate agreement between   computation and experiment is observed,   with a correlation coefficient of 0.68 (Fig. 8A).
  This analysis however includes the N28G  and K97Q mutations.
Neither of these   positions interacts directly with pepMHC   either in the wild type complex or in the   models of the mutants through either short- or   long-range interactions (the closest predicted   approaches for the N28G and K97Q  mutants are 16 and 11 , respectively).
  Excluding these mutants from the comparison   substantially improved the correlation   between prediction and experiment (R =   0.91).
Prediction scores of the double and   triple mutants also corroborated well with   experiment, with a correlation coefficient of   0.87 when these were included in the   comparison (Fig. 8B).
  The accurate recapitulation of the   relative binding energies of the RD1-  MART1HIGH mutants in Table 1 suggested the   structural models would be of use in   rationalizing how the mutations acted to   impact binding.
The V50D mutation, which   improved binding nearly 4-fold, may function   by introducing an electrostatic interaction with   the side chain of R65 of HLA-A2 (Fig. 2B).
  The T91Q mutation occurs in the V/V  interface, and may stabilize the CDR3 loop  through an intra-loop hydrogen bond and   electrostatic interactions within the   neighboring CDR3 loop (Fig. 2C).
A99Y is   the most favored mutation, and is predicted to   improve packing with the peptide and the   HLA-A2 1 helix (Fig. 2D).
The new   interactions for A99Y are largely non-   by guest on September 30, 2016 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Engineering protein-protein interactions  7!  directional contacts, perhaps accounting for   why multiple substitutions here are both   highly enriched and favorably predicted.
  G28E is predicted to form new van der   Waals and electrostatic interactions with   Trp167 of HLA-A2 (Fig. 2E).
  It is notable that, with the exception of   A99Y, the distance of these positions from   the interface would tend to place them as a   lower priority for investigation in typical   structure-guided design studies, with the   V50D mutation serving as the best example.
  This highlights the strength of deep   sequencing and yeast surface display in   identifying important affinity-enhancing   second shell mutations, which for TCRs   could be important in preserving or even   improving antigen specificity (25).
  DISCUSSION  Proteins often require affinity and   stability enhancements for therapeutic   purposes.
To achieve the desired   characteristics, various protein-engineering   techniques that use in vitro directed evolution   have been employed.
These include  ribosomal, phage, bacterial, yeast, and   mammalian display of degenerate mutational  libraries, followed by various selection   schemes.
More recently, it has been possible   to conduct deep mutational scans of every   residue in a proteins binding site to construct   a sequence fitness landscape.
Here we used   information from the sequence fitness   landscape of a TCR (RD1-MART1HIGH)   specific for the cancer antigen MART1/HLAA2 as a guide to compare various   approaches to engineer improvements in the   affinity and/or stability.
We were able to   identify specific mutants that enhanced the   affinity over 200-fold and increased the yeast  surface level expression by 6-fold.
  Furthermore, we compared these site-specific   mutants to structure-based predictions using   an in silico approach that modeled the effects   of the mutations and predicted the impacts on   binding.
  To determine the robustness of   identifying higher affinity mutations strictly   from the results of the sequence fitness   landscape, we generated single site-specific   mutations with enrichment values ranging   from 10- to 51-fold.
These mutations were   tested as individual and combined mutants.
  Site-specific mutagenesis was able to  increase the TCR affinity by 100-fold when   three of the highest-affinity mutants were   combined.
A previous study that aimed to   improve the affinity of an influenza inhibitor,   reported a maximum affinity improvement of   28-fold using a combination of eight   mutations identified from a sequence fitness   landscape (14).
In our study, when  enrichment values were >12 we observed a   direct correlation with enrichment value and   affinity enhancement.
In addition to affinity  increases, the yeast display approach also   selects for TCRs that are expressed at higher   levels due to the increased stability of the   mutant (18,30-32).
Accordingly, the present   study identified mutations that increased   surface levels up to about 6-fold.
Similar   observations have been made about the role   of residues in the thermal stability of antibody   scFv fragments (32,44,45).
  While the individual mutations with the   highest enhancement values in the sequence   fitness landscape yielded higher affinity, and   their combinations provided even higher   affinity (100-fold), we were interested in   determining if a directed evolution approach   based on the same data could yield   combined mutations with even higher affinity   or stability.
This combinatorial approach   would include variants with multiple mutations   that have additivity or positive cooperativity in   binding.
To test this, we generated a   combinatorial library at the four highest   enriched residues (G28, T91, V50,   A99).
Three successive selections of this  library yielded multiple clones that bound with   higher affinity than RD1-MART1HIGH to the   MART1/HLA-A2 ligand.
One of these clones   (S3-2) had the highest affinity (700 pM) and   greatest surface level (6-fold above RD1-  MART1HIGH) among all of the mutants   examined in the present study.
The   sequences of this and the other two unique   clones revealed that three of the four  positions in the library had mutations that   were highly enriched in the sequence fitness   landscape.
Unexpectedly, the G28 position    by guest on September 30, 2016 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Engineering protein-protein interactions  8!
  had two clones, including S3-2, with an  arginine substitution, whereas the G28R  substitution was not enriched in the sequence   fitness landscape.
As G28R is predicted to   interact strongly with Glu1 of the peptide as   well as Glu58 of HLA-A2, this mutation alone   may destabilize the TCR, a consequence   offset by the other mutations.
Accordingly, the  use of sequence fitness landscapes to   generate higher affinity mutants can benefit   by subsequent selections of combinatorial   libraries in the codons of enriched amino acid   positions.
  Our recently described structureguided computational design approach for   engineering TCRs (24,39) provided an   opportunity to evaluate the sequence fitness   landscapes computationally and compare   enrichment with predicted impacts on binding.
  While there was qualitative agreement   between those mutations predicted to   weaken binding and sequence depletion, the   in silico approach did not distinguish well   between mutations predicted to improve   binding and sequence enrichment, as 25% of   mutations selected against were predicted to   enhance binding.
Much of this may reflect the   sensitivity of yeast surface display to changes   in protein stability, resulting in some   substitutions that are either reduced or   enhanced in surface levels.
This is supported   by our analysis of the modeled structures of   each mutant for changes in exposed   hydrophobic surface area: sequences   enriched showed a much stronger trend to   reduce hydrophobic solvent accessible   surface area, and vice versa.
There can be a   tendency for structure-guided design to select   for hydrophobic mutations (12)(and   manuscript submitted) and our findings  reiterate that improvements in in silico  approaches may be found from continued   attention to electrostatic features such as   polar solvation, hydrogen bonding, and   interactions with formal charges (16,46-49).
  For those mutants studied directly, our   in silico analysis showed very good   agreement between predicted and impacted   effects on binding, permitting the use of the   structural models in helping to assess how   the mutations acted to improve binding.
A key   observation was that multiple second shell   mutations appeared to be enriched and these   most likely act via indirect or long range   effects (exemplified by the V50D mutation).
  Such sites are not always considered in   structure-guided computational design,   highlighting a strength of sequence fitness   landscapes and yeast surface display, as well   as further suggesting how in silico methods   might be extended.
  The single-codon approach used with   sequence fitness landscapes also improves   upon the many early studies using directed   evolution and error-prone PCR techniques.
  While the latter can sample the entire protein   interface, it is limited to single-site mutations   that are generated by a single base   substitution.
This is because the probability of   having two substitutions in the same codon or   in two codons with beneficial substitutions is   quite low and often beyond the size of the   libraries (or detrimental mutations at a higher   error-rate would obscure these mutations).
  As an example, the A99Y mutant was one   of the highest enriched mutations of RD1-  MART1HIGH but it would require two   nucleotide substitutions to mutate from   alanine to tyrosine.
  Finally, it is worth considering whether   information about binding affinities of mutants   gained in the yeast display system could be   extrapolated to these TCRs expressed in   their normal context, T cells.
The TCRs are in   single-chain form (V-linker-V) as Aga2-  fusions for yeast display, whereas in T cells   the V and V each contain transmembrane   spanning constant regions.
Despite these   differences, we have invariably observed with   other TCRs that the mutations yielding higher   affinity in the yeast display system also   yielded higher affinity when used as fulllength TCRs transferred into T cells   (18,37,50,51).
Thus, although not formally   tested, we have reason to believe that the   mutations of RD1-MARTHIGH TCRs identified   in the present work would exhibit binding with   enhanced affinities when transferred to the   full-length TCR context.
  In conclusion, deep mutational scans   of the entire protein-protein interface provide    by guest on September 30, 2016 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Engineering protein-protein interactions  9!  physical insights into binding, and they will   allow improvements in structure-guided in   silico analyses.
Sequence fitness landscapes   also serve as a robust guide for conducting   site-specific mutagenesis to enhance affinity.
  In the future one might be able to simply   combine all of the top enriched mutations into   a single mutant and thus bypass the need for   any selections.
This might be especially true   where the residues are located at different   locations in the interface.
However, the   combinatorial library/selection approach,   based on the results of the sequence fitness   landscape, yielded an improved mutant  compared to the single-site mutant strategy.
  Thus, there may still be advantages to using   a directed evolution, selection-based strategy   for optimizing improvements.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Reagents and Flow cytometry -   Procedure for induction of yeast to express   single-chain TCRs has been described   previously (21).
HLA-A2 heavy chain and 2  microglobulin were expressed as inclusion   bodies in Escherichia coli and refolded with a   UV-cleavable peptide (KILGFVFJV) (52).
At   the C-terminus of HLA-A2 heavy chain a   biotinylation site was included for addition of   biotin with BirA enzyme (Avidity).
To   exchange peptide, refolded HLA-A2 with UVcleavable peptide was incubated with 100-  fold excess MART1 10mer peptide   (ELAGIGILTV) during 45 min of UVexposure.
  Yeast stained with HLA-A2 monomer   were incubated with various concentrations of   MART1/HLA-A2 monomers (at the lowest   concentration, a minimum of 2-fold excess   monomer relative to total number of TCRs,   estimated to be 50,000 receptors/cell, was   used).
Cells were washed and stained with   streptavidin-PE (1:300) and subsequently   analyzed by flow cytometry.
To determine   binding affinities, the mean fluorescence   intensity (MFI) of secondary reagent control   was subtracted from the MFI of the yeast   cells stained with monomer.
Binding   constants were calculated using non-linear   regression of the binding curve (one site   specific binding in Graphpad).
Maximum MFI   values were either the MFI achieved at the  highest concentration of monomer (for   titrations that had a plateau) or in cases   where saturation was not reached, (e.g.  N28G and K97Q mutants), maximum MFI   values were estimated from the ratio of   tetramer binding to a TCR run at the same   time which did exhibit a plateau.
Titrations   were performed a minimum of two times, in   completely separate experiments.
  Yeast were additionally stained with   anti-HA (1:50) and anti-c-myc (1:100)   followed by secondary goat anti-mouse Alexa   Fluor 647 (1:100) and goat anti-chicken Alexa   Fluor 647 (1:100) respectively.
For tetramer   stains, yeast were stained with 50 nM   MART1/HLA-A2 tetramer for 1.5 h, washed   and analyzed by flow cytometry.
  Single-Site Mutants and   Combinatorial Library Design - Single-site   mutants of the RD1-MART1HIGH TCR in the   pCT302 yeast-display vector were created   using the QuikChange II Site-Directed   Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies).
  Identity of mutants was confirmed by   sequencing.
EBY100 yeast were   subsequently transformed using a lithium   acetate heat shock protocol (53).
A 4-codon   combinatorial library of RD1-MART1HIGH  spanning 4 CDR domains was created by   splice overlap extension (SOE) PCR.
PreSOE products were created using the   following primers: Splice4/L: 5'- GGC AGC   CCC ATA AAC ACA CAG TAT -3'; T7 rev: 5'-   TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG -3'; V50bfwd: 5'-TGG GCT TAA GAT TGA TTC ACT   ATT CAN NKG GTG TTG GCA TCA CTG   ATC A-3'; V50b-rev: 5'-TGA ATA GTG AAT   CAA TCT TAA GCC CA-3'; A99b-fwd: 5'-TCC   CGT CCG GGT TGG ATG NNK GGG GGG   GTG GAA CTG T-3'; A99b-rev: 5'-CAT CCA   ACC CGG ACG GGA-3'; G28a-fwd: 5'-GCG   TCT TTA AAC TGT ACA TAT TCA GAT AGA   NNK AGC ACG TCT TTC TTT TGG TAT C3'; G28a-rev: 5'-TCT ATC TGA ATA TGT   ACA GTT TAA AGA CGC-3'; T91a-fwd: 5'-  CAC ATA CTT GTG CGC GGT TNN KAA   GTA CTC GTG GGG TAA ACT G-3'; T91arev: 5'-AAC CGC GCA CAA GTA TGT G-3'.
  Pre-SOE products were combined by SOE   PCR using the T7 and Splice 4L primers.
   by guest on September 30, 2016 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Engineering protein-protein interactions  10  Libraries were created using homologous   recombination in EBY100 yeast as described   previously (54).
The theoretical diversity of   the four-codon library is 324  , or 1 x 106  .
  Based on the number of independent   transformants, the estimated size of the   combinatorial library was 2 x 107  , which   should provide coverage of all amino acid   combinations of the library.
The library was   sorted three times with MART1/HLA-A2   monomer at 50nM, 0.5nM, 0.1nM   respectively, collecting the top 1% of   fluorescent cells at each sort.
After the third   sort, eight high-affinity clones were   sequenced of which three unique sequences   were identified.
  Characterization of binding by surface   plasmon resonance  Recombinant single   chain S3-2 TCR and MART1/HLA-A2 were   generated from bacterially expressed   inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified as   described (25).
Binding analysis was   performed at 25 C using surface plasmon   resonance on a Biacore T200 instrument.
150   RU of S3-2 TCR was coupled to a CM5   sensor surface using standard amine   coupling.
MART1/HLA-A2 analyte was   injected in a series of concentrations at a flow   rate of 45 l/min.
Data were corrected for   injections over a blank surface, and the   responses vs. time fit globally to a 1:1 kinetic   binding model using Biacore T200 evaluation   software 3.0.
  Computational prediction of mutations  - Structural modeling and energetic scoring   followed closely the procedures described in  Riley et al (24).
For modeling, Rosetta with   the Talaris2013 score function was used (55-  57), using the PyRosetta interface (58).
The   crystallographically-absent linker region of the   RD1-MART1HIGH structure was constructed   and modeled using kinematic loop closure  (59).
Following linker modeling, the entire   structure was relaxed through multiple cycles   of backbone minimization and rotamer   optimization (60).
For comparison with the   experimental sequence landscapes, 19   amino acids were introduced separately into   each position, and the mutants plus the wildtype structures (760 in total) modeled from   three, independent, Monte Carlo-based   simulated annealing trajectories.
Modeling   utilized Rosettas Loop_Mover_Refine_CCD   mover with 3 outer cycles and 10 inner   cycles, with an initial metropolis acceptance   criterion of 2.2 that decreased linearly to 0.6  (61).
For double and triple mutants, mutations   were introduced simultaneously, followed by   a minimum of six independent minimization   trajectories to account for additional structural   impacts.
For all models, the large number of   packing operations introduced some minor   variability when scoring.
Therefore, the   unweighted score terms for the three   trajectories were averaged and stored for   calculations (62).
  Each model was scored in the   Rosetta interface with the TR3 score function   trained on TCR-specific data (manuscript   submitted).
TR3 utilizes dynamic information   from the wild-type structure as positional   modifiers to account for protein flexibility.
  Accordingly, molecular dynamics simulations   were calculated using the AMBER molecular   dynamics suite (63).
Starting coordinates for   the complex used the relaxed structure   described above, and the coordinates for the  free TCR were generated by stripping away   the pepMHC.
After adding solvent and   counter-ions, systems were energy minimized   and heated to 300K with solute restraints.
  Solute restraints were gradually relaxed and   followed with 2 ns of simulation with no solute   restraints for equilibration, after which 100 ns   production trajectories were calculated.
  Trajectory analysis for determining root mean   square fluctuations (RMSF) values used   ccptraj from the AMBER suite.
The RMSF   values were used along with the additional   terms of the TR3 function to score each of the   760 modeled structures.
The scores of the   114 wild-type control structures determined   the baseline score of 0.92 energy units,   where lower scores indicated stronger affinity   and higher scores weaker affinity.
For double   and triple mutants, RMSF descriptors were   averaged between the positions for scoring   purposes (i.e., for double mutant XY, the   RMSF of position X is averaged with the   position Y RMSF to give an RMSF descriptor   for double XY).
Solvent accessible surface   areas were calculated using a 1.4  probe.
   by guest on September 30, 2016 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Engineering protein-protein interactions  11  Calculations of protein stability   included using structural models to calculate   changes in exposed hydrophobic surface   area and computing changes in stability using   both the Talaris2013 and TR3 score   functions.
Computing binding probabilities as   in Whitehead et al. (14) or by accounting for   percent bound ligand using both folding and   binding partition functions together did not   yield more quantitative insight than simply   considering changes in exposed hydrophobic   surface area.

Structure of RD1-MART1HIGH TCR:MART1/HLA-A2 complex and models for   affinity-enhancing mutations.
(A) View of the the TCR:MART1/HLA-A2 complex with the four   CDR residues with the highest enrichments values are highlighted in yellow. (B) Close up view   of V50 (left) and the modeled D50 structure (right).
D50 is predicted to introduce a long   range electrostatic interaction with R65 of the HLA-A2 1 helix.
(C) Close up view of T91 (left)   and the modeled Q91 structure (right).
Q91 is predicted to form an electrostatic interaction   with R94 of the neighboring CDR3 loop as well as form an intraloop hydrogen bond with the   backbone of Y93.
Both could stabilize the loop in a binding-competent conformation.
(D) Close   up view of A99 (left) and the modeled Y99 structure (right).
Y99 is predicted to pack against   T9 of the peptide and V76 of the HLA-A2  helix.
(E) Close up view of G28 (left) and the   modeled E28 structure (right). E28 is predicted to interact with W167 of the HLA-A2 2 helix.

Flow cytometry staining histograms of RD1-MART1HIGH mutants identified from   sequence fitness landscape.
(A) The RD1-MART1HIGH TCR, four single mutants (G28E,   T91Q, V50D, A99Y), and one triple mutant (G28E/T91Q/A99Y) were stained with   various concentrations of MART1/HLA-A2 monomer at concentrations ranging from 1 M to 8   nM (1 M black, 500 nM blue, 125 nM green, 31 nM purple, 15 nM teal, 8 nM gray).
(B) Double   mutants of RD1-MART1HIGH (G28E/T91Q, G28E/V50D, G28E/A99Y, and   T91Q/A99Y) were stained with various concentrations of MART1/HLA-A2 monomer from 250   nM to .2 nM (250 nM black, 125 nM blue, 62.5 nM purple, 31.25 nM green, 15.125 nM yellow,   7.56 nM maroon, 3.8 nM teal, 1.9 nM silver, 950 pM navy, 470 nM lime, 235 pM black, 120 pM   red).
  FIGURE 4.
Titrations of mutants of RD1-MART1HIGH identified from the sequence fitness   landscape.
(A)(B) Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the indicated mutants were plotted   against concentration of MART1/HLA-A2 monomer.
(C) The enrichment values of RD1-  MART1HIGH and the indicated mutants were plotted against the calculated binding disassociation   constant (affinity, in nanomolar) from titrations with yeast and MART1/HLA-A2 monomer.
Error   bars are indicative of the range of maximum and minimum values from multiple titrations (RD1-  MART1HIGH; n=5, T91Q, Y50W; n=3, N28G, S51G, K97Q, G28E, V50D, A99Y; n=2).
  Binding constants were calculated using non-linear regression of the binding curve (one site   specific binding in Graphpad) based on the highest concentrations of pepMHC as an estimate   for maximum MFI.
For the N28G and K97Q mutants, a maximum MFI could not be   determined strictly from pepMHC monomer staining, therefore maximum MFI was estimated  based on the ratio of tetramer binding to A99Y, for which a maximum MFI was reached with  monomer.
Inset: a plot of the G values calculated for each mutant relative to the wild type   RD1-MART1HIGH interaction, versus enrichment value.
Dashed line shows a linear regression to   the data.
The correlation coefficient (R) is -0.82.

Titrations of RD1-MART1HIGH high-affinity clones isolated from a combinatorial   library.
(A) The combinatorial library of RD1-MART1HIGH and the subsequent sorted libraries   were stained with MART1/HLA-A2 monomer at concentrations ranging from 167 nM to 25 pM   (167 nM blue, 19 nM green, 6 nM yellow, 2 nM red, 700 pM teal, 200 pM gray, 100 pM navy, 25   pM lime).
(B) The G28E/T91Q/A99Y mutant identified from the sequence fitness landscape   and the three clones isolated from a combinatorial library were titrated with MART1/HLA-A2   monomer at concentrations ranging from 167 nM to 25 pM. (C) The mean fluorescence intensity   (MFI) of the indicated mutants was plotted against concentration of MART1/HLA-A2 monomer.
  (D) Surface plasmon resonance kinetic analysis of the interaction between the S3-2 variant and   MART1/HLA-A2.
Red lines show response vs. time; black lines are from a global 1:1 fit to the   data.
Injected concentrations ranged from 0.3 nM to 8 nM. kon was determined as 9.3x105   M-1 s-1   and koff as 2.0x10-3 s-1, yielding a KD of 2.2 nM.   FIGURE 6.
In silico modeling of the RD1-MART1HIGH deep mutational scan.
(A) Predicted   binding scores for each mutation in the deep mutational scan vs. experimental enrichment score   (see ref. (25) for definition of enrichment scores).
The horizontal dashed line indicates a binding   score of 0.92, above which binding is predicted to be weaker compared to wild type, and below   which binding is predicted to be stronger.
The majority of the negatively enriched mutants are   predicted to bind weaker, but there are many mutants predicted to bind stronger that are also   negatively enriched.
The four highest enriched mutants are indicated in red and noted on the   plot.
Four mutants that were examined further in Fig. 7 are highlighted in green.
(B) Of the   amino acids with enrichment ratios 1, 68% are predicted to have reduced solvent exposed   hydrophobic surface.
In contrast, for those residues with enrichment ratios 1, 66% are   predicted to have increases in exposed hydrophobic surface.
(C) Prediction score vs.   enrichment score with each data point colored by the predicted change in hydrophobic solvent   accessible surface area.

(A) Single mutants of RD1-MART1HIGH (A99W, S94M, G28F,   and G28W) were stained with various concentrations of MART1/HLA-A2 monomer from 1 mM   to 4 nM (1 mM black, 500 nM blue, 250 nM purple, 125 nM green, 32 nM maroon, 4 nM navy).
  (B) Mean fluorescence units (MFI) of RD1-MART1HIGH single mutants were plotted against   concentration of MART1/HLA-A2 monomer.
  FIGURE 8.
