M007350200  Yen-Yee Tang, Jianxia Shii, Lina Zhang, Amy Davis, Jeronimo Bravo**, Alan J. Warren**,  Nancy A. Speck , and John H. Bushwelleri  From the Department of Biochemistry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, the iDepartment of  Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22906-0011, and the  **3MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, United Kingdom  Core-binding factors (CBFs) are a small family of heterodimeric transcription factors that play critical roles  in several developmental pathways, including hematopoiesis and bone development.
Mutations in CBF genes  are found in leukemias and bone disorders.
CBFs consist of a DNA-binding CBFa subunit (Runx1, Runx2, or  Runx3) and a non-DNA-binding CBFb subunit.
CBFa  binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner, whereas  CBFb enhances DNA binding by CBFa.
Recent structural analyses of the DNA-binding Runt domain of CBFa  and the CBFb subunit identified the heterodimerization  surfaces on each subunit.
Here we identify amino acids  in CBFb that mediate binding to CBFa.
We determine  the energy contributed by each of these amino acids to  heterodimerization and the importance of these residues for in vivo function.
These data refine the structural analyses and further support the hypothesis that  CBFb enhances DNA binding by inducing a conformational change in the Runt domain.
  Core-binding factors (CBFs)1 are a small family of heterodimeric transcription factors that play critical roles in normal development and disease.
CBFs consist of two subunits,  CBFa and CBFb.
The CBFa subunit binds DNA in a sequencespecific manner (1, 2).
CBFb heterodimerizes with CBFa and  increases its affinity for DNA (3, 4).
The mechanism by which  CBFb enhances DNA binding by CBFa is unusual in that  CBFb does not establish contacts to additional phosphates or  bases in the DNA (1, 4).
It has been proposed that CBFb  stabilizes a conformation of CBFa favorable for DNA binding  (57).
  CBFa subunits are encoded by three related genes, RUNX1,  RUNX2, and RUNX3 (formerly CBFA13, AML13, or  Pebpa2a-c) (2, 8, 9).
A single gene, CBFB, encodes the CBFb  subunit subunit (3, 4).
The RUNX2 gene is required for bone  formation and is implicated in a human genetic disorder, cleidocranial dysplasia, a disease characterized by moderate skeletal malformations (1012).
The in vivo function of RUNX3 is  unknown.
RUNX1 (AML1) and CBFB are required for hematopoiesis and are the most frequent targets of mutations in  human leukemias (1317).
RUNX1 is disrupted by the t(8;  21)(q22;q22) in 15% of de novo acute myeloid leukemias (M2  subtype), the t(12;21)(p13;q22) in 30% of pediatric de novo  acute lymphocytic leukemias, and by the t(1;21)(p36;q22), t(3;  21)(q26;q22), t(5;21)(q13;q22), t(12;21)(q24;q22), t(14;21)(q22;  q22), t(15;21)(q22;q22), t(16;21)(q24;q22), and t(17;21)(q11.2;  q22) in therapy-related leukemias and myelodysplasia (8, 18  23).
Haploinsufficiency of RUNX1 is responsible for a rare  familial platelet disorder with propensity for acute myelogenous  leukemia (FPD/AML) (24).
Biallelic point mutations in the  RUNX1 gene are found in AML of the M0 subtype (25).
The  CBFB gene is disrupted in approximately 15% of acute myeloid  leukemias by inv(16)(p13;q22), t(16;16), and del(16)(q22) (26, 27).
  Together, disruptions of the RUNX2 and CBFB genes account for  approximately 25% of all de novo acute leukemias, making them  the most frequently disrupted genes in human leukemias (17).
  DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFb is mediated  by the Runt domain in CBFa (2, 28, 29).
The three-dimensional structures of the Runx1 Runt domain and the CBFb  heterodimerization domain were recently solved by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography (5, 7, 3033).
The Runt  domain is an s-type immunoglobulin fold similar to that of the  DNA-binding domains of NFAT, STAT, p53, and NF-kB. The  CBFb subunit is a novel structure consisting of five a-helices  and six b-strands arranged as a twisted six-stranded antiparallel b-sheet.
Chemical shift perturbation studies identified  sequences in both the Runt domain and CBFb at the heterodimerization interface (6, 3032).
The recent crystal structure of the Runx1 Runt domain-CBFb complex also delineated  an interaction surface on each protein (7).
However, the molecular details of the interaction have not yet been described.
  Here we analyze the interaction surface on CBFb, and identify amino acids that contribute energetically to heterodimerization.
We find that Asn-104, Gly-61, and to a lesser extent  Gln-67, Leu-103, Arg-3, and Val-4 in CBFb contribute to heterodimerization with the CBFa Runt domain.
Biochemical  analyses of mutated CBFb proteins find no evidence for direct  interaction of the CBFb proteins with DNA in the ternary  complex.
These data lend support to and further refine the  structures determined by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray  crystallography.

3957939588, 2000   2000 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Printed in U.S.A.  This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org 39579   at Georgian Court College on March 8, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Site-directed MutagenesisA XhoI restriction site was added to the  59-end of a BamHI-HindIII fragment encoding the open reading frame  of the wild-type murine CBFb heterodimerization domain (CBFb (141))  using the forward polymerase chain reaction primer 59-CCCGCTCGAGGGATCCATGCCGCGCGTCGT-39 and the reverse primer 59-GGCCCAAGCTTTCACTGTTGTGCTAATGCATCTTCC-39.
This fragment  was then subcloned into the pBluescript SK1 vector (Stratagene) between the XhoI and HindIII sites.
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on this plasmid using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis  kit following the manufacturers protocols.
  Yeast Two-hybrid AssaysThe yeast expression plasmids were  based on pGBT9 (GAL4 DNA-binding domain/TRP marker) and  pGAD10 (GAL4 activation domain/LEU2 marker).
The pGBT9:mAML1  (34) contains a subcloned segment of a Runx1 cDNA that encodes the  full-length, 451-amino acid isoform of the murine Runx1 protein (35).
  The CBFb mutant sequences, which contain amino acids 1141 of  CBFb, were made in the pBluescript SK1 vector and subcloned into the  yeast activation domain vector pGAD10 as BamHI-EcoRI fragments.
  The plasmids were then cotransformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y153 strain by the lithium acetate-TE protocol of Schiestl and  Gietz (36).
Y153 contains HIS3 and lacZ genes under the regulation of  Gal4 binding sites.
b-Galactosidase assays were performed following  the manufacturers protocols (CLONTECH).
  Purification of CBFb MutantsThe CBFb mutant proteins made in  the pBluescript SK1 vector were subcloned into the bacterial pGRX  expression vector as BamHI-HindIII fragments (37).
The individual 15N-labeled mutant proteins were then purified as described previously  (31, 37, 38).
  The DNA fragment containing the sequence encoding amino acids  41214 of the murine Runx1 protein, which encompasses the Runt  domain, was expressed in bacteria, and the protein was purified as  described previously (39).
  NMR SpectroscopyAll measurements were performed on a Varian  Inova 500-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with an actively shielded  triple-resonance probe from Nalorac Corp. and pulsed field gradients.
  15N-1  H heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra of the  mutant proteins were recorded using the gradient sensitivity-enhanced  HSQC sequence (40).
Measurements were carried out at 20 C with  solutions of the protein in 25 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.1 mM  EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide, and 5 mM DTT.
15N-1  H correlation spectra of 15N-labeled CBFb in a binary complex with the CBFa Runt domain  were recorded using a sensitivity-enhanced version of the transverse  relaxation-optimized spectroscopy experiment (41).
Measurements  were carried out at 40 C in a buffer of 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH  6.0), 0.1% sodium azide, and 5 mM DTT.
Due to the limited solubility  and stability of this complex, data were collected on a 0.35 mM sample  within 24 h of complex preparation.
  Equilibrium Binding Constant MeasurementsEquilibrium binding  constants of the wild-type and mutant CBFb proteins were determined  by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using conditions previously described (37, 39, 42).
DNA binding reactions contained g32Pend-labeled probe, 13 binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mM  2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, and 4% glycerol) supplemented with 0.2 mg of bovine serum albumin, 5 mM DTT, and 0.05%  Triton X-100, and protein samples in a final volume of 20 ml.
The core  site from the SL3-3 murine leukemia virus enhancer (59-GGATATCTGTGGTTAAGCA-39) was used in all equilibrium binding constant  measurements.
After incubation on ice for 1520 min, reactions (15 ml)  were loaded onto 1015% native polyacrylamide gels that had been  pre-run for at least 1.5 h in 0.5 3 TBE (45 mM Tris-HCl, 45 mM boric  acid, 1 mM EDTA) at 4 C at 280 V. Following electrophoresis, the gels  were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics).
Radioactivity was quantified using volume integration of individual bands on phosphor images (43).
  The DNA concentration was at least 10-fold lower than the estimated  Kd of CBFa or CBFa-b for the DNA site (K2 or K4, respectively),  ensuring that the total protein concentration, [Pt], was an accurate  estimate of free protein, [P].
The fraction of free DNA, [Df  ]/[Dt], was the  ratio of the free DNA signal analyzed at each protein concentration to  the DNA signal in a control lane containing no protein.
The fraction of  DNA in complex with protein was derived from the equation [PD]/[Dt]  5 1 2 [Df  ]/[Dt].
All points were fit to the rearranged mass action  equation [PD]/[Dt] 5 1/(1 1 Kd/[P]), using non-linear least squares  analyses (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software).
Protein titrations were  performed at concentrations in a range that resulted in approximately  0100% binding.
  To measure the affinities of CBFa-b heterodimers for DNA (K4)  CBFa was titrated onto a fixed amount of DNA (10213 M) in the presence  of CBFb at concentrations that were at least 10-fold above the estimated Kd of the CBFb proteins for CBFa in solution (K1).
The concentrations used were 2 mM for wild-type CBFb, 42 mM for CBFb(R3A), and  110 mM for CBFb(N104A).
The data were plotted as percentages of the  CBFa-bzDNA complex versus the concentration of CBFa, and the Kd is  defined as the concentration of CBFa at 50% saturation.
100% ternary  complex was defined as the point of saturation, and 0% ternary complex  is taken from the background at the same position in the absence of  added CBFa and CBFb protein.
K4 measurements were performed  using 15% polyacrylamide gels.
  The Kd of CBFb for the CBFazDNA complex (K3) was measured as  described previously (37, 42).
15% polyacrylamide gels were found to be  necessary for stabilizing the CBFa-bzDNA complex containing the mutated CBFb proteins.
Standard errors for DG0 were calculated by multiplying the fractional error for K3 times R (1.98 cal/mol K) T (273 K).
  Standard errors for DDG0 are the square root of the sum of the squares  of the standard errors for DG0 for the wild-type and mutated CBFb  proteins (44).
  Retroviral Infection of Cbfb2/2 ES CellsCbfb2/2 ES cells were  derived previously (15).
cDNAs encoding the wild-type and mutated  CBFb heterodimerization domains (amino acids 1141) were subcloned  as XhoI-EcoRI fragments into a murine stem cell viral vector harboring  a puromycin-N-acetyltransferase gene (MSCVpac) (45).
Transfection of  the packaging cell line and transduction of Cbfb2/2 ES cells were  performed as described previously (46, 47).
Briefly, BOSC23 cells were  transiently transfected by the CaCl2 precipitate method in the presence  of 25 mM chloroquine.
Retroviral supernatants (3 ml) were harvested  48 h later, passed through 0.2-mm filters, and added directly to subconfluent ES cell cultures.
Four mg/ml polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide;  Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added, and cultures were incubated at 37 C  for 3 h. ES cell culture medium (described below) was added (7 ml), and  the cultures were continued with daily changes of medium.
After 48 h,  transduced ES cells were selected with 2 mg/ml puromycin and maintained in the presence of puromycin until cells in control cultures were  no longer alive.
  Western Blot AnalysisES cell lysates were collected in IP buffer  (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2.0 mM EGTA) plus protease inhibitors (1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mM Pefabloc, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml  aprotinin).
Lysates were boiled in SDS loading buffer, resolved on 13%  SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose.
CBFb proteins were detected with mouse monoclonal antibody  b141.2 (15) and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
  ES Cell DifferentiationES cells were maintained on gelatinized  flasks in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium with 15% fetal calf serum  (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1.5 3 1024 M monothioglycerol, 50 units/ml  penicillin G, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Life Technologies, Inc.).
Two days before the initiation of differentiation, the cells were transferred to Iscoves modified  Dulbeccos medium containing the above components.
ES cells were  trypsinized into a single-cell suspension and plated into primary differentiation media containing 1% methylcellulose (Fluka, Ronkonkoma,  NY) in Iscoves modified Dulbeccos medium supplemented with 15%  fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 3 1024 M monothioglycerol, 50  mg/ml ascorbic acid, 200 mg/ml iron-saturated transferrin, and 5 ng/ml  vascular endothelial growth factor.
After 6 or 10 days in culture, embryoid bodies (EBs) were disaggregated and replated into secondary  methylcellulose cultures containing 10% plasma-derived serum (Antech, TX), 5% protein-free hybridoma medium (PFHM2, Life Technologies, Inc.) and cytokines.
EryP precursors were enumerated by replating cells into medium containing erythropoietin (2 units/ml).
  Erythropoietin (2 units/ml), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor  (CSF, 2 ng/ml), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (5 ng/ml), macrophage  CSF (5 ng/ml), stem cell factor (50 ng/ml), interleukin 1 (IL-1, 5 ng/ml),  IL-3 (20 ng/ml), IL-6 (5 ng/ml), IL-11 (10 ng/ml), vascular endothelial  growth factor (5 ng/ml), and LIF (1 ng/ml) were added to secondary  cultures to support differentiation of primitive erythroid, definitive  erythroid, myeloid, and mixed lineage colonies.
All cytokines and  growth factors were purchased fromR&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN.
  Colony types were scored by morphology.
  RESULTS  Identification of CBFb Mutants Impaired for Interaction  with CBFaIt has been demonstrated that the binding sites  on proteins for small molecules, proteins, or nucleic acids can  39580 Residues in CBFb Required for Heterodimerization   at Georgian Court College on March 8, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from be determined by mapping chemical shift changes in 15N-1  H  heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra that  occur upon binding of the other molecule (48).
We previously  measured the absolute values of chemical shift differences between 15N-labeled CBFb alone and 15N-labeled CBFb in a  ternary complex with an unlabeled Runx1 Runt domainzDNA  complex (31).
Substantial chemical shift perturbations (.150  Hz) identified in that study identified a region of CBFb involved in heterodimerization with CBFa.
The chemical shift  perturbations in CBFb can be the result of either a change in  the local protein conformation or the amino acid in question  being involved in establishing protein-protein or protein-DNA  contacts.
To distinguish between these possibilities, a limited  alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the heterodimerization surface on CBFb was performed.
We targeted the 26 amino acids  that displayed substantial chemical shift perturbations upon  binding to the Runt domainzDNA complex in our original study  (31), plus three additional amino acids in b-strand 2 identified  subsequent to the published analysis.
We also substituted  Asn-63 and Ser-65 with alanines, because these amino acids  are adjacent to two amino acids in b-strand 3 (Leu-64 and  Leu-66) that displayed large chemical shift perturbations, and  the side chains of both Asn-63 and Ser-65 are exposed to solvent.
All the amino acids substituted with alanines are indicated in Fig. 1A and Table I. Substitutions with alanines  should remove interactions beyond the b carbon of an amino  acid side chain with the Runt domain (49).
  The mutant CBFb proteins were assayed for their ability to  interact with CBFa in a yeast two-hybrid assay.
Mutant CBFb  proteins were expressed as fusions to the GAL4 activation  domain, and the full-length, 451-amino acid isoform of the  murine Runx1 protein (35) was expressed as a fusion to the  GAL4 DNA-binding domain.
The plasmids expressing the  Runx1 and CBFb fusion proteins were cotransformed into a  yeast strain containing a GAL4-driven lacZ reporter gene, and  both filter assays (not shown) and liquid b-galactosidase (b-gal)  assays (Table I) were performed.
  Six mutations in CBFb resulted in significantly reduced  b-gal activity, including G61A, L64A, L66A, M101A, I102A,  and N104A (Table I and Fig. 1B).
The Gly-61 residue is in the  loop connecting b-strands 2 and 3, Leu-64 and Leu-66 are in  b-strand 3, Met-101 and Ile-102 are at the C-terminal end of  b-strand 4, and Asn-104 is in the loop connecting b-strands 4  and 5 (31, 32).
All mutations severely affecting heterodimerization are in residues that are close to each other in the CBFb  structure.
Three mutations, Q67A, L103A, and V108A resulted  in b-gal activities between that of the wild-type CBFb subunit  and those of G61A, L64A, L66A, M101A, I102A, and N104A.
  The Gln-67 residue is located immediately C-terminal to  b-strand 3, Leu-103 is in the turn connecting b-strands 4 and 5,  and Val-108 is in b strand 5.

Residues that severely affect heterodimerization when replaced with alanine are shown in green.
Alanine substitutions that moderately decrease  b-galactosidase activity are shown in tan.
  The Arg-3 and Val-4 residues are indicated in red.
Alanine substitutions at  Arg-3 and Val-4 did not affect b-galactosidase activity.
  Residues in CBFb Required for Heterodimerization 39581   at Georgian Court College on March 8, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from liquid assay were expressed and purified from bacteria.
We  excluded CBFb(Val-108) from this analysis, because it displayed intermediate activity and has a buried side chain (0.0%  solvent exposed surface), and therefore the alanine substitution most likely perturbs the CBFb fold.
We included the  CBFb(R3A) and CBFb(V4A) mutants in our analysis, because  previous results showed that truncation of the N terminus  disrupted heterodimerization (34, 50).
The recent 2.6- crystal  structure of the Runt domainzCBFb complex placed P2 and R3  within 3.6  of residues in the Runt domain, with potential  hydrogen bonds between R3 and amino acids in Runt domain  loop bO-A (7).2 Because it is possible that the alanine substitutions perturbed the CBFb fold, the CBFb mutants were  labeled with 15N and 15N-1  H HSQC spectra were recorded.
Fig.  2 compares the 15N-1  H HSQC spectra of wild-type CBFb and  two of the mutant CBFb proteins, CBFb(N104A) and  CBFb(L66A).
CBFb(N104A) is correctly folded, with only the  backbone and side-chain N and NH nuclei from Asn-104 and  from residues in close proximity to Asn-104 (Val-5, Asp-7,  Gln-8, Leu-103, Gly-105, Val-106) displaying chemical shift  changes.
The CBFb(L66A) spectrum, on the other hand, is  significantly altered, with numerous residues displaying chemical shift changes in backbone N and NH nuclei.
Data from the  15N-1  H HSQC spectra of all the mutant CBFb proteins analyzed are summarized in Table II.
The spectra of the L64A,  L66A, M101A, and I102A mutant proteins were all severely  perturbed, indicating that the overall structure of the protein  had been compromised.
The Leu-64, Leu-66, Met-101, and Ile102 side chains are all buried in the hydrophobic core of CBFb.
  The percentages of solvent-exposed surface area for these  amino acids are 6.2% (Leu-64), 0.8% (Leu-66), 2.0% (Met-101),  and 7.8% (Ile-102).
  The 15N-1  H HSQC spectra for CBFb(R3A), CBFb(V4A),  CBFb(G61A), CBFb(Q67A), CBFb(L103A), and CBFb(N104A)  are essentially the same as that of the wild-type CBFb protein,  with chemical shifts changes observed only for amino acids in  proximity to the substituted alanine.
A larger percentage of the  surface area of these residues is exposed to solvent as compared  with Leu-64, Leu-66, Met-101, and Ile-102 (30.8% of Arg-3,  16.6% of Val-4, 26.9% of Gly-61, 24.4% of Gln-67, 21.8% of  Leu-103, and 38.9% of Asn-104).
  Biochemical Analyses of the Mutant CBFb ProteinsWe  measured the affinities of the mutant CBFb proteins for the  Runt domainzDNA complex by electrophoretic mobility shift  assays (EMSA).
Only those proteins with intact structures  (R3A, V4A, G61A, Q67A, L103A, and N104A) were analyzed.
  Fig. 3A illustrates the binding constants describing the interactions between CBFa, CBFb, and DNA (6).
K2 is the dissociation constant for the CBFa (Runt domain)zDNA complex, K3  describes the binding of CBFb to the CBFazDNA complex, and  K4 represents the binding of the CBFa-b heterodimer to DNA.
  The measured dissociation constants allow us to calculate a K1  value for the interaction between CBFa and CBFb off DNA  from the equation K2K3 5 K1K4.
  The CBFb-(1141) fragment used in these analyses binds  DNA in a weak, nonspecific manner in the absence of CBFa  (Fig. 3B, circle).
Ethylation interference analysis showed that  CBFb by itself does not bind to the sequence recognized by  CBFa (data not shown).
The dissociation constant for the  CBFbzDNA interaction (1026 M) is sufficiently high in comparison to K3 (4.5 3 1028 M) to allow determination of the K3 value.
  To ensure this was also the case for the mutated CBFb proteins  with severely perturbed binding, we also attempted to determine an approximate dissociation constant for these CBFb  proteins and DNA, but at 1025 M CBFb no detectable amount of  double-stranded DNA was shifted into the CBFbzDNA complex.
  Therefore, the binding constants for the mutated CBFb proteins for DNA is .1025 M, at least 100-fold higher than their  measured K3 values (not shown).

The K3  value for CBFb(N104A) (2.2 3 1026 M) was 49-fold higher than  that for the wild-type CBFb protein.
K3 values for all of the  mutated CBFb proteins are presented in Table III.
K3 for the  CBFb(G61A) protein is increased by 33-fold, consistent with  yeast two-hybrid data.
CBFb(Q67A) and CBFb(L103A) displayed modest reductions in affinity for the CBFazDNA complex, mirroring their intermediate activity in the yeast twohybrid assay.
  CBFb(R3A) and CBFb(V4A) had higher K3 values than  CBFb (7.1- and 10.7-fold higher, respectively), despite their  wild-type activity in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Table III).
In  the yeast two-hybrid assay CBFa is tethered to the DNA via  the heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain, which may account for the difference between the yeast two-hybrid data and  the in vitro results.
We considered the possibility that DNA  binding might induce a conformational change in the Runt  domain that specifically affects the interaction between the  Arg-3 and Val-4 residues in CBFb with the Runt domain.
To  test this, we compared the effect of the R3A substitution on  CBFb binding to CBFa in solution (K1) versus its effect on  CBFb binding to the CBFazDNA complex (K3).
The yeast twohybrid data suggest that the R3A substitution affects K3 but  not K1.
To measure K1 we determined the K4 value for  CBFb(R3A), and calculated K1 from the equation K2K3 5 K1K4.
  A K1 value for CBFb(R3A) was first estimated, based on the  assumption that it would be no more than 12-fold higher than  K3, as observed for the wild-type CBFb protein (Table IV) (K1  for CBFb(R3A) ; 3.7 mM).
We used a CBFb(R3A) concentration  that was 10-fold above its predicted K1 value (42 mM) in our  measurements of K4 to ensure that all of the CBFa protein was  in the ternary complex.
The K4 value we obtained with the  CBFb(R3A) protein was 1.7 3 10212 M (Fig. 3C, Table IV),  essentially identical to the K4 value we measured using the  wild-type CBFb protein (Table IV).
The calculation of K1 for  CBFb(R3A) yields a value of 4.1 mM (Table IV).
Our estimation  of K1 was therefore correct, confirming that an adequate  TABLE II  Summary of 15N-1  H HSQC analyses of alanine-substituted CBFb proteins  Protein Chemical shift changesa  CBFb(R3A) Asp-7, Gln-8, Arg-9, Asp-128, Glu-129, Gln-134, Leu-138, Ala-139, Gln-140, Gln-141  CBFb(V4A) Asp-7, Arg-9, Ser-10, Leu-103, Val-106, Val-108, Asp-128, Glu-129, Gln-134, Leu-138, Ala-139, Gln-140, Gln-141  CBFb(G61A) Arg-59, Thr-60, Thr-62, Asn-63, Leu-64  CBFb(L64A) Extensive chemical shift changes  CBFb(L66A) Extensive chemical shift changes  CBFb(Q67A) Ser-53, Phe-69, Trp-73, Gln-74, Gly-75, Glu-76, Gln-77  CBFb(M101A) Extensive chemical shift changes  CBFb(I102A) Extensive chemical shift changes  CBFb(L103A) Gln-8, Asn-14, Glu-15, Glu-16, Asn-104, Val-106  CBFb(N104A) Val-5, Asp-7, Gln-8, Leu-103, Gly-105, Val-106  a The amino acids displaying chemical shift changes [(uDNu 1 uDHNu) .

  Residues in CBFb Required for Heterodimerization 39583   at Georgian Court College on March 8, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from amount of CBFb(R3A) was included in the binding reactions  used to measure K4.
The R3A mutation increases K1 by 7.1-fold  and K3 by 7.8-fold, and therefore appears to affect heterodimerization of CBFb with CBFa and with the CBFazDNA complex  to an equivalent extent.
The data suggest that the interaction  of the R3 side chain with the CBFa Runt domain is not significantly influenced by the presence of DNA. Because neither the  R3A nor V4A mutation affected heterodimerization with CBFa  in the yeast two-hybrid assay, we tentatively conclude that  mutations that reduce the affinity of CBFb for CBFa less than  15- to 20-fold were not consistently detected in the yeast twohybrid assay.
  We also measured the K4 value for the most severely perturbed CBFb(N104A) mutant protein, using the same approach described for CBFb(R3A) (Fig. 3C, Table IV).
The K4  value obtained with CBFb(N104A) (4.8 3 10212 M) is approximately 2.5-fold higher than that obtained with wild-type CBFb  (1.9 3 10212 M).
Comparison of K3 with the calculated K1 value  suggests that the N104A mutation affects heterodimerization  on DNA more than off DNA.
This difference could be accounted  for by direct interaction of Asn-104 with the DNA, or by a  DNA-induced conformational change in the Runt domain.
We  believe the latter explanation is more likely, because Asn-104 is  buried at the Runt domain-CBFb interface and therefore cannot access the DNA (7).
Chemical shift perturbation experiments, described below, also indicate that Asn-104 is not intimately contacting the DNA.
  CBFb Does Not Contact DNAGoger et al. (32) proposed  that CBFb may stabilize the ternary CBFa-bzDNA complex by  contacting the DNA.
However, several observations disfavor  this hypothesis.
One observation is that the phosphate and  base contacts in the DNA do not change in the presence of the  CBFb subunit (1, 4).
Second, the DNA conformation does not  appear to change significantly upon binding of CBFb to the  CBFazDNA complex (6).
Third, a model of the Runt domainCBFb heterodimer bound to DNA, based on comparison to the  STAT3bzDNA co-crystal complex, did not invoke a role for  CBFb in establishing contacts to the DNA (7).
However, caveats exist in all of these experiments.
For example, CBFb could  be contacting phosphates and bases also contacted by the Runt  domain, in which case it would not extend the size of the  binding site and thus allow these contacts to escape detection  by chemical footprinting analyses.
CBFb could also establish  contacts to the DNA without altering its conformation.
Finally,  the ternary complex modeled by Warren et al. (7) was made  using B-form DNA, although both circular permutation analysis and circular dichroism spectroscopy suggest that the DNA  undergoes conformational changes upon CBFa binding (6, 34).
  These putative conformational changes in the DNA could significantly alter the protein-DNA interface, bringing CBFb  closer to the DNA than the current model predicts (7).
  To more directly examine whether CBFb is in close proximity  to the DNA, we measured the chemical shift changes in 15Nlabeled CBFb upon heterodimerization with unlabeled CBFa  in the absence of DNA (Fig. 4A).
We then compared these  chemical shift changes to those previously recorded in the  presence of the CBFazDNA complex (6).
The comparison is  presented in Fig. 4B as the chemical shift changes in 15Nlabeled CBFb observed in the presence of CBFa, subtracted  from the chemical shift perturbations in 15N-labeled CBFb  seen in the presence of the CBFazDNA complex.
Any significant  differences in Fig. 4B would represent a chemical shift perturbation in CBFb that is induced by the presence of DNA in the  ternary complex.
Except for a small difference at His-117,  essentially no additional chemical shift changes in CBFb occur  when DNA is present.
His-117 is an Asp in the Drosophila  Brother and Big Brother proteins.
The lack of conservation and  the relatively small chemical shift change suggests that His117 is unlikely to play an important role in DNA binding.
The  data indicate that CBFb does not intimately contact the DNA.
  The N104A and G61A Mutations Affect CBFb Activity in  VivoWe tested the ability of the mutated CBFb proteins to  rescue definitive hematopoiesis of CBFb-deficient (Cbfb2/2)  mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to determine whether the  amino acids in CBFb that mediate heterodimerization are important for its biological function in the cell.
Mouse ES cells  cultured under specific conditions can generate differentiated  hematopoietic cells in vitro (51).
ES cells are first grown in the  absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to generate embryoid bodies (EBs), as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5A.
The  EBs are then disaggregated at various time points after the  establishment of the primary culture, and the cells are replated  in secondary cultures in the presence of hematopoietic growth  factors to promote the expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic colonies.
When the secondary cultures are prepared  from EBs after 67 days of primary culture, large numbers of  primitive erythroid precursors are observed.
The appearance of  primitive erythroid precursors in EBs is followed at 810 days  of primary culture by a wave of definitive hematopoietic precursors that produce erythroid, myeloid, and mixed erythroid/  myeloid lineage colonies in secondary cultures.
  When Cbfb2/2 ES cells are differentiated in this two-step  procedure only primitive erythroid progenitors and small numbers of definitive myeloid progenitors emerge (Fig. 5C).3 This is  similar to the situation seen in Cbfb2/2 mouse embryos, in  which primitive erythropoiesis occurs, but definitive hematopoiesis is severely impaired (15, 16).
We previously showed that  the emergence of definitive hematopoietic progenitors in  Cbfb2/2 ES cells can be restored by ectopically expressing Cbfb  transgenes, and that the heterodimerization domain of CBFb is  sufficient for its function in this assay.3 We used the ES cell  rescue assay to assess the effects of mutations in the CBFb  heterodimerization surface on CBFb function in vivo.

  39584 Residues in CBFb Required for Heterodimerization   at Georgian Court College on March 8, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from encoding CBFb(R3A), CBFb(G61A), CBFb(Q67A), and  CBFb(N104A) were subcloned into the mouse stem cell virus  retroviral vector (45), and recombinant retroviruses were prepared and used to infect Cbfb2/2 ES cells.
The mutations analyzed spanned the range of in vitro effects, from the R3A  mutation that only modestly affects heterodimerization (7.1-  fold), to the N104A mutation that severely impairs heterodimerization (49-fold).
We isolated cell populations infected  with recombinant mouse stem cell viruses and performed a  Western blot to confirm CBFb expression.
The mutated CBFb  proteins were expressed at levels equivalent to or slightly lower  than the endogenous CBFb protein in wild-type (1/1) ES cells  (Fig. 5B).
  CBFb and CBFb(Q67A) restored definitive hematopoiesis in  Cbfb2/2 ES cells to an equivalent extent, and CBFb(R3A) to a  slightly lesser extent.
Rescue by CBFb(Q67A) was robust, despite the observation that its steady-state concentration was  lower than that of the ectopically expressed wild-type CBFb  protein (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 6).
CBFb(G61A) was somewhat  more impaired in its ability to rescue definitive hematopoiesis  than CBFb(R3A) and CBFb(Q67A), even though its concentration was slightly greater than that of CBFb(Q67A).
  CBFb(N104A) was severely impaired in its ability to restore  definitive hematopoiesis.
The CBFb(N104A) protein concentration (Fig. 5B, lane 7) was equivalent to that of the ectopically  expressed wild-type CBFb protein (Fig. 5B, lane 3), thus its  failure to rescue was not due to low protein levels.
The N104A  mutation therefore had the most severe effect on CBFb function both in vitro and in vivo.
Because the N104A mutation did  not perturb the CBFb structure, we conclude that the N104  side chain makes the single most important energetic contribution to heterodimerization with CBFa of those amino acids  we have analyzed.
  DISCUSSION  We performed a structure-guided, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the CBFb subunit to identify the amino acids that  contribute energetically to heterodimerization with the Runt  domain.
Chemical shift perturbation analysis was first used to  identify amino acids in the CBFa interface (31).
These were  substituted with alanines and interactions with full-length  CBFa (Runx1) were assessed in a yeast two-hybrid assay, an  experimental setup that does not involve DNA binding by the  CBFa subunit.
CBFb proteins with amino acid substitutions  that affected activity in the yeast two-hybrid assay were evaluated by NMR spectroscopy for the effects of the introduced  mutations on the CBFb fold.
We also examined CBFb proteins  with alanine substitutions at Arg-3 and Val-4, residues that  were identified by NMR (31) and implicated by truncation  analyses to be required for heterodimerization (34, 50).
Mutated CBFb proteins with intact structures were then analyzed  biochemically to measure the energy contributed by each of  their side chains to the overall binding energy.
The free energy  of heterodimerization of the CBFb subunit to the CBFazDNA  complex is 9.18 kcal.
The free energy changes caused by the  R3A, V4A, Q67A, L103A, and N104A substitutions are listed in  Table III.
Substitution of a Gly-61 with alanine presumably  perturbs heterodimerization by introducing a methyl group  into the interaction interface.
In both in vitro and in vivo assays  Asn-104 appears to make the most important energetic contribution to heterodimerization and may reside in a hot spot of  binding energy in the heterodimer interface (52, 53).
  The chemical shift perturbation analyses done by two independent labs (31, 32) and the co-crystal structure of the Runt  domainzCBFb complex off DNA (7) identified an overlapping  set of amino acids at the heterodimerization interface.
Residues 61, 64, 67, 101, 102, 103, and 104 were implicated in all  three studies, and alanine substitutions at each of these positions affected CBFa binding in the yeast two-hybrid assay.
  Several of these mutations, including L64A, M101A, I102A,  and L66A (Leu-66 was not implicated in the co-crystal structure) (7) perturbed the CBFb structure.
These amino acids may  also participate in heterodimerization, but this cannot be assessed due to the impact of the alanine substitutions on the  protein fold.
The side chains from all of these residues (Leu-64,  Leu-66, Met-101, and Ile-102) are buried in the core of the  CBFb protein.
  Asn-63 and Ser-65 were implicated by both the chemical  shift perturbation analysis by Goger et al. (32) and the cocrystal structure (7) as forming part of the interaction interface.
Asn-63 is conserved in the Drosophila CBFb homologues  Brother and Big Brother, whereas Ser-65 is a glutamine in both  Drosophila proteins.
Both Asn-63 and Ser-65 point toward the  solvent-exposed surface of CBFb.
Ser-65 in CBFb contacts two  amino acids in the Runt domain (Met-106 and Phe-153) and  Asn-63 contacts four amino acids (Met-106, Tyr-113, Ser-114,  and Thr-149) one of which (Thr-149) is mutated in a cleidocranial dysplasia patient (7, 54).
However, alanine substitutions  at Asn-63 or Ser-65 did not affect interaction with CBFa in the  FIG.

It is likely that Asn-63 and Ser-65  contribute less to the binding energy than Asn-104 and that we  could not detect the effect of alanine substitutions at these  positions in the assay.
We tentatively conclude that Runt domain interactions with individual side chains within b-strand 3  do not provide as much to the overall binding energy as Asn104 and may contribute to a shell of energetically less important contacts surrounding Asn-104 (52).
  The chemical shift perturbation study of Goger et al. (32),  which was also performed in the presence of DNA, identified  eight additional amino acids that were not examined in this  study, including Arg-78, Arg-83, Lys-98, Val-106, Gln-133, Gln134, and Glu-135.
Arg-78 and Arg-83 are in the flexible, nonconserved loop region connecting b-strands 3 and 4, and the  crystal structure of the Runt domainzCBFb complex rules out  their involvement in heterodimerization (7).
Val-106, in the  turn between b-strand 4 and 5, is conserved in the Drosophila  proteins and close to amino acids that are important for heterodimerization, but its side chain is buried in the CBFb core  (0.0% solvent exposed).
Gln-133, Gln-134, and Glu-135 are in  a-helix 4.
Of these only Glu-135 is completely conserved, but  most of its surface is not exposed to solvent (4.3%).
Lys-98 is in  b-strand 4, is a lysine in the Drosophila Big Brother protein  and an arginine in Brother, and showed a small chemical shift  perturbation in our study as well (31).
However, none of these  amino acids were found at the heterodimerization interface in  the co-crystal structure, so we believe it is unlikely that they  are intimately involved in CBFa binding.
  Warren et al. (7) also identified seven amino acids buried at  the heterodimerization interface not examined in this study,  including Pro-2, Val-5, Lys-11, Phe-17, Arg-33, Val-58, and  Pro-100.
Of these buried residues, Pro-2, Arg-33, and Val-58 lie  within 3.6  of amino acids in the Runt domain.
Pro-2 and  Pro-100 are not detected in 15N-1  H HSQC spectra, because they  lack backbone NH groups.
Arg-33, Val-58, Pro-2, and Val-5 are  conserved in the Drosophila Brother and Big Brother proteins,  whereas Pro-100 is tyrosine in Big Brother and a serine in  Brother.
In more recent spectra on a ternary complex containing 100% 2  H,13C,15N-labeled CBFb in the presence of unlabeled Runt domainzDNA, we also identified chemical shift perturbations at Val-5 (6).
Although neither chemical shift  perturbation study implicated Lys-11, Phe-17, Arg-33, or  Val-58 in heterodimerization (6, 31, 32), an interaction does not  necessarily result in a chemical shift change, and therefore  these amino acids may also be involved in binding CBFa.
Both  Arg-33 and Val-58 form contacts with Tyr-113, a residue that  provides a large surface area of interaction in the Runt domain  (7).
  Asn-104, which provides the most important contact to the  Runt domain we identified, is paired with the Runt domain  strand bG in the co-crystal structure (Fig. 6) (7).
In the NMR  solution structures Asn-104 is in the turn between b-strands 4  and 5, whereas in the co-crystal structure it forms part of a  short parallel b-sheet extension consisting of residues 102104  FIG.

  39586 Residues in CBFb Required for Heterodimerization   at Georgian Court College on March 8, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from of CBFb and residues 159161 of the Runt domain.
The b-sheet  extension is stabilized by a cluster of hydrophobic residues in  CBFb that include Met-101, Ile-102, and Leu-103 (7).
Asn-104  forms multiple contacts with three residues in the Runt domain  (Asp-66, Val-159, and T161).
The mutagenesis data support the  conclusion that the amino acid 102104 region of CBFb participates in binding the CBFa subunit.
The N104A mutation also  significantly affects binding of the Runt domain-CBFb heterodimer to DNA (K4), by 2.5-fold.
CBFb is thought to increase  the affinity of the Runt domain for DNA by inducing a localized  conformational change that alters the Runt domainzDNA interface (6, 7).
Warren et al. (7) hypothesize that the induced  conformational change of the Runt domain may be mediated by  stabilization of the Tyr-162 side chain in the Runt domain by  CBFb.
Tyr-162 is predominantly solvent-exposed (37.4%) in the  Runt domainzDNA complex (5), but oriented toward the hybrophobic core of the Runt domain in the Runt domainzCBFb  complex, whereas Thr-161 and His-163 are buried in the heterodimer interface (7).
The conformation of residues 161163  and 165166 in the Runt domain is significantly altered in  the Runt domainzCBFbzDNA complex relative to the Runt  domainzDNA complex (6).
The CBFb(N104A) mutant may be  less effective at inducing a conformational change in this region  of the Runt domain, thereby accounting for the increase in K4.
  At the other end of the Runt domain b-barrel, it has been  proposed that Runt domain loop bC-D interacts with CBFb  through multiple contacts mediated by the Tyr-113 side chain  to residues in CBFb, including Arg-33, Val-58, and Asn-63 (7).
  Arg-33 in CBFb is located in the loop between b-strand 1 and  the 310 helix, Val-58 is in b-strand 2, and Asn-63 is in b-strand  3.
Gly-61, which is very sensitive to alanine substitution, is  near Tyr-113 and contacts Asn-109 in the Runt domain.
We  predict that substitution of Gly-61 with an alanine will move  the main chain oxygen of Asn-109 in the Runt domain away  from the heterodimer interface, destabilizing the interaction.
  The region of the Runt domain near the end of bC and the bC-D  loop along with Gly-61 in the b23 loop of CBFb may contribute  to another hot spot of binding energy at the heterodimer  interface.

Ribbon diagram of the CBFa Runt domain-CBFb heterodimer (Protein Data Bank code 1e50) and detail of the interactions made by CBFb residues Asn-104 and Gly-61.
CBFb (magenta) residues Asn-104 (upper panel) and Gly-61 (lower panel) interact  with opposite ends of the curved interface of the Runt domain (cyan).
  Carbon atoms of the Runt domain are shown in cyan and in magenta for  CBFb.
Oxygen atoms are shown in red, and nitrogen atoms are shown  in blue.
Upper panel: detail of the extended parallel b-sheet between  CBFb residues 102104 on strand b4 and Runt domain residues 159  161 on strand bG. Hydrogen bonds are displayed as yellow dotted lines.
  Lower panel: Close up around CBFb residue Gly-61 showing the contact  (orange dotted line) between the Ca and main chain oxygen of Runt  domain N109 on strand bC.
