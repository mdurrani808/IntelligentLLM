Sequence Determinants of E2-E6AP Binding Affinity  and Specificity  Ziad M. Eletr and Brian Kuhlman  Department of Biochemistry and  Biophysics, University of North  Carolina, Chapel Hill,  NC 27599-7260, USA  The conjugation of ubiquitin to substrates requires a series of enzymatic  reactions consisting of an activating enzyme (E1), conjugating enzymes  (E2) and ligases (E3).
Tagging the appropriate substrate with ubiquitin is  achieved by specific E2E3 and E3substrate interactions.
E6AP, a  member of the HECT family of E3s, has been previously shown to  bind and function with the E2s UbcH7 and UbcH8.
To decipher the  sequence determinants of this specificity we have developed a quantitative E2E3 binding assay based on fluorescence polarization and used  this assay to measure the affinity of wild-type and mutant E2E6AP  interactions.
Alanine scanning of the E6APUbcH7 binding interface  identified four side-chains on UbcH7 and six side-chains on E6AP that  contribute more than 1 kcal/mol to the binding free energy.
Two of the  hot spot residues from UbcH7 (K96 and K100) are conserved in UbcH8  but vary across other E2s.
To determine if these are key specificity  determining residues, we attempted to induce a tighter association  between the E2 UbcH5b and E6AP by mutating the corresponding  positions in UbcH5b to lysine residues.
Surprisingly, the mutations had  little effect, but rather a mutation at UbcH7 position 4, which is not at a  hot spot on the UbcH7E6AP interface, significantly strengthened  UbcH5bs affinity for E6AP.
This result indicates that E2E3 binding  specificities are a function of both favorable interactions that promote  binding, and unfavorable interactions that prevent binding with unwanted partners.

The E1 uses ATP to form a thioester bond  between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and the  E1 active site cysteine.
The E1 then binds a ubiquitin  conjugating enzyme (E2) and transfers ubiquitin to  the E2 active site cysteine.
The next step in the  pathway requires a ubiquitin ligase (E3), which  utilizes distinct domains to bind both E2 and  substrate.
The two major classes of E3s bind E2s  using either a RING (really interesting gene) domain  or a HECT (homology to E6AP carboxy terminus)  domain.
E3s containing a HECT domain form a  third thioester intermediate with ubiquitin prior to  transfer to substrate.2 E3s that contain a RING  domain do not form a covalent intermediate with  ubiquitin, but rather bring the substrate in proximity  of the E2 whereby transfer of ubiquitin proceeds  directly from E2 to substrate.
  The importance of specific E3substrate interactions is apparent as aberrations can lead to improper  substrate regulation and severe physiological consequences.3,4 Often overlooked is the specificity of  E2E3 interactions as similar outcomes could potentially arise.
The hierarchical nature of the ubiquitin  pathway presents a formidable task in dissecting all  E2E3 and E3substrate interactions.
For example, in  humans there is a single E1, 30 E2s and hundreds of  potential E3s.
In general, a given E2 will interact with  multiple E3s while E3s only function with a limited  subset of E2s.4 Additionally, a given E3 may have  Abbreviation used: -Me, -mercaptoethanol.

Such  an approach has been taken by Marc Timmers and  colleagues who used a charge swap interaction  across the UbcH5bcNOT4 interface to create an  altered specificity E2-RING pair.5 The Timmers  study, as well as others, have helped map the  determinants of E2-RING specificity.59 Here, we  examine the sequence determinants of E2-HECT  specificity.
In particular, we focus on the HECT  domain protein, E6AP.
  E6AP is the founding member of the HECT domain  class of E3s.
It was first identified as a protein that  cooperates with the E6 protein from oncogenic forms  of the human papillomavirus to down-regulate the  p53 tumor suppressor.10 The conserved 350 amino  acid residue HECT domain adopts a bilobal structure  and is always found at the C terminus of E3s.
A three  residue hinge connects the N-terminal E2 binding  lobe with the catalytic C-terminal lobe and the  interface created by the two lobes forms a highly  conserved cleft containing the catalytic cysteine11  (Figure 1(a)).
Three crystal structures of HECT  domains have revealed significantly different orientations of the two lobes implying that conformational  changes are necessary for catalysis.1113 Hinge mutations to proline that restrict the conformational  flexibility of the HECT domain result in impaired E3  activity.12 Also, some patients with Angelman syndrome (AS), a severe neurological disorder linked to  E6AP, have acquired mutations within the conserved  cleft that have been shown to reduce E6AP ligase  activity.14,15 Despite the significant progress on AS  associated E6AP mutations, none of the identified  E6AP substrates have been directly linked to the  disorder.16 A better understanding of HECT domains  as well as their E2s and substrates may help combat  such E3 associated diseases.
  All E2 enzymes possess a conserved catalytic core  domain of approximately 150 amino acid residues  though some E2s also contain N and C-terminal  extensions which serve diverse functions.16 The E2  core domain contains the residues responsible for  catalysis as well as binding E1 and E3s.
Crystal  structures of the E2 UbcH7 bound to a HECT E3,  E6AP,11 and a RING E3, c-Cbl,17 revealed that E2s  utilize similar residues to bind both classes of E3s.
  The majority of E3 binding residues are contained  within the N-terminal helix (helix 1) as well as loops  4 and 711,17 (Figure 1(b)).
In both E2E3 structures,  the primary contact at the interface arises from F63  on loop 4 of UbcH7, which is buried in a hydrophobic groove created by the E3.11,17 This phenylalanine is present in all E2s that have been shown to  function with HECT E3s.11,18 The sequences of helix  1 and loop 7 of HECT binding E2s are more varied,  and it has been proposed that these regions of the  interface determine which HECT domains an E2  will bind.11 HECT E3s have been shown to form  selective interactions with at least three distinct E2  subfamilies.1922 To decipher the sequence determinants of E2-E6AP specificity, we have performed a  variety of mutagenesis experiments to map out  which E2 and E6AP residues are important for E2-  E6AP affinity, and have used this information along  with multiple sequence alignments to rationally  perturb E2-E6AP binding preferences.

  420 E2-E6AP Binding Affinity and SpecificityResults  E6AP selectivity for UbcH7 and UbcH8  Previous two-hybrid studies and activity assays  indicate that E6AP binds and functions with the  E2s UbcH7 and UbcH8, and to a lesser extent  UbcH5a.19,20 To more precisely quantify these preferences and test a larger set of E2s, we measured  the binding affinity of E6AP for nine E2s using a  fluorescence polarization (FP) assay that we previously used to measure UbcH7-E6AP binding.23  E2s were selectively labeled at cysteine side-chains  using a thiol-reactive bodipy dye, and fluorescence  polarization of the modified E2 was monitored as a  function of E3 concentration.
To ensure that the  bodipy labeling of the E2s was not influencing  binding, we measured the binding affinity of  unmodified UbcH7 for E6AP using isothermal  titration calorimetry (ITC) (Supplementary Data  Figure 1).
The two experiments yielded similar  measures of the UbcH7-E6AP dissociation constant  (KD of 5.0 M from FP and 2.2 M from ITC).
Of  the E2s tested only UbcH8 contained a cysteine  near the HECT-binding interface and for this reason  we used a C97S UbcH8 mutant in our FP assays.
  Four of the E2s (Ubc9, UbcH10, Rad6b, and Ubc12)  lack a phenylalanine at position 63 (F63) and were  not expected to bind E6AP (Figure 2(a)).
The E2s  with a F63 represent three distinct E2 subfamilies  according to a recent phylogenetic analysis of E2  enzymes.24 Representatives of the UBC4/5 subfamily include yeast UBC4 and its human homolog  UbcH5b (UbcH5a paralog).
The human UbcH2  protein belongs to the UBC8 subfamily while  human UbcH7 and UbcH8 represent the UbcH7/8  subfamily.
The binding assays show that only  UbcH7 and UbcH8(C97S) bind to E6AP with low  micromolar affinity (Figure 2(b)).
The other E2s with  a phenylalanine at position 63 (UBC4, UbcH5b, and  UbcH2) bind E6AP with affinities less than 200 M.  Of the E2s lacking F63, UbcH10, Rad6b, and Ubc12  did not bind E6AP.
Ubc9, the SUMO-conjugating  enzyme, was able to weakly interact with E6AP.
  These results are consistent with previous findings  that show that HECT E3s preferentially interact with  E2s containing a phenylalanine at position 63.11,18  Identifying hot spot residues at the  UbcH7E6AP interface  Having confirmed the importance of F63 to  binding E6AP, we next set out to identify secondary  determinants that provide E6AP selectivity for the  UbcH7/8 subfamily.
We used alanine scanning of  the E6APUbcH7 interface followed by binding  measurements to determine which side-chains contribute most to binding.
A total of 36 residues at the  interface were mutated to either alanine or glycine.
  The mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli.
and  binding affinities were measured with the FP  binding assay.
  The free energy of binding for the wild-type  UbcH7E6AP interaction was measured at 7.2 kcal/  mol (KD = 5.0 M).
As expected, the mutation  resulting in the largest loss of binding energy was  F63A (Gbind = 3.0 kcal/mol).
None of the other  mutants tested lost more than 2 kcal/mol, but nine  mutants lost greater than 1 kcal/mol.
Together with  F63 these residues will be referred to as hot spots  (Table 1).
Of these nine mutants, four are hydrophobic E6AP residues (L635A, L639A, L642A, and  F690A) that form van der Waals contacts with F63  (Figure 3).
An unexpected finding was that two  UbcH7 loop 7 lysine residues, K96 and K100, were  binding hot spots.
In the crystal structure, K96 forms  a salt-bridge with D641 of E6AP while the K100  hydrogen bonds with the D652 backbone carbonyl  of E6AP.
Hot spots were also observed at a  completely conserved proline preceding F63 as  well as M653 and Y645 of E6AP.
The latter two  residues form van der Waals contacts with P97 and  A98 of UbcH7 loop 7.
Of the remaining mutants we  Figure 2.

The dots indicate UbcH7  residues used to bind E6AP and are colored by the change  in UbcH7E6AP binding energy associated with mutating  the side-chain to alanine (or glycine) according to Figure 3.
  (b) Fluorescence polarization binding assays of E6AP  (HECT) with each of the E2s listed in (a).
The results show  that only UbcH7 and UbcH8 interact with low micromolar  affinity and that UBC4 and UbcH5b of the closely related  UBC4/5 subfamily bind E6AP significantly weaker.
Aside  from UbcH7 and UbcH8, all E2s have sub-optimal amino  acids at hot spots for E6AP.
  E2-E6AP Binding Affinity and Specificity 421found 16 to be moderately destabilizing (Gbind  of 0.25 to 1.0 kcal/mol).
These residues are a  mixture of polar, charged, and hydrophobic amino  acids.
Interestingly these residues form a shell  around the hydrophobic hot spot residues of  UbcH7 and E6AP (Figure 3).
Like the reciprocating  hydrophobic hot spots, moderately destabilizing  residues of UbcH7 interact with moderately destabilizing residues of E6AP.
The final ten mutants  exhibited either neutral (Gbind of 0.25 to 0.25  kcal/mol) or stabilizing (Gbind< 0.25 kcal/  mol) effects on the binding free energy.
These  residues cluster further from the hot spots and  outside the shell of moderately destabilizing residues (Figure 3).
The observed pattern of an energetically important hydrophobic interface core  surrounded by a shell of energetically less important  residues is not uncommon to proteinprotein  interfaces.25,26  Other mutations were made to UbcH7 and E6AP  to serve as controls.
In the UbcH7E6AP crystal  structure, R52 of UbcH7 is solvent exposed and  situated opposite the binding interface.
Mutation of  this residue to alanine resulted in wild-type binding  affinity (Table 1).
Similarly, no change in binding  free energy was observed upon mutating the E6AP  catalytic cysteine to alanine (C820A) (Table 1).
  Previous studies on the WWP1 HECT domain  found that a double proline mutation in the hinge  connecting the N and C lobes resulted in reduced  ligase activity.12 To confirm that the impaired activity arises from restricted conformational flexibility and not perturbed binding, the analogous  positions in E6AP were mutated to proline (S739P  N741P).
The resulting mutant bound UbcH7 with  wild-type affinity (Table 1).

  422 E2-E6AP Binding Affinity and SpecificityCharge swap mutations at the UbcH7E6AP  interface  To identify charged amino acids engaged in electrostatic interactions across the interface we measured binding affinities of ten UbcH7E6AP charge  swap mutants (Table 1).
The binding affinities from  the charge swap experiments were grouped into the  same categories as the alanine mutant affinities.
Six  of the mutants lost >1.0 kcal/mol of binding free  energy.
These include UbcH7 helix 1 mutants R5E,  R6E, and K9E as well as loop 7 charge swaps K96E  and K100E.
The helix 1 mutants form inter-chain (R5  and R6) and intra-chain (K9) hydrogen bonds to  backbone oxygen atoms.
The D652R mutation was  also largely destabilizing, possibly because of a loss  of interaction with K100.
Three of the remaining  charge swap mutants displayed less significant  losses in binding energy (E60R, K64E, and D641K).
  The E93R mutant displayed a large gain in binding  energy that may be the result of a new hydrogen  bond with the Q637 E6AP side-chain.
  Only two side-chainside-chain charged interactions are present across the interface, K100D652 and  K96D641.
We proceeded to test the mutant pairs for  an altered specificity interaction.
The effects from  K100ED652R interaction were as unfavorable as the  effects of either single mutant (Gbind of 1.6 kcal/  mol).
In contrast, the K96ED641K mutant pair  displayed a charge swap interaction that was more  favorable than the wild-type interaction (Gbind of  0.8 kcal/mol).
For the purpose of creating an  altered specificity UbcH7E6AP pair, the K96  D641K mutant pair would only achieve specificity  towards E3s because the D641K mutant displays no  defects in binding wild-type UbcH7.
A sub-optimal  K96D641K salt-bridge in the wild-type interaction  could give rise to such results.
These findings suggest that creating an altered specificity UbcH7E6AP  pair using a charge swap interaction may prove  difficult.
  Ubiquitin transfer rates correlate with  UbcH7E6AP binding affinity  Ubiquitin transfer assays were used to assess if  changes in UbcH7E6AP binding affinity influence  the rate ubiquitin is transferred to E6AP.
Activity  assays were not performed with mutant UbcH7  proteins because of potential complications from  altered E1-UbcH7 activity.
All E6AP mutants were  tested in reactions containing radiolabeled ubiquitin, E1, UbcH7, ATP and an ATP regenerating  system.
Each reaction was quenched in SDS-PAGE  loading buffer lacking -mercaptoethanol (-ME),  separated by SDS-PAGE, and ubiquitin-modified  proteins were visualized using a phosphorimager  (Figure 4(a)).
Ubiquitin-modified E6AP appears as  two bands and UbcH7 as a single band.
The wildtype reaction quenched in loading buffer containing -ME demonstrates that the ubiquitin modifications to both UbcH7 and the faster migrating  E6AP band are mediated via thioester linkages  (denoted with ).
The slower migrating E6AP  band that is resistant to treatment with -ME likely  represents ubiquitin modification via an isopeptide  bond (denoted with ).
No ubiquitin-modified  E6AP is observed in reactions using the catalytic  cysteine mutant (C820A) or the control lacking  E6AP.
  Phosphoimaging software was used to quantify  the total amount of UbE6AP formed in each  reaction as well as the amount of UbUbcH7 (Figure  4(b)).
Ub~UbcH7 levels were not constant between  the various reactions, indicating that the rates of  UbE6AP formation were partially limited by the  E1/UbcH7 reaction rates.
Indeed, in reactions with  the tighter binding E2E3 pairs the UbUbcH7 band  was very weak, suggesting that the rate of UbE6AP  formation depended almost entirely on the E1/  UbcH7 reaction rate.
Previously, we have shown that  E3 and E1 binding to UbcH7 are mutually exclusive  and that saturating amounts of E3 can inhibit the E1/  E2 transfer step.23 We do not believe that is occurring  in this case as the E3 concentrations are well below  saturating levels.
Despite being partially limited by  the E1/E2 transfer step, there is still a correlation  between the amount of UbE6AP formed and the  E2/E3 binding affinities (correlation coefficient=0.58).
E6AP hot spot mutants Y645A, D652R,  F690A, and M653A as well as Y694L, M654A, and  S739P N741P formed less than 55% of the ubiquitinE6AP observed in the wild-type reactions.
All the  E6AP mutants displaying enhanced binding affinity  resulted in an increase in the formation of ubiquitinE6AP.
There are a few outliers.
L639A and L635A  weaken binding by >1 kcal/mol, but do not show a  reduced amount of UbE6AP formed.
However,  there is a greater build up of UbUbcH7 for these  two reactions than for the wild-type reaction.
Overall, the results indicate that E2/E3 binding affinity  does affect E2/E3 ubiqutin transfer rates, but that  there could be additional important factors such as  on and off rates, rate of transfer within the bound  complex and the affinity of ubiquitin charged E2 for  the E3.
  UbcH7E6AP hot spots are essentially  conserved in the UbcH8E6AP interaction  The hot spot residues in UbcH7, F63, K96 and  K100, are conserved in UbcH8 (F62, K95 and K99).
To  confirm that these residues are playing the same role  at the UbcH8E6AP interface we mutated them to  alanine and measured affinity for E6AP.
The UbcH8  F62A mutation abolished binding to E6AP.
The  K95A and K99A mutations proved to be destabilizing with losses in binding energy of 0.9 and 1.3 kcal/  mol, respectively (Table 2).
In both E2s, the double  loop 7 mutants show nearly additive effects from the  single mutants, but still the combined destabilization  is less than the loop 4 phenylalanine mutation.
We  also tested our panel of E6AP mutants with UbcH8 in  binding assays.
There is a striking similarity in the  binding affinities of UbcH7 and UbcH8 for E6AP  mutants (Figure 5).
Only two significant discrepanE2-E6AP Binding Affinity and Specificity 423cies are observed and these are L639A and D641K;  both are stabilizing with UbcH8 yet destabilizing  with UbcH7.
These results show that hot spots at the  UbcH7E6AP interface are also hot spots at the  UbcH8E6AP interface.
  Redesigning UbcH5b to bind E6AP  To further explore the determinants of E2-E6AP  binding specificity we characterized a set of mutations that were rationally designed to induce  UbcH5b to bind more tightly to E6AP.
Our first  design strategy was to mutate residues in UbcH5b  that map to hot spot positions in UbcH7.
We made  the S94K and T98K single and double mutants in  UbcH5b and measured binding to E6AP (Figure 6).
  The S94K mutant destabilized binding by 0.5 kcal/  mol while the T98K strengthened binding by 0.4  kcal/mol.
The double mutant bound weaker than  wild-type UbcH5b but stronger than the S94K single  mutant.
A possible explanation for this result is that  the extra residue present in UbcH7/8 loop 7 (Figure  2(a)) may lead to different loop 7E6AP interactions  in UbcH5b.
From these results it is clear that  conserving the hot spot residues from UbcH7 is  not sufficient to induce low micromolar binding  with E6AP.
  To further search for UbcH5b mutations that could  increase affinity for E6AP, we examined the E2  multiple sequence alignment for residues that were  not conserved between UbcH7 and UbcH5b but  Table 2.

The ubiquitin-E6AP thioester (UbE6AP) is reduced in the  control reaction quenched in -ME while the isopeptide-linked ubiquitin (UbE6AP) is retained.
(b) For each reaction  the total ubiquitin-E6AP formed was quantified and normalized to the wild-type reaction.
The assay was repeated  (Supplementary Data Figure 2) and the averaged counts for each mutant is plotted versus the experimentally  determined Gbind.
Error bars represent standard deviation of relative ub-E6AP formed and the standard error of  Gbind.
  424 E2-E6AP Binding Affinity and Specificitywere located at the E6APUbcH7 interface.
The only  residue that differs between the proteins and had an  affect on UbcH7E6AP affinity is serine 4 on UbcH7,  which is a leucine in UbcH5b.
Somewhat surprisingly, mutating this leucine on UbcH5b to serine  (L3S) resulted in a significant gain of 1.2 kcal/mol in  binding energy (KD of 23 M) (Figure 6).
This  mutation was tested in conjunction with the S94K  and T98K mutants mentioned above, and the L3S  T98K double mutant bound E6AP with UbcH7/8-  like affinity.
So although the serine at residue 4 in  UbcH7 is not making strong favorable interactions  with E6AP, the residue located at this position can  have a significant impact on E2-E6AP binding  specificity.
The leucine at this position in UbcH5b is  dictating specificity by disfavoring interactions with  E6AP.
  Discussion  The sequence determinants of E2-E6AP binding  affinity and specificity have been studied by mutational analysis.
The major findings can be summarized as follows. (1) A F63 in loop 4 of an E2 is  necessary but not sufficient for tight E2E6AP  binding affinity as the five E2s that were characterized with this phenylalanine bind with affinities  ranging from 5180 M. Of these E2s only UbcH7  and UbcH8 bind E6AP with low micromolar  affinity.
(2) In addition to F63, three side-chains on  UbcH7 contribute >1 kcal/mol to the binding free  energy between UbcH7 and E6AP.
Two of these  (K96 and K100) are located on the periphery of the  interface and are not conserved in other E2 subfamilies that bind more weakly to E6AP.
(3) The  E6AP side-chains that contribute most to binding  UbcH7 are hydrophobic and surround the F63  binding cleft.
(4) Residues that are not hot spots  for the UbcH7E6AP interaction can contribute  significantly to E2-E6AP binding specificity.
Mutating L3 of UbcH5b to a serine led to a tenfold  increase in UbcH5bE6AP affinity.
  An important question that remains is whether  the interactions that determine E6AP-E2 specificity  Figure 6.
Rationally manipulating UbcH5b to enhance  binding to E6AP.
Three UbcH5b positions were mutated  and tested for their contribution to binding E6AP.
UbcH5b  mutants containing the UbcH7 hot spot lysine(s) (S94K  and T98K) alone were not able to significantly enhance  binding.
The L3 UbcH5b residue is a serine in UBC4,  UbcH7 and UbcH8, and the L3S mutation resulted in a  large increase in binding affinity for E6AP.
The L3S T98K  double mutant was capable of binding E6AP with  UbcH7/8-like affinity.
Interestingly the S94K mutation is  destabilizing except when present with the L3S mutation.
  Figure 5.
UbcH7 and UbcH8 form nearly identical interactions with E6AP.
Bar graph comparing the observed change  in binding free energy of E6AP mutants for UbcH7 and UbcH8(C97S).
Nearly all E6AP interface residues contribute  similar energy to binding UbcH7 and UbcH8(C97S).
The two significant differences (L639A and the charge swap D641K)  may arise from a slight difference in loop L7 of UbcH7 and UbcH8.
The F690A mutant was not tested with UbcH8.
  E2-E6AP Binding Affinity and Specificity 425will translate to other E2-HECT interfaces.
Much of  the initial work on E2-HECT specificity focused on  E6AP and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rsp5.
Different  techniques yielded conflicting results as to which  E2s these E3s preferred.
Studies using the yeast  two-hybrid method showed that E6AP selectively  interacts with UbcH7 and UbcH8 while Rsp5  prefers UbcH5a and UbcH6.20 Other results using  substrate or E3 ubiquitination assays show that  UbcH5a and UbcH7 support equal E6AP activity or  that Rsp5 is not active with UbcH6.18,19,22 One  consistent finding was that Rsp5 prefers UbcH5a.
  Many human HECT E3s are closely related to yeast  Rsp5 in their HECT domain as well as N-terminal  substrate binding domains (Nedd4, Nedd4L,  Smurf1/2, WWP1/2 and AIP4 in humans).27 A  sequence alignment of the E2 binding region of  HECT E3s (Figure 7) shows that within the Rsp5  subfamily there are conserved residues not present  in E6AP.
Some of these differences map to a loop  that is one to three residues shorter than E6AP in  the Rsp5 subfamily.
In more structurally defined  positions notable differences are observed at E6AP  residues D641 (W in Rsp5 subfamily), V634 (D/E),  and Y645 (N), and F690 (Y).
In an attempt to  optimize the UbcH7Smurf2 interaction, Ogunjimi  et al. found two mutations to Smurf2 that were  capable of enhancing catalytic activity in vitro and in  vivo.
  13 These mutations, H547I and Y581F, replaced  polar groups in the binding groove with hydrophobic residues observed in E6AP (I655 and F690).
  Other Rsp5 family members maintain the hydrophobic nature of I655.
Whether subtle differences  within other Rsp5 family members will drive specificity towards the UBC4/5 family or towards other  E2 families with an F63 remains undetermined.
Our  results show that a subtle difference between UbcH7  and UbcH5b indeed affects binding to E6AP.
  Our in vitro ubiquitination assays with E6AP  mutants demonstrate that E2E3 affinity influences  the rate ubiquitinHECT thioesters can be formed.
  In vivo there will be the added complexity that a  variety of E3s will be competing for E2 binding sites,  which could make E3 conjugation rates more  sensitive to E2E3 affinity.
Additionally, the study  by Ogunjimi et al. found that an auxiliary protein  Smad7 was able to bind both UbcH7 and the Smurf2  E3 via its WW domain and effectively enhance the  activity of Smurf2.13 This finding suggests that in  some cases the specificity of E2E3 interactions may  reside in a tertiary protein.
Discovering which E2E3  pairs functionally interact in the cell is a challenging  problem.
Introducing E2s and E3s with redesigned  binding specificities into the cell may provide one  route for deciphering the importance of specific  interactions.
Our study (and others like it) on the  determinants of E2E3 specificity lays the foundation for such efforts.
  Materials and Methods  Protein purification  UbcH7, ubiquitin, and E6AP expression plasmids have  been described.23 All other clones were obtained in or  subcloned into pGEX vectors with N-terminal GST-tags  followed by a thrombin recognition sequence.
Vectors  harboring S. cerevisiae UBC4 and human UbcH5b,  UbcH8, UbcH10, Rad6b, and UbcH2 were kindly  provided by Marc Timmers.
Human Ubc12 and Ubc9  were kindly provided by Brenda Schulman and Jon  Huibgretse respectively.
Point mutations were introduced using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene).
All vectors were verified by  DNA sequencing.
  Proteins were expressed overnight at 25 C with 0.3 mM  IPTG in the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli.
Cells were  disrupted by sonication and the resulting lysates were  cleared by ultracentrifugation.
UbcH7 was purified by  metal chelating Sepharose followed by cation exchange  and gel filtration.
Ubiquitin was purified by metal chelating Sepharose followed by thrombin cleavage and gel  filtration.
The HECT domain of E6AP and all other E2s  were purified by glutathione Sepharose followed by  thrombin cleavage, anion exchange and gel filtration.
  For the Y694A E6AP mutant we were not able to purify a  sufficient amount of protein, so instead we tested the  Y694L mutation.
Proteins were concentrated using Centricon and Centriprep centrifugal concentrators.
Extinction coefficients used to determine protein concentrations  were calculated using the method described by Gill and  von Hipple.28  Isothermal titration calorimetry binding assay  A Microcal-VP-ITC was used to measure the binding  thermodynamics of unmodified UbcH7 for E6AP (SupFigure 7.
Multiple sequence alignment of the E2-binding subdomain of Rsp5 family members and E6AP.
The dots are  colored by the change in UbcH7E6AP binding energy associated with mutating the E6AP side-chain to alanine according  to Figure 3.
Amino acids lining the hydrophobic groove that interacts with F63 of E2s are generally hydrophobic and/or  aromatic in the Rsp5 family of E3s.
The Rsp5 family members have a one to three residue deletion in the H7-S5 loop and  numerous non-conservative substitutions at E6AP residues.
Both of these differences likely play a role in dictating  E2-HECT specificity.
  426 E2-E6AP Binding Affinity and Specificityplementary Data Figure 1).
The experiment was performed  at 25 C using 700 M UbcH7 in the sample syringe and  1.45 ml of 35 M E6AP in the sample cell.
A total of 41 5 l  injections of UbcH7 were performed at 5 min intervals.
The  heat of dilution of UbcH7 was calculated as the average of  the final three titrations and this value was subtracted from  the dataset.
Origin software was used to fit the data to a  single-site binding model and determine the stoichiometry  (N) and thermodynamic parameters of binding Hbind,  Gbind and Sbind.
  Fluorescence polarization binding assays  Binding assays, data analysis, and labeling of the E2  enzymes with bodipy (507/545)-iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) has been described.23 Starting concentrations  for bodipy-E2 depended on the extent of conjugated  fluorophore and typically fell in the range of 0.52.0 M.  Manual titrations were performed using wild-type and  mutant E6AP(HECT) stock solutions that varied based on  yield and strength of the interaction.
All binding assays  were performed at room temperature in 20 mM KH2PO4  (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM -ME.
For each binding  experiment, nine polarization readings were collected and  averaged at 20 concentrations of E6AP(HECT).
Data were  fit to a single-site binding model using non-linear regression with SigmaPlot software to yield parameters for Pmin  (starting polarization), Pmax (maximum polarization), and  KD (dissociation constant).
  In vitro ubiquitin transfer assay  Isotopic labeling of ubiquitin with 32P was carried out  using the PKAce kit (Novagen) according to the  manufacturer's protocol.
The labeling reaction was  quenched with a tenfold molar excess of protein kinase A  inhibitor (PKI 622 Amide, EMD Biosciences).
Assays were  carried out at 4 C for 20 min in 50 l volumes containing  20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM  -ME, 2 mM ATP, 10 mM creatine phosphate, ten units/ml  creatine kinase, 5 M [32P]ubiquitin, 50 nM human E1  (Boston Biochem), 1 M UbcH7, and 1 M wild-type or  mutant E6AP(HECT).
Reactions were initiated with the  addition of [32P]ubiquitin and terminated with 2 SDSPAGE loading buffer with or without 200 mM -ME .
SDSPAGE was used to separate 30 l of the final reactions and  gels were then dried and exposed to a phosphor screen.
A  phosphorimager and ImageQuant 5.0 software (GE  Healthcare) were used to detect and quantify [32P]  ubiquitin bands.
The experiment was performed in  duplicate (Supplementary Data Figure 2).
