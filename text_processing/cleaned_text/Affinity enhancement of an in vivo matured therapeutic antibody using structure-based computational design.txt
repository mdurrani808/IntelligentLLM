We used a combination of  structure-based computational methods to optimize the binding affinity of an antibody fragment to the  I-domain of the integrin VLA1.
Despite the already high affinity of the antibody (Kd ;7 nM) and the  moderate resolution (2.8 A ) of the starting crystal structure, the affinity was increased by an order of  magnitude primarily through a decrease in the dissociation rate.
We determined the crystal structure of  a high-affinity quadruple mutant complex at 2.2 A .
The structure shows that the design makes the  predicted contacts.
Structural evidence and mutagenesis experiments that probe a hydrogen bond  network illustrate the importance of satisfying hydrogen bonding requirements while seeking higheraffinity mutations.
The large and diverse set of interface mutations allowed refinement of the mutant  binding affinity prediction protocol and improvement of the single-mutant success rate.
Our results  indicate that structure-based computational design can be successfully applied to further improve the  binding of high-affinity antibodies.
  Keywords: antibody; affinity maturation; computational protein design; proteinprotein interactions;  binding energy prediction  Supplemental material: see www.proteinscience.org  Computational techniques for small molecule design have  recently become an established part of the drug discovery  process, and many studies have been published in which  structure-based design has led to high-affinity molecules  (Jorgensen 2004).
In contrast, there has been considerably  less usage of computational design techniques in the field  of protein engineering.
This is due in part to the effectiveness of directed evolution experimental techniques  (Crameri et al. 1996; Hanes et al. 1998), the computational complexity of treating full proteins, and the relative  scarcity of structural information on engineered proteins.
  Very recently there have been a number of successes in  computational protein design, such as the redesign of  an internal domaindomain interface of an endonuclease  (Chevalier et al. 2002), the design of a novel protein fold  (Kuhlman et al. 2003), the design of specific enzymatic  activity into a periplasmic binding protein (Dwyer et al.  2004), and alteration of DNase-inhibitor pair binding  specificity (Kortemme et al. 2004). It is now foreseeable  that biomolecule therapeutic design could be addressed  using computational techniques.
  Antibodies are the most widely used format for protein  therapeutic applications for a variety of reasons, including  high affinity and the ability to trigger immune responses  ps0520305 Clark et al.

Traditionally, monoclonal  antibodies are produced by immunization of mice, construction of hybridomas, and selection of single clones expressing  the desired antibody (Kohler and Milstein 1975).
More  recently, directed evolution techniques such as phage-display  and related in vitro library display methods have become  commonly used (Crameri et al. 1996; Hanes et al. 1998).
  Either in vivo or in vitro techniques can produce highaffinity antibodies for most targets (Kretzschmar and Von  Ruden 2002; van den Beucken et al. 2003).
Further affinity  enhancement using directed evolution techniques has been  shown to be quite effective (Daugherty et al. 2000; Midelfort  et al. 2004).
In this report, we investigate the applicability  of structure-based computational design to improving the  affinity of a mature antibody.
The antibody optimized in this  work is specific for the I domain of human integrin (VLA1)  (Karpusas et al. 2003).
This integrin is a cell-surface receptor  for collagen and laminin and is present on some T-cells.
  Anti-VLA1 is a potential therapeutic intended to inhibit the  entry of activated T-cells and monocytes to sites of inflammation and may have uses in the treatment of arthritis  (Ben-horin and Bank 2004).
  In essence, computational protein design rests on  techniques to sample a large number of designs and the  ability to accurately predict the properties of the designs.
  Sampling of amino acid types and side chain rotamers  can be done efficiently using algorithms such as dead-end  elimination (DEE) (Desmet et al. 1992) and its refinements (Goldstein 1994; Pierce et al. 2000; Looger and  Hellinga 2001), Monte Carlo-based searches (Kuhlman  and Baker 2000), or combinations (Shah et al. 2004).
  Using these methods, a very large number of residue  types and conformations at many selected positions can  be screened in silico using fast evaluations of energetic  properties.
Equally important is the quality of the energy  evaluations, especially the treatment of the solvent and electrostatic interactions.
For these energy terms, the highestquality methods, such as region-dependent dielectric  constants (Wisz and Hellinga 2003) or numerical solution  of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (Marshall et al. 2005),  are only now becoming compatible with the exhaustive  search algorithms.
In principle, the ability of computational  methods to find the best designs in a virtual library of  around 1040 sequences within a few days is a major advantage over directed evolution methods, which explore on  the order of 1010 sequences within a time frame of weeks to  months.
For example, computational methods can exhaustively test all sequence combinations for a system in which  20 residues are allowed to vary (2020 ; 1026), whereas  directed evolution can only explore a tiny fraction.
  Computational protein design has been applied to the  redesign of protein cores for the purpose of making  proteins more thermostable or for exploring new protein  folds.
Several successful core redesigns have been  reported (Dahiyat and Mayo 1997; Dantas et al. 2003),  but significant challenges still exist (Dantas et al. 2003;  Mooers et al. 2003).
Compared with core redesign, there  is considerably less experience with proteinprotein interfaces.
Interface surfaces, particularly antibodyantigen  interfaces, are different from protein cores because they  may be more flexible and their residue composition  is often substantially more polar and diverse (Lo Conte  et al. 1999).
They must also have good solubility and resist  aggregation when unbound.
Additionally, interfaces usually  contain more bound water molecules, which suggests that  continuum treatments of solvation are more likely to fail.
  In this work we use structure-based computational design  to enhance the binding affinity of the anti-VLA1 antibody  AQC2 and determined experimental binding affinities for  >80 designed variants.
Mutations have been made to nearly  every antigen-contacting residue position using suggestions  from computational methods.
A number of multiple-mutant  variations have been constructed, and crystallographic data  for one of the best, a quadruple mutant, have been collected.
  This represents the first example in which structural verification has been obtained for a proteinprotein complex  designed to have increased affinity.
Previous examples of  computationally designed higher-affinity binders used only  charge optimizations and lacked structural verification  (Selzer et al. 2000; Marvin and Lowman 2003).
The extent  and the variety of the mutations allow conclusions about the  general applicability of this technology and provide a large  enough test set to further advance the quality of mutant  binding energy predictions.
  Results  Our general approach to improve the antibodys affinity  was first to computationally design and then to express  single and double mutants.
We intentionally did not restrict  the expressed mutants to those we thought most likely to  succeed.
The possibility of learning from mutation effects  also factored into the decisions.
After identification of  mutants with improved affinity, we expressed combination mutants to further increase the affinity.
Here, we first  give a general overview of the results, followed by sections  that focus on mutants designed by side chain repacking,  by electrostatic optimization, and by combination of single  mutations.
  General overview  Based on the results of the calculations, nearly all  antibody residue positions in contact with the antigen  were varied.
Figure 1 provides a view of the mutated  positions on the interface.
Residue H:Asp101 (101 in  heavy chain), which contacts the manganese ion in the  antigen, was not mutated because it is experimentally  known to be critical for binding (Karpusas et al. 2003),  Clark et al.  950 Protein Science, vol. 15  JOBNAME: PROSCI 15#5 2006 PAGE: 2 OUTPUT: Thursday April 6 17:40:57 2006  csh/PROSCI/111777/PS0520305and calculations show that it is already optimal (Sherman  2004).
It is clear from the figure that most of the  beneficial mutations were found at the periphery of the  antibodyantigen interface.
The exception is the H:T50V  mutation, which is located relatively deep in the antibody.
  We found 10 single-point mutants with measured  affinities better than wild type from the 83 constructed  mutants, a success hit rate of 12% uninfluenced by  binding energy predictions.
Of the 10, nine were found  in the first two passes of design calculations, which  included only 40 mutants (23% hit rate).
Further design  rounds contributed only one additional successful mutant  and were done to test new methods.
All mutations and the  measured binding affinities are shown in Table 1.
EC50  values were measured for all mutants using competition  ELISA, which is a solid-phase assay.
Mutants with apparent affinities near or better than wild type were also tested  using a more reliable solution-phase assay (KinExA) (see  Materials and Methods).
An example binding curve is  given in Figure 2b.
A decomposition of the calculated  binding energies is given in the Supplemental Material.
  The large number of mutations and their complex  character has allowed us to refine our protocol for predicting DDGs of binding (see Materials and Methods).
  This protocol is distinct from the search algorithms used  to find the mutations and was applied after the mutations  were expressed and tested.
Only a single false negative  (L:N52E) resulted from the predictions.
Rigorous testing  of binding energy prediction methods is outside the focus  of this work.
However, it is worth mentioning that  inclusion of more than local flexibility resulted in a higher  number of false positives.
A comparison of calculated and  experimental binding energies is shown in Figure 2.
If we  retroactively apply the results from this protocol, we  would only have made 35 of the 83 mutations, resulting in  nine mutations with affinity higher than wild type and  a corresponding hit rate of 26% (48% when restricted to  the first two passes).
  Combination of four of the higher affinity mutations,  S28Q and N52E in the light chain and T50V and K64E in  the heavy chain, resulted in a quadruple mutant with an  affinity of 850 pM, which is an ;10-fold improvement  over wild type.
For one of the combination mutants  (H:T50V/K64E, L:S28Q/N52Y), we solved the X-ray  structure in complex with the VLA1 I-domain.
There is no  change in binding epitope between the original complex  structure (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID 1MHP) and the  quadruple mutant, but some interesting structural changes  occurred, which are described in the following sections.

  Computational affinity maturation of an antibody  www.proteinscience.org 953  JOBNAME: PROSCI 15#5 2006 PAGE: 5 OUTPUT: Thursday April 6 17:41:14 2006  csh/PROSCI/111777/PS0520305One advantage of this DEE implementation is its ability  to quickly and exhaustively explore variations of all of the  antigen-contacting residues simultaneously.
  We generated a large number (500) of alternative  structures, each with a different sequence.
The structural  solutions were filtered by comparing each new sequence  to wild type and looking for promising variations at each  position.
To account for cooperativity, we looked for  residue changes that were always accompanied by mutations at neighboring positions.
These predicted single- or  double-point mutants were inspected visually, and if we  observed an improvement in packing, additional intermolecular hydrogen bonds, or an increase of intermolecular  hydrophobic contacts, we decided to make and express  the mutants.
  Our first set of mutations generated our best singlepoint mutant (L:S28Q), which by itself improves affinity  by almost a factor of 3.
Another mutant (L:N52Y) was  found with a small but not statistically significant improvement over wild type by itself.
Both of these mutants  are present in the quadruple mutant crystal structure and  allow comparison between prediction and experiment.
  Figure 3A shows the crystal structure of the quadruple  mutant (dark gray) in the region around the best singlepoint mutation (L:S28Q).
The longer glutamine residue at  this position stacks against the aromatic ring of Tyr264 on  the antigen.
The tyrosine residue is rotated inward toward  the bulk of the antigen.
Comparison with the wild-type  crystal structure (data not shown) indicates that the  tyrosine residue changed conformation, flipping inward  to make the interaction with the glutamine.
The protocol  used to evaluate the binding energies for Figure 2 predicts  a small (0.3 kcal/mol) improvement in the binding  energy relative to experiment (0.7 kcal/mol).
It fails  to rotate the tyrosine inward as observed in the crystal  structure.
Consequently, it does not pick up the correct  glutamine rotamer.
Allowing a small degree of backbone  flexibility in the vicinity of the mutation substantially  improves the predicted binding energy and allows the  correct rotamer to be found and the correct stacking  interaction to be formed (shown in light gray).
However,  only if the backbone of the quadruple mutant is used in  the calculations is the tyrosine conformation correctly  predicted.
  Figure 3B focuses on the L:N52Y mutation, which is  part of the quadruple mutant for which the crystal  structure was solved.
The tyrosine side chain extends  toward Ser295 on the antigen.
A long (4.3 A ) distance  between the serine and the tyrosine oxygens means that  direct hydrogen bonding cannot account for the apparent  increase in affinity.
As described below, we also designed  and tested an N52E mutant, which also resulted in a  small binding-affinity improvement.
Aspartate, arginine,  or lysine substitutions at this position did not produce  an improvement in affinity.
  The possibility of filling a cavity in the neighboring  antigen makes the glycine at position 100 in the heavy  chain an interesting position for mutations.
However, all  attempts to increase affinity by filling the cavity were  unsuccessful.
As shown in Figure 4, the cavity borders the  metal ion position in the antigen, is lined with polar  residues, and contains water molecules that were not  visible in the original structure.
Although the the glycine  has glycine-only uc backbone angles, the repacking  software suggested a number of drastic substitutions at  this position.
Experimentally, mutation of the glycine to  a methionine gives essentially no change from wild-type  affinity (+0.1 kcal/mol) and is the best substitution at this  position.
Substitution to phenylalanine or serine reduces  affinity by 60%, leucine drops the affinity by 1 order of  magnitude, and isoleucine or valine fail to show binding  in the competition ELISA assay.
  An alternative design set using the repacking methodology was generated using a simple modification to  include backbone flexibility (see Materials and Methods).
  Multiple starting backbone conformations were generated  using molecular dynamics and run through the same  procedure used for the single-crystal structure backbone.

(A) Comparison to the predicted  structure (light gray) in the vicinity of the S28Q mutation in the light  chain.
The predicted structure forms a similar stacking-like interaction  between Tyr264 on antigen and the glutamine.
The electron density (2Fo   Fc, s  1.1) indicates that the tyrosine has swung inward toward the bulk  of the antigen.

However, a larger fraction of the resulting  designs showed no binding in the competition ELISA  assay.
One new mutation (L:N52E) is apparently better  than wild type, and another mutation (H:F99W) is a wildtype equivalent.
  Another set of designs was proposed using a combination of high-quality electrostatic evaluations and a repacking  algorithm (see multilevel DEE/A* in Materials and Methods).
  Some advantages of this method are its detailed PoissonBoltzmann treatment of solvation and electrostatics and  its use of both binding and folding energies in selecting  promising designs.
Compared with the side chain repacking  algorithm used in the previous section, this method is best  used to redesign small clusters of residues.
We used this  methodology to design an additional 10 mutants, of which  three were double mutants and two were quadruple  mutants.
Two of the single-residue mutations were found  to have wild-type-equivalent affinity, but no additional  higher-affinity mutants were found.
  Electrostatic optimization mutants  Another set of mutations took advantage of a charge  optimization algorithm based on the electrostatic potential generated from solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) (Kangas and Tidor 1998).
Single residue  replacements that better meet the optimized charge  distribution are manually selected, modeled, and reevaluated computationally to find mutations that improve  electrostatic interactions and desolvation energies at the  interface while not adversely affecting packing interactions.
The specific rationale for making the individual  electrostatic mutations is presented elsewhere (Sherman  2004).
  One obvious benefit to the electrostatic optimizations  is the ability to design for long-range interactions.
The  H:K64E change is a charge reversal mutation that occurs  8.4 A from the nearest positively charged atom on the  antigen.
By itself, it does not produce a clear increase  in affinity, but in combination it seems to consistently  improve affinities (see last portion of Table 1).
A  Coulombic potential model truncated at 7 A would have  missed this mutation.
  Though less significant than other mutations of the  quadruple mutant in improving the binding affinity,  H:T50V is interesting because it induces local hydrogen  bonding rearrangements.
It is also the only mutation  buried in the interface rather than on the periphery.
  Figure 5 compares the quadruple mutant structure to the  wild-type crystal structure in the vicinity of the mutation.
  A side chain rotation to a different rotamer relative to the  threonine is seen in the valine mutant.
The predicted  structure captures this rotation but is not shown for  clarity.
Most interesting is the movement of the nearby  tryptophan residue.
The wild-type threonine was making  a hydrogen bond with Ser35.
This hydrogen bond is  critical for maintaining affinity; mutation of Ser35 to  alanine decreases affinity by ;1 order of magnitude.
  Removal of hydrogen bonding possibilities with the  threonine at position 50 leaves an unsatisfied hydroxyl  group and causes the tryptophan nitrogen to move 0.9 A  toward the serine oxygen to allow hydrogen bonding.
  There is a clear and surprisingly large backbone movement of ;0.7 A at the tryptophan Ca.
In this case, the  environment at the mutation site clearly rearranges to  eliminate an unsatisfied hydrogen bond.
  Combination mutants  Construction of combination mutants serves two purposes.
In some cases, it allows the production of a combined mutant with much higher affinity than any of its  constitutive single point mutations (see Fig. 2B).
The  highest-affinity mutant was a combination of S28Q and  N52E in the light chain and T50V and K64E in the heavy  Figure 5.

When substituted  with a valine, the local environment rearranges to eliminate an unsatisfied  hydrogen bond.

It is also  possible to examine the cooperativity of mutations by measuring affinities for the combination mutants.
Combining the  K64E and L60D mutations in the heavy chain does not lead  to an apparent affinity increase, presumably because they are  nearby (see Fig. 1) and both introduce a similar redundant  negative charge.
The small absolute value of many of the binding energy changes makes extensive consideration of the cooperativity speculative, but it should be noted that significant  cooperativity effects have been observed for mutations on  antibodyantigen interfaces (Sundberg and Mariuzza 2003).
  The mutations primarily improve affinity by decreasing  the dissociation rates.
This is a significant contrast to  previous work, which explicitly targeted association rate  improvements through electrostatic optimization (Selzer  et al. 2000; Marvin and Lowman 2003).
Table 2 compares  the wild-type kinetic rates to both the isolated S28Q  mutation and a combination of the S28Q, N52Y, and  T50V mutations.
Affinities (Kd) from both the surface  plasmon resonance measurements (Biacore) and the  solution-based assay (KinExA) agree well.
  The effect of the antigen-binding loop conformation  was indirectly probed by comparison with a variant with  a different supporting framework.
During the humanization of the anti-VLA1 antibody, several variants were  made that contained fewer antibody framework back  mutations but had identical CDRs.
These variants had  significantly lower affinity (;1 mM) than the humanized  antibody described in this work (M. Jarpe, unpubl.).
We  attempted to salvage the affinity of one of the low-affinity  humanization variants by applying the affinity-enhancing  mutants that were found in this work.
When the N52Y,  S28Q, and T50V mutations were applied, they improved  the affinity to 140 nM. Adding the additional K64E mutation brought the affinity to 110 nM. With the K64E mutation  and substituting N52E for N52Y, the affinity became 100 nM,  or an order of magnitude improvement, just as observed for  the wild-type reference used in this work.
This shows that  beneficial mutants can be transferred to another base wildtype anti-VLA1 with a similar net affinity improvement.
  Discussion  The results presented in this paper indicate that it is  possible using rational structure-based design to significantly enhance the affinity of an antibody produced by  traditional in vivo immunization methods.
Side chain  repacking calculations found the most effective single  mutation and electrostatic optimization methods provided  additional affinity-enhancing mutations.
Combination of  separately beneficial mutations yields the best binders  and validates the search-and-combine strategy.
  Although we were able to increase the affinity by an  order of magnitude, many of the designs were not  successful.
Computational design relies strongly on the  accuracy of the structure, and the relatively low resolution  (2.8 A ) likely contributed to inaccurate predictions.
We  have seen here that most beneficial mutations, at least for  this in vivo optimized interface, tend to have <1 kcal/mol  effect on the binding energy.
Predicting such small binding energy changes is difficult and our results highlight  the requirement for further improvement, a need that is  shared with the field of small molecule computational  design.
Areas for improvement include better treatments  of solvation effects, protein flexibility, entropic contributions, and the unbound states of the molecules in the  complex.
The crystal structure of the quadruple mutant  allows us to comment on two additional important factors:  explicit water molecules and hydrogen bonding networks.
  Explicit consideration of molecular water positions  during the design process is an important contemporary  goal in structure-based drug design.
There are two clear  examples in this work where water mediates the antibodyantigen interaction and is likely to contribute  strongly to the affinity.
The L:N52Y and the L:N52E  mutations marginally increase the affinity of the antibody,  although the L:N52Y mutation does not make direct  contact with the antigen (see Fig. 3B).
A contact through  a single bridging water molecule is structurally possible  and is likely to be present despite not being visible in the  crystal structure.
  The Gly100 position in the heavy chain (Fig. 4) shows  an unusually broad range of mutation effects.
It borders  the polar cavity on the antigen side that contains the metal  ion and buried water molecules.
Although the glycine  occupies a glycine-only region in the Ramachandran plot,  substitution for methionine or phenylalanine produces  near-wild-type affinities.
Strikingly worse effects are seen  for less extended residues such as serine, isoleucine, or  valine.
This behavior suggests that longer hydrophobic  Table 2.

The residues with branches at the Cb position  (isoleucine or valine) presumably introduce steric restrictions and may cause backbone reorientations.
Expulsion  of water from the cavity by the longer residues and the  resulting entropy gain would explain why the measured  binding is much more favorable than that predicted (wild  type vs. +14.1 kcal/mol for G100M).
  The H:T50V mutation shown in Figure 5 is an excellent  example of the importance of maintaining hydrogen bond  networks.
As described in the results, the T50V mutation  disrupts a hydrogen bond that existed between Thr50  and Ser35.
Our calculations assumed that the backbone  conformation would not change significantly, but in the  mutant crystal structure the local environment adjusted  backbone and side chains to enable a new hydrogen bonding network.
If a mutation leads to the introduction of  unsatisfied hydrogen bonds, it is likely that the environment rearranges to fix the hydrogen bonding network.
  Similar effects have been seen elsewhere (Takano et al.  1999) and it is an important factor to take into account  when designing protein mutants.
  A couple of questions arise regarding the affinityenhancing mutations that were found.
Why didnt nature  find these mutations when the antibody was matured in  the mouse, and have all the beneficial mutations been  found?
Nature is capable of discriminating high affinity  from low affinity during the affinity maturation process  up to ;0.1 nM (Foote and Eisen 1995; Batista and  Neuberger 1998).
The original affinity of the anti-VLA1  antibody was 710 nM, putting it well inside the discrimination range of the naive B-cell receptor.
For the  best single mutation that we found (L:S28Q), more than  one base mutation is needed, making it more difficult to  find via random mutagenesis.
A definitive answer to the  first question would require more immunizations and  careful selection.
Determining whether better solutions  exist would require the use of a set of library display  experiments, similar to those used to mature other antibodies to very high affinity (Midelfort et al. 2004).
  The type and locations of solutions are worth considering.
Figure 1 shows that all affinity-improving mutations except T50V are on the periphery of the antibody  antigen interface.
This could be a side effect of the  computational methodology that we use.
Incomplete  optimization of the periphery could also be a general  feature of antibodyantigen interfaces (Li et al. 2003).
At  the periphery, one needs to worry less about repacking  a set of cooperatively interacting side chains.
It is  sufficient to add new interactions across the interface  by changing a single residue.
The new residue is therefore  less likely to disturb existing interactions and finding  these solutions is more amenable to our present search  strategy.
It is also possible that optimizing the core of the  interface could require relative reorientation of the  antibody and antigen or sizable backbone movements,  neither of which is handled in most of the methodologies  we used.
As our ability to predict binding energy changes  evolves, it will be possible to trust more of the multiple  mutation designs and find solutions anywhere at the  antibodyantigen interface.
  In conclusion, we have shown that structure-based  design can be used to further affinity mature antibodies  of high affinity.
One of the advantages of computational  design is that, in principle, the smallest set of mutations  required for optimization can be determined.
Consequently, experimental follow-up by site-directed mutagenesis or a directed library approach can be done faster  than through general directed evolution methods.
It is  likely that through improvements in computational methodology, structure-based protein design will become an  important industrial approach for the optimization of  protein properties such as affinity, stability, and solubility.
  Materials and methods  Computational design methods  The starting complex structure at 2.8 A was obtained from the  PDB (1MHP chains B, X, and Y) and chains X and Y were  relabeled as H and L. Asparagine, glutamine, and histidine side  chain flips and histidine protonation states were corrected using  suggestions generated by the WHATIF software (Vriend 1990).
  We patched the N terminus of the light chain with an acetyl  group because the first residue was not visible in the 1MHP  structure.
The constant domains from the antibodys heavy and  light chains were removed and the C termini patched with  N-methylamide groups.
The structure was minimized using  harmonic constraints (10 kcal/mol/A 2 on all heavy atoms) to  remove major steric clashes.
  The calculated binding energies given in Table 1 and shown  graphically in Figure 2 were calculated using a combination of  electrostatics from the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and van der  Waals and multi-body terms from the CHARMM22 force field  (MacKerell et al. 1998).
These calculations are distinct from the  search algorithms that help to find the mutations.
All binding  energy calculations were done using CHARMM (Brooks et al.  1983; MacKerell et al. 1998), with the exception of the  electrostatic interactions and desolvation energies which were  calculated with the ICE software (Kangas and Tidor 1998; D.F.  Green, E. Kangas, and B. Tidor, MIT).
For each binding energy  evaluation the mutant structure was generated from the same  starting structure using a custom rotamer search method.
An  identical protocol was applied to regenerate the wild-type  structure at the mutant position.
CHARMM was used to scan  the x angles of each rotamer exhaustively in 60 increments  using a script adapted from one written by D.F. Green  (D.F. Green, E. Kangas, and B. Tidor, MIT).
From each starting  conformation, the rotamer and all side chains with atoms within  5 A of the Ca position were minimized and the lowest energy  conformation retained.
The protocol uses the rigid binding  approximation, no relaxation of the proteins in an unbound  state or the backbone was allowed.
  Computational affinity maturation of an antibody  www.proteinscience.org 957  JOBNAME: PROSCI 15#5 2006 PAGE: 9 OUTPUT: Thursday April 6 17:41:20 2006  csh/PROSCI/111777/PS0520305The electrostatic optimization is implemented in the ICE  software from the Tidor group (Kangas and Tidor 1998;  D.F. Green, E. Kangas, and B. Tidor, MIT).
It uses a numerical  solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to calculate the  optimal charge distribution on a set of atomic centers.
Empirical  group-based PARSE charges with polar hydrogens derived from  experimental desolvation measurements are used (Sitkoff et al.  1994).
The DEZYMER software (Benson et al. 2000; Looger  and Hellinga 2001) developed by the Hellinga laboratory was  used for the side chain repacking calculations.
It uses a custom  force field based on region-dependent dielectric constants,  Lennard-Jones van der Waals interactions, explicit hydrogen  bonding, a pair-wise decomposable surface area term, and  approximations for rotamer entropy (Wisz and Hellinga 2003).
  Van der Waals interactions were cut at 7.0 A and the well width  expanded from the conventional Lennard-Jones form to shrink  the hard-sphere radii by a factor of 1.35 without changing the  well depth.
  The flexible backbone calculations were performed by starting the side chain repacking runs from 20 unique backbone  configurations.
The configurations were snapshots taken every  10 psec from a constrained molecular dynamics simulation  using the CHARMM19 force field and a 4r dielectric.
Harmonic  constraints of 1.0 kcal/mol/A 2 were applied to each Ca atom to  prevent large departures from the crystal structure.
  The multilevel DEE/A* (Hanf 2002) protein design method  uses the dead-end elimination (Desmet et al. 1992; Lasters and  Desmet 1993; Goldstein 1994; Pierce et al. 2000) and A*  (Winston 1992; Leach and Lemon 1998) discrete search algorithms to find conformations of a set of mobile residues that  minimize the sum of the binding and folding energies.
The  method is novel in its use of three levels of increasingly detailed  discrete searching (sequence, fleximers [Mendes et al. 1999;  Caravella 2002], and rotamers [Dunbrack and Karplus 1993]),  and its use of multiple hierarchical energy functions.
After the  multilevel DEE/A*, a more accurate energy function, including  finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) electrostatics  (Gilson et al. 1988; Sharp and Honig 1990) was used to further  screen the best candidate structures found by DEE/A*. Mutant  sequences considered for synthesis were those that had a structure with better predicted binding energy, and predicted folding  energy no more than 1 kcal/mol worse, than the wild-type structure.
  Protein production  Escherichia coli expressed his-tagged Fab fragments of antiVLA1 and the described variants were used for this study.
The  plasmid consisting of the Fab fragment (Abraham et al. 2004),  a 6-His tag, and OmpA and PhoA periplasmic localization signals in a bicistronic arabinose-inducible vector was constructed.
  Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the anti-VLA1  Fab by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene).
  Expression of the antibody variants was carried out in super  broth using induction with 0.002% arabinose.
Cells were  pelleted, resuspended in 30 mM Tris, 20% sucrose with gentle  mixing, repelleted, and resuspended in 5 mM MgSO4 with  vigorous mixing.
The cells were again pelleted, and the  supernatant periplasmic lysate fraction was filtered.
An alternative cell line was used to produce Fabs for crystallography  (see Supplemental Material).
  The various His-tagged mutants of anti-VLA1 were purified  by passing the periplasmic supernatant over a 1-mL HisTrap HP  nickel chelate column (Pharmacia), which had been equilibrated  with 50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM  imidazole, 0.05% Tween-20 (pH 8.0).
After 10 column washings, the Tween-20 was removed from the buffer and then the  imidazole concentration was increased to 250 mM for elution.
  The proteins were analyzed by PAGE, UV scan, mass spectrometry, and SEC/light scattering to look for aggregates and  multimers.
  Recombinant a1b1 integrin I-domain (humanized rat) was  expressed in E. coli as a GST-fusion protein.
The I domain was  cleaved from the purified GST-fusion protein with thrombin and  further purified as described previously (Gotwals et al. 1999).
A  1.2 molar excess purified I-domain was mixed with purified  anti-VLA1 Fab and the complex purified by size exclusion  chromatography on a Superdex 200 (Amersham) in 50 mM  HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT (pH 7.4).
The complex was  buffer-exchanged into 20 mM Tris, 0.04% NaN3, 2 mM DTT,  and further concentrated to 11 mg/mL using a centricon-10  ultrafiltration device (Millipore).
  Production of Fabs for crystallography  For crystallography, Fabs are expressed using the strain  W3110ara, a Dara derivative of W3110.
A 100-mL culture  containing the expression plasmid, at a density of >109 cells/mL,  was used to inoculate (1:100) a 5-L fermenter containing  fermentation medium containing 2% fructose and 100 mg of  ampicillin.
The fermentation culture was grown overnight at a  pH of 7.0 with the DO2 maintained at 30% by fructose titration.
  The culture was induced at 15 OD with a final concentration of  0.02% arabinose.
At the time of induction 250 mL of induction  medium (Amisoy, 80 g/L; yeast extract, 20 g/L; L-proline, 12 g/L;  L-leucine, 12 g/L; tryptophan, 6 g/L) was added.
The culture was  harvested 3 h after induction at an OD600 of ;2530.
  Binding affinity measurements  To estimate the fold change in affinity of mutant anti-VLA1 proteins, we used a competition ELISA.
In this assay, GST I-domain  fusion protein was coated onto an ELISA plate.
A dilution series  of anti-VLA1 Fab samples was incubated with 10 nM biotin  anti-VLA1 Fab on the plate for 2 h at room temperature in HEPES  buffer with 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Tween-20, and  1% BSA.
The plate was washed and the amount of biotinylated  anti-VLA1 Fab bound was determined using streptavidin HRP as  a secondary.
The fold change in affinity versus wild type was  determined by comparing the EC50 of binding to wild-type Fab  measured on the same plate.
  To measure the solution phase affinity we employed the  KinExA 3000 (Sapidyne Instruments) and surface plasmon  resonance (Biacore) (see Supplemental Material for details).
  Polystyrene beads were coated with GST I-domain fusion  protein by passive adsorption.
Purified anti-VLA1 Fab fragment  is flowed through the column to bind to the I-domain on the  bead.
The Fab is detected with a secondary anti-mouse IgG  F(ab9)2 fragment specific antibody conjugated with the fluorescent  dye Cy5.
A dilution series of soluble I-domain protein with 3-h  equilibration is used.
The amount of free anti-VLA1 Fab that  remains in solution is determined by the intensity of the fluorescence signal.
A nonlinear regression curve fit gives a Kd value.
  Surface plasmon resonance measurements  Binding kinetic constants were obtained using the surface  plasmon resonance technique on a Biacore apparatus (Biacore  USA).
Research-grade CM5 sensor chips, N-hyroxysuccinimide  Clark et al.  958 Protein Science, vol. 15  JOBNAME: PROSCI 15#5 2006 PAGE: 10 OUTPUT: Thursday April 6 17:41:21 2006  csh/PROSCI/111777/PS0520305(NHS), N-ethyl-N9-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC),  and ethanolamine-HCl were purchased from the manufacturer.
All  buffers were filtered and degassed daily.
For amine coupling,  carboxymethylated dextran surfaces on CM5 chips were activated  using the standard NHS/EDC procedure with 7-min contact times.
  Anti-GST proteins were diluted to no less than 20 nM in 10 mM  sodium acetate (pH 5).
The diluted proteins were injected over the  activated surface until the desired surface densities were achieved.
  Activated, coupled surfaces were then quenched of reactive sites  with 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8) for 7 min.
Anti-GST surfaces were  prepared according to the manufacturers recommendations.
Low  and ultra-low surfaces were prepared; reference surfaces consisted  of activated CM dextran, subsequently blocked with ethanolamine.
  Data were analyzed from both the low and ultra-low surface  capacities.
  All data were collected at 10 Hz using at least three to four  replicate injections for each determination.
Regeneration of  active surfaces (when necessary) was carried out by 3-sec  injection of 100 mM HCl.
All final data sets were doublereferenced.
Sensorgram data sets were analyzed using the  Scrubber software (Myszka and Morton 1998; Myszka 1999).
  The data obtained fit globally to the binding models.
The raw  experimental data were corrected for instrumental and bulk  solvent artifacts by double-referencing using both activated  and blocked surfaces as controls.
The data were globally fit to  the replicate data for each ligand but allowed all the ligands to have  independent Rmax, ka, and kd.
Each was also allowed an independent  bulk refractive index change.
All responses were fit with one global  km since they should share the same molecular weight.
  Crystallography  One microliter of the protein was mixed with an equal amount  of reservoir buffer containing 12%14%A Peg 20,000, 100 mM  Mes (pH 5.5), 10 mM DTT using vapor diffusion techniques.
  Crystals typically appeared after 12 d with microseeding and  grew to full size (0.5 3 0.1 3 0.025 mm) in 12 wk.
For data  collection, crystals were typically broken from a larger mass,  incubated in mother liquor with 25% ethylene glycol, and flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection.
Data were  collected at 160C using 1.1 A X-rays at the National  Synchrotron Light Source (X25; Brookhaven National Laboratories) using a Quantum315 CCD detector (ADSC).
Data  processing and reduction was performed using HKL2000  (Otwinowski and Minor 1997).
Molecular replacement was  performed using MOLREP (Vagin and Teplyakov 1997) using  one monomer of the published wild-type structure (PDB ID  1MHP).
Iterative rounds of refinement and model building  utilized CNX (Brunger et al. 1998) and O (Jones et al. 1991).
  The Ramachandran plot shows that 87.4% of all residues are  in the most favored regions.
Data collection and refinement  statistics are given in Table 2 of the Supplemental Material.
The  coordinates have been deposited at the PDB (PDB ID 2B2X).
