Brunger, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, and approved October 27, 2015 (received for review May 6, 2015)  PDZ domains are abundant protein interaction modules and typically recognize a short motif at the C terminus of their ligands, with  a few residues in the motif endowing the binding specificity.
The  sequence-based rules, however, cannot fully account for the specificity between the vast number of PDZ domains and ligands in the  cell.
Plexins are transmembrane receptors that regulate processes  such as axon guidance and angiogenesis.
Two related guanine  nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), PDZRhoGEF and leukemiaassociated RhoGEF (LARG), use their PDZ domains to bind class B  plexins and play critical roles in signaling.
Here, we present the  crystal structure of the full-length cytoplasmic region of PlexinB2  in complex with the PDZ domain of PDZRhoGEF.
The structure  reveals that, in addition to the canonical C-terminal motif/PDZ  interaction, the 3D domain of PlexinB2 forms a secondary interface with the PDZ domain.
Our biophysical and cell-based assays  show that the secondary interface contributes to the specific interaction between plexin and PDZRhoGEF and to signaling by  plexin in the cell.
Formation of secondary interfaces may be a  general mechanism for increasing affinity and specificity of modular domain-mediated interactions.
  PDZ | plexin | signaling | protein interaction module | specificity  Plexins are cell surface receptors for semaphorins, extracellular  cues that control essential processes such as neuronal axon  guidance and vasculature development (1).
Binding of semaphorin  to the extracellular region of plexin induces formation of the  active dimer of the cytoplasmic region, which transduces signal to  downstream pathways (27).
The plexin cytoplasmic region contains  a juxtamembrane segment (JM-segment), a RhoGTPase binding  domain (RBD), and a GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain  (810).
The GAP domain, activated by the dimerization, transduces signal through converting its substrate GTPase Rap from  the GTP-bound active to the GDP-bound inactive state (2, 3).
The  RBD regulates plexin activity in response to binding of Rho family  GTPases, such as Rac1 (reviewed in ref. 11).
  In addition to the common signaling pathways through the domains shared by all plexins, class B plexins (B1, B2, and B3) mediate a pathway through their unique C terminus.
The conserved  VTDL motif at the C terminus of these plexins binds to the  N-terminal PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1) domains of two related guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), PDZRhoGEF,  and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) (1217).
This interaction recruits PDZRhoGEF and LARG to the plasma membrane, where they promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on  RhoA. GTP-bound RhoA binds its downstream effectors and  contributes to plexin signaling (1315, 18).
A recent study has shown  that deletion of the C terminus of PlexinB2 causes defects in the  development of the liver vasculature in mice, highlighting the critical role of the PDZRhoGEF/LARGRhoA pathway in plexin  function in vivo (19).
  More than 250 PDZ domains exist in the human proteome,  constituting one of the most abundant protein interaction modules (20, 21).
Correspondingly, there are 600 ligands for the PDZ  domains (22).
A high degree of mutual specificity is expected  between PDZ domains and their respective ligands to ensure  fidelity of signaling in the cell.
The fold of PDZ domains is composed of a six-stranded -barrel and two -helices.
The canonical  interaction mode between the PDZ domains and their ligands involves the binding of the C terminus of the ligand in an extended  -strand conformation to the groove between B and B in the  PDZ domain.
The C-terminal carboxyl group of the ligand forms  two hydrogen bonds with the backbone of the conserved GGF  motif (: hydrophobic residue) in the AB loop of the PDZ  domain, which underlies the strong preference of PDZ domains for  C termini.
Previous studies have established the general rules of  ligand specificity for PDZ domains (23).
Class I PDZ domains  recognize C-terminal motifs with the T/S-X- (X: any residue)  sequence, whereas class II PDZ domains prefer the -X- sequence.
The structural basis for this selectivity is relatively well  understood (20).
However, many PDZ domains are promiscuous  toward short peptidic ligands and defy these simple rules of specificity.
Particularly, the PDZ domains in PDZRhoGEF and  LARG, categorized as class I PDZ domains, bind with similar affinities to many peptides of both classes I and II (24).
  Binding of PDZRhoGEF and LARG to full-length class B  plexins has been detected by various in vitro and cell-based experiments, whereas many other PDZ domains showed no binding  under similar conditions (1216).
In contrast, isolated C-terminal  peptides from class B plexins and the PDZ domains of PDZ  RhoGEF/LARG only exhibit modest affinity, with the dissociation constant (Kd) in the range of 1040 M (2426).
This  Significance  Protein interactions mediated by modular domains, such as PDZ  and SH2 domains, play critical roles in biology.
The modules typically recognize a linear motif in their ligands, with a few residues in the motif determining the specificity.
We report a crystal  structure of the complex between the cytoplasmic region of  PlexinB2 and the PDZ domain of PDZRhoGEF.
The structure  shows that, in addition to the PDZ/motif interaction, a secondary  interface is formed between the three-dimensional domains of  the two proteins.
We further show that the secondary interface  enhances the affinity between plexin and PDZRhoGEF and is  important for plexin signaling.
Our analyses suggest that secondary interface-mediated interactions may be a broadly used  mechanism for modular domains to achieve high specificity.

  1485214857 | PNAS | December 1, 2015 | vol. 112 | no. 48 www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1508931112discrepancy suggests that the specificity between class B plexins  and PDZRhoGEF/LARG is not fully recapitulated by the peptide/  PDZ interaction.
More broadly, the sequence-based rules described above are likely an oversimplification of the mechanisms  underlying specificity between PDZ domains and their ligands.
  Most previous structural and binding analyses focused on isolated peptidic binding motifs derived from PDZ ligands, leaving  open the question of whether other regions in the ligands are  involved in the interaction.
  To address these questions, we determined the crystal structure of the complex between the full-length cytoplasmic region of  PlexinB2 and the PDZ domain of PDZRhoGEF.
The structure  reveals a secondary interface between PlexinB2 and the PDZ  domain, in addition to the canonical interaction mediated by the  C-terminal VTDL motif of PlexinB2.
Our structure-based mutational analyses show that the secondary interface plays an important role in the specific interaction between class B plexins  and PDZRhoGEF.
  Results  Crystal Structure of the PlexinB2/PDZ Complex Reveals a Secondary  Binding Interface.
We determined the crystal structure of the fulllength cytoplasmic region of mouse PlexinB2 (PlexinB2cyto) in  complex with the PDZ domain from human PDZRhoGEF  (Fig. 1A).
The diffraction data are anisotropic, extending to  3.2- resolution in the a* and b* directions and 5  resolution in  the c* direction (Table S1).
The asymmetric unit of the crystal  contains one PlexinB2/PDZ complex (Fig. S1).
The structure of  PlexinB2cyto, except for the disordered JM-segment, is similar  to reported structures of other plexins (2, 3, 810).
The PDZ  domain here is similar to the NMR structure of the PDZ domain  of LARG (Fig. S2).
PlexinB2cyto and the PDZ domain form a 1:1  complex, with the PlexinB2 VTDL motif and the PDZ domain  interacting in the typical PDZ/type I ligand binding mode (Fig. 1  B and C).
These interactions are similar to those seen in the  NMR structure of the complex between the octameric tail peptide from PlexinB1 and the PDZ domain from LARG (Fig. 1 B  and C and Fig. S2) (25).
In addition, Lys-1838 in PlexinB2, immediately upstream of the VTDL motif, makes an electrostatic  contact with Asp-64 in the PDZ domain (Fig. 1C).
The equivalent  interaction, between Lys-2131 in the human PlexinB1 peptide and  Asp-89 in the LARG PDZ domain, is also present in the NMR  structure (Fig. S2) (25).
Similar interactions have been extensively  characterized for many PDZ domains and their ligands (20).
  In addition to the canonical interface, our structure shows a  secondary interface between the last two helices in the GAP  domain of PlexinB2 and one face of the PDZ domain composed  of  strands BD (Fig. 2A).
The two interfaces together bury  1,500 2 of solvent-accessible surface area, with the canonical  and the secondary interfaces contributing 600 and 900 2  ,  respectively.
The center of the secondary interface is mediated  by hydrophobic interactions between Leu-68 from the PDZ domain and two alanine residues (Ala-1832 and -1833) from  PlexinB2 (Fig. 2A).
Ile-66 of the PDZ and Tyr-1806 of PlexinB2  contribute additional hydrophobic contacts at the periphery of  the interface.
The interface is further stabilized by polar interactions.
Arg-88 and Asp-64 from the PDZ domain interact with  Asp-1807 and Lys-1838 from PlexinB2cyto, respectively (Fig. 2B).
  Tandem glutamine residues from PlexinB2 (Gln-1829 and -1830)  interact with the backbone carbonyls of Gly-86 and Asp-87 from  the PDZ domain.
Ser-62 and Gln-70 from the PDZ domain  make polar interactions with the C terminus of the last helix in  the PlexinB2 GAP domain (Fig. 2B).
Some of these interactions  may be mediated by hydrogen bonds, but are not assigned because of the moderate resolution of the structure.
  The residues in PlexinB2 mediating the secondary interface  are conserved across class B plexins, but not among class A, C,  and D plexins (Fig. 2C).
Ile-66 and Leu-68 in the PDZ domain of  PDZRhoGEF are replaced by a proline and phenylalanine  residue, respectively, in LARG, maintaining the hydrophobicity  (Fig. 2D).
Other residues in the secondary interface are identical  between PDZRhoGEF and LARG from both human and  mouse (Fig. 2D).
These residues, however, are not conserved in  PDZ domains from other proteins (Fig. 2D).
These patterns of  sequence conservation suggest that class B plexins and PDZ  RhoGEF/LARG have coevolved the secondary interface to enhance their mutual specificity, and the secondary interface is  functionally important.
  Tight Binding Between PlexinB2cyto and the PDZ Domain from PDZ  RhoGEF.
By using fluorescence-based methods or isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), several studies have determined the Kd  value between isolated C-terminal peptides from PlexinB1 and the  PDZ domain of PDZRhoGEF in the range of 3036 M under  various buffer conditions (24, 26).
The PDZ domain of LARG  shows similar affinity to the tail peptide from PlexinB1 (2426).
  The peptides used in the studies of PDZRhoGEF included no  more than the C-terminal six residues of human PlexinB1, which  are identical to those in mouse PlexinB2.
We analyzed the binding  between PlexinB2cyto and the PDZ domain of PDZRhoGEF  using ITC.
PlexinB2cyto with the C-terminal four residues truncated (VTDL) showed no detectable binding to the PDZ domain, consistent with the notion that the VTDL motif is critical for  the interaction (Fig. 3).
PlexinB2cyto binds the PDZ domain with a  Fig. 1.

These results suggest that the secondary  interface as observed in our crystal structure substantially enhances the plexin/PDZ interaction.
  Mutational Analyses of the Secondary Interface.
To assess the  contribution of the secondary interface to the plexin/PDZ interaction, we examined the effects of a series of mutations at  this interface by ITC.
Three mutationsY1806A, A1832E,  and A1833Ewere introduced individually into PlexinB2cyto.
  The Y1806A mutant displayed approximately twofold reduction  in binding (Kd = 3.7 M) compared with the wild-type (WT)  PlexinB2cyto (Fig. 3).
The A1832E and A1833E mutants showed  much weaker binding, with Kd values of 13 and 30 M, respectively.
  The A1833E mutation reduces the affinity to the reported level  of the isolated C-terminal peptide of PlexinB1, effectively eliminating the contribution of the secondary interface.
Tyr-1806 is located at the periphery of the interface, and the alanine mutation  removes a portion of the hydrophobic interaction, but does not sterically occlude binding.
Introducing a charged and larger residue to  the hydrophobic core of the interface, as in the case of the A1832E  and A1833E mutations, however, disrupts the secondary interface.
  The PDZ mutations also attenuated binding to various degrees, consistent with the features of the secondary interface.
  The PDZ R88A mutant increased Kd by approximately threefold  to 6.4 M (Fig. 3).
Loss of the peripheral interaction between  Arg-88 in the PDZ domain and Asp-1807 in PlexinB2cyto is not  expected to actively disrupt the interface core or the ability of  other contacts to form.
The R88E mutation, which introduces  charge/charge repulsion with Asp-1807 in PlexinB2cyto, reduced  the affinity by 20-fold (Kd = 40 M).
An alanine mutation of  Leu-68 in the PDZ domain, which docks into the hydrophobic  patch created by Ala-1832 and -1833 in PlexinB2cyto, reduces the  affinity by approximately fivefold.
Mutating a peripheral hydrophobic residue in the PDZ domain, I66A, attenuated binding by  less than twofold.
Together, these data demonstrate that the  secondary interface is responsible for the >10-fold tighter binding to the PDZ domain by PlexinB2cyto compared with the isolated PDZ-binding motif.
  Both Binding Interfaces Contribute to Recruitment of PDZRhoGEF by  Plexin.
We have shown previously that the GEF activity of PDZ  RhoGEF and its homologs can be facilitated by membrane recruitment to membrane-delimited substrates such as RhoA (27)  and that this functional recruitment can mediate hormone signaling in cells (28).
In the reconstituted system, GEFs were  recruited to the surface of lipid vesicles that contained regulatory  partners and substrates tethered to the membrane surface  through interaction of polyhistidine tags with NiNTA-conjugated  lipids.
We used this system to examine the interaction of fulllength PDZRhoGEF with PlexinB2cyto (Fig. 4 AC).
PDZ  RhoGEF in solution displayed modest nucleotide exchange activity toward RhoA tethered to lipid vesicles.
Addition of His6  PlexinB2cyto produced a concentration-dependent increase in the  exchange activity (Fig. 4 A and B), suggesting functional recruitment of PDZRhoGEF by His6PlexinB2cyto to membranelocalized RhoA. Deletion of the C-terminal motif from PlexinB2  (VTDL) eliminated the GEF activity increase (Fig. 4 B and C),  consistent with an anticipated reduction in the recruitment.
We  further tested mutations in the secondary interface, two in the  PDZ domain (R88E and R88A) and two in PlexinB2cyto  (A1832E and A1833E).
All four mutants attenuated the  Fig. 2.

The partial reduction by the R88A mutation is  consistent with its more moderate effect on binding affinity  (Fig. 3).
These results implicate both the primary and secondary  interfaces in the recruitment of PDZRhoGEF by plexin.
The  sufficiency of this interaction is demonstrated by the recruitment  of a chimeric protein containing the PDZ domain of PDZ  RhoGEF linked to an unrelated RacGEF, TRIO (triple functional domain protein) (Fig. 4D).
His6PlexinB2cyto stimulates  nucleotide exchange of membrane delimited Rac1 by the chimeric PDZTRIO, but not TRIO alone.
  Secondary Interface Contributes to Plexin-Mediated Activation of PDZ  RhoGEF in Cells.
Activation of class B plexins by semaphorin activates PDZRhoGEF and LARG, leading to increased levels of  GTP-bound RhoA in cells (1217).
To examine whether this plexin/  PDZRhoGEF-mediated activation of RhoA is dependent on  the secondary interface, we used a pull-down assay for quantifying  RhoA(GTP) levels in the cell (29).
Full-length human PlexinB1,  which is nearly identical to mouse PlexinB2 in both the C-terminal  motif and the secondary interface, was used in these experiments.
Consistent with previous studies, the results show that  overexpression of PlexinB1 increased the levels of RhoA(GTP)  in HEK293T cells, which express PDZRhoGEF endogenously  (Fig. 5) (13, 18).
RhoA activation was further enhanced by  semaphorin treatment.
Deletion of the VTDL motif in PlexinB1  (VTDL) abolished RhoA activation in the presence or absence  of semaphorin treatment.
These results are also consistent with  previous studies (13, 14).
We then tested the effects on RhoA  activation of the A2125E and A2126E mutations of PlexinB1,  equivalent to the secondary interface mutations A1832E and  A1833E of PlexinB2, respectively.
These mutations both attenuated RhoA activation, although the reduction was not as severe as  that caused by VTDL (Fig. 5).
Together, our data strongly support  Fig. 3.

  Discussion  Protein interactions between modular domains, such as PDZ,  SH2, and SH3 domains, and linear binding motifs are a common  theme in biology (30).
An established paradigm is that sequence variations of one or a few residues in the binding motifs  determine the specificity.
However, modules of the same type  often show similar sequence preferences for the binding motifs,  and similar or identical motifs often exist in different proteins.
  This paradigm is therefore inadequate for rationalizing the diverse yet specific interactions mediated by modular domains.
In  the case of PDZ domains, binding motifs of different classes do  not always show large differences in affinity to cross-typed PDZ  domains.
Extensive investigations, including large-scale peptide  library screening and bioinformatics analyses, have shown that  residues beyond positions 0 and 2 in PDZ binding motifs are  involved in fine-tuning the specificity (20, 21).
Based on these  studies, as many as 16 classes have been defined to account for  the specificity profiles of PDZ domains (31).
A recent study has  shown that the PDZ domain in the protein PALS1 forms a  structural supramodule with the SH3 and guanylate kinase domains, with all of the three domains collectively contributing to  specific binding to the C terminus of its ligand crumbs (32).
  The above analyses are largely limited to linear binding motifs.
  Our finding of the secondary interface mediated by the folded  domains of PlexinB2 and PDZRhoGEF provides an additional dimension to the mechanism by which PDZ domains  achieve specificity.
Interestingly, a recent study has shown that the  C-terminal SH2 domain in phospholipase C forms a secondary  interface with the kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor, in addition to the SH2/phosphorylpeptide interaction  (33).
Similar secondary interactions have also been seen for a  SH3 domain and a small GTPase (34, 35).
The 3D domain-mediated  secondary interfaces may be broadly used by modular domains to  increase affinity and specificity, but are underappreciated because  they involve residues not adjacent in sequence to the binding motifs  and cannot be easily identified by sequence analyses.

  It is unclear how the interaction between class B plexins and  PDZRhoGEF/LARG is regulated by semaphorin binding to  plexin.
Before activation, plexin exists as an inactive monomer or  inhibitory dimer (3, 9, 36).
Semaphorin binding induces the formation of the active dimer of plexin (2, 47).
PDZRhoGEF and  LARG also form dimers or oligomers through their C-terminal  coiled-coil region (37).
The plexin active dimer and the PDZRhoGEF/LARG dimer may form a 2:2 complex (Fig. S3A).
Alternatively,  dimeric PDZRhoGEF/LARG may bridge two copies of the plexin  dimer, leading to their clustering on the cell surface (Fig. S3B).
The  dimerization/oligomerization may increase the avidity between plexin  and PDZRhoGEF/LARG.
PDZRhoGEF and LARG both have  other domains that help target them to the plasma membrane, such  as the Pleckstrin-homology domain that interacts with GTP-bound  RhoA (38).
These factors together may facilitate the interaction between plexin and PDZRhoGEF/LARG and thereby enhance their  ability to discriminate against nonspecific interactions.
  Materials and Methods  Full-length PDZRhoGEF was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda cells.
Other  proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli.
Proteins were purified by affinity  chromatography in combination with ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography.
