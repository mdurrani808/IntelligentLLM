Mutational and Structural Analysis of the Binding  Interface between Type I Interferons and their  Receptor Ifnar2  Jacob Piehler and Gideon Schreiber*  Department of Biological  Chemistry, Weizmann Institute  of Science, 76100, Rehovot  Israel  Type I interferons (IFN) exert pleiotropic activities through binding to  two cell surface receptors, ifnar1 and ifnar2.
We are investigating the biophysical basis of IFN signaling by characterizing the complex of the  extra-cellular domain of ifnar2 (ifnar2-EC) with IFNs on the level of puri-  ed recombinant proteins in vitro.
Here, we present a detailed mutational  study on the functional epitopes on both IFN and ifnar2.
Kinetic and  thermodynamic parameters were determined by label-free heterogeneous  phase detection.
On IFNa2, a relatively small functional epitope comprising ten amino acid residues was localized, which is nearly entirely  formed by residues on the AB loop.
Two hot-spot residues, L30 and R33,  account for two-thirds of the total interaction energy.
Comparing the  anti-viral potency of the various mutants to the binding afnity towards  ifnar2 revealed a proportional correlation between the two, suggesting a  rate-limiting role of ifnar2 binding in IFN signaling.
On ifnar2, residues  T46, I47 and M48 were identied as hot-spots in the interaction with  IFNa2.
For another ten residues on ifnar2, signicant contribution of  interaction energy was determined.
Based on these data, the functional  epitope on ifnar2 was dened according to a homology model based on  other members of the class II hCR family in good agreement with the  complementary functional epitope on IFNa2.
Although IFNa2 and IFNb  bind competitively to the same functional epitope, mutational analysis  revealed distinct centers of binding for these IFNs on ifnar2.
This small  shift of the binding site may result in different angular orientation, which  can be critically coupled to cytoplasmic signaling.

These  pleiotropic properties of type I IFNs have found  considerable attention since their discovery more  than 40 years ago (Isaacs & Lindenmann, 1957).
  During the last decade, some basic principles of  interferon signaling pathway have been unveiled.
  All human type I IFNs (IFNa, b, o and t) bind to a  cell surface receptor consisting of two trans-membrane proteins, ifnar1 (Uze et al., 1990) and ifnar2  (Novick et al., 1994).
These receptor components  associate upon binding to IFN (Cohen et al., 1995),  leading to phosphorylation by kinases associated  to the cytoplasmic domains of ifnar1 (Tyk2) and  ifnar2 (JAK1) (Uze et al., 1995; Velasquez et al.,  1995).
While ifnar2 binds IFNs with moderate af-  nity (KD  2-10 nM for IFNa2), the intrinsic afnity  of human ifnar1 to IFNs is low (KD > 100 nM), stabilizing the ternary complex by approximately 10  to 20-fold (Cohen et al., 1995).
Although signaling  to all type I IFNs is mediated through this cell  surface receptor, considerable differences in the  response to different interferons have been  observed (e.g. Rani et al., 1996).
Particularly IFNb  exerts specic functions which might be caused by  E-mail address of the corresponding author:  bcges@wiccmail.weizmann.ac.il  Abbreviations used: EC, extra-cellular; IFN, interferon;  ifnar, type I IFN receptor; R, receptor; hC, helical  cytokine; GH, growth hormone; TF, tissue factor; RIfS,  reectometric interference spectroscopy; VSV, vesicular  stomatitis virus.

Several models for the unique interaction of IFNb with the receptor have been proposed (Lewerenz et al., 1998; Russell-Harde et al.,  1999).  Type I interferons belong to the class of helical  cytokines (Sprang & Bazan, 1993) and are built by  ve helices.
The structures of several type I IFNs  have been solved, such as murine IFNb (Senda  et al., 1992), human IFNa2 (Radhakrishnan et al.,  1996; Klaus et al., 1997), human IFMb (Karpusas  et al., 1997) and ovine IFNt (Radhakrishnan et al.,  1998).
Numerous mutational studies have revealed  functional important residues on IFNs (Mitsui et al.,  1993; Runkel et al., 1998), which can be ascribed to  distinct functional epitopes for the interaction with  ifnar1 and ifnar2 (Bandu et al., 1994; Seto et al.,  1995; Uze et al., 1995).
Much less structural and  functional data is available for the receptor proteins, which belong to the class II helical cytokine  receptor (hCR) family (Bazan et al., 1990; Uze et al.,  1995).
Their homology to hCRs with known structure, e.g. TFR (Harlos et al., 1994; Muller et al.,  1996), IFNgR (Walter et al., 1995) and GHR (de Vos  et al., 1992), allows for modeling of the 3D structure with reasonable reliability.
For GHR and  IFNgR, the crystal structure of the complex of the  receptor in its ligand is also available (de Vos et al.,  1992; Walter et al., 1995).
Based on these structures,  models for the receptor and the complex with IFNs  have been proposed (Seto et al., 1995; Uze et al.,  1995) and several residues contributing to binding  were identied (Lewerenz et al., 1998).
  Understanding the mechanisms of how distinct  activity proles are exerted by different type I IFN  subtypes through the same cell surface receptor  proteins ifnar1 and ifnar2 is a prerequisite for  designing IFN-like drugs with specic activities.
  We believe that this requires detailed biophysical  characterization of the formation of the complex of  IFN with its receptor, which initiates the signaling  cascade.
We are investigating the interactions of  IFNs with its receptors on the level of puried  recombinant proteins to elucidate structure,  thermodynamics and kinetics of the complex  formation.
Recently we have succeeded in refolding active extra-cellular part of ifnar2 (ifnar2-EC)  expressed in Escherichia coli and we have puried it  to homogeneity with yields of a few milligrams  per liter of cell culture (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999).
  Moreover, we have established methods for studying thermodynamics and kinetic of the interaction  of ifnar2-EC with IFNs.
Here, we present a systematic mutational analysis of the binding interface  between ifnar2 and IFNa2 to dene the functional  epitope on both proteins in quantitative terms.
  Protein-protein interactions were investigated by  heterogeneous phase detection monitoring the  binding kinetics in real time.
By determining the  contributions of a number of residues on both  ifnar2-EC and IFNa2, we dened the binding interface of the ifnar2-IFNa2 complex on both proteins  and we quantitatively mapped differences in binding of IFNa2 and IFNb to ifnar2.
  Results  Theoretical considerations  We have shown before, that the simple relation:  KD  kd  ka  1  between rate constants of association ka and dissociation kd, and the equilibrium dissociation constant KD is valid for the formation of the ifnar2-ECIFNa2 complex (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999).
The  interaction between two proteins A and B is typically described by a three-state energy prole  including an encounter complex A:B, and a transition state with increased free energy compared to  the free and complexed proteins (Figure 1).
These  early states of interaction A:B and AB{ are stabilized by long-range electrostatic forces (Schreiber &  Fersht, 1996; Selzer & Schreiber, 1999), while the  nal complex AB is stabilized mainly by shortrange interactions.
The dissociation constant KD  describes the interaction energy of the complex as  a difference of the free energy of the free proteins  and the free energy of the nal complex AB  according to:  G0  KD  RT lnKD 2  Thus, changes in G0  KD upon mutation:  Figure 1.
Free energy proles for protein A and B  forming a complex AB via an encounter complex A:B  and a transition state AB{  .
The proles for two different  types of mutations of the original proteins (black) are  schematically depicted: mutation I (blue) exclusively  removes long-range electrostatic forces, while mutation  II (red) exclusively removes short-range forces.
While  these two mutated complexes have the same G0  KD , the  difference in Gz  kd is considerable.
  224 Type I IFN Receptor Binding InterfaceG0  KD  RT lnKmut  D  Kwt  D  3  identies changes in both the long-range and  short-range interactions.
However, precisely dening residues in the binding interface requires discrimination of long and short-range interactions.
  According to transition-state theory, the kinetic  rate constants describe the formation of the transition state.
The rate of association has been shown  to be affected mainly by the magnitude of longrange electrostatic forces between the proteins,  which can be altered by mutations outside the  binding site (Schreiber & Fersht, 1996; Selzer &  Schreiber, 1999).
Dissociation rates reect the free  energy Gz  kd required for breaking the short-range  interactions in the binding site of the complex:  Gz  kd  RT ln hkd  kT 4  where kd represents the dissociation rate constant.
  The change in Gz  kd upon mutation:  Gz  kd  RT ln kmut  d  kwt  d  5  is a much better measure for determining residues  making short-range interactions than G0  KD , as it  directly maps changes in the stability of the complex (cf.
Figure 1).
Measuring association and dissociation rate constants therefore allows for  discriminating long and short-range forces contributing to afnity.
Changes in the dissociation rate  constant can also be determined with higher precision than changes in afnity because they are  independent of the active protein concentration.
  Rate constants of association and dissociation  can be measured conveniently by label-free solid  phase detection.
Even though absolute values  obtained by this method are often doubtful, relative parameters, such as G values, have been  determined to be very reliable (Cunningham &  Wells, 1993; Albeck & Schreiber, 1999).
  The ifnar2 binding site on IFNa2  The AB-loop and the D-helix have been identied before as being important for IFN activity  (Mitsui et al., 1993) and are assumed to interact  with ifnar2 (Seto et al. 1995; Uze et al., 1995).
We  mutated in IFNa2 most of the exposed residues  from S25 to D35 on the AB-loop and from K121 to  K134 on the D-helix to alanine, and determined the  effect of mutation on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the interaction with ifnar2.
All investigations were carried out with wild-type ifnar2-EC  immobilized to the sensor surface, since rate constants and afnity determined by this conguration are self-consistent (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999).
  Typical binding curves for the interaction of wildtype IFNa2 and the mutant L26A are shown in  Figure 2(a).
Dissociation rate constants were determined at high protein concentrations to obtain a  maximum amplitude.
The dissociation curves for  all IFNa2 mutants were tted by a single exponential decay without systematic deviations.
The dissociation rate constants were measured at least ve  times for each mutant, with typical standard deviations of less than 10 %.
Association rate constants  were determined under pseudo-rst-order conditions at concentrations of 50 nM. Within the rst  30 seconds, the association phase of the binding  curve followed a single exponential function and  was determined by direct tting of a simple 1:1  kinetic model.
Owing to the fast interaction kinetics and the additional parameters (concentration  and the dissociation rate constant) the typical standard deviation of the association rate constants  was 20 %.
  All kinetic and thermodynamic constants for  the IFNa2 mutants binding to immobilized wildtype ifnar2-EC are summarized in Table 1.
The  association and the dissociation rate constants of  the IFNa2 mutants in comparison to wild-type  IFNa2 are shown in Figure 3.
The precision of  measurement allowed for the detection of down  to 20 % change in the dissociation rate constant  (2s criterion, a  0.95).
A signicant increase of  the dissociation rate constant was found for the  mutants L26A, F27A, L30A, K31A, D32A, R33A,  H34A, D35A, R125A and K133A (Figure 3(b)).
  For the two mutants, R33A and L30A, the kinetics were too fast to be resolved by this method  (>0.5 s1  ).
A dissociation constant KD of approximately 5 mM was found for the mutant L30A by  titration on the surface (Figure 2(b) and (c)).
  Afnities determined by this method were  shown to be consistent with the rate constants  (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999).
For the mutant  R33A, no signicant interaction with immobilized ifnar2-EC was detectable by this method  up to concentrations of 50 mM of this mutant.
  Signicant contributions of the association rate  constant were observed for the three positively  charged residues K31, K131 and K133 with the  strongest contribution by K133.
Since kinetic  measurement allows for discrimination of long  and short-range forces, the energetic contributions of the mutated residues to the stability  of the complex were determined both from  the dissociation rate constants (Gz  kd  ) and  from the afnity constant (G0  KD ) (Table 1).
  The residues L30 and R33 are hot-spots on  IFNa2, contributing approximately 15 kJ/mol  and >15 kJ/mol, respectively.
Except for residue  L26, for which the energetic contribution is  approximately 4 kJ/mol, all other residues investigated contribute less than 2 kJ/mol.
  Anti-viral activity versus affinity of  IFNa2 mutants  Binding of IFN to ifnar2 is the very rst step  initiating a complex signal transduction cascade  which activates the anti-viral state in cells.
Thus,  Type I IFN Receptor Binding Interface 225correlation between kinetics and thermodynamics  of binding of different IFN mutants to ifnar2-EC  and the relative potency of their antiviral response  could dene limiting steps in formation of the ternary complex required for signaling.
The anti-viral  activity of the IFNa2 mutants relative to wild-type  IFNa2 were determined from the concentrations  required to protect 50 % of human WISH cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).
We  found that the relative activity of the mutants  decreased proportional to the relative decrease in  afnity determined by heterogeneous phase detection (Figure 4).
Assuming that this correlation is  also valid at lower activities, the afnity of the  mutant R33A can be estimated from its relative  anti-viral activity (of 6  105 units/mg) to be  approximately 30 mM.  The binding site for IFNa2 on ifnar2  Three crystal structures of receptors from the  hCR super-family with a similar topology as  ifnar2-EC have been solved:
TFR, IFNgR and GHR.
  While TFR has 21 % identity and 33 % similarity  with ifnar2-EC, and IFNgR has 17 % identity and  33 % similarity, the homology of GHR to inar2-EC  is signicantly lower.
Therefore, we used only the  structures of TFR and IFNgR for homology modeling.
The nal alignment chosen for modeling is  shown in Figure 5.
Because of the rather low homology, the sequence alignment is ambiguous and  different models are possible.
The positioning of  the gaps within the sequence of ifnar2 compared to  the TFR sequence proved to be particularly critical.
  The sequence alignment of ifnar2 to IFNgR  appeared more reliable: in the N-terminal domain  where the binding site was mapped, only a single  gap of two residues occurs, which location is  dened by structural conserved regions.
We therefore took the model based on IFNgR for all further  structural considerations.
A model of ifnar2-EC  based on TFR as template with the alignment  shown in Figure 5, however, gave a RMS deviation  of all backbone atoms of 1.35 A compared to the  IFNgR based structure.
  The region presumably involved in the interaction with IFN can be identied by comparison  with the homologous systems GH/GHR and  IFNg/IFNgR, for which the structures of the complex have been solved (Seto et al., 1995; Lewerenz  et al., 1998).
Functional contributions of some residues in this region have already been conrmed  by a mutational study on ifnar2 (Lewerenz et al.,  1998).
To conne this binding site on ifnar2, we  Figure 2.

  Type I IFN Receptor Binding Interface 227probed long-range electrostatic interactions by a  set of single charge reverse mutants: D8R, E30R,  E52R, D72R, E86R, E134R, D140R and D191R.
The  effects on the dissociation kinetics was investigated  by heterogeneous phase detection with IFNa2  wild-type being immobilized (Table 2).
Based on  these data, a number of residues in the binding site  were individually mutated into alanine: T46, I47,  M48, S49, K50, E52, D53, W74, S76, T77, H78, E79,  N100, W102, I105, H189, D191 and E192.
The dissociation kinetics of these mutants was compared  to wild-type ifnar2-EC with immobilized IFNa2  (Figure 6(a)).
In order to characterize the energetic  contribution of residues towards binding more precisely, changes in kinetics and thermodynamics of  the interaction with IFNa2 were investigated with  the ifnar2-EC mutants being immobilized.
Immobilization of ifnar2-EC mutants gave active surfaces  for most mutants with typical Rmax values between  100 and 300 pm (60-200 pg/mm2  ) and a similar  stability as the wild-type.
For some mutants, however, no stable and active surfaces were obtained:  the mutants E134R and W74A quickly lost their  activity when immobilized on a surface, whereas  W74F remained stable on the surface.
For immobilized E79A, no binding activity could be measured  for the immobilized protein indicating complete  denaturation of this mutant by the immobilization  procedure.
The afnity of this mutant was  estimated by a binding inhibition assay in solution.
  All the thermodynamic and kinetic data measured  for the interaction of these mutants with wildtype IFNa2 are given in Table 2.
Though the absolute dissociation rate constants are different for  the ifnar2-EC mutants with either IFNa2 or  ifnar2-EC immobilized, the relative change in  the dissociation rate constant, and thus the Gz  kd  ,  determined are in good agreement (Figure  6(b)).
This result proves that these relative parameters are widely independent from experimental  artifacts.
A total of 14 out of the 24 mutated residues investigated signicantly affected the interaction with IFNa2.
The residue M48 was identied  as a hot-spot for the binding of IFNa2, contributing  more than 15 kJ/mol of binding energy.
Mutations  of T46 and I47 to Ala decrease binding by more  than tenfold.
E79 to Ala (but not to Gln) as well as  I105 to Ala decreased the afnity to IFNa2 by fourto vefold.
The very low stability of the mutant  E79A suggests that the residue E79 stabilizes not  only the integrity of the binding site, but also  seems to be important for the stability of the protein.
A more precise characterization of the contribution of this residue towards binding of IFNa2  might be achieved by a more stable homologue  mutant or by a different immobilization procedure.

  228 Type I IFN Receptor Binding InterfaceW102A each increased the dissociation rate constant between two- and threefold compared to  wild-type ifnar2.
The mutants E52A, K55A and  S76A increased the dissociation rate constant by  less than twofold, suggesting that these residues  are positioned in the periphery of the binding site.
  For all other alanine mutants, dissociation rate constants similar to wild-type ifnar2-EC were  observed.
Signicant changes in the association  rate constant were observed for the charge reverse  mutants E52R and D191R (decreased ka), as well as  for K50A (increased ka), indicating that a negative  eld on ifnar2 is required for electrostatic steering.
  Comparison of IFNa2 and IFNb binding  to ifnar2-EC  Accurate measurement of the interaction kinetics  of single alanine mutations in the binding site of  ifnar2 allowed mapping of differences in binding  of IFNa2 and IFNb.
Strong non-specic binding  interfered with studying the interaction of immobilized ifnar2-EC with IFNb under physiological  ionic strength.
Increasing the salt concentration up  to 500 mM eliminated the non-specic binding to  the transducer surface.
Therefore, all investigations  involving IFNb were carried out under these conditions.
The dissociation rate constant of IFNa2  decreased by 10 % at this salt concentration compared to 150 mM, but still single-phase kinetics  were observed.
The maximum response by IFNb  was approximately 10-20 % higher than that of  IFNa2, in agreement with the higher molecular  mass of the glycosylated, CHO-produced IFNb.
  The rst 70 % of the dissociation amplitude were  tted by a single exponential decay, with a rate  constant of 0.017 s1 for immobilized wild-type  ifnar2-EC.
Binding curves for IFNa2 and IFNb are  shown in Figure 7 in comparison for two different  ifnar2-EC mutants.
The association kinetics of  IFNb signicantly deviated from a simple single  exponential model and was not further evaluated.

  Type I IFN Receptor Binding Interface 229ifnar2-EC that are destabilizing the complex with  IFNa2, also affect the binding of IFNb.
However,  the relative energetic contributions to binding of  IFNa2 and IFNb are very different for most residues.
The mutation W102A results in a tenfold  stronger decrease in afnity to IFNb compared to  IFNa2.
The mutation M48A, which destabilizes the  complex with IFNa2 by about 500-fold, decreased  the afnity towards IFNb only eightfold.
Furthermore, the mutant H78A stabilizes the complex  with IFNb nearly twofold, while destabilizing the  complex with IFNa2 more than twofold.
The  mutation N100A hardly affects the rates for binding IFNa2, whereas its decreasing the dissociation  rate constant for IFNb by almost fourfold (cf.
the  binding curves in Figure 7).
For the residues K50,  E52 and W74F, no signicant changes in afnity to  IFNb were found upon mutation, while they  signicantly contributed to binding of IFNa2 with  ifnar2-EC.
  Discussion  Understanding the activity proles exerted by  different type I IFNs requires a thermodynamic,  kinetic and structural understanding of the recognition by the cell surface receptor.
As a rst step  towards this goal, we have carried out a rigorous  mutational analysis of the binding interface of the  complex formed between ifnar2 and type I IFNs.
  The energetic contributions of amino acid residues  were mapped in a quantitative manner using puri-  ed proteins for measuring afnity and kinetics of  the complex formation.
Heterogeneous phase  detection was used for precise comparison of the  rate constants and the afnity of different IFNs  and its mutants.
A principal problem of mutational  Figure 6.

Data are from Table 2.
  230 Type I IFN Receptor Binding Interfaceanalysis of a binding site is to discriminate  between mutations which affect its structural integrity, from mutations which specically remove  interactions in the interface.
In case of IFNa2, the  importance of residues for the structural integrity  of the binding site can be estimated from the structure, and only exposed residues in the vicinity of  the hot-spot of binding were analyzed.
The case is  more difcult for ifnar2, because small shifts in  sequence alignment can exchange exposed and  buried residues.
Some mutations on ifnar2-EC  affected the stability of the protein (e.g. Y81A,  W74A), indicating an effect on the structure of  ifnar2.
According to our model structure, these  two residues are buried within the core of ifnar2.
  Thus, the stability of the ifnar2 mutants gave at  least an estimate of whether residues are exposed  or buried.
All charge-reverse mutations which are  located outside the binding site (D8R, E30R, D72R,  E86R, E134R and D140R) did not signicantly  affect the interaction, suggesting that in general  mutations on the surface of ifnar2 affect binding  only when they are located at the vicinity of the  binding site.
This is true even for the extreme case  of charge-reverse mutants.
Furthermore, very  different effects upon mutation on the interaction  with IFNa2 and IFNb were observed.
This was  most pronounced for the mutants M48A and  W102A which are hot-spots of binding for IFNa2  and IFNb, respectively.
These mutants apparently  affect the binding very locally, excluding considerable effects on the structural integrity of the entire  binding site.
  Until now, all mutational studies of the binding  site on IFNa2 have been based on the assessment  of pleiotropic activities of chimaric or pointmutated IFNs (reviewed by Mitsui et al., 1993).
We  found a good correlation of the anti-viral activity  of IFNa2 mutants with their afnity toward ifnar2-  EC, which conrms the principal validity of conclusion drawn from activity assays.
The residues  on IFNa2 which contribute to the interaction with  ifnar2 are in good agreement with residues identied previously by measuring changes in antiviral  activity (Camble et al., 1986; Tymms et al., 1989;  Waine et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1994).
Assessment  of the kinetics and thermodynamics of IFN binding  to ifnar2 enables us to characterize its role in IFN  signaling.
The correlation between afnity and  activity of IFN is striking.
This correlation holds  true not only for the IFNa2 mutants we investigated here.
Our thermodynamic and kinetic data  for ifnar2-EC mutants also correlate with anti-viral  activities of IFNs measured on cells with mutated  ifnar2 (Lewerenz et al., 1998).
In particular, differences in anti-viral activity of IFNa2 and IFNb  observed with cells with the ifnar2 mutants M48A  and W102A correlate with the differences we  found in the afnity.
The apparently linear downstream propagation (tyrosine phosphorylation and  formation of the transcription factor ISGF3) of  these effects shown in the same study corroborates  the central role of the afnity of IFNs to ifnar2 for  function.
Such correlation is not trivial, since the  formation of a ternary complex by at least two consecutive binding events is required for signal transduction.
In the case of the structural homologous  and functionally similar GH-GHR system, the af-  nity of GH to its receptor surpasses the requirements for activity by about 30-fold, and any  further increase in afnity by decreasing kd did not  decrease the EC50 dose (Pearce et al., 1999).
The  limiting step in formation of the ternary GH complex is probably the association of GH to the rst  receptor (binding to site 1), while the long half-life  Figure 7.
Comparison of the binding curves for wildtype IFNa2 ( ) and IFNb () with immobilized (a)  wild-type ifnar2-EC and (b) the mutant N100A.
  Figure 8.
Comparison of the energetic contributions of  residues in the binding site of ifnar2 to binding of  IFNa2 and IFNb (data from Table 2).
  Type I IFN Receptor Binding Interface 231of this complex (one hour) is longer than is  required to ensure the formation of a ternary complex within a single binding event.
For GH  mutants with dissociation rate constants higher  than 0.016 s1  , a linear correlation between af-  nity and activity has been observed (Pearce et al.,  1999).
The half-life of the binary complex of <one  minute is probably too short to guarantee the formation of a productive ternary complex within a  single binding event.
In this case, equilibrium occupancy of the receptor (ka versus kd) determines the  probability of the formation of the ternary complex.
This situation corresponds to the IFNa2-  receptor system with a kd of 0.02 s1  , which is  strikingly close to the critical kd in the GH system.
  Though the critical kd, below which no further  increase in activity can be achieved, has yet to be  veried for the binding of IFNs, increasing the  activity of IFNs should be possible by increasing  ka.
  The total free energy of the IFNa2-ifnar2-EC  complex G0 is approximately 54 kJ/mol at room  temperature assuming the unitary standard state  of 55 M given by the concentration of water molecules.
Interaction energies G0  KD determined  from single point mutations are not strictly additive, because cooperative effects are not taken into  account.
Furthermore, interactions with the backbone and Cb atoms are not mapped by alanine  scanning analysis.
However, the sum of G0  KD for  individual mutations gives an estimation as to  what extent the binding site is mapped by the residues investigated (Cunningham & Wells, 1993).
  For IFNa2, the sum of the interaction energies  GKD of all residues investigated is approximately 53 kJ/mol, which is close to the free energy  of the complex formation.
This agreement suggests  that the functional epitope is essentially built from  the residues we have identied.
Further contributions to the total complex free energy have to be  ascribed to long-range electrostatic interactions,  which considerably increase the basal association  rate constant (5 kJ/mol at physiological ionic  strength; Piehler & Schreiber, 1999).
The two residues L30 and R33 on IFNa2 account for nearly  two-thirds of G0  , together with L26 and F27 for  more than 75 % of G0  .
The functional epitope on  IFNa2 for binding to ifnar2 according to these considerations is depicted by the solution structure of  IFNa2 (Klaus et al., 1997) shown in Figure 9.
The  key residues L30 and R33 (colored in red in  Figure 9) are close to each other and form together  with L26 and F27 a hydrophobic patch on IFNa2  (and probably other IFNa, which have a highly  conserved sequence in this region).
This region  contributes the dominant part of the interaction  energy and can be assumed as the very center of  the binding site.
Six residues adjacent to this patch  also show signicant interaction with ifnar2; however, none of them decreases the complex stability  (as measured by the change in kd) by more than  twofold (orange colored residues in Figure 9).
  These six residues are all charged, suggesting that  they predominantly interact by electrostatic forces.
  Except for R125 and K133, which are both in the  periphery of the binding site, all residues contributing to binding of ifnar2 are localized on the ABloop (Figure 9(b)).
Thus, peptides analogous to the  AB-loop might mimic the binding site of IFNa2,  providing a potential lead structure for designing  low molecular mass antagonists.
  A quantitative determination of the rate constant  of the complex formation allows for discriminating  of long and short-range forces contributed by  specic residues.
We have shown before that longrange electrostatic forces considerably enhance the  Figure 9.

  232 Type I IFN Receptor Binding Interfaceassociation of the IFNa2-ifnar2-EC complex  (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999).
In agreement with the  theory of electrostatic rate enhancement, only  mutations of charged residues (K31, K131 and  K133) on IFNa2 affected the association rate constant.
Mutation of these positive residues into neutral residues decreased ka, indicating that the  positive electric eld in the periphery of the functional epitope is important for steering the association with ifnar2.
This observation supports our  notion that a binding site is preferably mapped  using Gz  kd as a criterion for allocating a residue  in the binding site.
  In comparison to the functional epitope of GH  for the interaction with GHR (de Vos et al., 1992;  Cunningham & Wells, 1993), the number of contact  residues on IFNa2 is much smaller, suggesting a  signicant smaller buried surface of the complex  with ifnar2.
This observation matches the differences observed in binding kinetics of the two  complexes.
Both association and dissociation  rate constants of binding of GH to its receptor  (3  105 M1 s1 and 2.7  104 s1  , respectively,  for binding of GH site 1; Cunningham & Wells,  1993) are much smaller than for IFNa2-ifnar2.
The  lower association rate constants indicates less longrange electrostatic forces involved in the GH-GHR  interaction, while the lower dissociation rate constant indicates more stabilizing contacts in the  interface.
  We have characterized the functional epitope on  ifnar2 for the binding of IFNa2 and IFNb.
A number of residues on ifnar2 were identied which  contributed to binding both IFNa2 and IFNb.
The  binding sites resulting for IFNa2 and IFNb from  these investigations are depicted on our homology  model of ifnar2-EC (Figure 10).
The key residue on  ifnar2 for binding of IFNa2 is M48.
Mutating this  residue to Ala reduces binding by 500-fold (15 kJ/  mol).
Two additional residues located nearby (T46  and I47) reduce binding by over tenfold (5.5 and  6.5 kJ/mol, respectively).
These three relative  hydrophobic hot-spot residues are surounded by  six, mostly polar residues (S49, K50, H78 E79,  W102 and I105) which contribute between 2 and  4 kJ/mol binding energy.
Residue W74 in our  model is buried beneath this binding site.
This is  in agreement with the low stability of ifnar2-EC  observed for the alanine mutant of W74 (which  was not observed for the phenylalanine mutant)  and the considerable decrease of complex stability  upon mutation.
In agreement with previous investigations (Lewerenz et al., 1998), our results indicate hardly any contact of IFNa2/IFNb with the Cterminal domain of ifnar2, which is considerably  involved in the homologous complex of GH and  IFNg with their receptors (de Vos et al., 1992;  Figure 10.

The residues are color-coded according to their contribution to binding IFNa2 or IFNb as indicated in the Figure.
This picture was composed with the Swiss-PDB Viewer (Guex & Peitsch, 1997).
  Type I IFN Receptor Binding Interface 233Clackson et al., 1998; Walter et al., 1995).
Some contribution of residue E192 was found and none for  the residues E134, D140, H189 and D191.
However,  this perfectly agrees with the small functional epitope identied on IFNa2 and the binding site on  ifnar2 ts very well to its binding site on IFNa2.
  The key residues M48 and I47 form a hydrophobic  patch which could interact with the hydrophobic  patch on IFNa2 (F27 and L30).
For ifnar2-EC,  patches of negatively charged residues at the periphery of the binding site (E52/D53, E134-E137  and D191/E192) contribute to steering of association through long-range attraction of the positive  residues in the periphery of the functional epitope  of IFNa2, driving the fast rate of association of this  complex.
It is interesting to note that all the residues on ifnar2 identied by us to be important in  binding are located on loops and not beta-sheets.
  A similar distribution of binding residues has been  observed for the interaction of GH with GH-R, and  on antibodies.
The sum of the interaction energies  for all residues involved in binding IFNa2 identied so far accounts for 52 kJ/mol, which is close  to the total interaction energy of the complex.
  Dissecting the binding epitope of IFNb on ifnar2  shows a similar location of the binding site, but  with a very different distribution of binding energies of specic residues.
The most important residues on ifnar2 binding IFNb are W102 (11 kJ/mol)  and I47 (7 kJ/mol).
Other residues important for  binding include T46, M48, S49 and I105 (3-5 kJ/  mol).
Two mutations on ifnar2 (H78 and N100)  result in an decreased rate of dissociation (and  thus a higher afnity) for IFNb but not for IFNa2.
  It would be interesting to explore the phenotype of  a H78, N100 double mutation in ifnar2, which  should have about 20-fold tighter binding for IFNb  compared to IFNa2.
Overall, much lower effect of  the mutations investigated on the binding of IFNb  was observed.
The sum of the interaction energies  is 39 kJ/mol for IFNb, which is approximately  two-thirds of the total interaction energy (57 kJ/  mol).
Further residues of the functional epitope on  ifnar2 interacting with IFNb have yet to be  identied.
  Structural differences have been proposed to be  responsible for different activity proles of different IFNs, especially IFNa2 and IFNb (Domanski  et al., 1998; Lewerenz et al., 1998; Russell-Harde  et al., 1999).
Comparing the contributions of different residues located on ifnar2 to the binding of  IFNa2 and IFNb, allows mapping such differences  in a quantitative manner.
Our results suggest that  IFNa2 and IFNb essentially bind to the same binding site on ifnar2 with very similar kinetic and  thermodynamic parameters.
Albeit the contributions of specic residues to binding are signi-  cantly different.
Comparing the functional epitope  of IFNa2 and IFNb on ifnar2 (Figure 10) suggests  that despite the overlapping binding site, the angular orientation of both ligands binding ifnar2 may  differ.
This could lead to a different orientation of  the intra-cellular domains of ifnar2 and ifnar1 in  the ternary complex, which could be critical in the  pattern of activation of the cellular response to  IFNa2 versus IFNb.
This fact is in good agreement  with mutational studies of the binding site on  IFNb (Runkel et al., 1998).
Mutation of the residue  R35 of IFNb resulted in a much less dramatic loss  in activity than the homologous mutation of R33  on IFNa2.
Despite the considerable sequence homology between IFNa2 and IFNb in the AB-loop, the  spatial arrangement of the residues most important  for binding is quite different (Figure 11).
The overall structural deviation in the homologue sequence  C29-R33 (C31-R35 on IFNb) is 1.75 A , while for the  residues L26 and F27, which play a considerable  role in forming the functional epitope on IFNa2,  no homology on IFNb is observed.
The fact that a  loop structured so differently binds to essentially  the same epitope on ifnar2 might indicate structural changes upon binding.
  With the quantitative, high-resolution description of the functional epitopes on IFNa2 and  ifnar2, and the correlation of thermodynamics with  activity, we have made an important step towards  an understanding of IFN recognition by its receptor on a molecular level.
We were able to prove the  importance of the afnity of IFNa2 toward ifnar2  for their activity, which may account for the varying potency of different IFNs.
Although IFNa2 and  IFNb bind competitive to the same functional epitope, mutational analysis revealed distinct centers  of binding for these IFNs on ifnar2.
In the ternary  complex IFN-ifnar1-ifnar2, small shifts of the binding site may result in different angular orientation,  which can be critically coupled to cytoplasmic signaling as been shown for another hCR (Livnah  et al., 1998).

  234 Type I IFN Receptor Binding InterfaceMaterials and Methods  Protein expression and purification  IFNa2 and ifnar2-EC were expressed in E. coli and  were puried by ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography as described (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999).
The  levels of expression of IFNa2 and ifnar2-EC mutants  were as high as the wild-type.
The fraction of successfully refolded IFNa2 mutants varied, with typical yields  between 10 and 50 mg protein per liter of cell culture,  puried to over 95 % homogeneity.
The IFNa2 mutants  Y129A and R120A gave very low yields of active protein  (<1 mg/l cell culture).
These mutants were not further  investigated.
Signicantly lower yields of properly  refolded ifnar2-EC (approximately 20 % compared to the  wild-type) were obtained for the mutants W74A, E79A  and E134R.
However, the mutant W74F again gave  yields similar to the wild-type.
Y81A did not give active  protein.
Wild-type, glycosylated IFNb produced in  CHO cells was a gift from Professor M. Rubinstein. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999) with  e280  18,070 M1 for IFNa2, e280  30,050 M1 for IFNb  and e280  26,500 M1 for ifnar2-EC (corrected to  e280  21,100 M1 for the tryptophan mutants of ifnar2-  EC W102A and W74F).
Protein purity was analyzed by  SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and concentrations were veried by quantitative evaluation of the  protein bands compared to wild-type standard.
Concentrations of active IFNa2 protein were determined by analytical gel ltration with ifnar2-EC as described (Piehler  & Schreiber, 1999).
  Site-directed mutagenesis  Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR of  the plasmids for expression (pT72Ca2 and pT72CR2)  with 18-21 nucleotide primers containing the mutated  codon using high delity polymerases pwo (Boehringer  Mannheim) and Pfu (Stratagene) as described in detail  (Albeck & Schreiber, 1999).
After phosphorylation and  ligation, the mutated plasmids were transformed into  TG1 cells.
The sequence of the whole expressed gene  containing the mutation was veried by DNA sequencing.
  Thermodynamic and kinetic analysis  All thermodynamic and kinetic data were obtained  from label-free heterogeneous phase detection.
The interaction between IFNa2 and ifnar2-EC was monitored by  reectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS) under  ow-through conditions as described (Piehler &  Schreiber, 1999).
Either ifnar2-EC (wild-type or mutant)  or wild-type IFNa2 was immobilized by standard amide  coupling chemistry.
All measurements with IFNa2 and  ifnar2-EC were carried out in 50 mM Hepes with  150 mM NaCl and 0.01 % Triton X100 at pH 7.4.
The  interaction with IFNb was measured at 500 mM NaCl in  order to eliminate non-specic interactions with the surface, which was observed at 150 mM NaCl.
  Association and dissociation kinetics were measured  by standard injection protocols and corrected by blank  runs.
Dissociation rate constants were measured at protein concentration of 0.5-2 mM in order to saturate the  surface.
The total range of dissociation was used for  tting a 1:1 kinetic model.
Association rate constants  were determined by incubating IFNa2 (wild-type and  mutants) at a concentration c of 50 nM under pseudo-  rst-order conditions.
Consistency of the observed rate  constants at different concentrations with a single association rate constant under these conditions has been  shown before (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999).
The rst  30 seconds of the binding curve R(t) was tted by a 1:1  kinetic model:  Rt  Req1  ekackdt   6  (Req, equilibrium response) using the mean dissociation  rate constant determined in previous experiments.
All  rate constants were determined as mean values from at  least ve independent measurements and the errors are  given by their standard deviations s. Differences  between two mean values of more than 2s were considered signicant (a  0.95).
For fast dissociating  mutants, dissociation constants KD were determined  from the equilibrium binding on the surface at different  concentrations as described before (Piehler & Schreiber,  1999).
For signal correction, the immobilized ifnar2-EC  was denatured and the background response was  measured at the same concentrations.
Equilibrium dissociation constants in solution were determined by a  binding inhibition assay with immobilized ifnar2-EC as  described (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999).
  Anti-viral protection activity assay  Anti-viral activity of wild-type and mutant IFNa2 was  assayed as the inhibition of the cytopathic effect of VSV  on human WISH cells (Rubinstein et al., 1981).
The  activity of wild-type and mutant IFNa2 was determined  from the relative concentration needed for 50 % protection of the cells compared to NIH IFNb standard.
The  dissociation constant KD of IFNb binding to wild-type  ifnar2-EC was determined by a binding inhibition assay  as described (Piehler & Schreiber, 1999).
  Homology modeling of ifnar2-EC  A structural model of the extracellular part of the  ifnar2 (212 amino acid residues) from SYDSP (N-ter) to  ESEFS (C-ter) (Novick et al., 1994) was built using homology modeling.
Sequence alignment was carried out  using  -BLAST and clustalX (with ten different homologous protein sequences), taking into account the secondary structure motifs in TFR and IFNgR. The alignment  was corrected manually by moving gaps from b-sheets  into loops.
Homology modeling was done using SwissPDBViewer 3.0 and the automated comparative protein  modeling server SWISS-MODEL in optimized mode  (Guex & Peitsch, 1997).
As primary template for modeling we used the structure of IFNgR.  Acknowledgments  We thank M. Rubinstein and D. Novick for supplying  IFNb and for many helpful discussions, S. Barak for performing numerous IFN cytopathic activity assays, and S.  Albeck for the critical reading of the manuscript.
