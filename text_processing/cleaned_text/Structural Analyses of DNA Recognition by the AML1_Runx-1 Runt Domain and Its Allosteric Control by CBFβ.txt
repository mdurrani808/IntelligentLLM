Near this site, the side chain of Asn69  and backbone of Asp66 of CBFa are hydrogen bonded  to the backbone of Pro2 and side chain of Lys11 of  CBFb, respectively, and Pro68 of CBFa makes a van  der Waals contact with Val5 of CBFb, stabilizing the  N-terminal regions of both subunits.
  Several CBFa point mutations that degrade or abolish  CBFa-CBFb heterodimerization have been described  (Lenny et al., 1995; Akamatsu et al., 1997a; Li and Gergen, 1999).
Some (e.g., N109D, F146Y, L148D, or Q158L)  impair CBFa-CBFb binding by disrupting the conformation of L5 or the overall folding architecture of CBFa,  which also affects its ability to bind to DNA.
Others  (e.g., M106V or G108R) impair CBFa-CBFb binding by  specifically affecting the recognition residues at the  CBFa-CBFb interface.
For instance, replacement of  Met106 with a b-branched valine would cause steric  hindrance between the branched methyl group of valine  and the methylene part of Asn63 of CBFb, while replacement of Gly108 with arginine would cause steric hindrance between the arginine and the L2 main chain of  CBFb.
In these cases, the mutants retain the capacity  to bind to the DNA.
  The effects of several CBFb mutations on CBFa-CBFb  heterodimerization and their in vivo function were examined in a parallel study (Tang et al., 2000b).
R3A, V4A,  G61A, Q67A, L103A, and N104A mutations all impair heterodimerization, as Arg3, Gln67, Leu103, and Asn104 are all  directly involved in CBFa-CBFb binding, as described  above (Figure 3C); the V4A mutation would be expected  to alter the folding structure of CBFb; and the G61A  mutation would cause steric hindrance between the glycine and the Asn109 backbone of CBFa (Figure 3D).
