The CDR3 regions of an immunodominant T cell  receptor dictate the energetic landscape of  peptide-MHC recognition  Natalie A Borg1,4, Lauren K Ely1,4, Travis Beddoe1, Whitney A Macdonald1, Hugh H Reid1, Craig S Clements1,  Anthony W Purcell2, Lars Kjer-Nielsen2, John J Miles3, Scott R Burrows3, James McCluskey2 &  Jamie Rossjohn1  The energetic bases of T cell recognition are unclear.
Here, we studied the energetic landscape of peptidemajor  histocompatibility complex (pMHC) recognition by an immunodominant ab T cell receptor (TCR).
We quantified and evaluated  the effect of natural and systematic substitutions in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops on ligand binding in  the context of the structural detail of each component of the immunodominant TCR-pMHC complex.
The CDR1 and CDR2 loops  contributed minimal energy through direct recognition of the antigen and instead had a chief function in stabilizing the ligated  CDR3 loops.
The underlying energetic basis for recognition lay in the CDR3 loops.
Therefore the energetic burden of the  CDR loops in the TCR-pMHC interaction is variable among TCRs, reflecting the inherent adaptability of the TCR in ligating  different ligands.
  The specificity of the cellular immune responses is determined mostly  through the clonally distributed ab T cell antigen receptors (TCRs)  that co-recognize structural determinants on peptides in complex with  products of the major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)1  .
The  atomic detail of the TCR-pMHC interactions permits several generalizations to be made regarding the nature of TCR engagement of the  pMHC complex214.
The emerging paradigm of TCR recognition  suggests a common diagonal docking mode that may be an important  factor in coreceptor ligation or signalling1517.
In this diagonal framework, the complementarity-determining region 1 (CDR1) and CDR2  loops of the TCR contact the MHC a-helices, whereas the hypervariable CDR3 regions interact mainly with the peptide, although variations on these generalities have been reported17.
  Those structural investigations have been complemented by an  evaluation of the biophysical basis of the TCR-pMHC interaction.
  Such studies, using surface plasmon resonance and calorimetry  approaches, showed the TCR-pMHC interaction to be dominated  by weak intermolecular interactions (low micromolar range), with  slow association rates and fast dissociation rates18.
The slow association rates are consistent with the conformational plasticity of the CDR  loops that was noted after pMHC engagement.
Evidence so far  suggests the TCR-pMHC interaction is enthalpically driven (heat is  lost)19,20 and order is imposed (entropic penalty), which is consistent  with the reported inherent flexibility of the TCR CDR loops being  stabilized after pMHC ligation.
The biological outcome of TCR  engagement is considered to be related to the half-life and heat  capacity changes of the complex1922.
  To probe the nature of the TCR-pMHC engagement further, alaninescanning mutagenesis has been done in three systems: the MHC  class Irestricted mouse 2C system23,24, the MHC class II I-Ek-2B4  (ref. 25) and the MHC class Irestricted A6 TCR26.
The 2C system  involved substitutions in the TCR, whereas the other two systems  involved substitutions in the pMHC.
The 2C studies showed that  although residues in each Va and Vb CDR are important for binding,  the most important energetic interaction is contributed by CDR1  and CDR2 (refs.
23,24).
Studies of the I-Ekmoth cytochrome C  system suggested a two-step mechanism for TCR recognition of the  pMHC complex, whereby MHC contacts dictate the initial association, followed by peptide-mediated contacts dominating stabilization  of the TCR-pMHC complex25.
Mutational studies of the A6 TCR  system showed a small region or hotspot of the a1 helix that  provides most of the interactions vital for TCR recognition26.
Biophysical and structural data suggest that relatively rigid CDR1 and  CDR2 loops are principally involved in stabilizing the initial association, whereas the malleable CDR3 loops stabilize the peptide contacts,  enabling T cell triggering25,26.

  NATURE IMMUNOLOGY VOLUME 6 NUMBER 2 FEBRUARY 2005 171  ARTICLES   2005 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/natureimmunologyAlthough the potential repertoire of TCRs is vast27, some immune  responses, for example the immune response to Epstein-Barr virus  (EBV), show strong biases in TCR selection2830.
Unrelated people  with HLA-B8+ (B*0801) all make an immunodominant cytotoxic T  lymphocyte response to the peptide FLRGRAYGL (FLR) derived from  the latent EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA3)28.
Structural analyses of T cell  immunodominance in the immune response to infection with EBV13  or influenza14 have demonstrated the unique molecular properties of  the immunodominant TCRs that confer specificity.
However, the  energetic contribution of the structural elements that govern the  immunodominant TCR-pMHC interaction was not clear from those  studies.
To determine whether the emerging rules of engagement in  TCR-pMHC interactions apply to an immunodominant TCR, we  undertook binding studies and accompanying biochemical analyses of  39 mutants of the immunodominant TCR LC13, which recognizes  FLRHLA-B8.
Our data show that residues in strictly conserved  germline- and nongermline-encoded regions of the CDR3 loops  dictate the stabilization of the complex.
Thus, the energetic basis of  TCR-pMHC interaction for this immunodominant TCR differs from  that previously noted and demonstrates plasticity in the energetic  contribution of the CDRs in TCR-pMHC ligation.
  RESULTS  Rational selection and characterization of LC13 mutants  Crystal structures of the LC13 TCR and FLRHLA-B8 alone and in  complex have provided detailed insight into the structural basis of  recognition13,31,32.
However, those data did not indicate which LC13  TCR residues make crucial energetic contributions to binding.
Therefore, we targeted LC13 TCR residues for substitution based on the  previously determined crystal structures13,32.
We targeted for mutagenesis the residues in the LC13 TCR that interacted with the FLR  HLA-B8 or that underwent conformational change after ligation or  were exposed to solvent on a CDR loop.
Accordingly, apart from two  framework residues (His33a and His48a) that were involved in  binding to the FLRHLA-B8 complex, all substitutions were restricted  to the CDR loops of the LC13 TCR.
In total, 40 amino acids were  substituted to an alanine, with the exception of alanine residues, which  were substituted to glycine.
The altered LC13 TCR residues were as  follows: in CDR1a, Ser25, Thr26, Ser28, Thr30, Asp30A and Tyr31; in  CDR2a, Leu50, Thr51, Ser52 and Asn54; in CDR3a, Pro93, Leu94,  Ala95, Gly96, Gly97, Thr98, Ser99, Tyr100, Gly102, Lys103 and  Leu104; in CDR1b, Ser27, Gly28, Val30 and Ser31; in CDR2b,  Gln50, Asn51 and Glu52; and in CDR3b, Ser94, Ser95, Leu96, Gly 97,  Gln98, Ala99, Tyr100, Glu105, Gln106 and Tyr107 and the two  framework residues, His33a and His48a.
Of the 40 recombinant  receptors with different single-residue substitutions, only one,  Leu104aAla (VaLeu104 ! Ala104), did not express and refold.
  We verified the structural integrity of the refolded LC13 TCR  mutants in two ways.
First, we compared the solubility, yield and  chromatographic activity of each receptor mutant with that of the  native, refolded LC13 TCR.
Second, we tested the reactivity of all  receptors to an LC13 TCR monoclonal antibody (mAb; specificity,  Supplementary Figs. 13 online).
Compared directly with the native  LC13 TCR, all mutant proteins, except for His33aAla and Ser52aAla,  had overlapping gel filtration and ion-exchange profiles and identical  motilities by reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE.
Moreover, all the  mutant proteins reacted strongly with the LC13 mAb as did the wildtype TCR (data not shown).
The yields of the purified, refolded LC13  TCR mutant proteins were also comparable to that of the typical yield  of the native LC13 TCR, with 24 LC13 TCR mutants showing a similar  recovery (more than 75%).
Ten mutant proteins produced a moderate  recovery (4075%) and six LC13 TCR mutant proteins gave a  relatively low yield (less than 40%), with the lowest recovery being  that of 22% for the Gln50bAla mutant.
However, we obtained  sufficient quantities for the low-yielding LC13 TCR mutants for  detailed surface plasmon resonance analyses.
For all the mutant  LC13 TCRs that were folded, none had a stability problem, as assessed  by mAb reactivity (data not shown).
  Surface plasmon resonance studies of the LC13 mutants  We assayed the alanine substitutions for binding to recombinant FLR  HLA-B8 using surface plasmon resonance.
Measurements for the  LC13FLRHLA-B8 interaction yielded the following values: equilibrium binding constant (Kdeq), 12.53 mM; kinetic binding constant  (Kdcalc), 12.30 mM; association constant (Kass), 34,755 per molar per  second; and dissociation constant (Kdiss), 0.39 per second (Fig. 1 and  Table 1).
Using the same technique, we measured the affinity of the  LC13 TCR for an antagonist complex (FLRGRFYGL-HLA-B8, where  P7Y is substituted with F (underlined)) as 138 mM and for a weak  agonist complex (FLRGRAFGL-HLA-B8) as 113 mM (data not shown).
  Given that the FLRGRFYGL-HLA-B8 antagonist complex had a  change in free energy (DDG) of 1.42 kcal/mol and the FLRGRAFGLHLA-B8 weak agonist complex had a DDG value of 1.33 kcal/mol  (data not shown), these values emphasize the small energetic  20 30 40 50 60  Time (s)  0 10  50  0  50  100  150  200  250  Response (RU)  Response (RU)  LC13 D30a  LC13 G96  LC13 WT  20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140  50  0  50  100  150  200  250  Time (s)  1.8 M  3.2 M  5.6 M  10.0 M  17.8 M  31.6 M  56.2 M  0 6.0 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60  LC13 (M)  200  150  100  50  0  Response (RU)  a b  Figure 1 Binding analysis of LC13 TCR Ala point mutants to FLRHLA-B8 by surface plasmon resonance.

  We determined the Kdeq of the interaction  for the 39 LC13 TCR substitutions (Figs. 1  and 2, Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 13  online) and measured the kinetic rate constants of the interaction for approximately  half of the LC13 TCR mutants that had a Kdeq  of less than 100 mM (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 13 online).
No mutant had a  Kdeq of between 100 and 200 mM. However,  we recorded many Kdeq values above 200 mM  (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 13  online).
We consider a Kdeq above 200 mM  as approaching the upper limit of reasonably  accurate estimations for affinity in this system and so we designated any Kdeq value for  the LC13 mutants above 200 mM as being  greater than 200 mM. In all cases, the Kd  calculated from the kinetic data matched  the Kd estimated from the equilibrium data,  emphasizing the internal consistency of the  data and indicating that that there were no  mass transport effects at the concentration of  the reagents used.
We considered the substitutions as having a small effect on the interaction if the Kdeq for the mutant was less than  twofold, an intermediate effect if the Kdeq for  the mutant was between two and fourfold, and a notable effect if the  Kdeq was more than fourfold compared with the Kdeq of the native  LC13-FLRHLA-B8 interaction (Table 1 and Fig. 2).
  Structural perspectives  Structures have been determined to a resolution of 1.8 A for nonliganded FLRHLA-B8 (ref. 31), to a resolution of 1.5 A for nonliganded LC13 TCR32 and to a resolution of 2.5 A in complex with  FLRHLA-B8 (ref. 13).
After ligation, the buried surface area (BSA) of  the LC13 TCR was approximately 1,100 A 2 with the CDR1a, CDR2a,  CDR3a and CDR3b loops undergoing considerable conformational  changes.
All the CDR loops of the LC13 TCR were in contact with  FLRHLA-B8, with the CDR1b loop contributing 4% BSA (1%  contacts); CDR1a, 17% BSA (15% contacts); CDR2a, 17% BSA  (4% contacts); CDR2b loops, 17% BSA (17% contacts); CDR3b  loop, 21% BSA (37% contacts); and CDR3a loop, 24% BSA (25%  contacts) at the interface.
In the complex with ligand, four residues  from CDR1a and no residues from CDR2a interacted with CDR3a;  whereas three residues from CDR1b and no residues from CDR2b  interacted with CDR3b.
  Effect of CDR1b mutants  Given that CDR1b interacts marginally with FLRHLA-B8, it was not  unexpected that three of the four substituted residues in CDR1b had  little effect on recognition (Table 1 and Fig. 3a).
However, the  Ser31bAla substitution had a considerable effect on the interaction  (DDG, 1.06 kcal/mol).
At first, this result seemed to represent an  anomaly; the Ser31b side chain formed one van der Waals contact,  with a residue on the a1 helix of HLA-B8 (Fig. 3a), yet substitution of  this residue to Ala resulted in a substantial reduction in affinity  (Table 1).
Although the CDR1b loop did not change conformation  after binding to FLRHLA-B8, the CDR3b loop was repositioned such  that it then was in contact with the CDR1b loop.
The only contact  formed between CDR1b and CDR3b loops was mediated through the  Ser31bOg group, where it formed hydrogen bonds onto Gln98bN of  the CDR3b loop (Fig. 3a).
Accordingly, the structural and surface  plasmon resonance data suggest that Ser31b is essential in stabilizing  the ligated conformation of the CDR3b loop.
This finding supports  observations made with the 2C TCR, for which CDR1b residues that  were not in contact with antigen still contributed substantially to  binding energy through stabilization of the CDR3b loop23.
  Effect of CDR1a mutants  The CDR1a loop interacted at discrete sites on the FLRHLA-B8  complex, contacting Arg62 of the a1 helix and a stretch of the a2 helix  (residues 151155) as well as the antigenic peptide (Fig. 3b).
Three of  the six LC13 TCR mutants in the CDR1a loop had a small effect on  the recognition of FLRHLA-B8 (Table 1 and Fig. 3b).
The Ser25a  and Thr26a side chains did not contact FLRHLA-B8 and so their  negligible effect on ligand recognition was predicted.
However, Ser28a  formed hydrogen bonds to Arg62 (Fig. 3b) and, given the apparent  importance of the polymorphic Arg62 residue in ligating the CDR1a  loop in all known TCR complexes33, it was unexpected that the  Ser28aAla replacement had little effect on recognition (Table 1).
  However, Arg62 also formed a water-mediated hydrogen bond with  the Thr26a main chain (Fig. 3b) and so we could not conclusively rule  out a precise energetic function for Arg62 ligation here.
Although  Tyr31a formed van der Waals contacts with the aromatic ring of the  P7-Tyr (FLR peptide residue 7) that is essential to the specificity of the  LC13 TCR and also formed hydrogen bonds onto HLA-B8 (Fig. 3b),  the Tyr31aAla substitution had only a moderate effect on ligand  recognition (Fig. 2 and Table 1).
Conversely, neither the Thr30a nor  the Asp30Aa side chains interacted with FLRHLA-B8, yet the  Thr30aAla substitution had a moderate effect on recognition, whereas  the Asp30AaAla substitution had a profound effect on recognition  (Table 1 and Fig. 2).

  174 VOLUME 6 NUMBER 2 FEBRUARY 2005 NATURE IMMUNOLOGY  ARTICLES   2005 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/natureimmunologysubstitutions was apparent when we compared the non-liganded and  liganded conformations of the LC13 TCR (Fig. 3b).
In the nonliganded state, the CDR1a loop did not interact with the other CDR  loops; however, after binding, the CDR3a loop shifted forward and  contacted residues 2832 of the CDR1a loop (Fig. 3b).
The Thr30a  and Asp30Aa residues were the sole residues from the CDR1a loop  that mediated contacts with the ligated CDR3a loop, with Thr30a  forming hydrogen bonds to Gly96aO and Asp30Aa forming hydrogen  bonds onto the main chain of Ala95a and Gly96a (Fig. 3b).
Thus, the  CDR1a loop is essential in stabilizing the conformation of the ligated  CDR3a loop, analogous to the function of CDR1b in stabilizing  CDR3b discussed above.
  Effect of CDR2b mutants  The CDR2b loop contained many polar side chains (Gln50b, Asn51b  and Glu52b) that interacted extensively with a localized stretch of the  HLA-B8 a1 helix (residues 7279; Fig. 3c).
Nevertheless, substitutions  in the CDR2b loop had a modest effect on recognition.
For example,  despite the fact that Gln50b formed two hydrogen bonds with HLAB8, the Gln50bAla mutant showed a small change in DDG (Fig. 3c  and Table 1).
Moreover, the Asn51bAla substitution improved the  affinity of the interaction (discussed later).
The Glu52bAla substitution, which would disrupt the only salt bridge at the interface, did have  a moderate effect on the interaction (Table 1).
To form the Glu52bArg79 interaction after TCR ligation, Arg79 has to break a salt bridge  with Glu89 of HLA-B8, and this may have offset the favorable  energetic contribution normally associated with salt bridge formation  (Fig. 3c).
Collectively, the energetic contribution of the CDR2b loop  was unexpectedly small.
  Effect of CDR2a mutants  Three of the four residues that were substituted in the CDR2a loop  (Thr51a, Ser52a and Asn54a) were not in contact with the antigen,  with Thr51a and Asn54a minimally affecting recognition (Table 1 and  Q98  Y100  L94  H33  H48  Y31  P7-Tyr  T69  L94 G97  T98  A95 S99  Y100  P93  K103  CDR3  CDR3  CDR2  CDR1  CDR3  CDR3  CDR3 CDR2  CDR1  CDR1  CDR3  L104  E89 R79  E76  Q50 N51  E52  V30  G28  S27  S31  S25

3d).
In contrast, the Ser52aAla showed a moderate effect on  recognition, which seems to correspond to a function for Ser52a in  stabilizing the conformation of the CDR2b loop in the state without  ligand formation (Table 1 and Fig. 2).
The Leu50aAla substitution had  a considerable effect on the interaction with FLRHLA-B8 (Fig. 2).
  Leu50a interacted directly with HLA-B8; however, the effect of this  Leu50aAla substitution was disproportional to the extent of contact, as  it formed only a single van der Waals interaction with HLA-B8  (Leu50aCd2 interacted with Ala158Cb; Fig. 3d).
The structural analyses  suggest that Leu50a has a principal function in stabilizing the ligated  conformation of the CDR1a loop, where it makes van der Waals  contacts with the main chains of the CDR1a C-terminal residues  (Gly29a, Thr30a and Asp30Aa), as well as the side chain of Tyr31a.
  Effect of CDR3a mutants  We made 11 substitutions in the CDR3a loop in the region  between Pro93a and Leu104a, the two residues that defined the  pivot points of conformational change that occurred in this loop  after ligation (Table 1 and Fig. 3e).
The Leu104aAla mutant could not  be refolded, emphasizing the important structural function this  residue has in LC13 TCR stability.
Eight of the ten substitutions had  a profound effect on recognition (Table 1 and Figs. 2 and 3e).
  The side chains of Leu94a, Thr98a and Tyr100a were in contact  with FLRHLA-B8 and the substantial effect of their substitutions  was directly related to a loss of specificity-governing interactions  (Fig. 3e).
Ala95a and Gly96a, whose substitutions had a moderate  effect on recognition, mediated the interactions with the ligated  CDR1a loop and thereby stabilized the conformation of the  ligated CDR3a loop.
The Gly96a residue was also in contact with  antigen (along with Gly97a), so some of the effect of these substitutions must also reflect this function.
The CDR3a loop contains three  Gly residues, suggesting that structural plasticity of the CDR3a loop is  essential for antigen recognition.
Pro93a is a nongermline-encoded  residue that does not contact the antigen, yet, as judged by the effect of  the Pro93aAla substitution (Table 1), seems to represent a critical  residue that controls the conformational dynamics of the CDR3a  loop.
Similarly, the effect of the Ser99aAla substitution showed that  Ser99a, which formed hydrogen bonds onto Gly96aN, was important  in stabilizing the conformation of the CDR3a loop in the unliganded  state (data not shown).
The effect of the Lys103aAla substitution  suggests that Lys103a, which participates in intersubunit interactions,  is essential in stabilizing the Va-Vb interface.
Our data establish  that the CDR3a loop, which interacts mainly with the a1-helix of  HLA-B8, has an essential function in the energetics of recognition of  the FLRHLA-B8 complex.
  Effect of CDR3b mutants  The CDR3b loop is the principal loop of the immunodominant TCR  that interacts with the FLR peptide.
We made ten substitutions in the  CDR3b loop and of these substitutions, five (Gly97bAla, Gln98bAla,  Ala99bGly, Tyr100bAla and Gln106bAla; Table 1 and Fig. 3f) had  a profound effect on recognition (DDG 4 1.64 kcal/mol).
Ser95b,  Glu105b and Tyr107b neither contact FLRHLA-B8 nor change  conformation after ligation13, so their substitution had a negligible  effect on recognition (Fig. 3e).
Although Leu96b was in contact with  the heavy chain of HLA-B8, results with the Leu96bAla substitution  suggested that Leu96b was not essential in the energetics of recognition.
However, Ala99b and Tyr100b formed direct contacts with the  P7-Tyr group, and the effect of their substitutions demonstrated a  correspondingly essential energetic function in the interaction  (Table 1 and Fig. 3f).
Similarly, the residue Gln98b, encoded by the  DbN region, participated in interactions with Va, the peptide and the  HLA-B8 heavy chain and this was reflected in the substantial contribution of this amino acid to the energetics of antigen recognition.
  The CDR3b loop was essential in recognition of the FLRHLA-B8  complex (Table 1 and Fig. 2).
  Effect of Va framework residues  In addition to the substitutions in the CDR regions, we targeted two  substitutions (His33aAla and His48aAla), as these amino acids are  part of the germline-encoded Va (TRAV26-2*01) that is highly  selected in unrelated, EBV+ people who express HLA-B8.
These two  residues, located deep in the central pocket of LC13, formed watermediated hydrogen bonds with the P7-Tyr from the peptide13  (Fig. 3g).
The importance of these water-mediated hydrogen bonds  is suggested by the 90% loss of T cell activation after P7-TyrtoPhe  substitution of FLRGRAFGL13 and a corresponding 90% loss in  the affinity of the LC13 TCR for this HLA-B8-peptide complex  (data not shown).
Consistent with these observations, both of these  substitutions had a profound effect on recognition, confirming  the importance of these residues in the selection of the LC13  immunodominant TCR.
  Natural sequence variation in LC13 TCR  To further examine the energetic landscape of binding of LC13 to  FLRHLA-B8, we evaluated the natural sequence variation in the  LC13-like TCRs of two healthy, EBV+, HLA-B8+ donors (Fig. 4) as  well as those reported in the literature34,35 (Supplementary Figs. 13  online).
We stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from each  donor with the FLR peptide in vitro for 10 d and sorted the  responding CD8+ T cells with mAb specific for the BV7-8 Vb used  Figure 5 The LC13 TCR and HLA-B8 hotspot.

We then cloned and sequenced PCR products from  BV7-8 and TRAV26-2 transcripts.
In the first donor, all genes encoding TCRa and TCRb, including diversity (D), joining (J) and  untemplated (N)region sequences, were identical to the LC13 TCR  clonotype; that is, immunodominant in unrelated people (the public;  data not shown).
In the second donor (Fig. 4), although we found  multiple codon substitutions in the D-, J- and N-region junctional  sequences, with few exceptions, these preserved the CDR3a residues  Pro93 (three codons) and Leu94 (five codons) shown by mutagenesis  to be essential for ligand binding.
The only naturally tolerated  substitution in CDR3a was Ala95Gln, found in a single clone  (Fig. 4).
Ala95Ser has also been reported in this public TCR34  (Fig. 4).
Ala95a mediates interactions with the ligated CDR1a loop,  stabilizing the ligated CDR3a loop, consistent with a moderate effect  on recognition by the in vitroaltered TCR.
Presumably other residues  at this position can also serve this function, allowing some natural  variation at this site.
  In the junctional regions of TCRb clones from donor 2 and other  published sequences34,35, the residues Gly97 (three codons), Gln98  (two codons) and Ala99 (three codons) were all conserved despite  multiple codon usage.
However the N-region residue 96 contained  two alternate residues, Leu96Ile and Leu96Ser, in just under half the  clones.
CDR3b Leu96 was in contact with the heavy chain of HLA-B8,  but natural variation at this site is predicted because the Leu96Ala  mutant is a minor contributor to the energetics of recognition.
Thus,  the natural CD8+ T cell repertoire toward FLRHLA-B8 reflects the  stringent conservation of residues that make important contributions  to ligand binding and the natural variants of the receptor that do  retain specificity confirm the location of receptor hotspots and cold  spots defined by the mutagenesis approach.
  The hotspots of interaction  Having defined the LC13 TCR residues that contact FLRHLA-B8,  and the effect of altering these residues (Fig. 5a), we were able to  approximate a corresponding hotspot on the FLRHLA-B8 complex.
  This hotspot covered the CDR3a and CDR3bbinding site only,  mapping onto the P6-P8 positions of the peptide, as well as residues  Gln65, Ile66, Thr69 and Gln72 from the HLA-B8 a1 helix,  and residues Lys146, Ala150 and Gln155 from the a2 helix of  HLA-B8 (Fig. 5b).
  Kinetics of TCR-pMHC interaction  We determined the association and dissociation rate constants for  the native LC13 TCRFLRHLA-B8 interaction (Table 1 and  Supplementary Figs. 13 online).
We attempted a phi (f) analysis25  (an approach that allows initial stabilization contributions to be  ascertained) on this LC13 TCR data set; however, the extensive  conformational change in the LC13 TCR meant that most of the f  values were outside the expected range and therefore were not valid25.
  We were able to assess the effect of 17 LC13 TCR mutants on the  kinetic rate constants of the interaction (Table 1).
All substitutions on  the CDR2a loop for which we determined kinetic constants considerably increased the half-life (calculated as 0.693/Kdiss) of the interaction  (Thr51aAla, t1/2  3.09 s; Ser52aAla, t1/2  2.84 s; Asn54aAla,  t1/2  2.37 s).
In addition, the Asn51bAla substitution and the  Ser95bAla substitution substantially increased the half-life of the  interaction (Asn51bAla, t1/2  3.62 s; Ser95bAla, t1/2  4.52 s).
  None of the measured mutants notably increased the association  rates, whereas many mutants substantially decreased (Thr30aAla,  His48aAla and Ser52aAla) or moderately decreased (Asn51bAla,  Ser94bAla, Leu96bAla, Glu105bAla and Tyr107bAla) the association  rates (Table 1).
The His48aAla substitution had a particularly profound effect, with a 84.5% decrease in the on rate and a much less  substantial change in the off rate.
Of these substitutions, the side  chains of His48a, Asn51b and Leu96b interacted directly with  FLRHLA-B8 complex.
  Some of the Ala substitutions led to a moderate improvement in  affinity for this interaction (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 13  online), as has been reported in previous mutagenesis studies of  2C36,37.
The Ser95bAla substitution had the most notable effect  (Table 1).
Ser95b is located in a part of the CDR3b loop that  does not interact with antigen, but forms a hydrogen bond internal  to this loop.
The positive effect of this substitution suggests the loss  of this intraloop hydrogen bond improves the flexibility of the  CDR3b loop, which seems to promote the interaction with FLR  HLA-B8.
Similarly, Thr51a did not interact with FLRHLA-B8,  yet the Thr51aAla substitution improved the affinity of the interaction, suggesting that the conformational plasticity noted in the  CDR2a loop after ligation is an important facet in recognition  (Fig. 3d).
Asn51b formed hydrogen bonds to Arg79 of  HLA-B8 (Fig. 3c), yet the Asn51bAla substitution enhanced the  interaction with FLRHLA-B8, suggesting that the removal of  Asn51b may remove the necessity of breaking the Arg79-Glu89 salt  bridge (Fig. 3c).
Collectively, this suggests that the affinity-improving  substitutions exert their effects through reducing the steric constraints  on binding.
  DISCUSSION  The phenomenon of T cell immunodominance has been reported  in the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to many different viral  infections3844.
Although we have provided a structural basis  for T cell immunodominance against the EBV peptide FLR28,39, our  studies did not demonstrate the energetic landscape underlying this  phenomenon.
We have described here a systematic scanning mutagenesis study of a TCR-pMHC system in which the precise structural  components have been defined in their liganded and non-liganded  states.
The question arises as to whether each of the V(D)J gene  segments and N regions exclusively selected in the immunodominant  LC13 TCR share the energetic load of recognition through a  large number of weak contacts across the interface or if there is an  energetic interaction hotspot45.
The idea of an energetic hotspot is  also consistent with previous studies of TCR-pMHC recognition23,25,26.
If an energetic hotspot dictates the LC13 TCRFLR  HLA-B8 interaction, where would it be located and what then drives  the salient sequence conservation in the six CDR loops of the  LC13 TCR?
Our data have established that there is indeed a hotspot,  but unexpectedly it is in the CDR3a and CDR3b loops, whereas  the exclusively germline-encoded CDR1 and CDR2 loops have a  minor energetic function in the interaction with FLRHLA-B8.
The  sum energetic contribution from each CDR loop is as follows (in  descending order): CDR3a, 12.98 kcal/mol; CDR3b, 8.38 kcal/mol;  CDR1a, 2.99 kcal/mol; CDR2a, 1.54 kcal/mol; CDR1b 1.09; CDR2b,  0.32 kcal/mol.
These data contrast with the energetic landscape  of the 2C TCR, for which the most substantial energetic contribution  to the interaction arises from the CDR1 and CDR2 loops23.
The  diminished energetic function of the CDR3 loops in the 2C TCR  may be attributable, in part, to their shorter CDR3 loop lengths  and Gly-rich composition compared with that of the LC13 TCR.
  Unlike the 2C TCR, for which both CDR3 loops interact with the  peptide, there is a notable division of functions between the LC13  TCR CDR3 loops, whereby the CDR3a loop is involved principally in  NATURE IMMUNOLOGY VOLUME 6 NUMBER 2 FEBRUARY 2005 177  ARTICLES   2005 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/natureimmunologyinteracting with the HLA-B8 heavy chain and the CDR3b loop  interacts with the peptide.
To assume these differing functions, both  CDR3 loops of the LC13 TCR undergo large-scale conformational  changes that focus the energetic hotspot to the central region of the  LC13 TCR.
In these CDR3 loops, most residues are critically important in specificity-determining interactions and in mediating conformational change.
  To accommodate the CDR3 conformational change that occurs  after ligation of FLRHLA-B8, a concerted movement of the CDR1a  and CDR2a loops is essential13.
The largest energetic function  attributable to the CDR1a loop lies in stabilizing the ligated  CDR3a loop.
Similarly, the CDR1b loop, which has a smaller function  in directly interacting with the antigen, is critical in stabilizing  the ligated conformation of the CDR3b loop.
Moreover, our data  suggest that conformational change in the CDR2a loop after ligation  assists in the remolding of the CDR1a and CDR3a loops rather than  making a direct specificity contribution to binding.
Unexpectedly, the  CDR2b loop, despite forming multiple ionic interactions within a  localized stretch on the HLA-B8 a1-helix, had the least energetic  function of the CDR loops at the interface.
This observation is  consistent with the location of the CDR2b loop at the periphery of  the interface, whereby the need to break polar bonds offsets the  contribution of bond formation.
Conversely, Tyr100b from the  CDR3b loop and the two framework residues encoded by the Va  gene, His33a and His48a all have an essential energetic function in  recognition of the P7-Tyr.
  The FLRHLA-B8 hotspot is much more extensive than that  noted before in studies of HLA-A2 (refs. 26, 46, 47).
The HLA-A2  hotspot corresponds with the HLA-B8 hotspot, despite polymorphism  between these alleles at a1 helix residues 65 and 66.
Defining  the HLA-B8 hotspot also represents an important step toward  understanding the alloreactivity of the LC13 TCR to HLA-B*4402.
  Of the 31 amino acid polymorphisms between HLA-B*0801 and HLA  B*4402, six map to the antigen surface; four, onto the a1 helix  (residues 80, 81, 82 and 83); and two, onto the a2 helix (residues  163 and 167).
None of these residues is involved in LC13 TCR ligation  of HLA B8-FLRGRAYGL, and the remaining polymorphisms are  buried.
This indicates that LC13 TCR binds HLA-B*4402 (refs.
48, 49)  in a way similar to HLA-B8.
Thus, the sequence of the allopeptide  ligand is likely to be a critical determinant of the HLA B*4402  alloreactivity, whereas the main contribution of CDR3a to binding  the HLA a1 helix is also a potential conserved hotspot for alloreactivity.
Our studies have shown how the TCR interaction can vary its  structural focus between the peptide antigen and the HLA heavy  chain, depending on the available array of solvent-exposed side chains.
  Thus, the MHC has more extensive involvement in TCR stabilization  when there is lack of prominently exposed peptide residues to contact  the TCR.
  Given that the CDR1 and CDR2 loops contribute minimal energy  to the direct interaction with FLRHLA-B8, a two-step mechanism in  TCR recognition is not consistent with our results.
One of the great  mysteries of T cell recognition is that even though the TCR is  immunoglobulin like, antigen recognition is highly restricted to  pMHC ligands.
This might be explained if TCRs have a rudimentary  scanning function, as suggested by the observation that MHC class I  and class II restriction correlates with particular sequences in the TCR  CDR1 and CDR 2 regions5054, although exceptions to these patterns  are reported36.
However, the germline-encoded CDR1 and CDR2  loops of the LC13 TCR have a minimal energetic function in  recognizing the FLRHLA-B8 complex.
Thus, the energetic burden  of different CDR loops in TCR-pMHC interaction apparently shifts  according to the nature of the ligand, emphasizing TCR adaptability  in recognizing diverse ligands.
This is consistent with the idea that  the TCR footprint shifts between conserved residues in different  pMHC complexes55.
  What are the energetic principles governing the positive selection of  the LC13 TCR?
The nongermline-encoded regions of the LC13 TCR  CDR3 loops have prominent functions in recognition.
Thus, it is  possible that the nongermline-encoded regions of the TCR may have a  function that is as important as that of the germline regions in  dictating TCR recognition and immunodominance in selection of  the T cell repertoire.
Some somatic alterations in antibodies that  improve the affinity for the antigen also stabilize CDR loop conformation rather than directly contacting the antigen itself 56.
Thus,  the evolution of antibody maturation seems to mirror the evolution of  TCR recognition, which for this particular immunodominant TCR  has been raised to combat the ancient EBV.
  METHODS  Construction of LC13 mutants.
In total, 40 amino acids were substituted  to Ala, except for Ala residues, which were substituted to Gly.
The original  LC13 human T cell clone was prepared as described57 and was used as the  template to generate the forty LC13 mutants by site-directed mutagenesis  (QuikChange; Stratagene).
  Expression and purification of recombinant proteins.
Soluble FLRHLA-B8  complex was prepared from Escherichia coli as described57.
The refolded  complexes were concentrated and purified by anion exchange and gel filtration  chromatography.
The a- and b-chains of the LC13 TCR were expressed in  BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells, refolded from inclusion bodies and purified as  described57.
The structural integrity of the refolded proteins was confirmed  by the apparent molecular weight of the protein after size-exclusion chromatography and by SDS-PAGE.
  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mAbs reactive against  LC13 TCR.
Two mAbs reactive to LC13 were generated in-house (description,  Supplementary Figs. 13 online) and were used to probe the native conformation of recombinant TCRs in a capture ELISA assay.
The mAb 12H8  (IgG, to Ca; 100 ml at a concentration of 10 mg/ml) was used to coat 96-well  ELISA plates (U96 Maxisorp, Nunc) at 4 1C for 16 h before blocking at 37 1C  for 1 h with 200 ml of 1% BSA in PBS.
Positive control wild-type LC13, the  mutant LC13 TCRs or the negative control TCR CF34 were then added to  the wells for 1 h in triplicate at a concentration of 10, 1, 0.1 or 0.01 mg/ml.
The  biotinylated mAb 13G11 (IgG, to LC13 Vb) was then added at a concentration  of 1 mg/ml and bound mAb was detected with horseradish peroxidase  conjugated antibody to mouse immunoglobulin (Silenus).
Reaction with the  substrate O-phenylenediamine substrate (Sigma) was terminated with HCl,  and ELISA plates were read at 492 nm on a Labsystems Multiscan ELISA  plate reader.
  Surface plasmon resonance measurements and analysis.
All surface plasmon  resonance experiments were done at 25 1C on a Biacore 3000 instrument with  HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 0.005% surfactant  P20 supplied by the manufacturer) supplemented with 1% BSA to inhibit  nonspecific binding.
The antibody W6/32 (ref. 58) was coupled in 10 mM citric  acid, pH 5.0, to research grade CM5 chips with standard amine coupling at  9,00011,000 resonance units (RU).
For each experiment, 200400 RU of the  FLRHLA-B8 was captured to the antibody.
LC13 wild-type and mutants were  injected over all flow cells at a rate of 20 ml/min or more.
The final response was  calculated by subtraction of the response of the antibody alone from that of the  antibodyHLA-B8 complex.
The antibody surface was regenerated between  each analyte injection with ActiSep (Sterogene).
All measurements were  minimally in duplicate, and where the replicates were not consistent, the  measurements were repeated.
All mutants were originally tested in a concentration range of 156.2 mM; if the binding was too weak, the concentration  range was increased to 50200 mM. BIAevaluation Version 3.1 (Biacore AB) was  178 VOLUME 6 NUMBER 2 FEBRUARY 2005 NATURE IMMUNOLOGY  ARTICLES   2005 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/natureimmunologyused for all data analysis; the 1:1 Langmuir binding model, allowing for local  fitting of the binding maximum, was used to calculate the kinetic constants.
To  allow for the capture system, the model was modified to include an additional  parameter for the drifting baseline and local fitting of the binding maxima.
The  Kdcalc (Kdiss/Kass) concurred with the Kdeq for all reported values.
  Generation of bulk T cell cultures, sorting and TCR gene sequencing.
Shortterm cytotoxic T lymphocyte bulk cultures from two EBV+, HLA-B8+ donors  were generated by culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (2  106 per  2-ml well) in growth medium with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear  cells that had been precoated with FLR peptide (1 mM for 1 h; responder:-  stimulator ratio, 2:1).
On days 3 and 7, cultures were supplemented with  recombinant interleukin 2 (20 U/ml) before sorting on day 10 with either  FLRHLA-B8Rphycoerythrin tetramer or FLRHLA-B8Rphycoerythrin  pentamer (ProImmune) or mAb 13G11 (data not shown) specific for the  BV7-2 (TCR b-chain) expressed by LC13.
Cells were labeled with CD8tricolor  (Caltag) and CD3-allophycocyanin (BD Pharmingen) and were sorted on a  MoFlo apparatus (Cytomation).
  Total RNA was extracted from bulk cultures with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).
Reverse transcription was done with Superscript III (Invitrogen) and  antisense TCRa and TCRb chain primers59.
PCR used a 25-ml volume containing 200 mM dNTPs, 20 mM MgCl2 and 1.25 U of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied  Biosystems) with a TCRa constant region primer and TRAV26 familyspecific  primer, or a TCRb constant region primer and a TRBV6 familyspecific  primer59.
PCR products were purified and cloned into the pGEM-T vector  system (Promega) and were sequenced with the ABI PRISM Big Dye Termination Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems).
