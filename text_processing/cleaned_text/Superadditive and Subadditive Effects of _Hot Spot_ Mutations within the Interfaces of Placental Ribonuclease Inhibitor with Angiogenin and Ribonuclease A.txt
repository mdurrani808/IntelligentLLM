Superadditive and Subadditive Effects of Hot Spot Mutations within the  Interfaces of Placental Ribonuclease Inhibitor with Angiogenin and Ribonuclease A  Chang-Zheng Chen, and Robert Shapiro*,,|  Center for Biochemical and Biophysical Sciences and Medicine and Department of Pathology, HarVard Medical School,  Boston, Massachusetts 02115  ReceiVed April 1, 1999  ABSTRACT: Previous single-site mutagenesis studies on the complexes of ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) with  angiogenin (Ang) and RNase A suggested that in both cases a substantial fraction of the binding energy  is concentrated within one small part of the crystallographically observed interface, involving RI residues  434-438.
Such energetic hot spots are common in protein-protein complexes, but their physical meaning  is generally unclear.
Here we have investigated this question by examining the detailed interactions within  the RIligand hot spots and the extent to which they function independently.
The effects of Phe versus  Ala substitutions show that the key residue Tyr434 interacts with both ligands primarily through its phenyl  ring; for Tyr437, the OH group forms the important contacts with RNase A, whereas the phenyl group  interacts with Ang.
Kinetic characterization of complexes containing multiple substitutions reveals striking,  but distinctive, cooperativity in the interactions of RI with the two ligands.
The losses in binding energy  for the RNase complex associated with replacements of Tyr434 and Asp435, and Tyr434 and Tyr437, are  markedly less than additive (i.e., by 2.4 and 1.3 kcal/mol, respectively).
In contrast, the energetic effects  of the 434 and 435, and 434 and 437, substitution pairs on binding of Ang are fully additive and 2.5  kcal/mol beyond additive, respectively.
Superadditivities (0.9-2.4 kcal/mol) are also observed for several  multisite replacements involving these inhibitor residues and two Ang residues, Arg5 and Lys40, from  this part of the interface.
Consequently, the decreases in binding energy for some triple-variant complexes  are as large as 8.5-10.1 kcal/mol (compared to a total G of -21.0 kcal/mol for the wild-type complex).
  Potential explanations for these functional couplings, many of which occur over distances of >13  and  are not mediated by direct or triangulated contacts, are proposed.
These findings show that the basis for  the generation of hot spots can be complex, and that these sites can assume significantly more (as with  Ang) or less (as with RNase) importance than indicated from the effects of single-site mutations.
  The formation of tight, specific complexes between  heterologous proteins is critical for most biological processes.
  The physicochemical basis for this molecular recognition has  been investigated extensively in recent years, and substantial  progress has been made (see refs 1-4).
Nonetheless, a  predictive understanding of protein-protein interactions has  not yet been achieved.
The limits of our comprehension are  perhaps most evident in those instances (some 20 to date;  see the list in ref 5) where binding epitopes have been defined  both by crystallography and by detailed mutational studies.
  The structural epitopes in these complexes are invariably  large and include 10-33 residues from multiple discontinuous segments on each protein.
However, the functional  epitopes assigned by mutagenesis are usually more restricted;  replacements of a small number of amino acids (typically  two to five on each protein) weaken the complex dramatically, and substitutions of most other interface residues,  including many which appear to form highly favorable  contacts, produce little or no loss in binding affinity.
  No reliable method has been devised to pinpoint these  energetic hot spots (6) by structural analysis.
Indeed, these  sites do not seem to share any universal characteristics that  would facilitate their identification.
Moreover, their physical  meaning is generally unclear.
For example, in most cases it  is not known whether the effects of replacing critical residues  can be attributed entirely to the loss of the specific interactions made by them, nor is it known whether these residues  work in a cooperative manner among themselves or with  other amino acids.
The answers to such questions are of  practical as well as theoretical interest, since they have  important implications for the design of small molecules that  can disrupt protein-protein interactions or functionally  substitute for one of the protein components.
  The complexes of RNase inhibitor (RI),1 a 50 kDa leucinerich repeat protein, with the 14 kDa members of the  mammalian pancreatic RNase superfamily provide an excellent system for investigating these issues.
Binding is extraordinarily tight; e.g., Ki values for the interactions of human  placental RI (hRI) with human angiogenin (Ang), a ribo-   This work was supported by NIH Grant HL 52096.

Consequently, losses of binding free energy  of as much as 12-13 kcal/mol can be quantitated, i.e.,  7-8 kcal/mol beyond those which can be measured for most  hormone-receptor or antigen-antibody complexes, and it  is possible to accurately determine the effects of replacing  multiple key residues simultaneously.
The interaction of RI  with Ang is of particular interest because of the essential  role Ang has been shown to play in the formation of human  tumors in athymic mice (10, 11).
Full-length hRI inhibits  Ang-induced angiogenesis (12) and the growth of syngeneic  tumors in mice (13), but is unlikely to be useful as an  anticancer drug because of its lability, large size, and broad  specificity.
Knowledge of the detailed structural basis for  hRI-Ang recognition might enable the development of RI  derivatives with properties more suitable for therapeutic  applications.
  Crystal structures have been determined for the complexes  of hRI with Ang (14) and porcine RI (pRI) with RNase A  (15, 16).
In each case, 24 enzyme residues interact with 26-  28 residues distributed widely over the inhibitor structure,  which adopts a horseshoe shape formed by symmetrical  arrangement of its 15 tandem repeat units (Figure 1A).
The  hot spot paradigm seems to apply in both instances;  individual substitutions within one part of each interface  decrease affinity substantially, whereas numerous replacements outside this region have no appreciable impact (17-  19).
  The RI residues identified as most important for interacting  with Ang and RNase A are located primarily on the same  short loop segment, residues 434-438 (panels B and C of  Figure 1).
In this study, we have explored further the roles  of intermolecular contacts of these residues and the extent  to which they function independently.
We find that the  energetic effects of various replacements within this segment  on affinity for RNase A are less than additive [subadditive  (20)], indicating that the binding energy within the hRI  RNase A interface may not be as concentrated as suggested  by studying the single-site variants.
In contrast, the effects  of eliminating contacts of residues 434-438 with Ang are  largely additive or beyond additive (superadditive).
Thus,  this segment may assume even greater importance for Ang  binding than was first apparent.
These results show that the  basis for the generation of hot spots can be varied and  complex, and emphasize the need to move beyond singlesite mutagenesis in determining the distribution of binding  free energy within protein-protein interfaces.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Materials.
Primers were synthesized by Genosys or  Promega.
CpA and CpG were purchased from Sigma.
RNase  A (type RAF) and bovine serum albumin (RNase-free) (BSA)  were obtained from Worthington.
Human Ang (both the  native <Glu1 form and the Met-1/Gln1 derivative), [14C-  (U)]Ang (2700 cpm/g), the Ang variants R5A, K40G, and  W89M, hRI, and the hRI variants Y434A, D435A, and  Y437A were produced in Escherichia coli as described  previously (18, 19, 21, 22).
<Glu1 and Met-1/Gln1 Ang  have identical rate constants for dissociation from hRI (23)  and were used interchangeably for dissociation experiments.
  Association rate constants for the two proteins differ  somewhat; only the <Glu1 form was employed for measuring this parameter.
RNase A- and Ang-Sepharose were  prepared by the method of Blackburn et al. (24).
Buffers  used for kinetic experiments were degassed prior to being  used.
  Determination of Protein Concentrations.
Concentrations  of RNase A, Ang, and the Ang variants R5A and K40G were  determined spectrophotometrically [for RNase A, 278 ) 9800  M-1 cm-1 (25); for Ang, 280 ) 12500 M-1 cm-1  ]; W89MAng was quantitated by amino acid analysis.
Concentrations  of hRI and all single-residue hRI variants were based on  measurements of inhibition of RNase A activity (26).
The  hRI double mutants Y434A/D435A and Y434A/Y437A were  quantitated by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad); the standard  was a sample of hRI [in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.6)] which was  itself quantitated spectrophotometrically [281 ) 45 000 M-1  cm-1 (F. S. Lee and R. Shapiro, unpublished)].
  Site-Directed Mutagenesis and Production of Variant  Proteins.
Fragments of hRI cDNA containing the desired  mutations were generated by overlap extension PCR (27)  with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene).
The template was  the expression plasmid pTRP-PRI (21); the external flanking  primers were 5-GGTGTGACATCAGACAACTGC-3 [nucleotides 749-769 in the hRI cDNA sequence (28)] and 5-  TCGACGGATCCCCGGGAATTC-3 (from the 3-noncoding region of the plasmid), and the internal mutagenic primers  were 5-GCTGGTCCTGTTTGACATTTACTGG-3 and 5-  AGTAAATGTCAAACAGGACCAGCTG-3 (Y434F), 5-  GTACGACATTTTTTGGTCTGAGGAG-3 and 5-CCTCAGACCAAAAAATGTCGTACAG-3 (Y437F), 5-CTGGTCCTGGCTGCTATTTACTGGTCTGAGGAG-3 and 5-  CCAGTAAATAGCAGCCAGGACCAGCTGCTCCAGG3 (Y434A/D435A), and 5-GCTGGTCCTGGCTGACATTGCTTGGTCTGAGGAGATGG-3 and 5-CCTCAGACCAAGCAATGTCAGCCAGGACCAGCTGCTCC-3 (Y434A/  Y437A).
The final PCR products were digested with StuI  and EcoRI and ligated into pTRP-PRI that had been cleaved  with the same enzymes.
DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified  regions in all cases confirmed the presence of the intended  mutations and the absence of any spurious changes.
Variants  were expressed in E. coli strain W3110 cells transformed  with the mutant plasmids and were purified by ammonium  sulfateprecipitationandchromatographyonRNaseA-Sepharose  (29) or Ang-Sepharose (19).
The final products were  dialyzed into 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.6) containing 50 mM KCl,  8 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 50% glycerol and stored at  -20 C.
Yields were 200 g per liter of culture.
SDSPAGE analysis revealed that all variants were >95%  homogeneous and were the same size as the native proteins.
  The amino acid compositions of all proteins were consistent  with their proposed structures.
  Kinetics.
(A) Assays.
The enzymatic activity of RNase A  was measured spectrophotometrically with 75 M CpA or  CpG as the substrate (30) in buffer A [0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0)  containing 0.1 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA] and 10 g/mL  1 Abbreviations: RI, ribonuclease inhibitor; hRI, human placental  ribonuclease inhibitor; Ang, angiogenin; RNase A, bovine pancreatic  ribonuclease A; pRI, porcine ribonuclease inhibitor; CpA, cytidylyl-  (3f5)adenosine; CpG, cytidylyl-(3f5)guanosine; BSA, bovine  serum albumin; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; SE, standard  error.
  9274 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 Chen and ShapiroBSA at 25 C.
The RNase A concentrations were 0.2-0.3  and 3 nM for assays with CpA and CpG, respectively.
  (B) Dissociation Rate Constants.
Dissociation rate constants for Y434F-hRI and Y437F-hRIligand complexes  were determined by adding to the complex a scavenger for  free inhibitor and then measuring the amount of free ligand  present at various times (9, 19).
Incubations were performed  at 25 C in buffer A, DTT (5 mM with RNase A and 120  M with Ang), and 100 g/mL BSA.
For incubations with  RNase A (20 nM), the scavenger was Ang (10 M), and  quantitation of free RNase A was based on the activity of  10-15 L aliquots toward CpA. The activity of Ang in this  assay is undetectable.
For Anginhibitor complexes, 14Clabeled ligand (0.9-1.4 M) was used and the scavenger  was unlabeled Ang (20 equiv).
Bound and free [14C]Ang in  70-140 L aliquots of these mixtures were separated by  Mono S cation-exchange chromatography and quantitated  by scintillation counting.
Elution was achieved with a 15  min linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.6 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris  (pH 8) at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min.
As for previous  complexes (see ref 19), dissociation was biphasic, with a  relatively rapid release of some ligand (16-20% for RNase  A and 2-3% for Ang), followed by a slower dissociation  of the remainder.
Data for the slower phase (six to nine points  per complex) were fitted to a single-exponential decay  process with SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS) to obtain kd.

Parts B and C  were drawn with MOLSCRIPT (53).
  Nonadditive Effects of Hot Spot Mutations Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 9275of RNase A complexes was followed for one or two halflives; experiments with Ang complexes were conducted over  8 days, during which 7-10% dissociation occurred.
  Dissociation of other Ang complexes and all complexes  of Ang variants was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy  (see below).
Incubations were performed in buffer A at 25  C.
Ten minutes after formation of the complex (each  component at 0.1 M), 1-2 M W89M-Ang was added as  a scavenger for free hRI or the hRI variant, and the decrease  in Trp fluorescence (see the Results) was followed for at  least six half-lives.
Data were fitted to a single-exponential  decay as described above.
  (C) Association Rate Constants.
Association of hRI and  its derivatives with Ang and Ang variants was assessed by  using the stopped-flow fluorimeter to monitor the enhancement in Trp fluorescence that accompanies complex formation (26).
The conditions were the same as for dissociation  experiments, except that the DTT concentration was 25-50  M and BSA was not added.
The inhibitor concentration  was 50 nM. Association of wild-type Ang complexes was  assessed at four or five concentrations of Ang ranging from  0.25 to 1.5 M (i.e., under pseudo-first-order conditions in  all cases); between seven and eleven replicates were recorded  at each concentration, and more than five half-lives of the  reaction were used for analysis.
Association of the complexes  of Ang variants was examined at a single concentration (100  nM for R5A and 150 nM for K40G); five or six replicate  measurements were taken, and only the first half-life was  used for data analysis to minimize any error due to ligand  depletion.
The fluorescence increases were fitted to a singleor double-exponential decay equation to obtain values of kobs;  for biphasic association, kobs represents the faster rate constant  (see the Results).
Data for complexes of wild-type Ang were  plotted as 1/kobs versus 1/[Ang] and fitted by linear regression;  the slope equals 1/ka, where ka is the apparent second-order  rate constant of association (26).
The ka values for complexes  of Ang variants represent kobs divided by the ligand concentration.
Values of ka for RNase A-inhibitor complexes were  determined from the rate constants for the corresponding Ang  complexes by measuring the competition between the two  ligands for inhibitor in a spectrophotometric assay of RNase  A activity toward CpG (26).
  (D) Dissociation Constants.
Ki values for all Ang and Ang  variant complexes and for the complexes of RNase A with  Y434F-hRI and Y437F-hRI were calculated from the rate  constants for dissociation and association (Ki ) kd/ka).
Ki  values for the complexes of RNase A with the hRI double  mutants Y434A/D435A and Y434A/Y437A were obtained  by measuring enzymatic activity toward CpA in the presence  of five to seven concentrations of inhibitor and performing  nonlinear fits of the data to the equation Vi ) V0/(1 + [I]/Ki)  with SigmaPlot 4.0, where Vi and V0 are initial velocities in  the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively, and [I]  is the inhibitor concentration; the concentration of CpA was  well below Km.
A Ki value for the complex of Y434A/  D435A-hRI with Ang was also determined from that for the  RNase A complex by measuring the competition between  the two ligands fluorimetrically.
This method is based on  the 1.5-fold difference in the Trp fluorescence emission level  between the AngRI and RNase ARI complexes (26).
  Spectra of mixtures of 100 nM inhibitor, 150 nM Ang, and  4.5 or 12.4 M RNase A in buffer A were recorded after  incubation for 45 min at 25 C; this amount of time is >10  half-lives of dissociation for the two complexes and is  therefore sufficient for reaching equilibrium.
The distributions of inhibitor between the two enzymes were then  determined by reference to spectra of mixtures of 100 nM  inhibitor with either 150 nM Ang or 8.9 M RNase A using  the emission intensity at 360 nm.
The Ki value for the Ang  complex equals the Ki value for the RNase complex  multiplied by [A]F[R]B/[R]F[A]B, where A and R refer to Ang  and RNase A, respectively, and B and F refer to bound and  free, respectively.
  (E) Propagation of Standard Error.
Standard errors (SEs)  for Ki values equal Ki times the square root of the sum of  the squares of fractional SEs for kd and ka.
SEs for values of  G ()RT ln Ki) equal RT times the fractional SE for Ki.
  SEs for values of G [the difference between G values  for wild-type (wt) and variant (var) complexes] are the square  root of the sum of the squares of SEs for Gwt and Gvar.
  SEs for values of G (the difference between the sum  of the G values for the single-residue variants and the  observed G value for a multiple-residue variant) are the  square root of the sum of the squares of SEs for G values  for the multiple-residue variant complex and the singleresidue variant complexes.
The calculated SEs in G for  all complexes examined here are <0.2 kcal/mol, and in all  but three instances are <0.1 kcal/mol; errors for earlier  complexes (not reported previously) are e0.1 kcal/mol.
SEs  for all G values are e0.2 kcal/mol.
  Fluorescence Measurements.
Fluorescence spectra were  measured with a Jobin Yvon-Spex FluoroMax-2 fluorimeter.
  Excitation was at 285 nm, and emission was recorded from  300 to 400 nm, except in the competition experiment where  excitation was at 295 nm to minimize any contribution of  RNase A tyrosines, and emission was monitored between  340 and 400 nm.
Time-based data acquisition on this  instrument was performed at 2.5 s intervals with excitation  at 285 nm (0.7 nm slit) and emission at 365 nm (25 nm  slit).
Stopped-flow measurements were performed with an  Applied Photophysics instrument.
Excitation was at 285 nm  (2 nm slit), and emission was monitored with a 340 nm bandpass filter; 2000 data points were collected for each experiment.
  RESULTS  Rationale for the Mutational Studies.
In the crystal  structure of the hRIAng complex, the side chains of hRI  residues Tyr434, Asp435, and Tyr437 and the main chain  of hRI Trp438 contact Arg5, Lys40, Ala106, Glu108, His114,  and Gln117 of Ang (Figure 1B and Table 1).
Replacements  of Asp435 and Arg5 with Ala and Lys40 with Gln were  shown previously to decrease affinity markedly; these effects  can potentially be understood as consequences of eliminating  the H-bonds of Asp435 with Lys40 and Trp438 with Arg5.
  The relatively minor change associated with the substitution  of Tyr437 with Ala also seems reasonable, since this residue  only makes five van der Waals contacts with Ang.
In  contrast, replacement of Tyr434 by Ala, which also removes  only a relatively small number of van der Waals interactions,  produces a large reduction in complex stability.
  The Tyr434 mutation decreases the affinity for RNase A  even more substantially than for Ang; indeed, the loss in  9276 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 Chen and Shapirobinding free energy (G) of 5.9 kcal/mol is by far the  largest for any substitution in the three proteins.
The side  chain of residue 434 forms more extensive interactions with  RNase A (one H-bond and 13 van der Waals contacts; Table  1 and Figure 1C) than with Ang.
However, replacement of  Tyr437 eliminates a similar number of interactions and yet  produces a much more modest change in binding strength,  2.6 kcal/mol. [The interactions cited are those in the pRI  RNase A complex and are assumed to be present in the hRI  complex as well: the Ki values for the two complexes are  indistinguishable (9, 31), the sequences of hRI (28) and pRI  (32) are 77% identical, and the region under examination is  especially well-conserved.] Substitution of Asp435 in hRI  destabilizes the complex with RNase A to the same degree  as that with Ang, suggesting that similar interactions have  been eliminated.
Although the pRIRNase A crystal structure  exhibits no H-bonds corresponding to those of Asp435 with  Lys40 in the Ang complex (the analogous lysine, Lys41,  instead binds a sulfate ion from the crystallization medium),  such interactions probably form under the conditions used  for kinetic characterization, where sulfate and similar anions  are not present (14); this would require only a slight  reorientation of the -amino group of Lys41 to a position  already observed for it in some crystal structures of the free  enzyme (33).
  The preceding observations raise numerous questions  regarding the interactions of the hRI segment of residues  434-438 with Ang and RNase A, particularly with respect  to the structural bases for the dramatic losses in affinity  associated with replacement of Tyr434.
What is the relative  importance of H-bonds versus van der Waals contacts and  the hydrophobic effect in the interactions of Tyr434 and  Tyr437 with RNase A? Does Tyr434 form contacts with  either enzyme that are not apparent from the crystal  structures? Does the Tyr434 mutation disrupt contacts of  other hRI residues? More generally, are the functional effects  of replacing the individual interface residues independent?
  We initially addressed these questions by characterizing the  complexes of RNase A and Ang with four new hRI  variants: Y434F, Y437F, Y434A/D435A, and Y434A/  Y437A.
Interrelationships within this region of the hRIAng  interface were then investigated further through kinetic  studies on the complexes of R5A-Ang and K40G-Ang with  hRI single and double mutants.

Kinetic analysis of their interactions was  performed by standard methods (see Experimental Procedures), and Ki values were calculated from the rate constants  for dissociation (kd) and association (ka).
Replacement of  Tyr434 by Phe had essentially no effect on binding of RNase  A (Table 2), indicating that the putative H-bond of this  residue does not contribute to complex stability and that the  attenuated affinity of Y434A is due only to the loss of the  phenyl group.
In contrast, replacement of Tyr437 by Phe  weakened the hRIRNase A interaction almost to the same  extent (2.1 kcal/mol) as had substitution with Ala (2.6 kcal/  mol).
Thus, the OH group rather than the phenyl ring of this  Tyr appears to provide the energetically important interactions.
  The Tyr434 f Phe substitution decreased the binding  energy of the Ang complex by 0.6 kcal/mol (vs 3.3 kcal/  mol for the Ala replacement), suggesting that this residue  again participates primarily through its phenyl ring, but that  the OH group may play a minor role as well.
Replacement  of Tyr437 with Phe did not alter the affinity significantly,  consistent with the absence of any H-bond for this residue  in the three-dimensional structure.
  Interactions of Y434A/D435A-hRI and Y434A/Y437A-hRI  with RNase A. Recombinant Y434A/D435A and Y434A/  Y437A hRIs were prepared in the same manner as the other  variants, except that Ang-Sepharose was used for the final  purification step (19).
Binding constants for the complexes  of these variants with RNase A were determined directly by  measuring the extent of inhibition of enzymatic activity, as  had been done previously with Y434A; indeed, dissociation  was too rapid to allow measurement of kd and ka by available  methods.
Both hRI mutants bound only 8-9-fold less tightly  than the single Y434A derivative.
Thus, the impacts of the  double replacements (Table 3) were 59-fold (Y434A/D435A)  and 10-fold (Y434A/Y437A) smaller than would be expected  if the individual substitutions reduce the affinity by independent mechanisms.
In energetic terms, the effects of the  replacements are subadditive; the difference (G) between the sum of G values for the single-residue variants  and the measured G value for the double-mutant complex  is 2.4 kcal/mol for the 434 and 435 pair and 1.3 kcal/mol  for the 434 and 437 pair.
  Interactions of Y434A/D435A-hRI and Y434A/Y437A-hRI  with Angiogenin.
Attempts to measure Ki values for the  complexes of Ang with the hRI double mutants by the  standard method were unsuccessful because neither complex  remained intact during the chromatographic procedure that  was used to quantitate bound and free Ang in dissociation  experiments.
Thus, it was necessary to develop an alternative  approach for determining affinity.
The ribonucleolytic activity of Ang is extremely weak (8), precluding measurement  of Ki by enzymatic assay.
Instead, a fluorescence-based  technique for monitoring dissociation was devised. Lee and  co-workers had demonstrated that the fluorescence of the  complex of Ang (which contains a single tryptophan, at  position 89) and hRI (with six Trps) is twice that of the  oxindolylalanine-89-Ang complex (26), and that Trpoxidized Ang binds almost as tightly as the wild-type protein  (17).
These findings suggested that kd values for the  complexes of Ang with Y434A/D435A-hRI and Y434A/  Y437A-hRI could be determined by adding to the complexes excess Trp-modified Ang and then following the  decrease in fluorescence as the inhibitor dissociates from Ang  and binds to the Ang derivative.
The feasibility of this  approach was tested with the Ang variant W89M (22) rather  than with the oxidized protein, which is more difficult to  prepare.
  Met substitution of Trp89 had no significant effect on  complex stability (results not shown).
Addition of W89MAng to wild-type hRI produced a several-nanometer blue  shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum; the maximum  was 10% lower than that for hRI itself (Figure 2).
Addition  of a 10-fold molar excess of this protein to the AngY434A/  D435A-hRI complex induced a 30% decrease in fluorescence emission that occurred with a half-life of 4.3 min  (Figure 3), i.e., 24400-fold faster than for the wild-type  complex (t1/2 ) 73 days) (Table 3).

  9278 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 Chen and ShapiroY434A/Y437A-hRI complex was accelerated almost as  much, by a factor of 16 000.
  The effects of the hRI double mutations on association  were investigated by the standard stopped-flow fluorimetric  method with a fixed concentration of inhibitor and multiple  concentrations of Ang ranging from a 4- to a 30-fold molar  excess.
In all instances, the fluorescence increase that  accompanied complex formation was markedly biphasic (see  Figure 4), whereas a single-exponential process had been  observed for the wild-type complex and for every variant  complex examined previously.
The data fit well to a doubleexponential equation, with rate constants for the two  processes differing by a factor of at least 6 at all Ang  concentrations.
  Because of the unusual association behavior, it was not  immediately apparent how to obtain values for ka from the  stopped-flow data.
This calculation is straightforward for the  wild-type complex, where association of Ang (E) and hRI  (I) occurs by a two-step kinetic mechanism in which rapid  formation of a loose complex EI (dissociation constant K1  ) 0.3 M) is followed by a slower isomerization to the tight  complex EI* (rate constant k2 ) 80 s-1  ) (26; values cited  are from ref 19).
The initial E + I a EI equilibrium for the  wild-type complex is established within the dead time of the  instrument (<1 ms), and the subsequent fluorescence change,  which is a single-exponential process, reflects conversion  of EI and remaining E + I to EI*. The rate constant for this  process, kobs, equals k-2 + k2[Ang]/(K1 + [Ang]) (k-2 is the  rate constant for the reverse isomerization and can be ignored  for most complexes); ka equals k2/K1 and is determined from  the dependence of kobs on Ang concentration (see Experimental Procedures).
For the hRI double mutants, the calculation is less straightforward.
One obvious potential explanation  for the biphasic association of the complexes of these variants  is that the amino acid replacements have prolonged the first  step to the point where it is observable.
In this case, the  slower of the two processes would correspond to the single  phase seen with the wild-type complex.
Alternatively, the  faster process might correspond to that normally measured  (i.e., EI f EI*), with formation of EI still taking place during  the dead time and the slower phase reflecting an additional  step in the inhibition mechanism or an experimental artifact.
  Values for ka determined on the basis of these two  interpretations differ substantially.
Three considerations,  taken together, strongly support the latter view and indicate  that ka can be calculated by treating the rate constant for the  faster process as kobs in the standard procedure. (1) Most of  the fluorescence increase with the wild-type complex is due  to the conversion of EI to EI* rather than to formation of EI  (R. Shapiro, unpublished results); between 70 and 85% of  the fluorescence increase with the double mutants is associated with the faster process. (2) The dependence of the faster  rate constant on Ang concentration for Y434A/D435A is  linear over the entire range of concentrations examined,  reaching a value of 105 s-1 at 1.5 M Ang. If these rates  reflect EI f EI*, then both K1 and k2 are much larger than  for wild-type hRI (see above), as was the case for the Y434A  and D435A single-residue variants (19).
However, if the  faster rate constants reflect E + I a EI, then k2, as derived  from data for the slower phase, would be considerably  smaller than for wild-type inhibitor (K1 would be unchanged);  i.e., the effect of the double substitution on k2 would be the  opposite of that for the single replacements.

  Nonadditive Effects of Hot Spot Mutations Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 9279proximate Ki value for the Y434A/D435A-hRIAng complex  obtained by fluorimetric examination of competition between  Ang and RNase A (see Experimental Procedures) is consistent with the ka value calculated from the faster phase.
This  experiment indicated that Ang binds 100-200-fold more  tightly than RNase A (i.e., with a Ki of 28-56 pM).
(A more  precise determination could not be performed because of  technical limitations.) Together with the value for kd measured above, this sets ka to 4.8-9.6  107 M-1 s-1.
  The ka values for the Ang complexes with Y434A/D435A  and Y434A/Y437A based on the more rapid process were  7.0  107 and 5.9  107 M-1 s-1  , respectively, several-fold  lower than for the wild-type complex.
These changes in  association are much smaller than the effects on dissociation,  as has generally been the case with mutations that substantially weaken protein-protein interactions (19, 34, 35).
The  calculated Ki value for the Y434A/D435A complex (39 pM)  is equivalent to that predicted if the effects of the mutations  at positions 434 and 435 are completely additive (G )  0).
However, the Ki for the Y434A/Y437A complex (29 pM)  is 74-fold higher than expected for simple additivity; i.e.,  the effects of the replacements at positions 434 and 437 are  markedly superadditive, with G being equal to -2.5  kcal/mol.
Both findings stand in stark contrast to the strong  subadditivities observed with the RNase A complexes.
  Consequently, the impacts of each double mutation on Ang  and RNase A binding are nearly the same, although the single  replacements at positions 434 and 437 reduced the affinity  for RNase A to a much greater extent than that for Ang.
  Interactions of Ang Variants R5A and K40G with hRI  Single and Double Mutants.
hRI Trp438 interacts with Ang  primarily through its main chain, whose oxygen atom forms  two H-bonds with the guanidino group of Arg5.
Therefore,  additivities involving the interactions of this residue were  assessed through the use of R5A-Ang.
Dissociation of all  R5A complexes was rapid enough to measure by the  fluorescence method; for the complex with Y434A/D435AhRI, it was so fast that it could be followed only with the  stopped-flow instrument.
Association was monitored as for  the complexes with wild-type Ang, except that a single  concentration of R5A-Ang, well below K1, was used; in the  one instance where the fluorescence increase was biphasic  (with Y434A/Y437A), the ka value was calculated from the  faster process, as described above.
  The effects of replacing Ang Arg5 and Tyr434, Asp435,  or both on hRI were all superadditive, with G values  ranging from -0.9 to -1.4 kcal/mol (Table 4).
The impact  of the three simultaneous replacements was particularly  dramatic; the Ki for the triple mutant complex was 10 nM,  i.e., (2.7  107  )-fold higher than for the wild type, and the  t1/2 for dissociation was only 1.1 s. The effects of substituting  Arg5 and both Tyr434 and Tyr437 were even more strongly  superadditive (G ) -2.1 kcal/mol), although the Ki  value for this complex was somewhat lower, 0.7 nM.  The Ang variant K40G was used to investigate further the  interactions of Lys40 with Asp435 and Tyr434 of hRI as  well as to assess additional interrelationships within this  interface region.
The K40G complexes were characterized  in the same manner as those of R5A-Ang; association was  biphasic except with Y434A/Y437A.
A previous study in  which K40G was used (19) had measured kd, but not ka, for  the complex with wild-type hRI.
The missing parameter was  now determined so that the Ki value for this complex could  be calculated.
The resultant G value, 3.2 kcal/mol (Table  4), was similar to that produced by Ala substitution of  Asp435, the H-bonding partner of Lys40 (3.5 kcal/mol).
The  G values for replacing Lys40 and Asp435 within the  context of the AngY434A-hRI complex also agreed closely  (3.3 and 3.5 kcal/mol, respectively).
Replacement of Lys40  in the AngD435A-hRI complex produced only a small  additional effect (0.6 kcal/mol), and substitution of this  residue in the AngY434A/D435A-hRI complex in fact  increased affinity slightly (by 0.4 kcal/mol).
Thus, the effects  of replacing Ang Lys40 and hRI Asp435 are almost entirely  nonadditive, whereas those of substituting Lys40 and hRI  Tyr434 are fully additive, as for the combination of residues  434 and 435 (Table 3).
  In contrast, replacing Ang Lys40 together with hRI Tyr437  revealed strong superadditivity (G ) -2.4 kcal/mol),  similar to that measured for the complex of Ang with Y434A/  Y437A-hRI.
A somewhat smaller superadditivity (G  ) -1.8 kcal/mol) was observed when all three mutations  were incorporated.
The Ki for binding of K40G-Ang to  Y434A/Y437A-hRI (1.9 nM) was the second highest for any  of the complexes that were examined, as was the kd value.
  Association was 28-fold slower than for the wild-type  complex, by far the largest change observed for this  parameter.

  9280 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 Chen and ShapiroDISCUSSION  Nature of the Hot Spot in the hRIRNase A Binding  Interface.
The results of earlier mutational studies showed  that the region of the hRIRNase A interface containing hRI  residues Tyr434, Asp435, Tyr437, and Ser460 constitutes  an energetic hot spot (19).
Residues 434, 435, and 437 lie  on a single loop, with Ser460 juxtaposed next to them in  the three-dimensional structure; this cluster blocks the active  center of RNase A, contacting the P1 catalytic site (Lys41  and His119), B2 purine-binding subsite (Gln69, Asn71,  Ala109, and Glu111), and the P2 phosphate-binding subsite  (Lys7) (the subsite nomenclature is from ref 36).
Individual  mutations of these hRI residues decreased the binding energy  by 2.6-5.9 kcal/mol.
Substitutions of five others (Glu287,  Lys320, Glu401, Cys408, and Arg457) produced much  smaller changes, although all of these amino acids form  H-bonds or salt bridges in the crystal structure.
Deletion of  the internal segment of residues 315-371, which eliminates  the interactions of all 10 contact residues between the  N-terminus and residue 371 because of the horseshoe shape  of the inhibitor, increased Ki only by 630-fold (29).
None  of the nine contact residues on hRI still to be investigated  interact extensively with RNase A in the crystal structure of  the complex, and only one forms an H-bond.
Six of them  are neighbors of residues 434-437 and/or 460 that may also  contribute to the hot spot.
  The mutagenesis results indicated that Tyr434 is the hRI  residue most important for binding RNase A. However, the  nature of its role is not obvious from the crystal structure.
  The H-bond between the Tyr OH group and the carbonyl O  of RNase A Leu35 appears to be weak (donor-acceptor  distance of 3.4 ), and this is now supported by the finding  that Y434F-hRI is functionally indistinguishable from the  wild-type inhibitor (Table 2).
The phenyl ring of Tyr434  forms numerous van der Waals contacts with RNase A and  becomes almost completely buried in the complex [solventaccessible surface area (ASA) decreases from 73 to 6 2].
  In principle, these contacts and the hydrophobic effect might  provide appreciable binding energy.
However, elimination  of the phenyl group of Tyr437, which forms nearly as many  interactions and undergoes a still larger decrease in ASA  (from 102 2 in free RI to 6 2 in the complex), had only  a minor effect; G for Phe437 f Ala is 0.5 kcal/mol, i.e.,  5.3 kcal/mol smaller than that for Phe434 f Ala (Table 2).
  Moreover, the burying of Tyr434 in the interface appears to  have an energetic cost; it requires an 180 rotation of the  side chain of Arg39, whose positions in the structures of  free RNase A and RNase-nucleotide complexes conflict  with that occupied by Tyr434 in the RI complex (16).
  Results obtained in this study with Y434A/D435A-hRI and  Y434A/Y437A-hRI suggest that in fact much of the contribution of Tyr434 to binding of RNase A is indirect.
The  losses in binding energy for both double mutations are  strongly subadditive, implying that Tyr434 is functionally  coupled to Asp435 and Tyr437 in the complex.
One plausible  basis for this would be that removal of the Tyr434 side chain  attenuates the interactions of the other residues.
In this case,  the portion of G for Y434A-hRI that is attributable to  indirect effects on Asp435 and Tyr437 could be as high as  63% (3.7 kcal/mol), since G values for replacement of  Asp435 in wild-type and Y434A-hRI differ by 2.4 kcal/mol  and G values for replacement of Tyr437 in these two  RIs differ by 1.3 kcal/mol.
  An alternative or additional basis for the observed  couplings would be that substitutions of Asp435 and Tyr437  each impair the interactions of Tyr434.
This would imply  that the direct energetic contributions of Asp435 and Tyr437  are much smaller than the G values measured for the  Ala variants.
Although this possibility cannot be excluded,  we note that the changes in binding energy produced by  replacing residues 435 and 437 are more readily understandable than that engendered by mutating residue 434.
The G  value for D435A-hRI (3.6 kcal/mol) is reasonable for the  loss of the putative H-bonds with Lys41; indeed, the similar  effect of mutating Asp435 in the hRIAng complex seems  to be almost entirely due to disruption of the corresponding  interactions (see below).
The G values for removal of  the Tyr437 OH and phenyl groups are 2.1 and 0.5 kcal/mol,  respectively.
The first of these values is not excessive for  the loss of the two H-bonds of the OH moiety, both of which  are well-buried and one of which is short (donor-acceptor  distance of 2.7 ).
The second value is low, rather than high,  in view of the 10 van der Waals contacts and extensive  burying of the phenyl ring in the complex.
The preceding  considerations also argue against another potential explanation for the subadditive effects of the mutations of the 434  and 435 and 434 and 437 pairs, i.e., that the replacement  pairs have common negative effects on solvent structure or  on energetically significant interactions of other residues.
  Moreover, thermal denaturation studies have shown that Ala  substitutions of Tyr434 and Asp435 do not perturb the overall  hRI structure (19).
  Functional coupling between Tyr434 and Asp435 is not  surprising given the short distance (5.7 ) separating these  residues and the contact residue on RNase, Lys41, that they  share.
Tyr434 might strengthen the 435-41 H-bonds by  aligning the two residues optimally and/or by shielding them  from solvent.
The conformational change in RNase A  associated with binding of Tyr434 might also help to improve  these bonds.
It is more difficult to envision how Tyr434 is  linked to Tyr437, as these residues are 13  apart, and their  contacts on RNase A approach no closer than 7  (the  major Tyr434 contact, Lys41, is separated from the Tyr437  H-bonding partners Asn71 and Glu111 by even greater  distances, 16-18 ).
Perhaps the loss of the side chain of  residue 434 alters the local RI backbone structure in a manner  that propagates to residue 437, which is on the same loop.
  The pRIRNase A crystal structure indicates ways in which  Tyr434 might influence interactions of RI residues Glu401  and Ser460 as well.
The two H-bonds between Glu401 and  Arg39 of RNase A are able to form only because of the  movement of the Arg side chain facilitated or induced by  Tyr434; elimination of these H-bonds by Ala substitution  of Glu401 decreases the complex stability by 1.3 kcal/mol  (unpublished data).
van der Waals contacts of Tyr434 with  Ser460 might help to optimize the H-bonds of the Ser with  Lys7 and Gln11 of RNase A; removal of the Ser460  interactions produces a G value of 3.5 kcal/mol (19).
  In summary, the present findings suggest that Tyr434  serves as a key linchpin that functions largely by enhancing  interactions of other residues within, and possibly beyond,  the hot spot region of the hRIRNase A interface rather than  by forming strong direct contacts of its own.
A more detailed  Nonadditive Effects of Hot Spot Mutations Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 9281understanding of the elaborate role of this residuesand,  indeed, confirmation of this hypothesissmust await the  outcome of further mutational and crystallographic studies.
  Nonetheless, it is already clear that the residues within the  hot spot of the RIRNase A interface do not function  independently and that the effects of single-residue mutations  overestimate the contributions of some or all of these amino  acids.
  Nature of the Hot Spot in the hRIAng Binding Interface.
  As with the RNase A complex, mutagenesis results point to  the existence of a hot spot in the hRIAng interface  encompassing loop residues 434-438 and its neighbor  residue 460 on hRI and the P1/B2/P2 portion of the enzyme  active site.
Replacements of four amino acids in this region  (hRI Tyr434 and Asp435 and Ang Arg5 and Lys40)  increased Ki substantially (G ) 2.3-4.2 kcal/mol), and  substitutions of four others (hRI Tyr437 and Ser460 and Ang  His8 and His114) produced smaller, but significant, changes  (G ) 0.6-1.3 kcal/mol).
Replacements of three Ang  residues (Arg31, Arg32, and Trp89) that form H-bonds and  extensive van der Waals contacts with hRI in other parts of  the interface had little or no impact.
Indeed, the results of  preliminary single-site mutagenesis studies on the remainder  of the interface suggest that no residues outside the key  region already identified make large energetic contributions  (R. Shapiro, unpublished).
  Most of the effects of single-site substitutions within the  hot spot are readily understandable from the crystal structure  of the hRIAng complex.
Replacements of hRI Asp435 and  Ang Lys40, residues which are linked by two well-buried,  medium-length H-bonds and three van der Waals interactions, decrease the binding free energy by 3.5 and 3.2-4.2  kcal/mol, respectively (Tables 1 and 4).
Although each of  these amino acids forms additional intermolecular interactions (Asp435 with Gln117 directly and with Asp41 and  Leu115 via water; Lys40 with Tyr434), the present findings  suggest that only their contacts with each other are energetically important.
(i) G values for Asp435 f Ala and  Lys40 f Gly are nearly identical; (ii) the effects of replacing  Asp435 and Lys40 are almost entirely nonadditive, and (iii)  the effects of mutating Lys40 and Tyr434 are fully additive.
  Substitution of Ang Arg5 by Ala decreases the binding  energy by 2.3 kcal/mol; this residue forms two H-bonds with  Trp438 of hRI, a water-mediated H-bond with Ile436, and  van der Waals contacts with Trp438, Ser439, and Glu440.
  Presumably, the strongest of these interactions are the direct  H-bonds, although neither is optimal; one is well-buried but  long, and the other is short but only partially buried.
  Replacement of hRI Tyr437 by Ala produces a relatively  minor change in affinity (G ) 0.8 kcal/mol), and mutation  to Phe has no effect (Table 2).
This is again consistent with  the crystal structure, where Tyr437 makes a small number  of van der Waals contacts with Ala106, Glu108, and His114  of Ang and does not form any H-bonds.
Deletion of hRI  Ser460, which eliminates the H-bonds of this residue with  His8 and Gln12 of Ang, yields a G value of 1.3 kcal/  mol.
  The basis for the 3.3 kcal/mol loss in binding energy that  results from mutating hRI Tyr434 to Ala is less evident from  the crystal structure.
The phenyl group of this residue forms  several van der Waals contacts with the alkyl portion of Ang  Lys40 and becomes almost fully buried upon complex  formation.
As just noted, the effects of replacing Tyr434 and  Lys40 are entirely independent, suggesting that the interactions between these two amino acids do not make an  important contribution.
Nonetheless, the hydrophobic effect  still might account for much of the reduced affinity of  Y434A-hRI for Ang; i.e., it is possible that removal of the  Lys40 side chain does not increase significantly the accessibility of the Tyr434 phenyl group to solvent.
In addition,  the G value of 0.6 kcal/mol for replacement of Tyr434  by Phe (Table 2) suggests that the OH group of the tyrosine  may form a weak H-bond not observed in the X-ray structure,  where its oxygen atom is 3.7  from the nearest potential  partner (Pro38 O).
It is also possible that the phenyl group  forms a more favorable set of interactions under the  conditions used for the kinetic experiments than it does in  the crystal. [We note, however, that the complex is extremely  stable (t1/2  70 days) in solution under the crystallization  conditions (14).] In addition, Tyr434 might provide binding  energy by altering the arrangement of the solvent at the  protein surfaces; this is particularly difficult to assess because  the structure of free hRI has not been determined.
  Tyr434 does not appear to contribute to binding of Ang  via the indirect mechanism proposed for it in the RNase A  complex.
The effects of replacing this residue and Asp435  are completely additive, and the effects of mutating it  together with hRI Tyr437 and/or Ang Arg5 are superadditive.
  The simplest interpretation of these findings is that Tyr434  and Asp435 are functionally independent and that replacement of Tyr434 does not reduce (and might increase; see  below) the contributions of Tyr437 and Arg5.
These additivities also provide further evidence that the loss of the side  chain of residue 434 does not cause any general perturbation  of the inhibitor structure.
However, we cannot exclude the  possibility that the Tyr434 substitution attenuates specific  interactions of residues other than those examined here.
For  example, removal of the two short (3.2 and 3.4 ) van der  Waals contacts of the residue 434 phenyl ring with Ser460  CB might affect the H-bonds of residue 460 OG with His8  and Gln12 of Ang.
  Superadditive mutational effects are found whenever hRI  Tyr437 or Ang Arg5 is replaced together with the other  residues that have been examined (Tables 3 and 4).
They  are particularly large for the combinations of Tyr437 with  Tyr434 and with Ang Lys40, which give G values of  -2.5 and -2.4 kcal/mol, respectively.
G values for  replacements of Arg5 and Tyr434, Asp435, or both are  smaller (-0.9 to -1.4 kcal/mol).
The superadditivities  associated with mutations of Arg5 and Tyr437 do not seem  to be independent, as G for the 434, 437, 5 triple  combination is about the same as for the 434 and 437 pair  by itself.
These findings suggest that the hot spot residues  fall into two groups, Tyr434, Asp435, and Lys40 and Tyr437  and Arg5; the effects of eliminating multiple interactions  within each group are additive, whereas mutations involving  both groups give superadditive effects.
All of the superadditivities measured are highly significant since the errors  in the G values are in the range of 0.1-0.2 kcal/mol.
  Moreover, the effects would be even larger if our decision  to calculate ka values for biphasic associations from the faster,  rather than the slower, process was incorrect.
  One potential physical basis for the observed superadditivities is that replacement of one residue within the pair or  9282 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 Chen and Shapirogroup strengthens the contacts of others.
For example, once  the side chain of hRI Tyr437 or Ang Arg5 is removed, hRI  Tyr434 and Ang Lys40 might form more effective interactions with each other, and the Asp435Lys40 H-bonds  might also be improved; this would imply that the actual  energetic contributions of Tyr437 and Arg5 in the wild-type  complex are larger than the effects of single-site mutations.
  Conversely, losses of the Tyr434 and Lys40 side chains  might enhance the contacts of Tyr437, allowing this residue  to pack better or to form a strong H-bond with Glu108 (the  residue 437 OH and residue 108 OE2 are slightly beyond  H-bonding distance in the wild-type complex), or perhaps  to engage in a cation- interaction (37) with His114; this  would imply that the free energy losses for the individual  Tyr434 and Lys40 replacements underestimate the true  importance of these residues in the wild-type complex.
  Similarly, substitutions of Tyr434 and Lys40 might serve to  strengthen the H-bonds of Ang Arg5 with Trp438 of hRI.
  This type of negative cooperativity might reflect the difficulty  of optimizing multiple interactions simultaneously when the  evolutionary driving force is not only to maximize affinity  but also to maintain broad specificity (hRI must bind tightly  to all members of the RNase superfamily; see ref 38).
  An alternative explanation for superadditivity is that the  loss of the interactions of one residue is offset by the  formation of entirely new interactions by other residues  within the group.
This would require at least some localized  structural rearrangements of hRI, Ang, or both.
In this regard,  it should be noted that the loop that contains residues 434-  438 makes relatively few interactions with other structural  elements on hRI and therefore might be quite flexible.
This  mechanism of superadditivity would again imply that some  of the interactions in this region make greater contributions  than is apparent from the single-residue replacements.
  In principle, superadditive effects could also result if  multiresidue substitutions weaken or disrupt the interactions  of other residues but the individual replacements do not.
In  this case, the basis for the observed superadditivities in fact  would be similar to that proposed above for the subadditivities in the RNase A complex.
Although this possibility  cannot be ruled out entirely, it seems unlikely because G  values for the triple mutations of Tyr434, Asp435, and Arg5,  Tyr434, Tyr437, and Arg5, and Tyr434, Tyr437, and Lys40  are all similar to or greater than those for any of the double  mutations.
  In light of these considerations, we conclude that the hot  spot in the hRIAng interface plays an even more critical  role than had been suggested by earlier studies with singleresidue variants.
Elimination of the interactions of only three  of the residues in this site (Tyr434, Asp435, and Arg5)  together decreases the binding free energy by 10.1 kcal/mol  (47% of the total).
Replacement of a fourth residue, Tyr437,  would be expected to have a significant further effect since  in all variant and variantvariant complexes examined this  substitution reduced the binding energy by >1.5 kcal/mol.
  The interactions of Ser460 might also add to the overall  contribution of this region; the G value for deletion of  this residue in the wild-type complex is 1.3 kcal/mol, and  the results of preliminary studies (R. Shapiro, unpublished)  indicate that the energy losses for double mutations involving  Ser460 are superadditive.
  Implications for Protein-Protein Interactions in General.
  Single-site mutagenesis has been used extensively to investigate the distribution of binding free energy within proteinprotein interfaces.
Although the maps obtained, in conjunction with the corresponding crystal structures, provide critical  information on the molecular basis for binding affinity, they  do not reveal how the whole is generated from its parts.
This  issue is commonly addressed, as it is in this study, by  replacing two or more residues both separately and together  and comparing the effects that are produced (39-41).
If the  G value for the multiple mutation equals the sum of those  for the individual mutations [i.e., if G (sometimes  termed Gint) is zero], this suggests that the residues are  functionally independent.
Positive G values obtained  when two residues on the different protein partners are  replaced are taken to be quantitative measures of the energy  of the interaction between the residues as long as the  mutations have not produced secondary effects, e.g., on  protein or solvent structure.
Although such complications  can be ignored in many cases, there are numerous examples  where they clearly come into play since significantly positive  G values (i.e., subadditivities) are measured for residues  that form no direct pairwise or triangulated contacts (20, 42,  43).
  Early studies in which multiple sites were mutated on the  same protein partner showed the effects to be fully additive  as a rule (44, 45).
However, many instances of subadditivity  have now been documented (46, 47).
Indeed, this phenomenon must be quite prevalent because the sum of G values  for single-residue mutants is much greater than the G value  for virtually all complexes that have been examined; in the  most striking cases, G and G differ by nearly a factor  of 4 (48, 49).
The subadditivities observed previously have  generally involved interface residues that are neighbors, and  can often be explained qualitatively in terms of intramolecular contacts.
The effect of the hRI Tyr434/Asp435 double  replacement on the affinity for RNase A reported here  constitutes yet another example of this situation.
In contrast,  the coupling between the hRI Tyr434 and Tyr437 side chains  in binding RNase A occurs over a distance of >13  and  does not seem to reflect any direct or mediated interactions.
  The paucity of analogous cases in the literature probably  reflects the limited extent to which studies on protein-protein  complexes have examined interrelationships between distant  residues on the same protein, as compared to those on the  two interacting proteins.
This type of long-range thermodynamic coupling within proteins has been seen for both protein  folding (50) and enzymatic systems (see refs 20 and 51).
  Superadditive mutational effects such as those observed  here for the hRIAng complex seem to be much rarer.
Indeed,  we are not aware of any reported previously that are strictly  comparable.
Jin and Wells (47) found that the affinity  decreases produced by Ala replacements of key antibodybinding determinants on human growth hormone became  4-20-fold greater when groups of five to nine neighboring  residues were also mutated to Ala (i.e., G values ranged  from -0.8 to -1.8 kcal/mol).
These superadditivities differ  from those measured in this study in that they involve larger  sets of mutations and can potentially be explained by the  close proximity of the various replacement sites.
The most  substantial G values for the hRIAng complex were  obtained for the double mutations 434(hRI)/437(hRI) and  Nonadditive Effects of Hot Spot Mutations Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 29, 1999 9283437(hRI)/40(Ang); these side chain pairs are separated by  at least 13.6 and 13.4 , respectively (the shortest distances  between the two residues; CG-CG and CG-NZ, respectively), and there are no apparent links between them other  than the main chain.
The 434(hRI)/5(Ang) combination gives  a somewhat smaller G value for residues that are  similarly separated (>12.6 ; CG-NH2).
Outside of proteinprotein complexes, superadditivities have been seen in protein  folding and enzymatic systems (compiled in refs 20 and 51),  but these are likely to have very different physical meanings.
  The same types of secondary physicochemical effects of  mutations that are usually invoked to account for subadditivity can also apply to superadditivity.
These include  changes in local or global protein conformation, solvent  structure, electrostatic fields or dielectric constants, and  protein dynamic properties.
However, whereas subadditivity  for protein-protein complexes reflects the fragility of the  specific intermolecular interactions (i.e., how easily the loss  of one interaction can impact on others), superadditivity  reflects the plasticity and adaptability of the interface (i.e.,  how readily the interactions lost can be compensated for).
  Clearly, this latter property is particularly beneficial when  one protein component must evolve to recognize multiple  ligands of diverse structure as in the RI-RNase/Ang system,  where the sequences of the targets are only 25-35%  identical.
Nonetheless, it seems likely that detailed studies  of additional protein-protein complexes will reveal that  superadditivity has been widely utilized in nature.
  Nonadditivity has enormous implications for the interpretation of binding energy hot spots identified by single-site  mutagenesis.
As seen for the two hRI complexes, such sites  can be either hotter or less hot than they appear.
In the  examples presented here, the binding energy within the key  region was overestimated due to subadditivity and underestimated as a result of superadditivity.
However, each type  of nonadditivity can have the opposite outcome as well.
If  some residues function largely to support the hot spot, as  proposed for the complex of human growth hormone with  its receptor, then the effects of mutating them together with  the critical amino acids will be subadditive, and this would  now mean that the binding energy is in reality more focused  than it appeared from the single-residue replacements (52).
  If the effects of mutating combinations of non-hot spot  residues are superadditive, this would indicate that these  residues are more important (and the interaction energy less  concentrated) than they seemed to be on the basis of the  individual substitutions.
  The extent to which binding free energy is localized within  hot spots has obvious ramifications for the design of small  molecules that block or mimic protein-protein interfaces;  in general, the more concentrated the energy is, the more  likely it is that these agents can be developed.
Indeed, in  cases where the critical region comprises a single small  segment, it may be possible to utilize this peptide directly if  appropriate constraints can be introduced to achieve the  correct conformation.
At the same time, complex interrelationships among the crucial residues, such as those  observed for the hRI interactions, might make this task more  difficult even when the key site is very compact. If residues  exhibit positive cooperativity (i.e., if mutational effects are  subadditive), then subtle deviations from optimal positioning  for a single amino acid can weaken multiple interactions and  thereby decrease affinity dramatically. If negative cooperativity exists (i.e., if mutational effects are superadditive),  then it might be extremely challenging to maintain strong  interactions of multiple residues simultaneously.
Moreover,  caution must be exercised when deciding which elements  of the hot spot region to incorporate into the designed  molecule.
A residue that is dispensable in one context may  be extremely important in another that differs only slightly;  e.g., Tyr437 appears to make a much larger contribution to  binding Ang as part of Y434A than as part of wild-type hRI.
  However, it might also be possible to exploit negative  cooperativity to increase affinity, if methods can be devised  for uncoupling the various residues so that they can all fulfill  their full binding potential in the presence of the others.
