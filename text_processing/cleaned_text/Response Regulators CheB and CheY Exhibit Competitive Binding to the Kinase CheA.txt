With isothermal titration calorimetry, it was demonstrated that CheA and a CheA fragment   composed of amino acid residues 1-233 (CheAl-233) bound to CheY with similar dissociation constants   of 2.0 and 1.2 pM at 298 K, respectively, indicating that the CheY binding site is wholly within the   1-233 amino acid locus.
CheB bound to CheAl-233 with a KD of 3.2 pM, and also bound to intact CheA   with the same affinity.
CheY was found to compete with CheB for binding to CheA1-233, in spite of the   low level'of sequence identity between CheY and the regulatory domain of CheB. The competitive nature   of CheY and CheB binding was determined in two independent sets of experiments: titration experiments   in which either a CheB-CheA1-233 complex was titrated with CheY or CheB was titrated with a CheYCheAl-233 complex, and competitive affinity chromatography experiments that used Ni-NTA-chelating   resin as an affinity matrix for complexes of the histidine-tagged CheA1-233 fragment and CheY or CheB.   The effects of phosphorylation, binding-site mutations, and active-site mutations were also studied to   probe the influence of conformational changes in CheY as a regulatory mechanism of CheY-CheA   interactions.
Phosphorylated CheY, in the presence of excess EDTA, was found to have a 2-fold lower   affinity for CheA1-233, and 6 mM Mg2' further reduced the affinity of phosphorylated CheY for CheA1-233   (ca. 3-fold), although Mg2+ on its own had no effect on the interactions of either CheB or CheY with   CheAl-233.
The data thus indicate that phosphorylated CheY has a significantly lower affinity for CheA   under physiological conditions.
The idea that phosphorylation may induce a significant conformational   change, reducing the strength of the CheY-CheA interactions, is supported by the relative values of the   association constants measured for CheY active-site and binding-site mutants.
A binding-site mutation   (A103V) in CheY, which is remote from the site of phosphorylation produced a 10-fold reduction in K,,   whereas active-site mutations produced a modest (2-fold) reduction.
  As it swims through solution Escherichia coli continuously   samples the local concentrations of nutrients and toxins,   which are identified as attractants or repellents by their   specific binding interactions to integral membrane receptor   proteins and by the behavioral responses that are subsequently generated.
Detection of chemoeffector concentration   versus time permits the bacterium to respond positively to   gradients of attractants and negatively to repellents using a   signal transduction pathway that couples changes in chemical   concentration to the motility apparatus of the cell [reviewed   A This research was supported by U.S. Public Health Service Grants   AI-19296 (M.I.S.) and GM-42636 (R.M.W.) and a Young Investigator   Award from the Beckman Foundation (R.M.W.).

Abstract published in Advance ACS Absrmcrs, November 1, 1995.   in Bourret et al. (1991); Stock et al. (1992), and Alex and   Simon (1994)l. The histidine kinase CheA plays a central   role in this pathway, as it is involved in the response and   adaptation to all of the chemoeffectors processed through   the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, which are a   thoroughly characterized class of integral membrane receptor   proteins in prokaryotes [reviewed in Hazelbauer (1992)l.
  Changes in receptor occupancy result in behavioral responses   that occur rapidly in comparison to the process of adaptation,   which is mediated by changes in the level of receptor   covalent modification.
Both the receptor occupancy and the   level of covalent modification influence the autophosphorylation rate of CheA by ATP through direct protein   interaction between the kinase and chemoreceptors in a   complex also containing Chew (Gegner et al., 1992; Schuster   et al., 1993).
Phosphorylated CheA kinase is the phosphate   donor for CheY and CheB (Hess et al., 1988), and signal   amplification is generated by repeated cycling through the   autophosphorylation and the phosphotransfer reactions.
  CheY and CheB, 14 and 37 kDa, respectively, are members   of the response regulator family of signal transduction   0006-2960/95/0434- 14626$09.00/0 0 1995 American Chemical Society CheB and CheY Binding to CheA   proteins (Stock et al., 1985).
Where CheY is composed only   of the response regulator domain, CheB has in addition a   catalytic domain at the carboxyl terminus facilitating the   hydrolysis of methyl esters on the receptor protein (Stock   & Koshland, 1978; Lupas & Stock, 1989; Stewart et al.,   1990).
Both phosphorylated CheY and CheB are the active   forms; phosphorylated CheY interacts with the motor switch   proteins, thereby promoting clockwise motor rotation in E.   coli and Salmonella typhimurium, a close relative of E. coli   (Welch et al., 1993), and phosphorylated S. typhimurium   CheB has over 10-fold higher methylesterase activity in vitro   relative to the unphosphorylated form (Lupas & Stock, 1989).
  Since the elucidation of the basic biochemical (phosphorylation and methylation) reactions in the chemotaxis pathway, the focus of this field has shifted more toward   identifying the noncovalent protein-protein interactions in   the signal transduction cascade with emphasis on the   formation and characterization of behaviorally relevant   multiprotein complexes (McNally & Matsumura, 199 1 ;   Gegner & Dahlquist, 1991; Gegner et al., 1992; Long &   Weis, 1992; Swanson et al., 1993; Schuster et al., 1993;   Welch et al., 1993; Blat & Eisenbach, 1994).
CheA is   centrally positioned in the signal transduction chain, it   interacts both with the receptor and the response regulators,   CheY and CheB. CheA has been shown to form a highaffinity complex with CheY (McNally & Matsumura, 1991;   Swanson et al., 1993).
Fragments of CheA also bind to   CheY, allowing the binding domain on CheA to be localized   between residues 98 and 233 (Swanson et al., 1993; Momson   & Parkinson, 1994).
  In this study, the interactions of CheY and CheB with   CheA have been characterized using ITC,' which provides   the first complete report of all the thermodynamic parameters   in the binding reactions.
The competitive nature of CheB   and CheY binding was also established, and the effects of   point mutations in CheY and phosphorylation of CheY were   measured to determine the influence of conformation on the   strength of CheY-CheA interactions, which is a matter of   physiological significance for signal amplification.
The   relative affinities of CheB and CheY, the arrangement of   the binding site, and the effect of phosphorylation are all   important in developing a quantitative understanding of the   signal transduction process through modeling studies (Bray   et al., 1993; Hauri & Ross, 1995).
Finally, this binding study   provides information relevant to the analysis of molecular   recognition within the large family of histidine kinases and   response regulators.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS   Protein Puri3cation.
CheB was purified from the E. coli   cheA strain KO685 (Hess et al., 1987) containing the   expression vector pCW/cheB, a generous gift from A. F. Roth   and F. W. Dahlquist (University of Oregon).
After reaching   an apparent absorbance at 600 nm (OD600) equal to ca. 0.8   (approximate conversion factor: lo9 cells/mL/absorbance   unit), 1-L LB cultures (typically three or four) of KO685   transformed with pCWlcheB at 37 "C were induced to   I Abbreviations: ITC, isothermal titration microcalorimetry; SDSPAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis;   IPTG, isopropyl thio-P-o-galactoside; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl   fluoride; LB, Luria broth; GFC, gel filtration chromatography; NiNTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.
  Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 45, 1995 14627   express CheB by the addition of IPTG to 1 mM. Incubation   was maintained for 2-3 h more before the cells were   harvested by centrifugation (4800g for 10 min).
The high   level of expression from this plasmid made possible a   simplified purification scheme adapted from the procedure   of Simms et al. (1985).
Frozen cells were thawed and   resuspended in TrisNg buffer (25 mM Tris, 5 mM MgC12,   1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol) containing   0.1 mg of RNaseNmL, 0.1 mg of DNase VmL, and 0.5 mM   PMSF.
The suspended cells were lysed by sonication and   the resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 30   min at 123 OOOg.
The cleared lysate was fractionated by   adding 29.6 g of (NH4)2S04 per 100 mL while stirring on   ice.
After 30 min on ice, the solution was centrifuged   (27000g for 30 min), the supernatant was discarded, and the   pellet was resuspended and dialyzed against TrisNg buffer.
  The dialyzed solution was passed over a DEAE-cellulose   column (2.5 cm i.d. x 6 cm) equilibrated in TrisNg buffer.
  The column flow-through and effluent from one column   volume wash were pooled and concentrated either by   centrifugation (3000g) in a Centriprep- 10 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) or by precipitation with 49 g of (NH&   SO4 per 100 mL. Concentrated protein was dialyzed against   50 mM NaP04, 5 mM MgC12, pH 7, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol.
The final purification step was either FPLC gel   filtration performed at 0.5 mL/min using a Superdex-75 HR   10/30 column equilibrated in 25 mM Tris, 50 mM KCI, 5   mM MgC12, pH 7.5, or alternatively chromatography on a   2.5 cm i.d. x 4 cm Affi-gel Blue column.
Affi-gel Blue   chromatography was performed by binding the protein to   the column and washing with the dialysis buffer containing   25 mM NaCl.
The protein was then eluted with the same   buffer containing 1 M NaCI.
  CheA1-233 was purified from E. coli strain M15 containing   plasmids pREP4 and pRS 1-4 by chromatography on a NiNTA column as described previously (Swanson et al., 1993),   followed by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography which   consisted of a linear gradient from 0 to 0.7 M NaCl in 50   mM sodium phosphate, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM /3-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5.
CheA was purified according to published   procedures (Hess et al., 1988) in the E. coli strain RP3808   transformed with the plasmid pDV4 (a gift from P. Matsumura; McNally & Matsumura, 199 1) for CheA expression.
  CheY was purified according to published protocols (Matsumura et al., 1985; Sanders et al., 1989) from the E. coli   strain RP3808 transformed with the CheY expression plasmid   pCWlcheY, a gift from F. W. Dahlquist. C~~YYSIC, C~~YDI~K,   CheY~12~,~57~, and CheY~lo3" were purified as previously   described (Swanson et al., 1993).
  Determination of 'Protein Concentrations.
To measure   protein concentrations precisely, several methods were used   to determine the molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm (280)   of CheA, CheA1-233, CheB, and CheY. The proteins used   in the determination of molar extinction coefficients were   judged to be '95% pure by scanning densitometry of   samples resolved on Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels.
  Absorbance spectra for each of the proteins were recorded   from 250 to 340 nm using a Cary 14 UV-visible spectrophotometer, and the absorbance difference between 280 and   320 nm was taken as A280.
The masses of protein samples   were determined by amino acid analysis on an AB1 model   420/130A derivatizedanalyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster   City, CA), and also, using independent samples, determined 14628 Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 45, 1995   by the BCA assay (Smith et al., 1985).
The masses of CheY   and CheAI-233 were also determined by the method of dry   weights (Kupke & Dorrier, 1978).
Values for the molar   extinction coefficient obtained by the different methods were   found to be in good agreement.
The averaged unit absorbances at 280 nm in a 1 cm path cuvette were calculated to   be 2.9, 4.9, 1.7, and 1.3 mg/mL of CheA, CheA1-233, CheB   and CheY, respectively.
Using molecular weights of 73, 27,   37, and 14 kDa for CheA, CheAl-r33, CheB, and CheY, the   respective 6280 values of 25 000, 5 500, 22 000, and 11 000   (M cm)-' were computed.
  Phosphorylation of CheY. To test the effect of CheY   phosphorylation on CheA-CheY interactions, CheY was   phosphorylated using the protocol developed by Lukat et al.   (1992) using acetyl phosphate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,   Catalog No. A0262) as the phosphodonor.
The extent of   phosphorylation was determined by the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence as described previously (Lukat et al.,   1992) using a PTI QM-1 spectrofluorometer.
CheY was   incubated in reaction buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 20   mM NaC1,6 mM MgC12, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10%   (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM acetyl phosphate, pH 7.4) for 20 min   at room temperature.
Phosphorylated CheY was used   immediately in the calorimetry experiments described below.
  In some cases the reactions were stopped by the addition of   EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mM.   All titrations were   carried out using a MicroCal MCS ultrasensitive titration   calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) with Observer software for instrument control and data acquisition.
  Instrumentation, software, and data analysis have been   described elsewhere (Wiseman et al., 1989; Brandts et al.,   1990; Lin et al., 1994).
Before a titration experiment, protein   samples designated for the reaction cell (1.343 mL) and the   syringe (100 or 250 pL) were dialyzed against buffer (0.5   L, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,   1 mM PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4) in the same flask   overnight at 4 "C. Titrations were carried out in the same   buffer over a range of temperatures (8.2-38.5 "C), using a   syringe-stirring speed of 500 rpm.
Typical titration experiments consisted of 10-30 injections in which the individual   injections were 5-10 pL each and were made every 3-4   min.
The calibrated cell feedback signal @cal/s) was   collected at 2-s intervals.
In most cases the areas derived   from the first injection were not used in the analysis since   anomolously small values were observed, presumably due   to sample dilution during the pre-equilibration step.
Experimental data were corrected for buffer mismatch by   subtracting a value similar in magnitude to the heat of   injection after the system had reached saturation, which was   determined as the average heat of the last three injections.
  The Origin software supplied with the instrument was used   to analyze data according to a single-set-of-sites model from   which values for the binding stoichiometry, n, the enthalpy   of binding, AH, and the association constant, K,, were   obtained.
The n value is defined as the molar binding ratio   of the molecule in the syringe to the molecule in the reaction   cell, and binding enthalpies are expressed in kilocalories per   mole of injectant.
The values of K,, AH, and n returned by   the fits were used to compute AS" and AGO at the   experimental temperature (r).
Whenever possible the binding reactions were carried out at either two or more   temperatures, so that the change in the heat capacity (AC,,)   Isothermal Titration Calorimetry.   Li et al.   accompanying the association reaction could be determined   and used to compute values of the thermodynamic parameters   at the standard temperature (298 K, referred to hereafter as   TO) which were reported as average values for the association   reactions summarized in Table 1.
To check the stability of   the proteins during a titration, samples were compared by   SDS -PAGE before and immediately after titration.
There   was no proteolysis evident in the samples reported in this   study.
  In experiments with phosphorylated CheY and CheA1-233,   fluorescence quenching was measured before and after   titration experiments to demonstrate that the level of phosphorylation was unchanged during the course of the experiment.
Since CheAl-233 has no Trp residues, it does not   contribute significantly to the tryptophan emission spectrum.
  Fluorescence quenching was also used to monitor the extent   of CheY phosphorylation over the course of a typical titration   experiment (ca. 90 min) to evaluate the extent of CheY   phosphorylation in titration experiments where the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions had not been   stopped by the prior addition of EDTA.
In these experiments, phosphorylated CheY was added to both the sample   cell and the reference cell to balance the effects of the   phosphorylation and hydrolysis heats of reaction.
  Competitive Binding Assay with Ni-NTA Affinity Resin.
  Experiments were carried out using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen   Corp., Chatsworth, CA) to determine the competitive nature   of CheY and CheB binding by an independent method.
500   pmol His-tagged CheAl-233 was captured on Ni-NTA resin   (ca. 10 mg of resin, providing an excess of Ni-NTA binding   sites) in a mixture that contained either 250 pmol of CheY   or 380 pmol of CheB in phosphate buffer (50 mM sodium   phosphate, 150 mM NaC1, 2 mM /3-mercaptoethanol, pH   7.5).
In some tubes either an additional 3.8 nmol of CheB   or 2.5 nmol of CheY was added.
The total volume was   adjusted to 50 pL with buffer, and the samples were   equilibrated on ice for 5 min.
The Ni-NTA resin was then   separated from the supernatant by passing the sample through   1.5 mL micropure separators (Amicon Corp., Beverly, MA)   at 16,OOOg for 4 min.
Protein that remained bound to the   Ni-NTA resin was collected by resuspending the resin in   40 pL of phosphate buffer that also contained 250 mM   imidazole, and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation after a 5, min incubation period.
5-pL aliquots of the   supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
  RESULTS   Titration Calorimetry of CheY and CheAl-233.
A series   of titration experiments were carried out which verified that   CheAl-233 bound to CheY in a 1:l ratio.
The top data trace   in Figure la shows six 10-pL control injections, spaced at   200-s intervals, of a 0.51 mM CheAl-233 solution into buffer   at 1 1.5 "C. Titrations of CheAl-233 into solutions of CheY   at 11.3 and 28.5 "C are shown in the middle and lower traces   of Figure 1 a, respectively.
Experimental parameters, including protein concentrations and titration temperatures, are   summarized in Table 1.
The large exothermic peaks   recorded in the middle and lower curves were due to the   specific binding of CheAl-233 to CheY. The injection heats   displayed a steady decrease in exothermicity as higher mole   ratios of CheAI-233 to CheY were produced.
The heats   became endothermic and displayed little change in area once CheB and CheY Binding to CheA   Table 1: Thermodynamic Parameters for Titrations Involving CheA with CheY or CheB"   Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 45, 1995 14629   mean values at 298 K (fsd) AH AGO 4 protein (concn)   expt reaction cell temp Ka (kcall (kcal/ ASo (kcal/ Ka298 AH'298 no.

Standard deviations were calculated from the averages of Kd, AH", and ASo   at 298 K. The buffer in all experiments was 20 mM sodium phosphate, 20 mM NaC1, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10% (vh) glycerol, pH 7.4,   unless indicated otherwise.
6 mM MgC12 was added to the titration buffer.

Neither   n nor K, could be determined from the data since AH % 0.
  the binding sites on CheY for CheA1-233 were saturated.
The   endothermic peaks (which point upward from the base line)   seen in the control and the last several injections in the   titrations were due to the buffer mismatch between the   solution in the syringe and the reaction cell.
In several   control experiments, where the CheAl-233 fragment was   injected into buffer, the observed heats were nearly constant   as a function of the injection number (e.g., see Figure la).
  The magnitudes of the heats in different control experiments   were found to be proportional to the difference in the sample   dialysis temperature prior to the experiment (4 "C) and the   experimental temperature (ranging from 8.5 to 38.5 "C).
This   mismatch was attributed to the differences in the temperature   dependence of the buffer pH and the pH of the protein   solution, and was subtracted as background.
  The background-corrected, integrated heats are plotted in   Figure lb as kcal per mol of CheA1-233 injected versus the   molar ratio of CheA1-233 to CheY. The open circles are the   integrated heats of titration at 11.3 "C, and the open squares   are the integrated data obtained at 28.5 "C. Fits of the data   to a single-set-of-sites model (Wiseman et al., 1989) were   drawn through the data in Figure lb and provided estimates   of the binding stoichiometry (n), the enthalpy of binding   (AH) and the association constant (K,).
An n value of 0.94   was obtained from the fit of the 11.3 "C data.
This n value   agreed well with the average value (0.94 & 0.03) determined   from five titrations (Table 1, expts 1-5), indicating that   CheAl-233 and CheY interacted in a 1:l ratio.
The values   K, and AH were determined from the data plotted in Figure   lb were 16.7 x lo5 M-' and -9.3 kcal/mol, respectively,   at 11.3 "C and 6.7 x lo5 M-' and -13.5 kcal/mol at 28.5   "C. AC, of binding was found to be -0.22 kcal/mol/deg   using the values AH determined from five experiments   (Table 1, expts 1-5) including those determined from the   data plotted in Figure lb.
Ka298 and AH298 were determined   to be 8.1 x lo5 f 8 x lo4 M-' and -12.0 f 0.5 kcal/mol,   respectively, from the same five experiments, using AC, to   adjust the values obtained from individual experiments to   TO so that they could be averaged.
Finally, the average value   of the entropy change (AS"298) accompanying CheYCheAI-233 binding was calculated to be -13 f 2 eu.
  To check the consistency of the parameters determined   from the experiments described above, CheA1-233 and CheY   were exchanged so that CheAl-233 (in the reaction cell) was   titrated with CheY (in the syringe) under otherwise identical   conditions.
Figure 2a includes plots of the raw data of the   injection series of CheY into a solution of CheAl-233 at 10.5   "C (top) and 28.5 "C (middle).
The raw data were subjected   to the same data treatment described above, resulting in the   integrated data and fit curves plotted in Figure 2b of   normalized binding heat per mole of CheY injected as a   function of the mole ratio of CheY to CheA1-233.
The open   circles and squares represent the data obtained at 10.5 and   28.5 "C, respectively.
The data were described very well   by a simple model that fit the data to a single set of sites.
  Values for n, K,, AH, and AC, obtained from the titrations   of CheA1-233 with CheY were in good agreement with the   parameters obtained from the inverted titrations, i.e. CheY   titrated with CheAl-233.
The average value of n determined   from four experiments (Table 1, expts 6-9) was 0.97 f 0.06. 14630 Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 45, 1995   Time, minutes   0 10 20 30 40 50 60   28 I 1 I I.i,j I1 1   ,&&& control, 11 soc a   Li et al.

The top curve in panel a is a control experiment   consisting of IO-pL injections of the CheA1-233 fragment into buffer   (as described in Materials and Methods) at 11.5 "C. The second   and third curves in panel a are titrations of CheY with CheAl-233   at 11.3 and 28.5 "C, respectively, using 10-pL injections and the   protein concentrations specified in Table 1 (expts 2 and 5).
Panel   b shows the integrated areas for the titrations between CheAl-233   and CheY at 11.3 (0) and 28.5 "C (0).
The lines plotted with the   data are the best-fit curves described by the values of n, Ka, and   AH listed in Table 1.
  Also from the same four experiments AC,, was determined   to be -0.23 kcal/mol/deg using the AH values.
Ka298,   AH'&, and As0298, obtained from the titrations of CheA1-233   with CheY (9 x lo5 & 2 x lo5 M-l, -1 1.7 f 0.7 kcal/mol,   and - 12 f 2 eu) were in agreement with the corresponding   values from titrations of CheY with CheAl-233 (see Table   1).
Since the titrations of CheAl-233 with CheY (Figure 2a)   exhibited a small buffer mismatch (and slightly exothermic),   the possibility that the mismatch observed in titrations of   CheY with CheA1-233 (Figure la) could have significantly   affected the results was eliminated.
  Intact CheA and CheAl-233 Bind to CheY with Similar   AfJinities.
Most titrations were carried out using the CheAl-233   fragment since it was readily purified in high yield and did   not precipitate at the high concentrations required in the   syringe.
However, a few titrations were carried out between   intact CheA and CheY to determine what effect, if any, the   deletion of amino acids 234-654 had on CheA-CheY   interactions.
Raw data from one such titration (Table 1, expt   11) carried out at 28.0 "C is plotted in Figure 2a (bottom   curve) which after curve-fitting with the single-set-of-sites   model resulted in a value for the association constant of 5.1   x lo5 M-l.
The value of K, determined for CheY and intact   CheA is ca. 60% of the value determined for CheAl-233.
The   modest difference in K, measured by ITC contrasts sharply   with the relative values determined using SPR (Schuster et   al., 1993; Swanson et al., 1993), where CheY was observed   to bind 12-fold more tightly to intact CheA relative to   CheAl-233.

Panel b plots the integrated areas   for the titrations between CheAl-233 and CheY at 11.3 (0) and   28.5 "C (O), and for the titration between intact CheA and CheY   (W).
The lines plotted through the data are the best-fit curves   described by the values of n, Ka, and AH listed in Table 1.
  responsible for the difference in binding constants observed   by SPR (see Discussion).
In contrast, the ITC experiments   (Figures 1 and 2; Table 1) measured single-site interactions,   which indicated that the majority of the binding interactions   between CheY and CheA resided in the first 233 amino acids.
  The modest decrease in the affinity of the interactions   between CheY and intact CheA may be experimentally   significant.
Two plausible explanations include either a small   (negative) contribution of the carboxyl tail of CheA to   binding or a weak negative cooperativity between sites in   the CheA dimer.
  Effects of Mg2+, Phosphorylation, and Mutation on CheACheY Interactions.
Several factors that might influence the   interactions between CheA and CheY were explored: the   presence of divalent cation (Mg2+), which is required for   the phosphotransfer reaction; the influence of mutations near   the active site and the putative CheA-CheY-binding surface,   and phosphorylation of aspartate-57 in the active site.
Figure   3 plots representative results of some of these experiments.
  5 mM Mg2+ was observed to have no significant effect on   the interaction of CheY with CheAl-233.
The values of K,   and AH determined from titrations in the presence of Mg2+   were, within experimental error, the same as the values   obtained in its absence. (Compare expt 12 in Table 1 with   expts 3-5.)   CheY was phosphorylated using acetyl phosphate, which   has been shown to be able to transfer phosphate to CheY   (Lukat et al., 1992).
The quenching of intrinsic tryptophan   fluorescence was used to estimate that the extent of CheY   phosphorylation was over 90% using the reaction conditions   described in Materials and Methods.
Titrations were carried CheB and CheY Binding to CheA Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 45, 1995 14631   I'I'I'I'I'II   "i h z -12   Y   0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5   Molar Ratio   FIGURE 3:Injection heats from titrations between CheAl-233 and   various CheYs.
CheY (reaction cell) was titrated with CheA1-233   (syringe) under different conditions: CheY in the presence of 6   mM MgC12 (0), phosphorylated CheY in the presence of excess   EDTA (*), and the A103V mutant of CheY (W) according to the   specific conditions summarized in Table 1, experiments 12, 14,   and 16, respectively.
In the titration of phosphorylated CheY in   the presence of 6 mM MgClP (0), 40 pM CheY was titrated with   1.05 mM CheAl-233 in reaction buffer using 8-pL injections at 28   "C, as described in Materials and Methods.

K, values obtained from experiments where the   phosphotransfer reaction was first quenched with EDTA were   ca. 50% of the values obtained with unphosphorylated CheY.   Figure 3 shows the integrated heats and fits to a titration   (Table 1, expt 14) between CheA1-233 and CheY-P carried   out at 28.2 "C that produced an association constant of 3.8   x IO5 M-'.
Although the value for Ka298, determined with   CheY-P was ca.
50% of Ka298 determined with CheY, the   values of AH0298 were the same within experimental error   (12.0 f 0.1 kcal/mol).
  Titration experiments performed with CheAl-233 and CheY   in which both acetyl phosphate and Mg2+ were present (Le.,   in the absence of EDTA to quench the reaction) produced   values of K, that were ca. 6-fold lower than unphosphorylated   CheY. Integrated heats from a titration carried out at 28.0   "C between 1.05 mM CheAl-233 (syringe) and 40 pM CheY   (reaction cell) are plotted in Figure 3.
The experiment   consisted of sixteen 8-pL injections in a buffer [20 mM   sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 20 mM NaC1, 1 mM EDTA,   1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol (v/v)] that also contained 6 mM   MgC12 and 20 mM acetyl phosphate.
Under these conditions   the phosphorylation reaction was estimated to be ca.
90%   complete by fluorescence quenching (data not shown).
K,,   AH, and n were determined from the data and found to be   1.5 x lo5 M-I, -7.9 kcal/mol and 0.95, respectively.
A   second experiment carried out in the same buffer system but   at 7.5 "C with 0.58 mM CheAl-233 and 60 pM CheY   produced respective values for K,, AH, and n of 3.0 x lo5   M-I, -9.0 kcal/mol, and 0.98.
From these data it would   appear that binding of Mg2+ at the active site and phosphorylation at aspartate-57 of CheY together have a significant   effect on the interaction of CheA with CheY.   Four mutants of CheY were tested for altered affinity to   CheA. The most significant decrease in affinity was detected   with an alanine-103 to valine (A103V) point mutant of CheY   which yielded titration data with values for Ka298 that were   10-fold lower than wild type CheY (Figure 3 and Table 1).
  Alanine-103 of CheY is proposed to be near to the CheYCheA binding interface, a conclusion based on the analysis   of changes in the I5N-'H correlation spectrum of CheY which   are observed to occur upon binding of CheAl-233.
On this   basis, CheYA103v was investigated and shown to be defective   in binding CheAl-233 (Swanson et al., 1995).
The activesite point mutant aspartate-I3 to lysine (D13K), which   produces the tumble phenotype in cells without being   phosphorylated (Bourret et al., 1990), and the D12E, D57E   nonphosphorylatable double mutant of CheY were both   found to bind to CheA1-233 with an affinity ca.
2-fold lower   than wild type CheY (data not shown).
Finally, the tyrosine51 to cysteine (Y51C) point mutant that was used in SPR   studies of CheA-CheY interactions (Schuster et al., 1993;   Swanson et al., 1993) was found to yield values of K, (Table   1, expts 17 and 18) similar to wild type CheY. Observations   from this small sample of CheY mutants were consistent with   the interpretation that the effects of the mutations tended to   be local, Le., the largest effects on binding were observed   when the mutations were made close to the CheA-CheY   binding interface.
  Interaction of CheB with CheAl-233 Observed by GFC.
  Gel filtration chromatography was used to qualitatively   characterize the interaction between CheA1-233 with CheB.   As shown in Figure 4a, top trace, CheB eluted from the gel   filtration column with a volume that was consistent with the   molecular mass of 37 kDa (upper trace) and agreed well with   the predicted mass of the monomer on the basis of sequence   data (Mutoh & Simon, 1986).
As described by Swanson et   al. (1993) and shown in Figure 4a (bottom trace), CheAl-233   eluted with a retention time characteristic of a 45 kDa   globular protein, which was significantly larger than the   predicted M, of 27 kDa based on sequence.
CheAl-233 was   a monomer nonetheless since it eluted with a retention   volume that was significantly smaller than the smallest   possible elution volume based on a globular dimer of   CheA1-233 (54 ma).
When a mixture of CheAl-233 and   CheB (1.5-fold molar excess of CheA1-233) was coinjected   (Figure 4a, middle trace), the CheB was found to elute with   a larger apparent mass, as determined by PAGE analysis of   the column fractions (Figure 4b), suggesting that the two   proteins formed a 1:l complex.
  Titration Calorimetry of CheB and CheA. Titrations of   CheB in the reaction cell with CheAl-233 in the syringe were   carried out under conditions similar to those of CheY with   CheA1-233 at four different temperatures, 8.5, 18.8, 28.0, and   38.2 "C, according to the concentrations of CheAl-233 and   CheB listed in Table 1 (expts 19-22).
The heat of binding   was nearly zero at 8.5 "C (expt 19), which precluded   estimates of K, and n being made at that temperature.
  Nevertheless, those data were still useful in determining ACp,   where a plot of AH versus temperature indicated a linear   relationship and produced a value of -0.45 kcal/mol/deg by   linear regression (R = 0.993).
Using AC,, the association   constant for CheAl-233 and CheB (Ka298) was estimated as   3.1 x lo5 M-I, which was 40% of the value determined for   CheAl-233-CheY interactions. "Inverted" titrations with   CheA1-233 in the reaction cell and CheB in the syringe were   not carried out because the solubility limits of CheB   prevented its use in the syringe.
  It was interesting to note that AH0298 and As0298 of   CheAl-vs-CheB association (Table 1) were both significantly 14632 Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 45, 1995   a   Li et al.   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ?l 12 13 14 MW/loOO   11111111111   Volume (ml)   0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20   Fraction b 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14   Chef3   Chef3   CheAl -233   CheAl -233   FIGURE 4: Results of GFC experiments with CheB and CheAl-2.33.

  smaller than the values characterizing the interactions   between CheAt-233 and CheY. The decrease in magnitude   of both AH0298 and ASo298 had compensating effects on   AG0298, so the difference in AG0298 (and thus Ka?9g) for the   two processes was modest by comparison.
The thermodynamic parameters in Table 1 indicate that the enthalpic and   entropic contributions to AGO298 for the binding of CheY   and CheB to CheA 1-233 are significantly different.
Comparison of the entropic contribution (ToASo298) to AG0z98   provides a simple illustration of the difference in the driving   force for complex formation.

  These data indicate a similarity in the binding of CheY and   CheB to CheA, Le., residues 234-654 of CheA do not appear   to be involved in the binding process.
  CheB arid CheY Conipetc for Biiidiiig to CheAI-2.q.q usiiig   a Ni-NTA Bincling Assci!. CheY binding to CheA was   previously localized between residues 135 and 233 of the   intact CheA molecule in an SPR binding study (Swanson et   al., 1993).
The N-terminal regulatory domain of the methylesterase (CheB) is phosphorylated on a conserved aspartate   residue but otherwise has a relatively low (23%) amino acid   identity with CheY (Mutoh & Simon. 1986).
To test whether   CheY and CheB recognized the same site on CheA, the   competitive binding experiment summarized in Figure 5 was   carried out.
The gel lanes in Figure 5 report the ability of   CheAl-233.
CheY, and CheB to bind to the affinity matrix   (Ni-NTA Sepharose).
when the proteins were incubated   either individually or in various mixtures.
When incubated   in phosphate buffer without imidazole, CheAl-7-33 was   completely removed from the solution by the Ni-NTA sites   on the Sepharose beads (which are in excess) through a highaffinity interaction with the (histidine)h tag located at the   C-terminus of CheAI-233 (lane 1).
The CheAI-233 eluted   when the Sepharose beads were washed with phosphate   buffer containing 250 mM imidazole (lane 2).
Neither CheY   nor CheB bound to the Ni-NTA Sepharose when they were   subjected to the same treatment (lanes 3-6).
When either   CheY or CheB was incubated with a stoichiometric excess   of CheA1-2.13 and Ni-NTA Sepharose, the majority of   protein was bound to the Ni-NTA Sepharose and then   coeluted (with CheAl-2;;) in the 250 mM imidazole wash   (lanes 7-10).
These results demonstrated that CheY and   CheB were captured on the affinity matrix via specific   interactions with CheAI-2;;. In other experiments, a smaller   fragment of CheA (residues 1 - 134 of CheA followed by   the C-terminal-histidine affinity tag) could also be captured   by and eluted from the Ni-NTA Sepharose in the same   manner as CheAI-233. but neither ClieY nor CheB could he   captured using CheAI-l;l (data not shown).
These results   demonstrate that amino acid residues 135-233 are required CheB and CheY Binding to CheA Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 45, 1995 14633   change in the magnitude of the heats between the first and   last injection was small, ca. 2 kcaYmol injectant.
This range   was 4-fold smaller than the range of heats observed in simple   titrations and was consistent with the expected enthalpy   change (AAH) for the displacement of one Che protein by   the other.
As described below a more careful analysis of   the data demonstrated that the results were consistent with   competitive binding between CheB and CheY.   The top injection series in Figure 6a consisted of eighteen   10-pL injections of 0.83 mM CheY into a solution that was   0.026 mM in CheAl-2p and 0.051 mM in CheB. The   gradual increase in the areas of the endothermic peaks was   indicative of an exothermic process.
The heats tended toward   a steady level, which was assumed to contribute a constant   background and was subtracted from the data.
This resulted   in a series of heats that resembled a low-affinity, weaklyexothermic binding process which was expected for displacement of CheB by CheY (calculated AAH -3 kcall   mol at 28.5 "C, see Table 1).
The lower injection series of   Figure 6a were obtained with a larger proportion of CheB   (1.29 mM CheY, 0.035 mM CheA1-233, and 0.11 mM CheB).
  These two experiments produced qualitatively similar results,   indicating that CheB was competing with CheY in binding   to CheAl-233.
A second type of competitive titration   experiment (not shown), in which CheY was displaced from   the CheAl -233-CheY complex by CheB, was also consistent   with competitive binding.
Finally a control experiment (not   shown) which consisted of nine 10-pL injections of 0.17 mM   CheY into 10 pM CheB gave no indication of an interaction   between CheY and CheB.   Data from the competitive titration experiments were found   to be in quantitative agreement with the thermodynamic   parameters determined from the simple binding studies of   CheY and CheB with CheA1-233.
On the basis of competitive binding, the trends displayed by the titration data in   Figure 6b could be explained with computed values for an   apparent binding constant, Kapp, and the difference in the   binding enthalpies of CheY and CheB, AAH.
The latter   were estimated using the thermodynamic parameters obtained   in the direct binding experiments.

  for CheB binding, as demonstrated previously for CheY   (Swanson et al., 1993).
  CheB and CheY compete with one another for binding to   CheAl-233.
For example, when a large excess of CheY was   added to the mixture of CheB and CheAl-233, the majority   of CheB was not captured by Ni-NTA Sepharose but   remained in the supernatant (Figure 5, lane 1 l), and CheY   was the predominant protein that coeluted with CheAl-233   (lane 12).
Some CheB also coeluted with CheA1-233, but in   an amount that was consistent with the relative association   constants and concentrations of CheY and CheB used in the   experiment.
Similar behavior was observed when the relative   concentrations of CheY and CheB were reversed.
With a   large stoichiometric excess of CheB relative to CheY (ca.
  15-fold), CheB was the major protein that was observed to   coelute with CheA1-233 (lanes 13 and 14).
These results   provide strong evidence for competitive binding of CheB   and CheY to CheAl-233.
The competition for binding to   CheAI-233 was not a nonspecific effect due to large protein   concentrations, since BSA at similar high concentrations did   not affect the interaction of either CheY or CheB with   CheAI-233 (data not shown).
  Competitive ITC Experiments with CheAI-233, CheY, and   CheB. The results of the Ni-NTA affinity binding experiments demonstrate that a large excess of CheY could   compete for binding with CheB to CheA1-233.
Competition   between CheY and CheB was also tested in ITC experiments   in which the ratio of CheY to CheB was varied continuously.
  Raw data from two experiments carried out at 28.5 "C are   plotted in Figure 6a, where the CheAl-233-CheB complex   (CheAl-233 in an excess of CheB) was titrated with CheY.   The integrated heats are plotted in Figure 6b.

  Kapp was estimated using values for KAY and KAB of 6.5 x   lo5 and 2.5 x IO5 M-l, respectively, and -3.1 kcal/mol was   used for AAH. [Bfree] was computed as the average of the   free CheB concentration at the beginning and the end of the   titration.
Values for Kapp of 2.7 x lo4 and 5.8 x IO4 M-I   were estimated from eq 1 using values of 93 and 41 pM for   [Bfree], respectively, and were used to generate the theoretical titration curves for the integrated heats plotted in Figure   6b (as circles and squares, respectively).
Considering the   approximations that were made in deriving eq 1, estimating   [Bfree], and taking into account the small values of both Kapp   and AAH, the agreement between the simulations and the   -   -   -   - 14634 Biochemistiy, Vol. 34, No. 45, 1995   data was found to be quite reasonable, and thus these   titrations experiments provided additional support for competitive binding of CheB and CheY to the same (or mutually   exclusive) site(s) on CheA.   Li et al.   found to differ significantly (2.7 x lo6 and 3.3 x lo7 M-I,   respectively), indicating that CheY interacted 10-fold more   tightly with intact CheA. In contrast the ITC experiments   reported here have produced comparable values of K, for   complexes of CheY and either CheA or CheA1-233 (Table   1).
This rather significant discrepancy undoubtedly resides   in the differences between the two methods of measurement.
  ITC measures the single-site equilibrium association constant   directly between two molecules in solution.
SPR experiments often determine K, indirectly using rates of binding   and dissociation between a molecule covalently attached to   a polymeric matrix on a sensing chip and a second freely   diffusing molecule.
Furthermore, CheA-CheY interactions   measured by SPR may be influenced by possible multivalent   interactions between the intact CheA protein, which is   dimeric, and the polymer-bound CheY, which can behave   as a multivalent ligand if the density of sites is sufficiently   large.
CheAI-233 has been demonstrated to be a monomer   (Swanson et al., 1993; Figure 4) and thus is unable to exhibit   the same avidity effect as the intact dimer.
A similar 10-   fold ratio between the SPR and ITC-determined association   constants has been observed in a study of proline-rich   peptides (derived from the Ras guanine nucleotide releasing   factor, Son of Sevenless) binding to Grb2, which has two   peptide binding sites per Grb2 protein (Lemmon et al., 1994).
  For a discussion of the effects of multivalency on the   measured values of K,, see Ladbury et al. (1995).
It thus   appears that the major difference in K,(CheA)/K,(CheAI -233)   estimated by SPR and ITC may be explained by multivalent   interactions.
Differences in the absolute values of K,   between our study and the previous studies of CheYCheA1-233 interactions might be due to differences in the   buffer composition, although conditions unique to the SPR   experiment (e.g., possible effects of the polymer matrix and   the determination of K, using kinetic data) may also be   significant.
  Effects of CheY Phosphorylation on CheA-CheY Interactions.
Phosphorylated CheY generates tumbles of the   bacterial cell by enhancing the probability of clockwise motor   rotation through direct interaction with a switch complex   protein (FliM) on the motor (Welch et al., 1993).
The data   presented here indicate that phosphorylation lowers the   affinity of CheY-CheA interactions (ca. 6-fold in the   presence of Mg2+).
This may be physiologically significant,   since a higher affinity for unphosphorylated CheY will   improve the efficiency of the phosphotransfer reaction as a   signal amplification process.
  Experimentally it was found that mutations in the phosphorylation site of CheY had little effect on CheY-CheA   interactions.
For example the activated CheYD13K mutant,   which has been found to produce the same effect on tumble   generation as phosphorylated CheY (Bourret et al., 1990),   binds to CheA with an affinity comparable to wild type   CheY. Yet phosphorylation of CheY resulted in a comparatively large reduction in K,, and a similar large reduction   was produced by the A 103V mutation.
Alanine- 103 residue   has been implicated in CheA-CheY interactions by NMR   studies (Swanson et al., 1995).
These results may be   explained by postulating that phosphorylation produces a   significant conformational change which propagates from the   site of phosphorylation to the CheA-CheY binding interface,   and that mutations introduce relatively small perturbations   restricted to the region in close proximity to the mutation.
  DISCUSSION   Properties of CheY and CheB Binding to CheA. The   results of this study demonstrate that the binding of CheY   and CheB to the CheA1-233 fragment is competitive, that the   individual affinities of CheY and CheB for CheA1-233 are   comparable (differing by a factor of 2), and that truncating   CheA has little effect on the strength of the interactions with   either CheB or CheY. These results are summarized in Table   1.
On first inspection, the similarity in the strength of the   binding interaction is unexpected given that E. coli CheY   and the amino terminal domain of CheB have only a   moderate amount of sequence identity, ca.
23% (Mutoh &   Simon, 1986).
Furthermore, the majority of the conserved   residues are found in the region of the active site, which are   regarded as part of the consensus residues in the CheY   superfamily (Volz, 1993).
Considering that a seemingly   subtle change caused by a single mutation (A103V) near the   CheA-CheY binding interface can significantly reduce the   association constant (10-fold), one may arrive at the conclusion that, while the specific (favorable and unfavorable)   interactions of CheA with CheY may be very different from   those of CheA with CheB, the sum of the interactions must   be similar for the two cases.
  The negative value of AC, is a feature common to CheY   and CheB binding to CheA,~2~~, -0.22 and -0.45 kcal/mol/   deg, respectively, and is typical of protein association   reactions (Hibbits et al., 1994, and references therein).
A   negative AC, can be interpreted as qualitative evidence for   a decrease in the amount of hydrophobic surface in contact   with water (Brandts, 1964), although other factors may   contribute (Sturtevant, 1977).
A comparison of the measured   ACp values with structure-based estimates determined from   changes in solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface could be   carried out were the structures of all of the Che proteins and   their complexes known.
In other studies where such   comparisons have been made, the estimates were significantly smaller in magnitude than the measured values, so   that additional factors (e.g., changes in protein conformation   and dynamics) were required to explain the decrease in C,   not accounted for by the burial of nonpolar surface (Connelly   et al., 1993; Ladbury et al., 1994; Spolar & Record, 1994).
  In a similar vein, ITC experiments can provide two different   estimates of AH (i) AHcal as a direct result of the calorimetry   experiment and (ii) AH,,H derived from the temperaturedependence of K, (vant Hoff analysis).
Analysis of the   equilibrium constants in Table 1 yielded values for AH\.H   that were consistently smaller than the AHcal (average 65   %, range 40-90 70).
Although these differences appear to   be experimentally significant and have been observed in other   ITC studies [e.g., Lin et al. (1994), and J. F. Brandts, personal   communication], the reasons for the discrepancy are not   apparent.
  Comparison of Association Constants Determined by ITC   and SPR.
In previous SPR studies of CheA-CheY interactions (Schuster et al., 1993; Swanson et al., 1993) the   association constants measured at 24 C for CheYCheAl-233 and CheY -CheA (intact CheA) interactions were CheB and CheY Binding to CheA   This difference in the sphere of influence that mutations and   phosphorylation produce is consistent with the interpretations   drawn from 19F NMR studies of CheY conformation (Bourret   et al., 1993; Drake et al., 1993).
The results of the ITC   experiments and the global effect of phosphorylation   uersus the local effect of a mutation taken together imply   that the CheA-CheY binding interface is (at least partly)   separate from the site of phosphorylation.
  Sign8cance for Information Processing in Bacterial Signal   Transduction Systems.
The chemosensory pathway requires   coordination of the receptor-mediated excitation and adaptation processes, which are both influenced by changes in the   concentrations of chemoeffectors.
The methylatable receptors in E. coli exert their influence on swimming behavior   through the kinase CheA (Borkovich et al., 1992; Schuster   et al. 1993), whose activity is modulated both by ligand   (binding inhibits activity) and receptor covalent modification   (increased levels of methylation andor amidation attenuates   inhibition by ligand, Borkovich et al., 1992).
The signaling   pathway branches at CheA-mediated phosphorylation and   directs phosphate along the excitation pathway to CheY and   along the adaptation pathway to CheB. Partitioning of   phosphate between CheY and CheB in the branchpoint is   thus a potential means of controlling the magnitude and   duration of the excitation and adaptation signals.
An   understanding of the interactions between CheA, CheB, and   CheY is essential to determine whether control is exerted at   this level.
The results of this study contribute to this goal   by (i) determining the association constants for the formation   of complexes between CheA, CheB, and CheY, (ii) finding   that binding is competitive, and (iii) finding that phosphorylation of CheY can affect the strength of the interaction   with CheA.   E. coli has numerous two-component systems which likely   have a high degree of structural homology in the response   regulator proteins at the site of phosphorylation (Le., the   CheY superfamily; Volz, 1993).
The conservation of structure at the active site is dictated by the chemistry of the   phosphotransfer reaction, but this conservation might lead   to adventitious phosphorylation of response regulator proteins   from a physiologically-unrelated pathway (cross-talk).
The   results of this study and the NMR study of CheY-CheA   interactions (Swanson et al., 1995) suggest that the surface   involved in CheA-CheY (and presumably CheA-CheB)   interactions includes protein-protein contacts at sites distinct   from the site of phosphorylation.
This feature of the binding   interaction may serve to maintain the specificity of protein   interactions and thus reduce unwanted cross-talk between   signaling pathways.
  Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 45, 1995 14635   where A,,, is the total concentration of CheA1-233 (and is   equal to [A] + [AY]).
In the presence of CheB, A,,, is given   by the sum of all forms of CheAl-233, which includes the   unbound or free CheA1-233 and the complexes with CheY   and CheB.   APPENDIX   An ITC experiment measures the extent of ligand-receptor   complex as a function of the amount of added ligand.
With   this in mind, the association constant for the formation of   the CheA1-233-CheY complex (KAY) can be written to reflect   the extent of complex formation out of the total number of   binding sites (in this example on the CheAI-233 protein) and   is given by   Substituting this expression for A,,, into eq A1 accounts   for the presence of CheA1-233-CheB complex and thus   becomes an expression for Kapp, the apparent association   constant of CheY and CheA1-23~   which, after substitution of KAB[A][B] for the concentration   of the CheAI-233-CheB complex, [AB], and KAY for [AY]/   [A][Y], yields eq 1 in the text, the expression for the apparent   association constant of CheY and CheAl-233.
In the experiments described in the text, the average concentration of free   CheB (which changes modestly over the course of the   competitive binding experiment) is used to provide an   estimate for Kapp.
  It is worth noting that the expression for Kapp simplifies   to K,IK,[C] when the product of the association constant for   competitor binding (Kc) and the competitor concentration,   [C], is much greater than one, Le., KJC] >> 1 (in this specific   example KAB[B] >> I), and thus provides a means to estimate   K, for tight binding ligands if K, and [C] are known.
