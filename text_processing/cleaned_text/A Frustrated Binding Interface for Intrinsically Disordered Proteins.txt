M113.537068  Per Jemth1  , Xin Mu, ke Engstrm, and Jakob Dogan2  From the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, SE-75123 Uppsala, Sweden  Background: Protein-protein interactions often involve intrinsically disordered protein domains.
  Results: The binding interface between two disordered protein domains is suboptimal, or frustrated, with regard to the  energetics.
  Conclusion: The frustration likely results from the promiscuous binding behavior of these disordered domains.
  Significance: Suboptimal binding interfaces may be common among intrinsically disordered proteins with multiple binding  partners.
  Intrinsically disordered proteins are very common in the  eukaryotic proteome, and many of them are associated with diseases.
Disordered proteins usually undergo a coupled binding  and folding reaction and often interact with many different  binding partners.
Using double mutant cycles, we mapped the  energy landscape of the binding interface for two interacting  disordered domains and found it to be largely suboptimal in  terms of interaction free energies, despite relatively high affinity.
These data depict a frustrated energy landscape for interactions involving intrinsically disordered proteins, which is likely  a result of their functional promiscuity.
  Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)3 are abundant in the  eukaryotic proteome and participate in various cellular processes such as signaling, cell cycle control, transcription, and  translation (1).
Due to their frequent occurrence and the fact  that many IDPs are involved in diseases such as cancer and  neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson and Alzheimer  (2), the relationship between disorder and (dys)function has  been the subject of intense research in the last decade.
A recurrently cited reason for the prevalence of IDPs is that disorder  enables a combination of low affinity and high specificity and  that it also facilitates binding to several different targets (1).
  However, this binding malleability could also lead to interactions with targets for which IDPs were not intended to bind and  hence lower their specificity.
This apparent contradiction leads  to the following question.
How optimized are the interactions  involving IDPs? To address this issue, we have analyzed in detail  the largely hydrophobic interaction surface between the molten  globule nuclear coactivator-binding domain (NCBD) of CREBbinding protein and the fully disordered activation domain  from the p160 transcription coactivator for thyroid hormone  and retinoid receptors (ACTR) (3 6).
  We have previously used ACTR/NCBD as a model system to  investigate the mechanisms of coupled binding and folding  (79).
The association between NCBD and ACTR is fast, with a  transition state that contains only a few native hydrophobic  interactions, followed by a cooperative formation of native contacts after the rate-limiting barrier, resembling the nucleation  condensation mechanism in protein folding (10).
  In this work, we used protein engineering, namely the double  mutant cycle (11), in combination with kinetic experiments to  map in detail the binding interface between ACTR and NCBD.
  We found that the binding interface contains energetic frustration and propose that this is a necessary result of the promiscuity of IDPs such as ACTR and NCBD.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Protein Expression and PurificationHuman NCBD and  ACTR were expressed and purified as described previously  (7, 8).
  Binding KineticsKinetic measurements of the interactions  between mutant NCBD and mutant ACTR were performed  using an upgraded SX-17MV stopped-flow spectrometer  (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, United Kingdom).
Stoppedflow binding data for single mutant interactions with the wild  type are from Dogan et al. (8).
The change in Trp fluorescence  was monitored, with excitation at 280 nm and a 320-nm longpass emission filter.
Experiments were done at 277 K in 20 mM  sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl.
Apparent association rate constants of binding (kon  app) were obtained by measuring kobs values for binding at different concentrations of  ACTR (0.525 M) and 1 M NCBD.
The data (kobs versus  [ACTR]) were fitted to the general equation for a reversible  association of two molecules (12).
Displacement experiments  were performed to determine apparent dissociation rate constants of binding (koff  app) by mixing a preformed ACTR-NCBD  complex with an excess of NCBDWT (7, 8).
Kd values were  obtained by taking the ratio of koff  app to kon  app.
Calculation of  Gc was performed as described previously (13).
  Isothermal Titration Calorimetry ExperimentsThe thermodynamics of ACTR/NCBD association was characterized  * This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (Natural and  Engineering Sciences) and the Human Frontiers Young Investigator Science Program (to P.

Proteins were dialyzed prior to isothermal titration calorimetry measurements, which were performed in 20 mM  sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl and at 278 K.  NCBD (150365 M) was titrated into an ACTR solution with  concentrations ranging from 15 to 30 M. Each titration series  consisted of an initial 0.4- or 0.5-l injection, followed by 18  subsequent 2-l injections.
Data were corrected for the heats of  dilution and fitted to a one-to-one binding model using the  Origin software provided with the iTC200 instrument.
  RESULTS  We mapped the energetics of the binding interface between  ACTR and NCBD using site-directed mutagenesis and binding  kinetics.
In a previous study (8), we made 10 deletion mutations  at hydrophobic positions in both ACTR and NCBD and performed a  value analysis for binding.
Here, we used the same  20 mutants to measure the coupling free energies of binding  (Gc) between different positions in ACTR-NCBD using  the double mutant cycle analysis (11).
The side chains subjected  to mutation are in the interface of ACTR and NCBD as defined  by the NMR structure (4).
Thus, our measured Gc values  reflect the energetic cross-talk in the binding interface.
  Stopped-flow fluorometry was used to determine the binding  dissociation constants (Kd) as the ratio between koff and kon for  each pair of mutants.
These Kd values are identical within error  to Kd values determined by isothermal titration calorimetry  (Fig. 1).
Gc values were obtained from Kd values as  described in detail previously (13, 14).
Briefly, the Kd values of  four bimolecular ACTR-NCBD complexes were measured in  each cycle (7, 8): the wild-type complex, single mutants X and Y,  and the double mutant (in which both X and Y mutations are  present), as illustrated in Fig. 2.
If the sum of the differences in  the free energy of binding between the wild-type and single  mutant complexes (GmutantX  GmutantY) is identical  to GmutantXY when both mutations are present, then the  FIGURE 1.

Observed rate constants  (kobs) are plotted against the concentration of ACTR, and from the fitting (12), the apparent association rate constant of binding (kon  app) is obtained.
The insets  show a trace in a displacement experiment in which a preformed NCBDY2108W/ACTR solution was mixed with an excess of NCBDWT to obtain the apparent  dissociation rate constant (koff  app).
Stopped-flow data shown in a are from Dogan et al. (7), and data shown in b are from Dogan et al. (8).
The two different  methods produced the same Kd.

Bibliothek on May 12, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from free energies are additive, and positions X and Y are not energetically coupled to each other.
However, if Gc does not  equal zero, then a cross-talk in terms of free energy between X  and Y exists.
  If the wild-type protein-protein interaction is highly optimized in terms of all intra- and intermolecular interactions, it is  likely that it becomes less optimized by the first mutation in the  cycle.
This means that the first mutation weakens the effect of  the second mutation, and Gc becomes positive.
Conversely, if the first mutation boosts the effect of the second  mutation, then Gc becomes negative, which is a sign of a  less optimized wild-type complex.
  We were able to measure the interaction free energy for 63  pairs of amino acid side chains situated in the interface between  ACTR and NCBD in the complex (Table 1).
Gc values for  several other pairs were not possible to obtain by the stoppedflow technique due to elevated observed rate constants (kobs),  which in turn result from severe destabilization of the ACTRNCBD complex upon double mutation.
Nevertheless, the  obtained values were well distributed, thus ensuring a good  coverage of the whole ACTR-NCBD binding surface.
The coupling free energies for a few positions are, to some extent, distance-dependent.
However, when all of the coupling free energies are plotted against the distance between the positions, no  clear correlation is observed (Fig. 3).
  DISCUSSION  Despite a recent avalanche of articles on IDPs, there is still a  paucity of quantitative data on the interactions in the interface  of disordered proteins.
Such knowledge is needed for a general  understanding of IDP interactions but may also help drug  design.
We have here investigated in detail the interaction energetics in the interface formed in a coupled binding and folding  reaction of two disordered protein domains, ACTR and NCBD,  and found it to be rather distinct from those of ordered  domains.
  The coupling free energies determined for ACTR and NCBD  reflect the network of noncovalent bonds holding the two  domains together in the complex.
Note that our interpretation  of Gc values is not dependent on mechanism.

  To visualize the spatial distribution of the interaction energies, we mapped the Gc values onto the structure of the  ACTR-NCBD complex (Fig. 4).
Surprisingly, 80% of the  Gc values adopt negative values (Fig. 3 and Table 1), which  means that the effect of having both mutations present at the  same time is more unfavorable compared with the theoretical  combination of single mutations.
One interpretation of these  negative Gc values is that the binding interface is not fully  optimized for the ACTR/NCBD interaction.
Previously determined coupling free energies in the context of folded and stable  proteins generally displayed positive values (13, 1519),  although for some systems, both positive and negative Gc  values have been reported (20).
A positive Gc means that  the first mutation diminishes the effect of the second mutation,  and along the same line of reasoning as above, the interpretation is that the interactions of these ordered proteins are highly  specific and optimized throughout the binding interface and  even the whole protein domain (Fig. 5a) (13).
  The large number of negative coupling free energies in the  interaction surface between ACTR and NCBD may be understood in terms of frustration.
The concept of minimal frustration was initially proposed for protein folding (21) but applies  also to binding.
In a hypothetical fully optimized protein-protein interaction, all possible bonds are satisfied in the complex,  and there is no frustration.
In the free ground states, however,  the respective binding interface may contain frustration, which,  upon binding, is minimized due to the favorable interactions  between the two proteins.
In a protein-protein interface with all  interactions satisfied, a perturbation of the interface by mutation may affect neighboring residues and result in a positive  coupling free energy in a double mutant cycle.
The first mutation introduces strain in the protein-protein complex, which  lowers the effect of the second mutation.
Conversely, in a suboptimal strained binding interface, a mutation might even  relax, i.e. stabilize the protein-protein complex and make it  more sensitive for the second mutation, leading to a negative  coupling free energy (Fig. 5b).
  Thus, protein-protein interactions are optimized by minimizing the frustration upon binding.
However, IDPs with multiple binding partners, such as ACTR and NCBD, cannot minimize the frustration in the binding interface to the same degree  as proteins involved in more specific interactions because their  amino acid residues make different interactions with different  partners and may even adopt distinct conformations.
For  example, NCBD adopts a completely different conformation  when bound to IRF-3 compared with the ACTR-NCBD complex (22), and the C terminus of p53 has been shown to have at  least four different bound conformations depending on the  interacting ligand (23).
We therefore suggest that, in general,  protein-protein interactions involving functionally promiscuFIGURE 3.

Bibliothek on May 12, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from ous IDPs display more frustration than those of well folded  proteins with specific binding partners.
  One important implication of this suggestion is that it challenges the prevalent low affinity-high specificity argument for  binding of IDPs.
It has been previously suggested that the interactions forming the highly hydrophobic binding interfaces by  -helical molecular recognition features (so-called -MORFs,  which undergo a disorder-to-order transition upon binding)  are predominantly nonspecific (24).
NCBD has been shown to  bind to several widely different ligands (4, 22, 2530).
The  ACTR-NCBD complex has a rather high affinity (93 nM at physiological salt) resulting from hydrophobic and electrostatic  interactions but yet apparently combined with a frustrated  interface.
There are previous studies that have collected data  from literature on the binding kinetics for stable proteins and  IDPs (31, 32), and they found that IDPs tend to have higher koff  values than folded proteins.
It is believed that such a difference  would be one of the key advantages of being disordered (33)  because it means that complexes formed by IDPs can dissociate  rapidly, which is important for proteins acting as hubs in signaling pathways.
Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the frustrated interface is related to a high koff (26 s1 at 25 C for  ACTR-NCBD).
However, there are a couple of shortcomings  with such tabulations of binding kinetics, such as data being  collected at different ionic strengths, temperatures, and pH values and the use of different experimental methods.
Therefore,  at present moment, it is difficult to make such comparisons and  draw any conclusions about the magnitudes of binding rate  constants when comparing IDPs with stable and folded proteins.
However, it is clear that IDPs interact with their targets  with a wide range of binding affinities, from picomolar to  micromolar (3437).
The most likely general scenario for IDPs  is, almost by necessity, a suboptimized binding site in combination with basically any affinity depending on the relevant intracellular concentration of ligand and biological function.
  Interestingly, although the majority of coupling free energies  were negative, most of the positive coupling free energies were  obtained for two residues: Leu-2087 in NCBD and Leu-1049 in  ACTR.
The positions in NCBD that displayed positive interaction energies with Leu-1049 in ACTR may form a contiguous  positive pathway (Fig. 4), although the coupling between NCBDLeu-2096 and ACTRLeu-1049, which seems to be important for  this pathway, is missing because we were not able to determine  an accurate value of Gc between these two positions.
Similarly, the residues in ACTR that displayed positive interaction  energies with Leu-2087 in NCBD form a putative contiguous  pathway (Fig. 4).
Indeed, both of these hydrophobic side chains  could interact with other proteins: they are partially solventexposed in the complex, with 50 and 30% of the surface area  being accessible in the bound state for Leu-2087 in NCBD and  Leu-1049 in ACTR, respectively.
Such contiguous pathways  were previously observed for PDZ domains (14), and they offer  the possibility for a specific route for long-range signal transmission (38).
