Cines**  From the Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and **Medicine, University of Pennsylvania,  Philadelphia, Pennsylavania 19104, Angstrom Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, California 92121, and the iDepartment of  Clinical Biochemistry, Hadassah Medical Organization, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel  The urokinase receptor is composed of three homologous domains based on disulfide spacing.
The contribution of each domain to the binding and activation of  single chain urokinase (scuPA) remains poorly understood.
In the present paper we examined the role of  domain II (DII) in these processes.
Repositioning DII to  the amino or carboxyl terminus of the molecule abolished binding of scuPA as did deleting the domain entirely.
By using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we identified a 9-amino acid continuous sequence in DII  (Arg137Arg145) required for both activities.
Competition-inhibition and surface plasmon resonance studies  demonstrated that mutation of Lys139 and His143 to alanine in soluble receptor (suPAR) reduced the affinity for  scuPA ;5-fold due to an increase in the off rate. Mutation of Arg137, Arg142, and Arg145, each to alanine, leads  to an ;100-fold decrease in affinity attributable to a  10-fold decrease in the apparent on rate and a 6-fold  increase in off rate.
These differences were confirmed  on cells expressing variant urokinase receptor.
suPARK139A/H143A displayed a 50% reduction in scuPA-mediated plasminogen activation activity, whereas the 3-arginine variant was unable to stimulate scuPA activity at  all.
Mutation of the three arginines did not affect binding of a decamer peptide antagonist of scuPA known to  interact with DI and DIII.
However, this mutation abolished both the binding of soluble DI to DIIIII in the  presence of scuPA and the synergistic activation of  scuPA mediated by DI and wild type DIIDIII.
These  data show that DII is required for high affinity binding  of scuPA and its activation.
DII does not serve merely as  a spacer function but appears to be required for interdomain cooperativity.
  Urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA)1 has been implicated in angiogenesis, wound healing, fibrinolysis, and formation of tumor metastases.
The capacity of uPA to promote  remodeling of clots and basement membrane through its enzymatic activity and to promote cell adhesion through non-enzymatic processes is modulated by its interaction with its cellular  receptor, uPAR (1).
The interaction between the uPAzuPAR  complex and b integrins has been implicated in cell adhesion  and migration (2, 3).
uPAR2/2 mice exhibit defective leukocyte  recruitment to inflamed peritoneum due to impaired cell adhesion (4).
uPAR-dependent signaling has also been implicated in  various signal transduction events, cell differentiation, and  tumor dormancy (511).
  uPAR can be expressed on the surface of many but not all cell  types as a 281-amino acid, three-domain glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein (12).
Each domain consists of  8187 amino acids that are characterized by a generally conserved pattern of cysteine residues, which are separated from  each other by ;11-amino acid linker sequences.
There is ;20%  amino acid sequence similarity among the domains at the  amino acid level (13).
However, the mechanism by which the  three domains interact to generate a high affinity binding site  for uPAR and to participate in cell adhesion and scuPA activation remains largely unresolved.
  We (14) and others (15, 16) have reported that scuPA binds  to soluble domain I of uPAR (sDI), albeit with ;50-fold lower  affinity than full-length suPAR or GPI-linked uPAR and with  even lower affinity to a soluble fragment composed of domains  II and III (sDII/DIII) (14).
In addition, each fragment of suPAR  displays less capacity to activate scuPA than the intact receptor (14).
Proteolytic cleavage of uPAR between the DII and DIII  generates a soluble fragment composed of DI and DII that  binds uPA with an affinity similar to that of isolated sDI (16).
  Thus, the connection between the domains of suPAR is essential to generate a high affinity site.
The fragment containing  DII and DIII may come into close proximity to DI to form an  extended binding site for uPA (17).
Alternatively, DII and DIII  may contain auxiliary binding sites that are independent of the  site within DI.
  Potential contact sites for uPA on the surface of sDI and  sDIII have been probed using mutagenesis, chemical protection, and cross-linking approaches (1720), but direct contact  between these portions of uPAR and uPA itself has not been  proven.
Furthermore, the contribution of domain II within the  intact receptor to uPA binding has received little attention (21).
  The studies reported here identify a region in domain II composed of 9 amino acids that is required for scuPA to bind  * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health  Grants HL60169 and HL58107.

Mutation of three arginine  residues within this region of uPAR reduces the affinity of  scuPA binding to a level comparable to that of domain I alone  and abolished the capacity of suPAR to activate scuPA in the  absence of amino acid substitutions in domain I or domain III.
  These results demonstrate that domain II is required for high  affinity binding of scuPA to uPAR.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Chemicals and ReagentsscuPA, two chain uPA, and polyclonal  anti-uPAR antibody were the kind gifts of Dr. J. Henkin (Abbott).
  Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were purchased from American  Tissue Type Culture Collection, (Manassas, VA).
Tissue culture medium, bovine serum, and Lipofectin were from Life Technologies, Inc.  Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) was from Oxford Glycosystems (Wakefield, MA).
Chymotrypsin and pepsin were  from Sigma, Na125I from (NEN Life Science Products), and IODOBEADS from Pierce.
Plasminogen and Spectrozyme PL were gifts of  American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT).
  Construction of Domain Swap uPAR VariantscDNA encoding domains I and III (DIDIII; amino acids 192 and 192281) was constructed using two-step polymerase chain reaction by looping out DII  (amino acids 93191) using full-length uPAR/pGEM as a template.
  Each PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA at the HindIII and EcoRI  sites.
cDNA encoding DII was constructed from two-step PCR with a  mutation at position 191 of glycine to arginine to permit carboxylterminal processing and GPI linkage (22).
To add DII (final amino acid  sequences 192, 192281, and 93191) to the carboxyl terminus of  DI-DIII, DI-DIII/pcDNA and DII/pcDNA were used as templates in the  second step of the PCR.
To add DII to the amino terminus of DI-DIII  (final amino acid sequences 93191, 192, 192281), the wild type  sequence at position 191 was restored.
DII/pcDNA and DI-DIII/pcDNA  were then used as templates in the second step of the PCR.
After the  nucleotide sequence of each final construct was confirmed, COS cells  were transfected using Lipofectin.
Expression levels of uPAR were  measured by ELISA using polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody.
Binding of  anti-uPAR and scuPA to cells expressing each variant were demonstrated to be .90% PI-PLC-sensitive.
Specific binding of 125I-scuPA to  these transiently transfected cells was measured as described below.
  Mutagenesis of uPAR Domain IIAlanine-scanning mutagenesis  within the second domain of uPAR, residues 137145, was performed  both in clusters and as individual mutations.
cDNA encoding the fulllength uPAR, generously provided by F. Blasi (Milan, Italy), was subcloned into pBluSK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate pBluSK/  uPAR(EcoRI-HinIII).
The five residues, Arg137, Lys139, Arg142, His143,  and Arg145, were all mutated to alanine (Arg137 3 Ala, Lys139 3 Ala,  Arg142 3 Ala, His143 3 Ala, and Arg145 3 Ala), designated m5A) using  the ExSite PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).
  pBluSK- uPAR (EcoRI-HinIII) was amplified using the sense oligonucleotide 59 GCCGCCCTCGCTGGCTGTGGCTACCTTCCCGGC 39 and  the antisense oligonucleotide 59 GTCATCCTCTTGTATCCCCTTCACCTTCCTGGAT 39.
The recombinant clone, designated pBluSK-m5AuPAR, was subcloned into pTracer-SV40 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at  the KpnI site to yield pTracer-m5A-uPAR.
pTracer-m5A-uPAR was  then used as template to generate pTracer-m2A-uPAR (Lys139 3 Ala  and His143 3 Ala, designated m2A) or pTracer-m3A-uPAR (Arg137 3  Ala, Arg142 3 Ala, and Arg145 3 Ala, designated m3A) using the  QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).
Mutation of  individual residues was performed using a two-step PCR (23) with  pTracer-SV40/uPAR (KpnI) as the template.
Plasmid DNA was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells using Lipofectin, and the  cells were grown in 10% Dulbeccos minimum essential medium, 10%  fetal bovine serum and selected for Zeocin resistance.
Clones expressing  high, intermediate, and low levels of uPAR were chosen based on the  ELISA and/or flow cytometry with rabbit polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody (24) in the presence and absence of PI-PLC.
  Radiolabeling of ProteinsscuPA, suPAR, and soluble domain I of  suPAR (sDI) were radiolabeled with Na125I (NEN Life Science Products) using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) according to the manufacturers instructions.
Free 125I was removed by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25  (PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
  Binding of scuPA to 293 CellsStable 293 cells lines expressing  either wild type uPAR or variant uPAR were subcultured onto poly-Dlysine 96-well Biocoat Multiwell tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson  Labware, Bedford, MA) at an initial cell density of 1 3 105 and grown  for 12 days by which time they reached confluence.
To measure the  binding of 125I-scuPA, the cells were pre-chilled for 30 min at 4 C and  washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer composed of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1% BSA.
The cells were then incubated with  0.1520 nM 125I-scuPA in the presence or absence of 100-fold molar  excess unlabeled ligand for 1 h at 4 C in binding buffer, washed 4 times  with the same buffer, and the cell-bound ligand was eluted with glycine  buffer, pH 2.8.
Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding.
In some experiments cells were treated  with PI-PLC (1 unit/ml) at 37 C for 1 h before binding was measured.
  Production of Wild Type and Variant-soluble Urokinase Receptor  (suPAR)cDNAs encoding soluble wild type uPAR (amino acids  1277), soluble domain II 1 III (amino acids, 88277), and variant  full-length uPA receptor sequences (designated m2A, m3A, and m5A,  see below) were generated by polymerase chain reaction using pTraceruPAR, pTracer-m2uPAR, pTracer-m3uPAR, or pTracer-m5uPAR as  templates.
The fragments were digested with BglII and Xho and subcloned into the expression vector (pMT/BiP/V5, Invitrogen).
Wild type  and variant suPARs or soluble domains were expressed in Drosophila  Schneider S2 cells (DES system, Invitrogen) as described by the  manufacturer.
  Purification of suPAR Expressed in S2 CellsSmall scale preparations of suPAR and variants were purified from the media using a  polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody affinity column.
For large scale preparation, S2 cell culture supernatants were filtered and the media loaded  onto a 40 GM hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with 10 mM K2HPO4,  pH 7.0.
The column was then eluted with a gradient of 10200 mM  K2HPO4, pH 7.0, and the suPAR-containing fractions were identified by  Western blotting.
Fractions containing monomeric suPAR eluted between 50 and 120 mM K2HPO4.
Fractions containing monomeric suPAR  were pooled, concentrated, and further purified using C8 RP-HPLC.
  Crude suPAR (20 mg of total protein) was loaded in a volume of 2 ml  onto a semi-preparative (10 3 25 cm) C8 column and eluted at a flow  rate of 4 ml/min with a linear gradient of 070% solvent B where  solvent A was 100% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B was  100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.
suPAR eluted as a single  broad peak under these conditions with a retention time of approximately 27 min.
SDS-PAGE analysis of suPAR purified in this manner  demonstrated a single major peak at 35 kDa under non-reducing conditions.
Also observed was a slight laddering effect with 34 minor  higher molecular weight species.
These were determined to be SDS  stable aggregates of suPAR, which disappeared when SDS-PAGE was  performed under reducing conditions.
Matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry revealed a single broad peak  with an average mass of 34,797.
The predicted mass based on the amino  acid sequence is 30,672 indicating the presence of about 4 kDa of  glycosylation.
Expression levels of suPAR were typically 30 mg/liter  determined by ELISA.
Purification yielded about 1012 mg of pure  suPAR protein per liter of culture supernatant.
  Generation of suPAR FragmentssuPAR was digested with chymotrypsin to generate sDI and sDII-DIII.
Chymotrypsin was added to  suPAR (1 mg/ml in PBS) at a final molar ratio of suPAR:chymotrypsin  of 1000:1, and the digest was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room  temperature.
The digest was quenched by addition of Pefablock (100 mM  final concentration).
sDI and sDII-DIII were separated using C8 RPHPLC.
sDI and sDII-DIII eluted with retention times of approximately  27 and 25 min, respectively.
Purified sD1 was sequenced and a single  amino terminus was observed beginning with RS (representing the two  extra amino acids present in this construct) followed by KR, amino acids  1 and 2 in the mature suPAR sequence.
Sequencing of sDII-DIII revealed a single amino terminus as well, beginning with amino acids  SRS corresponding to amino acids 8890 in the mature suPAR sequence.
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass  spectral analysis revealed a single peak for sD1 (mass 5 11,041 Da) and  several peaks for sDII-DIII (mass 5 23,846, 23,691, 22,936, and  22,800).
These were presumed to be glycosylation isoforms, although  additional digestion of sDII-DIII from the carboxyl terminus could not  be excluded.
However, no consensus chymotryptic cleavage site that  could result in the observed mass differences is present at the carboxyl  terminus of sDII-DIII.
  suPAR Binding to CHO-scuPA CellsThe capacity of wild type and  variant suPAR to compete with the binding of wt-suPAR to scuPA was  measured as described (24).
Briefly, binding of 125I-wild type suPAR (10  nM) to a stably transfected CHO cell line expressing GPI-anchored  scuPA was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled wild type and variant full-length suPAR (24).
In other experiments, binding of 125I-sDI (50 nM) to scuPA-CHO cells was measured in  the presence of varying concentrations of wild type sDII-DIII (100400  nM) for 1 h at 4 C.
  Binding of scuPA to Soluble uPAR (suPAR) Measured as Surface  Domain II of uPAR Is Required for Urokinase Binding 28533   at BRUNEL UNIV on March 25, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Plasmon ResonanceBinding of scuPA to suPAR was measured using  a BIA 3000 optical Biosensor (Biacore, AB, Sweden) (25).
This method  detects binding interactions in real time by measuring changes in the  refractive index at a biospecific surface, enabling the association and  dissociation rate constants to be calculated.
For these studies, wild type  or variant suPAR was coupled to a CM5-research grade sensor chip flow  cell (Biacore, AB, Sweden) via standard amine coupling procedures (26)  using N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N9-[3-(dimethylamino) propyl-  ]carbodiimine hydrochloride (Pierce) at a level of 500 response units.
  The sensor surface was coated with suPAR (10 mg/ml) in 10 mM NaAc  buffer, pH 5.0.
After immobilization, non-reactive groups were blocked  with 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.5.
A second flow cell, similarly activated  and blocked without immobilization of protein, served as a control.
All  binding reactions were performed in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.005%  Tween 20.
Binding of scuPA was measured at 25 C at a flow rate of 60  ml/min for 2 min, followed by 2 min of dissociation.
The bulk shift due  to changes in refractive index measured using a blank surface was  subtracted from the binding signal at each condition to correct for  nonspecific signals.
Surfaces were regenerated with 1 3 18-s pulse of 1  M NaCl/HCl, pH 3.5, followed by an injection of binding buffer for 1 min  to remove this high salt solution.
All injections were performed using  the RANDOM command in the automated method.
Binding of scuPA  was measured using 2-fold dilutions over a range of concentrations  (12.5 to 0.2 nM for WT-scuPA, 50 to 0.4 nM for m2A-suPAR, 200 to 12.5  nM for m3A-suPAR, and 400 to 25 nM for m5A-suPAR).
Data, collected  at 2.5 Hz, were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir reaction mechanism using global  analysis in the BIA evaluation 3.0 software (Biacore, AB, Sweden).
  Secondary plots of the data (ln(udR/dtu) versus t) were also performed to  unmask any contribution of mass transport to the kinetic data.
  Activation of scuPA by suPAR VariantsThe capacity of suPAR  variants to promote scuPA-mediated plasminogen activation was measured using a chromogenic assay, as described (27).
Briefly, scuPA (5 nM)  was incubated with various concentrations of wild type suPAR, m2AsuPAR, and m5A-suPAR in the presence of 10 nM plasminogen and 500  mM chromogenic substrate (Spectrozyme-PL) and the absorbance (405  nm) was measured over time in a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA).
  Binding of Soluble uPAR Domain I to Cells Expressing uPAR Domains II 1 IIIcDNA encoding GPI-linked uPAR DII-III was generated by two-step PCR using pBluSK/uPAR as template and subcloned  into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at EcoRI and HindIII sites.
Stable lines in  293 cells were developed under G418 selection as described above.
  Expression of uPAR DIIDIII was confirmed by flow cytometry using  affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-uPAR IgG in the presence and  absence of PI-PLC.
293 cells expressing wild type or variant GPIanchored uPAR domains IIIII or mock-transfected cells were incubated with 125I-sDI (50 nM) in the absence or presence of scuPA (0500  nM) for 1 h at 4 C in PBS, 1% BSA.
The cells were washed three times  with ice-cold binding buffer, and the cell-associated radioactivity was  measured as above.
  Cross-linking ExperimentsThe method of Ploug (20) was followed  with minor modifications.
Briefly, SLN-Bpa-SQYLWS (AE-81) and SLNFSQYL-Bpa-S (AE-83) were synthesized in a stepwise manner by the  Fmoc solid-phase method.
Fmoc amino acids and Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-Wang  resin were obtained from AnaSpec (San Jose, CA), and other reagents  for peptide synthesis were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).
  The synthesis was in a 0.1-mmol scale on a Applied Biosystems model  431A peptide synthesizer using 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium/1-hydroxybenzotriazole for activation.
The peptides  were cleaved from the resin, and the side chains were deprotected with  trifluoroacetic acid containing 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol and 2.5% H2O.
  The resin was removed from the reaction mixture by filtration, and the  peptides were precipitated with ether.
The peptides were then purified  by preparative reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (10 mm,  300 Angstrom, 10 3 25 cm) using a linear gradient from buffer A (0.1%  trifluoroacetic acid in water) to buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in  acetonitrile).
The electrospray ion traps mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finingan, CA) was used to check the integrity of the peptides.
Each peptide  was iodinated using Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Pharmacia  Biotech), as described (20).
To perform cross-linking, 5 mM WT- or  m5AsuPAR was incubated with a mixture containing labeled and unlabeled peptide (100 mM final concentration) on ice for 90 min in the  dark.
Wells containing each mixture were uniformly positioned 12 cm  from the light source (Philips TL/09 actinic lamp, 20-watt lmax 5 365  nm).
The reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample  buffer.
The receptor concentrations were equalized based on protein  staining on 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the extent  of cross-linking was assessed by autoradiography.
  RESULTS  Binding of scuPA to uPAR Requires Interdomain CooperativityThere is considerable indirect evidence to suggest that  each domain of uPAR contributes to the development of the  high affinity binding site for scuPA.
The purpose of our studies  was to study the specific contribution of DII to this process.
To  begin to address this question, we measured the specific binding of 125I-scuPA to COS cells expressing WT-uPAR and comparable levels of GPI-anchored uPAR variants in which the  position of domain II within the receptor was moved to the  amino terminus (DII-DI-DIII) or carboxyl terminus (DI-DIIIDII) of the molecule.
scuPA (10 nM and 100 nM) bound specifically to cells expressing WT-uPAR as expected, whereas no  specific binding to cells expressing comparable levels of either  variant was seen (Fig. 1), indicating that DII must be present  between DI and DIII for the receptor to function normally.
In  accordance with this, deletion of DII from either entity or from  wild type uPAR, leaving DI-DIII, did not restore binding (Fig.  1).
No specific, receptor-dependent binding was detected to  cells expressing GPI-linked uPAR-domain I at either ligand  concentration (data not shown).
These experiments indicate  that DII must be present and must be present in its natural  location for scuPA to bind to cell surface uPAR.
  Localization of a Potentially Important Continuous Amino  Acid Sequence in DIIPrevious studies suggest that Arg53,  Leu55, Trp57, and Leu66 in DI and His251 in DIII interface with  scuPA.
Computer-based analysis of the individual domains of  uPAR revealed a single region in DII that had the highest  likelihood of being expressed on the surface of the protein and  might thereby contribute to the binding of scuPA (Fig. 2).
Of  interest, this region in DII (Arg137Arg145) occupies a similar  position with respect to the cysteine residues to the regions in  domains I and III that also have a high probability of surface  expression and have previously been implicated in scuPA binding (13, 17, 19, 20).
Therefore, we targeted this region to examine the role of DII in scuPA binding and interdomain  cooperativity.
  Mutations in Domain II of suPAR (Arg137Arg145) Regulate  the Binding of scuPATo examine the role of this region in DII,  we generated wild type suPAR in S2 cells as well as a suPAR  variant, designated m5A, in which five charged amino acids  within this region (Arg137, Lys139, Arg142, His143, and Arg145)  were mutated collectively to alanine.
To characterize the binding affinity of m5A-suPAR, we first examined the capacity of  the purified protein to inhibit the binding of 125I-wild type  FIG. 1.
Binding of scuPA (10 and 100 nM) to cells expressing  wild type uPAR and uPAR variants.
COS cells were transfected  with cDNA encoding the indicated GPI-anchored uPAR variants.
Cells  were chilled to 4 C and incubated with 10 or 100 nM 125I-scuPA for 1 h  at 4 C, washed 4 times, and cell-bound ligand was eluted with glycine,  pH 2.8.
Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding in the presence of 100-fold molar excess unlabeled ligand from total  binding.
The data shown represent the mean of triplicate determinations from one experiment, representative of three that were performed.
  28534 Domain II of uPAR Is Required for Urokinase Binding   at BRUNEL UNIV on March 25, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from suPAR (10 nM) to a previously characterized CHO cell line that  expresses high levels of GPI-anchored scuPA (Fig. 3 and Table  I).
m5A-suPAR inhibited the binding of 125I-WT suPAR to  CHO-scuPA with an IC50 ;16 mM, whereas unlabeled WTsuPAR inhibited binding with an IC50 of ;10 nM.  Residues within Arg137Arg145 Required for scuPA Binding  to uPARMutation of the five residues in the sequence Arg137  Arg145 thus leads to a greater than 1000-fold increase in the  IC50 of suPAR for scuPA.
To identify the contribution of the  individual amino acids in this region in greater detail, we  posited that the three arginines might constitute a functional  group.
Therefore, we restored either the three arginine residues (uPAR-K139A/H143A; designated m2A-uPAR) or the lysine and histidine residues (uPAR-R137A/R142A/R145A; designated m3A-uPAR).
The affinity of m2A-suPAR for scuPA was  moderately reduced (IC50 ;70 nM) compared with wild type  suPAR (Fig. 3 and Table I).
In contrast, m3A-suPAR (IC50 ;2.6  mM) and m5A suPAR (IC50 ;16 mM) were comparatively much  weaker competitors.
  To confirm these results and to obtain a more precise estimate of their Kd values, we measured the binding of scuPA to  immobilized WT- and each variant suPAR in real time as  surface plasmon resonance (Table II).
Binding of scuPA to  immobilized WT-suPAR from S2 cells was essentially identical  to the Kd value measured using suPAR expressed in mammalian cells (not shown) and comparable to its affinity for GPIanchored uPAR.
m2A-suPAR bound scuPA with a 45-fold  lower affinity, attributable primarily to an increase in off  rate. In contrast, the affinity of scuPA for m3A-suPAR was  ;100-fold lower than was seen with WT-suPAR due to a ;10-  fold reduction in the apparent on rate and a 6-fold increase in  the off rate (Table II).
The decrease in the affinity of m5AuPAR was even greater (;160-fold), suggesting a contribution  from all five charged residues.
Interestingly, the apparent off  rate of scuPA from m5A-suPAR was similar to that of WTsuPAR, whereas the apparent on rate was even slower than to  m3A-suPAR.
These data suggest a complex interaction among  these 5 residues and/or with other regions of uPAR.
  Binding of scuPA to GPI-linked suPAR MutantsTo re-evaluate these observations in a more physiologic setting, we examined the effect of these mutations in DII on the function of  cellular, GPI-anchored receptors.
To do this, we generated stable cell lines expressing wild type receptor and each of the three  DII variants.
As mentioned above, 125I-scuPA bound specifically to WT-uPAR with a Kd 5 0.91 6 0.51 nM (mean 6 S.D.,  n 5 4).
scuPA bound to cells expressing m2A-uPAR with a  comparable affinity (Kd 5 1.96 6 0.97), whereas binding to  m3A-uPAR and m5A-uPAR were each greatly reduced (.40  nM) (Fig. 4 and Table III).
The loss of uPAR-dependent binding  was not due to the absence of proper folding resulting in reduced surface expression of the variant receptors.
Binding of a  polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody to 293 cells expressing WTuPAR and each variant uPAR was comparable in intensity as  assessed by ELISA and FACS and .90% of antibody binding to  each cell line was sensitive to PI-PLC (not shown).

CHO-scuPA cells were pre-chilled for 30 min and  washed twice with binding buffer (PBS, 1% BSA).
Cells were then  incubated with 125I-WT suPAR (10 nM) in the presence of the indicated  concentrations of unlabeled WT-suPAR (f) and suPAR variants m2AsuPAR (*), m3A-suPAR (M), m5A-suPAR () for 1 h at 4 C.
Cells were  washed 4 times with binding buffer, and the cell bound ligand was  eluted with glycine buffer, pH 2.8, and counted.
The data shown are  from a single experiment representative of three experiments that were  performed.

Restoration  of any four of these five charge residues to their wild type  counterparts fully restored binding of scuPA, with Kd values  statistically indistinguishable from native receptor (Table III).
  Activity of suPAR VariantsBinding of scuPA to its receptor  promotes its enzymatic activity (2729).
We therefore examined the capacity of each suPAR variant to promote the plasminogen activator activity of scuPA.
A fixed concentration of  scuPA (5 nM) was incubated with each variant over a wide  range of receptor concentrations, including concentrations well  in excess of their respective Kd values as determined by surface  plasmon resonance.
Plasminogen activation was determined 60  min after the incubation was started.
WT-suPAR generated in  S2 cells stimulated scuPA activity in a dose-dependent and  saturable manner, consistent with our findings using mammalian suPAR (24).
m2A-suPAR stimulated scuPA enzymatic activity less effectively than did WT-suPAR (EC50 ;100 nM versus 20 nM for WT-suPAR).
The decrease in m2A-suPAR  activation was proportional to the reduction in its affinity for  scuPA (Fig. 5).
In contrast, neither m5A- nor m3A-suPAR promoted significant scuPA-mediated plasminogen activation  even when the receptor was present at 500 nM final concentration, i.e. ;10 times greater than its Kd measured by surface  plasmon resonance (Fig. 5).
  Effect of Mutations in Domain II on Inter-domain CooperativityThe observation that m5A-suPAR binds scuPA with a Kd  of 55 nM, a value comparable to the affinity of isolated sDI (14),  may indicate that these mutations interrupt a binding epitope  in DII-DIII and/or disrupt the ability of the three domains to  interact in a productive conformation.
To begin to examine the  mechanism by which these mutations in DII disrupt binding,  we studied the interaction of m5A-suPAR with a decamer peptide antagonist of uPA (AE-68) tagged by specific-site photoaffinity activable groups on Phe4 (AE-81) or Trp9 (AE-83) (20).
  Upon photoactivation, these groups cross-link to domain I or to  domain III, respectively.
AE-68 tagged on either end of the  peptide showed comparable incorporation into WT-suPAR and  m5A-suPAR, excluding a direct effect of the mutations on  scuPA-binding sites in DI and indicating that the proximity of  these regions in DI and DIII to each other was retained in the  mutant.
  sDI can interact with sDII-DIII, and this interaction enhances the affinity of scuPA binding (14, 30).
Therefore, we  next asked whether the mutations introduced into the second  domain of uPAR affects its interaction with domain I. To do so,  we first generated stable cell lines expressing WT- and m5ADII-DIII as GPI-anchored proteins.
Again, clones were chosen  for comparable levels of cell surface receptor expression by  FACS and ELISA.
sDI increased the binding of 125I-scuPA to  cell-associated wild type DII-DIII in a dose-dependent, saturable, and PI-PLC-sensitive manner but had no effect on binding  to m5A-DII-DIII even at concentrations as high as 400 nM (Fig.  6A).
Similarly, scuPA (10 and 50 nM) increased the binding of 125I-sDI to cell-associated wild type-DII-DIII, but did not increase binding of sDI to m5A-DII-DIII (Fig. 6B).
The same  results were obtained when DI and DII-DIII were co-incubated  in solution.
125I-sDI was also added to CHO cells expressing  GPI-linked scuPA alone or in the presence of various concentrations of a soluble suPAR fragment containing the wild type  sequence of domains II and III (sDII-DIII; amino acids 88281)  or m5A-sDII-DIII.
125I-sDI (50 nM) binds minimally, if at all, to  cell-associated scuPA at concentrations as high as 400 nM.  Binding of 125I-sD1 to scuPA was increased in a dose-dependent and saturable manner by WT-sDII-DIII, consistent with  our previously published data (14), but not by addition of m5AsDII-DIII (data not shown).

  28536 Domain II of uPAR Is Required for Urokinase Binding   at BRUNEL UNIV on March 25, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from The same outcome was observed when plasminogen activation by sDII-DIII was examined in the presence of sDI.
sDI (50  nM) stimulated scuPA activity to a limited extent, as expected  (14).
Wild type sDII-DIII (100 nM) promoted the enzymatic  activity of scuPA directly (Fig. 7A, line e versus a), as described  previously (14).
This activity increased markedly in the presence of sDI (50 nM) (Fig. 7A, line f).
In contrast, m5A-sDII-DIII  induced significantly less activity than wild type DII-DIII (Fig.  7A, line d).
Further addition of sDI had no stimulatory effect  (Fig. 7A, line b), consistent with the apparent absence of interdomain cooperativity indicated by the results shown in Fig. 6.
  The data from the 120-min point for each combination of fragments is shown in Fig. 7B (mean 6 S.D., n 5 3).
  DISCUSSION  It is generally accepted that all three domains of uPAR are  required for scuPA to bind with high affinity.
This conclusion is  based on the finding that deleting any domain from uPAR  reduces its affinity for scuPA.
For example, scuPA binds with  low affinity to either isolated soluble domain I, to soluble domain III, or fragments composed of domains I and II or II and  III (1416).
Co-incubation of scuPA with the receptor fragments only partially restores its affinity when compared with  full-length receptor.
  The solution structure of the scuPAzuPAR complex has not  been reported, and the contribution of domain II to binding is  unresolved.
Previous findings that neither soluble uPAR-DIDII nor soluble DII-DIII binds uPA efficiently could be interpreted as indicating that DII is unimportant, as might the  finding that a small peptide that inhibits the binding of scuPA  to its receptor can be cross-linked to DI and DIII (20).
However,  the present study shows that deleting domain II or changing its  position within the full-length receptor profoundly inhibits the  capacity of uPAR to bind scuPA.
The fact that we observed no  binding of scuPA to cells expressing GPI-DI or GPI-DI-DII  excludes the possibility that the reduced affinity is the result of  steric masking of the DI site caused by reordering the position  of DII and/or DIII.
Furthermore, the absence of specific binding  to GPI-DI receptor compared with soluble DI suggests that the  cellular receptor fragment may partner aberrantly with other  cell surface proteins, becoming less available for a low affinity  interaction with uPA.
Similar changes in the pairing of uPAR  with other cell surface constituents that occur only when the  receptor is expressed at high concentrations may reduce its  apparent affinity for scuPA, a finding we observed on COS  cells, uPAR-expressing 293 cell lines, and cultured endothelial  cells.
  We identified a small region within loop 2 (13) of domain II  that is critical for scuPA binding.
Mutation of Lys139 and His143  to alanine decreased the affinity of suPAR for scuPA ;5-fold.
  On the other hand, similar mutations of the neighboring  Arg137, Arg142, and Arg145 residues decreased the affinity  .100-fold.
These results were obtained with soluble uPAR in  surface plasmon resonance studies, and the relative impact of  the mutations on affinity was confirmed by competition-inhibition experiments and by measuring scuPA binding to whole  cells expressing their GPI-anchored counterparts.
The Kd values of scuPA for WT-suPAR determined by surface plasmon  resonance and by binding to cellular uPAR were essentially  identical; the same was true for m2A-suPAR.
The Kd values for  binding of scuPA to cellular m3A- and m5A-uPAR could not be  FIG. 6.

  Domain II of uPAR Is Required for Urokinase Binding 28537   at BRUNEL UNIV on March 25, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from calculated because of the presence on cells of abundant low  affinity non-uPAR-binding sites (31).
Similarly, estimations of  the Kd values from the competition-inhibition experiments and  surface plasmon resonance for wild type suPAR and m2A were  similar (32).
However, the estimated Kd values from the competition-inhibition experiments were lower in the case of m3A  and m5A.
It is likely that these lower estimated affinities also  result from competition between low affinity suPAR variants  with more abundant cell surface components that bind uPA  independent of uPAR (31).
These cellular components have the  added advantage of high local concentration when competing  with the suPAR variants for GPI-scuPA.
  Our data suggest that all 5 amino acids that we mutated in  the loop 2 region of domain II of uPAR participate in the  binding process.
Furthermore, the competition-inhibition and  surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrate that the impact of the two sets of mutations is coordinate and interactive.
  This conclusion is based on the finding that the mutation of  Lys139 and His143 primarily affects the off rate, whereas mutation of the three arginines perturbs the on rate as well.
The  fact that mutation of each of the 5 amino acids individually has  no discernible effect suggests that the function of certain of  these charged residues can compensate for the others.
The  reduced capacity of the Lys139/His143 variant m2A-suPAR to  stimulate the activity of scuPA was proportional to its lowered  binding affinity.
In contrast, m3A-suPAR in which Arg137/  Arg142/Arg145 were altered caused little or no activation of  scuPA even under conditions where binding was demonstrable,  suggesting these three arginine residues participate in the  activation process as well.
  It has been suggested that when scuPA binds to uPAR, both  components of the complex undergo conformational changes  that are involved in cell adhesion, signal transduction, and the  induction of enzymatic activity (2, 27, 33).
The Arg137Arg145  sequence might participate in this re-arrangement process to  stabilize high affinity binding.
This possibility is supported by  the finding that the mutation m2A and m3A affects the off rate  of the interaction.
The fact that the three arginines in DII that  are mutated in m3A also appear to be essential for activation  suggests that additional re-arrangements in the components of  the complex are required for the post-receptor binding event to  occur.
Clearly, more extensive structural and biophysical (e.g.  calorimetric) analyses will be required to elucidate the nature  of this complex process.
  We have previously shown that uPAR is composed of two  major functional units consisting of DI and DII-DIII, which  exert a synergistic effect on scuPA binding and activation (14).
  These data has since been confirmed (15).
The interaction  between DI and DII-DIII in uPAR may also regulate signal  transduction independent of uPA (21).
Our data strongly support the notion that Arg137Arg145 participates in the interdomain cooperation between DI and DII-DIII with respect to  scuPA binding and activation.
sDI bound directly to wild type  cell-associated DII-DIII but not to the m5A-DII-DIII mutant in  the presence of scuPA.
The same result was obtained when  scuPA was GPI-anchored to the cell surface, and the uPAR  fragments were in solution.
Furthermore, wild type soluble  DII-DIII promoted the activation of scuPA in the presence of  sDI, whereas m5A-DII-DIII did not.
Finally, these functional  changes occurred notwithstanding the preservation of the binding epitopes in domain I and domain III, as demonstrated by  photoaffinity labeling using a decameric uPA peptide antagonist.
These data, taken together, suggest that scuPA, isolated  DI, and the DII-DIII portion of the receptor form a ternary  complex.
scuPA may promote the formation of this complex  either by binding to each fragment independently, thereby  bringing them in close proximity, or by binding to one of the  fragments and changing its conformation to allow interaction  with the other receptor fragment.
Although this study did not  distinguish between these two possibilities, Arg137Arg145 is  clearly required for the formation of the ternary complex.
Additional studies will also be required to establish the pattern  and sequence by which the ternary complex is formed.
  The Arg137Arg145 sequence may also represent a new target  for uPAR-based peptide antagonists.
Inhibitors directed at this  or other critical regions involved in interdomain cooperativity  may have the advantage of antagonizing both uPA-dependent  and uPA-independent receptor functions.
uPAR may not be  expressed at high levels in most tissues in vivo under physiological conditions, but its expression is clearly up-regulated in  various patho-physiological conditions that involve cell adhesion, proteolysis, and migration through basement membranes.
  This expression profile would be expected to increase the specificity of uPAR-based antagonists to such sites of disease.
Studies are in progress to address this possibility.
