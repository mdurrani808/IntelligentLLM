Mutational Analysis of the IFNAR1 Binding Site on  IFNa2 Reveals the Architecture of a Weak  LigandReceptor Binding-site  Laila C. Roisman1  , Diego A. Jaitin1  , Darren P. Baker2 and  Gideon Schreiber1*  1  Department of Biological  Chemistry, Weizmann Institute  of Science, 76100 Rehovot  Israel  2  BiogenIdec Inc., 14 Cambridge  Center, Cambridge, MA 02142  USA  Type I interferons activate cellular responses by forming a ternary complex  with two receptor components, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2.
While the binding of  the IFNAR2 receptor to interferon is of high affinity and well characterized,  the binding to IFNAR1 is weak, transient, and poorly understood.
Here, we  mapped the complete binding region of IFNAR1 on IFNa2 by creating a  panel of 21 single alanine mutant proteins, and determined their binding  affinities.
The IFNAR1 binding site on IFNa2 maps to the center of the B  and C helices, opposite to the binding site for IFNAR2.
No hot spots for  binding were found in the interface, with individual mutations having an  up to fivefold effect on binding.
Of the nine residues that affected binding,  three adjacent conserved residues, located on the B helix, conferred an  increase in the binding affinity to IFNAR1, as well as an increase in the  biological activity of the interferon mutant.
This suggests that binding of  alpha interferons to the IFNAR1 receptor is sub-optimal.
A correlation  between binding affinity and biological activity was found, albeit not across  the whole range of affinities.
In WISH cells, but not DAUDI cells, the antiproliferative activity was markedly affected by fluctuations in the IFNa2  affinity towards the IFNAR1 receptor.
On the other hand, the antiviral  activity of interferons on WISH cells seems to change in accordance to the  binding affinity towards IFNAR1 only as long as the binding affinity is not  beyond twofold of the wild-type.
In accordance, the biological roles of the  two interferon-receptor subunits are discussed.

  Keywords: type I interferons; IFNAR1; structurefunction analysis; protein  *Corresponding author protein interaction  Introduction  Interferons, discovered in 1957 by Isaacs &  Lindenmann, are so named after their ability to  interfere with viral proliferation.1 These cytokines  can also combat bacterial and parasitic infections,  inhibit cell division, inhibit spontaneous apoptosis,  and promote or impede the differentiation of cells.
  Based on their receptor specificity, two types of  interferon are recognized: type I and type II.
The  type I interferons are a family of monomeric  proteins, including many non-allelic alpha interferons and IFNu that are products of leukocytes,  IFNb that is produced by fibroblasts, and IFNt that  has been described only in ungulate species.2 The  only known type II interferon is the dimeric IFNg,  which is produced exclusively by lymphocytes.2,3  The human interferon alpha family is composed of  13 intronless fully translated genes (excluding  pseudo-genes).3 Each member includes mature  proteins of 165 or 166 amino acid residues, with  two conserved disulfide bonds: Cys1Cys98 and  Cys29Cys138.4 A high level of sequence homology  (80%) is displayed among the various interferon  alpha sub-types, and about 35% homology exists  between these sub-types and the IFNb.
  2 In spite of  the high homology of the different sub-types, their  biological activities, among them anti-proliferative,  antiviral, and immunomodulation, differ notably.5,6  0022-2836/$ - see front matter q 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Biol. (2005) 353, 271281The structures of several type I interferons have  been solved including murine IFNb (1IFA, 1RMI),7  human IFNb (1AU1),8human IFNa2 (1RH2, 1ITF),9,10  and ovine IFNt (1B5L).11 Structurally, interferons  are members of the a-helical cytokine family. All the  type I interferons signal through a common  receptor complex composed of IFNAR1 and  IFNAR2.12 The major ligand-binding component  of the type I interferon receptor is IFNAR2, with a  binding affinity of w10 nM for IFNa2.13  The structure of the extracellular part of IFNAR2  consists of two immunoglobulin-like domains,  with the binding site of IFNa2 being located at  the N-terminal domain and the connecting  loop.14,15  Mature IFNAR1 is a 530 amino acid protein, with  a transmembrane segment composed of 21  residues, and a cytoplasmatic domain of 100  residues.16 The structure of the extracellular part  of IFNAR1 is unknown, but from the sequence one  can deduce that it is composed of four immunoglobulin-like domains.
Binding of IFNa2 to IFNAR1  is weak, with the affinity measured on an artificial  membrane being 5 mM.17 Bovine IFNAR1  (BoIFNAR1) and the human IFNAR1 (HuIFNAR1),  are 68% identical.
The sub-domains 2 and 3 of  HuIFNAR1 have been shown to play a critical role  in binding IFNa2.18,19 By exchanging these subdomains with the homologous BoIFNAR1, the  affinity was increased substantially.
The soluble  BoIFNAR1 can bind human interferons with a  10 nM affinity, which is 500-fold greater than that  of HuIFNAR1.17,20,21 A number of mAbs were  raised against IFNAR1, some of them neutralizing  (like 64G12 and EA12) while others, such as DB2  and AA3, not.22 The latter two were used in this  study to immobilize IFNAR1 to the surface.
Their  binding site on IFNAR1 was mapped to domain 4  and 2, respectively.22 Murine cells expressing  HuIFNAR2 bind IFNa2 with an affinity of 8 nM,  whereas cells expressing only HuIFNAR1 exhibit  no ligand binding.23 Upon co-expression of IFNAR1  and IFNAR2, a tenfold increase in the affinity for  IFNa2 was observed.
Using in vitro studies on  artificial membranes it was shown that the magnitude of IFNAR1-induced increase in binding  affinity of the ternary complex relates to the relative  surface concentration of this receptor.17 The  IFNAR1 receptor is an essential component of the  interferon receptor complex.
Indeed, an IFNAR1-  null mutation, or the addition of neutralizing  antibody against this receptor, results in cells  completely irresponsive to the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of IFNa and IFNb.
  24 The  location of the IFNAR1 binding site on interferon  was mapped on IFNb to be located on the B, C, and  D helices and the DE loop.25 Residues on the C helix  were implicated to be important for activity also on  IFNa2.26  A number of studies have suggested that the  formation of the ternary complex occurs in a  sequential mode, beginning with interferon  binding IFNAR2 to form an intermediate complex,  Figure 1.

  272 Mutational Analysis of the IFNAR1 Binding Site of IFNa2followed by the recruitment of IFNAR1.17,27 The  IFNAR1IFNbIFNAR2 complex has been shown  to have a 1 : 1 : 1 stoichiometry.28 Association of  IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 stimulates the activation of  the constitutively associated intracellular kinases  Jak1 and Tyk2, leading to a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade that results in the dimerization of the  phosphorylated STATs, and transport into the  nucleus, where they bind to specific DNA  sequences and stimulate transcription of hundreds  of responsive genes.29,30  The question remains open on how very similar  interferons induce differential activities on the same  cell type.
It has been suggested that the biological  activities of different IFNa sub-types correlate with  their respective binding affinities and the cell type  used.31 Here, we aimed to elucidate the IFNAR1-  binding site on IFNa2.
We have performed a  systematic search, using solid phase detection to  analyze the interaction of 21 different purified  interferon mutant proteins to a surface immobilized  IFNAR1-EC receptor.
The in vitro binding data were  compared with the antiviral and anti-proliferative  potencies of these mutants.
We found an extraordinary composition of the binding site between  IFNa2 and IFNAR1 receptor, which lacks  binding hot spots, and also identified a number of  alanine mutations on the IFNa2 surface that confer  tighter receptor binding and increased biological  activity.
  Results  Real-time characterization of the IFNa2IFNAR1-  EC interaction  The interaction of IFNAR1-EC with IFNa2 was  investigated by label-free solid phase detection  using reflectometric interference spectroscopy  (RifS).
This technology requires the immobilization  of one of the interacting compounds on a chip  surface.
The standard method of direct immobilization of IFNAR1 by amine coupling to a carboxymethylated surface did not yield an active IFNAR1  surface.
However, we found it possible to  immobilize biotinylated IFNAR1 to a streptavidin  surface, but for convenience we utilized a method  successfully employed by us previously for  IFNAR2-EC, in which the receptor was  immobilized by monoclonal antibodies.32 The  non-neutralizing anti-IFNAR1-EC monoclonal  antibody (mAb) DB2 was coupled to the aminofunctionalized dextran AMD 500 surface via its  exposed amino groups.
The IFNAR1-EC was  affinity-captured to the mAb surface followed by  the addition of a second non-neutralizing mAb,  AA3.
The second mAb is stabilizing IFNAR1-EC on  the surface (similar as for IFNAR2-EC32).
The  process as followed in real time RIfS is shown in  Figure 1(a).

d Data taken from Lamken et al.  17  Mutational Analysis of the IFNAR1 Binding Site of IFNa2 273bound to the RIfS surface was determined by  injecting IFNa2 protein at concentrations ranging  from 0.12 mM to 4 mM. Due to the low binding  affinity of IFNa2 to IFNAR1-EC, kinetic data of  association and dissociation could not be determined.
Therefore, the binding affinity was determined from plotting the steady-state response  versus the protein concentration according to the  law of mass action (Figure 1(b) and (c)).
This results  in an affinity constant of 1.5 mM for wild-type  IFNa2.
The affinity determined here is about  threefold tighter than the one determined  previously.17 This could be due to a number of  factors.
For one, a different method for surface  immobilization of IFNAR1-EC was employed in  both studies, which can result in differences in  absolute binding affinities (as previously observed  for IFNAR2-EC32).
A second possible reason is that  the IFNAR1-EC used here was expressed in yeast  and was de-glycosylated, while in the former  Figure 2.

  274 Mutational Analysis of the IFNAR1 Binding Site of IFNa2study17 the protein was expressed in baculovirus  with the sugars staying intact.
The difference in the  glycosylation pattern for both proteins may cause  some change in their compactness and binding to  interferon.
However, as the major aim of this study  was to compare the binding affinities of different  IFNa2 mutants to the same IFNAR1-EC, the  difference in the absolute binding affinity should  not influence the relative change in binding upon  mutation.32  Mapping the binding site of IFNAR1 on IFNa2  In order to locate the binding site of IFNAR1 on  IFNa2, we performed an alanine scan of most  residues located on the B and C helices (Figure 2).
  All together, 21 single point mutations were  produced, and their binding affinity towards  IFNAR2 and towards IFNAR1 were measured by  RIfS. The binding affinities of the different mutant  proteins towards IFNAR2 were very similar to  wild-type IFNa2 (Table 1).
This is not surprising, as  the mutations are located on the opposite surface of  the IFNAR2 binding site on IFNa2.
Yet, these results  validate the proper folding of all the mutant  proteins, and their active concentrations.
While  binding of IFNa2 to IFNAR2-EC provides a clear  kinetic signal, binding to IFNAR1-EC is much  weaker and has to be analyzed using equation (1)  according to the shift in the interference spectrum of  the steady-state affinity (y-axis in Figure 1), at  different concentrations of the ligand.
In this case,  the knowledge of the active concentrations of all  IFNa2 proteins is essential.
Therefore, in addition to  the IFNAR2-EC binding measurements, all mutant  protein concentrations were validated on an  analytical gel-filtration column by their capacity to  bind IFNAR2-EC.
  The results of all the binding measurements are  summarized in Table 1 and Figure 2(b).
Three  mutations resulted in an increase in the binding  affinity towards IFNAR1-EC (H57A, E58A and  Q61A) while six mutations caused a decrease in  the binding affinity (F64A, N65A, T69A, L80A,  Figure 3.

  Mutational Analysis of the IFNAR1 Binding Site of IFNa2 275Y85A and Y89A).
However, no hot spot for binding  was identified, with none of the mutations leading to  a change beyond fivefold in affinity.
To corroborate  the single mutation effects, a triple mutant containing  the single mutations L80A, Y85A, Y89A (designated  as LYY) and a quadruple mutant composed of N65A,  L80A, Y85A, Y89A (designated as NLYY) were  prepared.
Binding for these two mutant proteins  was below the threshold of our measurement.
  Anti-proliferative and antiviral activity of IFNa2  mutants  We next compared the binding properties of the  interferon mutants with their corresponding biological activities.
The antiviral activity was assayed  as the inhibition of the cytopathic effect of vesicular  stomatitis virus (VSV) on WISH cells (a human  epithelial cell line of amniotic origin).
The antiproliferative activity was determined both on WISH  cells and on DAUDI cells, as the 50% inhibition of  cell growth (see Materials and Methods).
Due to  their high sensitivity, it is standard practice to test  interferon anti-proliferative activity on DAUDI  cells,5 and antiviral activity on WISH cells33 (to  our knowledge, there is no reported evidence  regarding the antiviral activity on DAUDI cells,  due to technical difficulties).
To obtain a direct  quantitative comparison of both activities on the  same cell line, we also tested the anti-proliferative  activity on WISH cells.
Relative activities were  obtained in comparison to wild-type IFNa2, and  included IFNb in the analysis as another point of  reference.
As an example, Figure 3 shows the antiproliferative and antiviral analyses of IFNa2 and  IFNb.
The anti-proliferative activity of interferons  on WISH cells was determined by applying a serial  dilution of interferons for 72 hours, after which the  cells were stained using crystal violet (Figure 3(a)).
  The relative number of cells in each well was  determined from a densitometry analysis, and the  results were plotted versus the protein concentration  applied (Figure 3(b)).
The same was done to  determine the antiviral potency of interferons on  WISH cells (Figure 3(c)).
The protein concentration  giving 50% activity (EC50), as well as the sensitivity  of cells to increasing amounts of interferon (s, for  slope), were deduced from an IFN dose-response  curve (equation (2)).
The IFNa2 and IFNb concentrations promoting 50% antiviral protection were  0.85 pM and 0.43 pM, respectively (averaged over  six experiments).
The average IFNa2 (17 experiments) and IFNb (seven experiments) antiproliferative activity EC50 were 1360 pM and  29 pM, respectively.
Interestingly, the IFNa2 concentration promoting 50% anti-proliferative activity  in DAUDI cells is only 0.5 pM (Table 2), which is  three orders of magnitude lower than that  measured for WISH cells, highlighting the importance of using the same cell line when comparing  different activities.
  The antiviral and anti-proliferative activities of all  the interferon mutant proteins were determined  relative to that of wild-type IFNa2, as the wt/mut  Table 2.

  276 Mutational Analysis of the IFNAR1 Binding Site of IFNa2ratio.
Results are summarized in Table 2.
Similar to  what was found for the binding affinity towards  IFNAR1-EC, the antiviral and anti-proliferative  activities of the interferon mutants did not change  dramatically upon mutation.
The only mutant  that causes a significant increase in antiviral activity  (O2-fold) is E58A.
L80A, Y85A and Y89A cause a  significant decrease in antiviral activity (yet, none  below fivefold).
However, the combined LYY and  NLYY mutants reduced the antiviral potency by 30  and 100-fold, respectively.
This reduction roughly  fits the additive effects of the single mutations (for  LYY, 0.5!0.26!0.20Z0.029).
The effect on the antiproliferative activity of the same set of mutants is  more significant, with both E58A and Q61A causing  a significant increase in activity, while N65A, T69A,  L80A, Y85A and Y89A causing a significant  decrease in activity.
Moreover, the magnitude of  the decrease in anti-proliferative activity measured  on WISH cells is significantly larger than that  measured for antiviral protection.
The multiple  LYY and NLYY mutants reduce activity by 180 and  1100-fold, respectively.
In this case, the single  mutations overestimate the effect measured for the  multiple mutants by about 30-fold (for LYY, 0.14!  0.035!0.044Z0.00022 versus the experimentally  measured value of 0.0057, and for NLYY 0.16!  0.14!0.035!0.044Z0.000035 versus the experimentally measured value of 0.00092).
The antiviral  and anti-proliferative results for all mutants  analyzed are plotted in Figure 4(a).
For interest,  we included IFNb.
This graph shows that most  mutations analyzed have a stronger effect on the  anti-proliferative response than on the antiviral  response.
Interestingly, this trend also fits the data  for IFNb, for which the antiviral activity is about  twofold higher than that of IFNa2 while its antiproliferative activity is about 50-fold higher.
  Figure 4(b) shows a comparison of the biological  activity with the measured binding affinity for  IFNAR1, showing that both activities generally scale  with the binding affinity, though not over the whole  scale.
One clear exemption to this is IFNb.
  Discussion  The primary aim of this work was to map the  IFNAR1 binding site on IFNa2.
For this purpose we  constructed 21 single Ala mutations on the B and C  helixes.
The location of the binding site is similar to  that reported for IFNb, around residues Y85 and  Y89.25 In addition to these residues, the binding site  also includes H57, E58, Q61 (whose alanine  mutation increases binding) and F64, N65, T69  and L80 (Ala mutation decreases binding).
This  maps the IFNAR1 binding site on the opposite  surface relative to the IFNAR2 binding site14,15  (Figure 5(a) and (b)), and would fit the classical  model for cytokinereceptor interaction as shown  for hGH, EPO and IL434 where the ligand recruits  two receptor subunits binding to opposite,  structurally distant surfaces of the cytokine.
  Mapping these residues on the surface of IFNa2  shows that all residues that affect binding are  concentrated at one location, except for leucine 80  that faces the opposite direction (albeit still in close  proximity).
Without further knowledge of the  interferon-binding site on IFNAR1, it is difficult to  guess the role of Leu80 in binding IFNa2.
It was  suggested that the interferon binding site on  IFNAR1 consists of more than one continuous  patch.18 Therefore, it is possible that Leu80 binds  the second active patch on IFNAR1.
Another  possibility would be that Leu80, which is partially  buried within IFNa2 has an indirect effect on  Figure 4.

  Mutational Analysis of the IFNAR1 Binding Site of IFNa2 277binding, through the destabilization of the C helix  (Figure 5(b)).
However, this mutant binds IFNAR2-  EC with affinity similar to wt, and runs as expected  on an analytical gel filtration column, not supporting this notion.
Moreover, its effect on binding  within the multiple LYY and NLYY mutations is  additive (in the antiviral test), suggesting that  Leu80 is not destabilizing the C helix.
  The mutations that cause an increase in affinity  (H57, E58 and Q61) are physically grouped (red  patch in Figure 5(a)), separately from the group of  residues that upon mutation decrease the binding  affinity towards IFNAR1 (F64, N65, T69, L80, Y85  and Y89; blue patch in Figure 5(a)).
Indeed, it is  interesting to note that residues 57, 58 and 61 are  polar, while the residues in the second group are  mostly aromatic or hydrophobic.
This may relate to  the composition of the binding site on IFNAR1.
  Indeed, a number of aromatic residues on IFNAR1  were implicated to participate in the binding with  interferon, suggesting an aromatic interface  between the two proteins.18  A surprising aspect of the IFNAR1 binding site  on IFNa2 is the lack of hot spot residues for binding,  with no single mutation causing a change in affinity  of over fivefold.
This is very different from that  found for the IFNAR2 binding site,13,35 and actually  for most other proteinprotein binding sites.36  Indeed, two of the six residues identified to reduce  binding (Tyr85 and 89) are not conserved between  IFNa proteins, suggesting multiple solutions for  weak binding.
In contrast, all six hot spot residues  on IFNa2 binding IFNAR2 (30, 33, 144, 147, 148 and  149)37 are conserved for all IFNa proteins  (Figure 2(a)).
To decrease binding to IFNAR1  further, we had to introduce multiple mutations  (e.g. LYY or NLYY).
For those, the binding affinity  was below the detection threshold of our biophysical measurements.
Yet, binding occurred, as shown  by their residual biological activities (between 100  and 10,000-fold reduction).
  The results of the mutagenesis studies of the  IFNAR1 binding site on IFNa2 clearly suggest that  binding of IFNa2 to IFNAR1 is far from being  optimal.
Three of the mutations to Ala (H57, E58  and Q61) increased the binding affinity (as  measured in vitro and in vivo) by two to fourfold  per mutant.
Interestingly, these three residues are  conserved in all IFNa proteins (Figure 2(a)), and  still their mutation (to Ala) increases both binding  and biological activity.
If mutations to Ala increase  affinity, one may guess that mutations to other  residues could increase affinity to IFNAR1 even  further.
This suggests that the weak binding of  IFNAR1 to all IFNa proteins (but not to IFNb17) is a  conserved feature of this system.
The much higher  affinity of IFNb towards IFNAR1, and the easiness of  improving binding of IFNa2 towards IFNAR1, make  one to believe that the low affinity of IFNa2 towards  IFNAR1 is not a coincidence, but has biological  relevance.
As shown for IFNb, the increased binding  affinity mostly translates into an increase in the antiproliferative activity of the interferon (Table 1 and  Figure 4(b)), while the antiviral potency seems to be  close to its maximum also in wild-type IFNa2.
It is  possible, that a strong anti-proliferative effect of  IFNa2 upon viral infection is actually not desirable,  and that tighter binding to IFNAR1 is one of the  mechanisms for differential activation.
  Different activities have been attributed to IFNa2  versus IFNb.
The most basic difference between the  two is in their antiviral versus anti-proliferative  Figure 5.

  278 Mutational Analysis of the IFNAR1 Binding Site of IFNa2potentials.
This is clearly seen for WISH cells,  where the concentration needed to induce an antiproliferative effect by IFNa2 is three orders of  magnitude higher than that needed to initiate an  antiviral state.
For IFNb the difference in protein  concentrations needed to initiate the antiproliferative versus the antiviral response was only  65-fold.
The matter is further complicated when  different cell types are used.
While 1.3 nM IFNa2 is  needed to initiate a 50% anti-proliferative response  in WISH cells, only 0.4 pM was needed to do the  same in DAUDI cells (Table 2).
It has been reported  that DAUDI cells exhibit a high density of  interferon receptors on their surface27,38,39 and that  their anti-proliferative responsiveness to interferon  is unusually high.5 We suggest the hypothesis that  the combination of the weak binding affinity of  interferon towards IFNAR1, and the higher IFNAR  receptor concentration on DAUDI cells, is the  reason for their high anti-proliferative responsiveness to interferon, in comparison to WISH cells  and other human cell lines.
This hypothesis is  strengthened by the findings of Wagner et al., who  investigated the anti-proliferative activity of IFNb  on three cancer cell-lines (HT1080, LOX and  MDA231.MT1), and compared the activity to the  number of IFNAR surface receptors as determined  by FACS.
The data show clearly that LOX cells,  which were the most sensitive to IFNb, also  displayed the highest number of IFNAR1 and  IFNAR2 cell surface receptors.40  In addition to the differential sensitivities of  IFNa2 versus IFNb on WISH cells, we noticed  another interesting phenomena.
Following the  titration curve of anti-proliferative activity versus  interferon concentration (Figure 3) it becomes clear  that cells are more sensitive to IFNb than to IFNa2.
  First, the slope of the titration curve (equation (2)) of  IFNb is much steeper than that for IFNa2.
Second,  wells treated with IFNb at high concentrations  contain a significantly smaller number of cells, as  indicated by their lower density, compared to those  treated with IFNa2 even at the highest concentration (Figure 3(a) and (b); note the difference in  maximal cell density).
This may indicate that the  onset of activation of the anti-proliferative response  is faster for IFNb than for IFNa2.
The kinetics are  not a quantitative but a qualitative effect, as the  same cell density is observed even for interferon  concentrations much above that needed to arrest  growth, and is not increasing with higher interferon  concentrations.
The slope of the antiviral and antiproliferative titration curves (as determined from  fitting the data to equation (2)) is given in Table 2.
  The slope for IFNb is clearly steeper, but also  between the IFNa2 mutants one can see some order,  with the very weak mutants (in relation to binding  to IFNAR1) having a smaller slope.
While this is  very clear for the anti-proliferative activity, it can  also be seen for the antiviral activity of interferon,  albeit to a lesser degree.
IFNb was shown to bind  IFNAR1 about 50-fold tighter compared to IFNa2.17  This difference in binding affinity may explain the  faster onset of activation of the biological response to  IFNb.
IFNa2 binds first to IFNAR2, and then undergoes quick cycles of binding and dissociation with  IFNAR1 (with the ternary complex being metastable).
On the other hand, IFNb binds much tighter  to IFNAR1, conferring a stable ternary complex.28  Figure 4 gives a somewhat complicated picture of  the relations between the anti-proliferative and  antiviral effects of the different IFNa2 mutants,  and the binding affinity towards IFNAR1.
In  general there is a clear relation between biological  activity and binding affinity.
However, the relation  is not linear over the whole range of affinities and  activities, in contrast to that for mutants affecting  binding towards IFNAR2, where a linear relation  extending over three orders of magnitude was  recorded.37 For one, the mutant effect on antiproliferative activity is more pronounced than the  effect on antiviral activity (Figure 4(a) and Table 2).
  The weakest mutant (NLYY) has a 1000-fold  reduced anti-proliferative activity versus a 100-fold  reduced antiviral activity.
Tighter binding mutants  have also a more pronounced effect on the antiproliferative potency compared to their influence  on the antiviral state (Figure 4(b)).
The most  pronounced change here is of course for IFNb,  which, on a per-mol basis has 50-fold higher antiproliferative potency, but only a twofold higher  antiviral potency.
Looking at the antiviral/antiproliferative relations over the whole curve, it  seems that the antiviral potency cannot be increased  beyond twofold for tighter binding IFNAR1 interferons, while the anti-proliferative potency keeps  on rising linearly.
This would suggest a different  mechanism of activation for both pathways, which  may be influenced differently by the retention time  of the ternary complex, and would also indicate that  IFNAR1 is responsible for the differential activity of  interferons.
  Materials and Methods  Materials  Ethyl-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) and  N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS) were purchased from  Fluka.
Monoclonal anti-IFNAR1-mAb DB2 and AA3,22  which bind non-competitively and do not inhibit IFN  binding, were obtained from BiogenIdec.
WISH and  DAUDI cells were a gift by Daniela Novick, Weizmann  Institute of Science.
  Site-directed mutagenesis  Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR  amplification of the expression plasmid pT72Ca2 with  1821 nucleotide primers containing the mutated codon  using high fidelity polymerases pwo (Boehringer  Mannheim) and pfu (Stratagene) as described.41 After  phosphorylation and ligation, the mutated plasmids were  transformed into Escherichia coli TG1 cells.
The sequence  of the whole expressed gene containing the mutation was  verified by DNA sequencing.
  Mutational Analysis of the IFNAR1 Binding Site of IFNa2 279Protein expression and purification  IFNa2 and IFNAR2-EC were expressed in E. coli and  purified by ion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography as described.13 Protein concentrations were  determined from the absorbance at 280 nm with 3280Z  18,070 cmK1 MK1 for IFNa2 and 3280Z26,500 cmK1 MK1  for IFNAR2-EC.
IFNAR1-EC was produced as  described.28 Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE  under non-reducing conditions.
The concentration of  active IFNa2 protein was determined for all mutants by  analytical gel filtration with IFNAR2-EC as described.13  Measurements of binding affinity  
The interaction between recombinant IFNAR1-EC and  IFNa2 was monitored by reflectometric interference  spectroscopy (RIfS) under flow-through conditions.42  This method detects biomolecular interaction at interfaces  as a change in the apparent optical thickness of a thin  silica layer.
Binding to the surface is monitored as a shift  in the interference spectrum.
A shift of 1 pm corresponds  to approximately 1 pg/mm2 protein on the surface.
All  measurements were carried out using HBS (20 mM Hepes  (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.01% (v/v) Triton X100) as a  running buffer.
The non-neutralizing anti-IFNAR1-EC  mAb DB2 was coupled to the (amino-functionalized  dextran AMD 500) surface via its exposed amino groups  by amine-coupling chemistry.
The IFNAR1-EC was  affinity captured to the surface followed by cross-linking  with a second mAb AA3.
A detailed description of the  method (used for measuring the interferon  IFNAR2-EC  interaction) is given by Piehler & Schreiber.32 As binding  is weak, the dissociation constant KD was obtained from  the equilibrium response plotted against the protein  concentration and fitted according to the law of mass  action according to equation (1):  g Z KAcRmax=KAcn C1 (1)  where y is the signal, KA is the affinity (in molar), c is the  protein concentration, Rmax is the interference signal at  maximum binding and n is the stoichiometry of the  complex, which in this case is 1.  Antiviral and antiproliferative assays  Antiviral activity of wild-type and mutant IFNa2 was  assayed as the inhibition of the cytopathic effect of  vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) on human WISH cells.33  The antiproliferative assay on WISH cells was conducted by adding IFN at serial dilutions to the growth  media in flat-bottomed microtiter plates, and monitoring  the cell density after 72 hours by crystal violet staining.
  The 50% activity concentrations (EC50) as well as the  sensitivity of cells to increasing amounts of interferon  were deduced from an IFN doseresponse curve  (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software) using equation (2):  g Z A0 CA=1 Cc=EC50  s   (2)  where y is the absorbance and reflects the relative number  of cells, A0 is the offset, A is the amplitude, c is the IFN  concentration and s is the slope.
The slope is a measure of  the sensitivity of the cells to increasing interferon  concentrations.
  Error calculations  The error (s) on KD for IFNa2-IFNAR2 binding as  measured on RIfS is 20%, and for relative affinity  (wt/mut) 30%.
For IFNa2-IFNAR1, the error (s) on KD  is 35% and for relative affinity (wt/mut) 50%.
Using 2s  (95% confidence) as the basic confidence level, this would  suggest that a minimum of a twofold change can be seen  as significant.
The magnitude of the error (s) for  individual biological activity measurements (whether  antiviral or antiproliferative) is 35%.
Therefore, a 2s  confidence level between two measurements would  suggest that differences smaller than twofold are within  the experimental error.
