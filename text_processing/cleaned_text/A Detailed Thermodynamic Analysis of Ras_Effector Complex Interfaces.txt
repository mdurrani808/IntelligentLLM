A Detailed Thermodynamic Analysis of Ras/Effector  Complex Interfaces  Christina Kiel1  , Luis Serrano2 and Christian Herrmann1*  1  Max-Planck-Institut fur  Molekulare Physiologie  Abteilung Strukturelle Biologie  Otto-Hahn-Strasse 11, 44227  Dortmund, Germany  2  EMBL, Meyerhofstrasse 1  69117 Heidelberg, Germany  Many cellular functions are based on the interaction and crosstalk of  various signaling proteins.
Among these, members of the Ras family of  small GTP-binding proteins are important for communicating signals  into different pathways.
In order to answer the question of how binding  affinity and specificity is achieved, we analyzed binding energetics on  the molecular level, with reference to the available structural data.
The  interaction of two members of the Ras subfamily with two different  effector proteins, namely Raf and RalGDS, were investigated using  isothermal titration calorimetry and a fluorescence-based method.
Experiments with alanine mutants, located in the complex interfaces, yielded an  energy map for the contact areas of the Ras/effector complexes, which  could be differentiated into enthalpy and entropy contributions.
In  addition, by using double mutant cycle analysis, we probed the energetic  contribution of selected pairs of amino acid residues.
The resulting energy  landscapes of the Ras/effector interface areas show a highly different topology when comparing the two effectors, Raf and RalGDS, demonstrating  the specificity of the respective interactions.
Particularly, we observe a  high degree of compensating effects between enthalpy and entropy;  differences between these components are much greater than the overall  free energy differences.
This is observed also when using the software  FOLD-X to predict the effect of point mutations on the crystal structures  of the different complexes.
Prediction of the free energy changes shows a  very good correlation with the experimentally observed energies.
Furthermore, in line with experimental data, energy decomposition indicates that  many different components of large magnitude counteract each other to  produce a smaller change in overall free energy, illustrating the importance of long-range electrostatic forces in complex formation.

Ras and Ras-related GTP-binding proteins  play an important role within signaling pathways,  while acting as switch molecules: they cycle  between two nucleotide states, a GDP-bound  inactive and a GTP-bound active form.
Switching  between these nucleotide states is controlled by  the action of guanine nucleotide exchange factors  and GTPase-activating proteins.1,2 In the active  form, Ras proteins gain the ability to interact with  various downstream targets, so-called effector  molecules.
The Ser/Thr-specific protein kinase Raf  was the first effector identified to become activated  upon binding to Ras in the GTP-bound state, subsequently activating the MAP kinase cascade,  which results in the phosphorylation and  activation of DNA transcription factors in the  0022-2836/$ - see front matter q 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Although some signal  transduction pathways of Ras/effector interactions  have been elucidated, the importance and the  mechanisms of crosstalk between different pathways are unresolved, especially the molecular  details of the effectors specificity for different Ras  proteins.
  The Ras-binding domain (RBD) is a functional  element common to all known Ras effectors.
Structural characterization of the RBDs of Raf, RalGDS,  PI3K, Byr2 and AF6 by X-ray analysis and NMR  spectroscopy revealed the same topology for all  RBDs; i.e. the ubiquitin fold.7  13 This is particularly  interesting, as there is only poor sequence  homology among the different RBDs.
The structures of Raf-RBD in complex with Rap1A (here  called simply Rap) or in complex with the mutant  Rap1A K31E, E30D (which serves as a mimic for  Ras, here termed Raps), have been solved using  X-ray crystallography.14,15 In addition, crystal structures have been determined for RalGDS-RBD in  complex with H-Ras (here abbreviated to Ras)16  and (at better resolution) with the mutant H-Ras  E31K,17 Ras in complex with PI(3)K18 and Ras in  complex with Byr2-RBD.13 All these structures of  RBDs in complex with a Ras protein show the formation of an intermolecular antiparallel b-sheet  consisting of b2 and b3 of the Ras protein, and b1  and b2 of the RBD.
Nevertheless, biochemical  studies have shown that an effector RBD binds  with different affinities to the members of the Ras  subfamily.19,20 Especially the comparison of the  effectors RalGDS-RBD and Raf-RBD shows significant differences: RalGDS-RBD binds with higher  affinity to Rap than to Ras, while Raf-RBD binds  more strongly to Ras than to Rap.15 This specificity  is astonishing, considering the high level of homology of the effector region of the Ras proteins,  which share the same core effector region.
In an  earlier study, the interactions of four closely related  members of the Ras family with four different  effectors were analyzed using isothermal titration  calorimetry (ITC).21 The changes in enthalpy,  entropy and heat capacity were shown to be  similar for the same effector associating with  different Ras proteins.
In contrast, the thermodynamic parameters of Ras associating with  various RBDs, especially those of RalGDS and Raf,  are drastically different.
  In order to further understand the observed  specificity in molecular detail, we have analyzed  the observations mentioned above on a more  detailed thermodynamic level by defining the  energetic contributions of distinct pairs of amino  acid residues located in the protein/protein interface.
Here, we present the protein/protein interface landscapes contoured by the free energy of  binding, differentiated according to enthalpic and  entropic contributions.
We focused on the interaction of Ras and Rap with the RBDs of Raf and  RalGDS.
In addition, the experimental data are  compared to the results from theoretical calculations of the changes in binding energy.
These  calculations are based on an empirical approach to  defining a set of parameters that relate structural  observations and binding affinity.22 Although the  different energy terms used in FOLD-X do not  relate unequivocally to enthalpic and entropic  components, they allow a rough estimate of the  importance of different forces to the formation of  the complexes analyzed here.
  Results  Starting from the structure  The structural view of a protein complex shows,  in general, the distances and geometries of interacting amino acid residues, the details of which  depend on the resolution of the structure.
Despite  the high resolution of some of these structures,  they tell us little about the underlying binding  energies and the location of possible hot spots  in the protein/protein interface, which are responsible for a major part of complex formation.
We  took advantage of structural data on Ras/effector  complexes in order to identify amino acid residues,  in the contact area of the two proteins, which are  likely to contribute to the interaction.
To understand the relationship between structure and  energetics of interaction, we studied the change in  thermodynamic parameters upon single alanine  mutation and upon combined changes of one  residue in both proteins at the same time in order  to measure their energetic coupling, as described  in detail below.
  The Ras family members share the same core  effector region (residues 3240) differentiated by  only a few different flanking amino acids.23 In  Figure 1(a) and (b) the complex between Rap and  the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf is depicted  in two orientations in order to show all important  contacts of amino acid side-chains.
Figure 1(c)  and (d) show the structure and the interface  residues of the complex between Ras and RalGDSRBD, and it is these interactions that we explored  on a quantitative thermodynamic level.
The RBDs  of all Ras effectors analyzed so far share the  bbabbab ubiquitin fold.
This is remarkable, as the  effectors share only little sequence homology in  their RBD.
In addition, all the effectors contact the  Ras protein in a similar way, basically by establishing an intermolecular b-sheet comprised of Ras-b2  and Ras-b3, and RBD-b1 and RBD-b2.
In Tables 1  and 2, we list the contacts established between the  effectors and Ras.
It must be emphasized that the  interaction is stabilized mainly by the contacts  between polar and charged amino acid side-chains  mediated partly by water molecules.
Hydrophobic  residues play only a minor role in all Ras/effector  1040 Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector InterfacesFigure 1 (legend on p.1043)  Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfaces 1041Figure 1 (legend opposite)  1042 Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfacescomplexes and the binding interface is rather flat.
  However, this does not mean that apolar atoms of  charged side-chains like Lys or Arg do not have  an important contribution to the stability of the  complex.
  Inspection of the Ras/RalGDS-RBD complexes  (1lfd and see Vetter et al.  16) shows that Gln25 of  Ras has its NH2 and CO groups within H-bond distance of the His27 side-chain and the CO group of  RalGDS-RBD Asn27, respectively (Figure 1(e)).
  Although the NH2 group of Gln25 can H-bond to  the side-chain N group of a non-charged His, the  Gln25 side-chain CO group will not H-bond to  another carbonyl group.
Therefore, it makes more  sense to swap the NH2 and CO groups of Gln25  so that two H-bonds are made.
Similarly, Asn25 of  RalGDS-RBD (Figure 1(f)) has, in one complex,  the NH2 group pointing to the center of the aromatic ring of Ras Tyr40 and in the other the CO  group.
It is well established that N groups from  Lys, Asn and Gln can make pseudo-H-bonds with  the center of the aromatic rings of Phe and Tyr.24  Thus, since both orientations are similar in terms  of the interactions with other neighbor residues,  we favored the one with the NH2 group pointing  to the aromatic ring.
Other changes involved a  rotamer change for RalGDS Ser29, as seen in the  wild-type complex,16 resulting in a good H-bond  made with the main-chain amide group of Ras  Figure 1.

Otherwise, the N group of Ras Glu37 will  be buried and unsatisfied.
Finally, we modified  slightly the rotamer of RalGDS-RBD Lys28.
The  CE and NZ groups of this Lys have high B-factors,  and in the complex the NZ group makes an  H-bond to the RalGDS-RBD carbonyl group of  Lys48.
This leaves the OH group of Ras Tyr40 and  the OD2 atom of Ras Asp38 buried and unsatisfied.
  A small rotation of the NZ groups provides a  double H-bond to both Ras residues.
It is quite conceivable that in the structure in solution the Lys NZ  atom will be moving between the two conformations, explaining the high B-factors.
Finally, we  mutated Ras Lys31 to Glu, since this is the residue  present in the experimental analysis.
  Regarding the Rap/Raf-RBD complex, we used  PDB structures 1CLY and 1GUA.
Where structural  data were not available, we needed to modify  available structures by mutating the corresponding  Ras residues.
In the first case, we mutated Rap  Lys31 to Glu, and in both cases we mutated  Rap Val21 to Ile and Ile27 to His. As a result of the  Lys31 to Glu mutation, Lys84 of Raf-RBD was  re-oriented to approximate Glu31.
No other change  was made, since the orientation of the rest of the  side-chains seemed correct.
  The structures of the complexes after these  changes are used as a basis to select amino acid  residues for substitution in order to analyze the  thermodynamics of the interaction at the molecular  level.
  Thermodynamic characterization  In previous studies, the GDI assay was  developed in order to obtain accurate data on the  affinity between Ras proteins and effectors.
This  method is based on the observation that GTP (or  GppNHp) dissociation from the Ras protein is  inhibited by effector binding.
By attaching a fluorescent label (the mant group; N-methylanthraniloyl  (a fluorophor attached to the 20  or 30 position of the  nucleotide)) to the nucleotide, it is possible to  follow the dissociation kinetics with respect to the  effector concentration.
It is possible to calculate  the Kd (equilibrium dissociation constant) of the  Ras/effector complex from these data.
Typical  data of this type are shown in Figure 2, for a set of  Ras and RalGDS mutants.
The curves are fit  according to a quadratic equation, which yields  the Kd value as described.25 Averaging the results  of two or three independent experiments leads to  a range of error #30%, which corresponds to  ^0.16 kcal/mol for the resulting change of free  energy, DG8 (1 cal  4.184 J).
In addition to Ka  (defined as the reciprocal value of Kd), and the corresponding DG8 values, we obtain directly the  change in enthalpy, DH8, from isothermal titration  calorimetry (ITC) experiments26 and one can  calculate the change in entropy, DS8.
Commonly,  in calorimetry experiments these parameters refer  to complex formation rather than dissociation.
  Figure 3 shows the association of Ras with RalGDS  N23A as a typical example of an ITC measurement  of the Ras/RalGDS system.
As indicated by the  negative peaks in Figure 3, complex formation is  exothermic; an observation that holds true for all  the other experiments.
ITC is the major tool for  the work presented here.
Each experiment was  carried out at least twice and, similar to the GDI  results, the experimental error on the DG8 values  is less than 0.2 kcal/mol.
For the stoichiometry of  the Ras/effector interactions, a value of 1.0 ^ 0.1  was obtained by ITC reflecting errors in the concentration of the proteins.
This has impact on the  DH8 values, leading to an error of ^10%, which is  much larger than the error from curve fitting.
For  a few mutants, the decrease of binding affinity is  so dramatic that the Kd value exceeds 100 mM.  Although this makes it impossible to measure the  interaction by ITC (exceedingly high concentrations would be necessary), the GDI method is  still capable of yielding reasonable estimates in  the range of Kd  10 mM up to 500 mM. Good  agreement of the Kd values obtained by ITC and  GDI is observed for measurements where both  methods were applied (see the Tables below).
  Effects of single mutations  In this study, alanine mutations were generated  almost exclusively, since this residue is expected  to abolish all interactions of the native residue and  to show only weak interactions (if any) with the  other amino acid side-chains.
However, Tyr-Phe  mutations were analyzed in two cases.
Thus, we  focused on removing the existing contacts and  quantifying the changes in binding, and we did  not try to substitute for residues with the potential  for stronger or new interactions.
  On the basis of structural data for different Ras/  effector complexes, we analyzed point mutations  of amino acid residues of Ras, Rap, RalGDS- and  Raf-RBD, which are involved in the formation of  the complexes.
Table 3 shows the results for  binding of single mutants of RalGDS and Ras or  Rap characterized by large favorable (negative)  enthalpy changes counteracted by an unfavorable  (negative) entropy change.
The difference values  DDX8 in the Tables are defined as wild-type minus  mutant, and a decrease of the amount of Gibbs  energy of binding (DDG8 , 0) is observed for most  mutations, with a maximum change of 3.9 kcal/  mol.
Four residues seem to play the most important role for the interaction; namely, Arg16, Tyr27,  Lys28 and Lys48 (numbering according to Vetter  et al.  16).
These lead to a decrease of the amount of  free binding energy of more than 2 kcal/mol each  upon mutation.
The respective decrease of the  amount of binding enthalpy upon mutation of one  residue is in most cases larger (up to 5.5 kcal/  mol), accompanied by a corresponding counteracting change of TDS8.
Typical examples are Ras  residues Glu31 and Asp33 in the Ras/RalGDS  complex.
We observe this especially for the substitution of the polar amino acid residues lysine and  1044 Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfacesarginine by alanine.
Also for the Ras/Raf complex  (Table 4) we find enthalpy and entropy changes  upon mutation being much greater than the resulting DDG8 value.
  Similar results are found for the binding of  RalGDS to Rap, which is tighter than to Ras due  to a less unfavorable (less negative) entropy  change.
The changes of the Gibbs energy upon  Figure 2.
Typical results of the GDI assay.
The observed rate constants for the dissociation of Ras-mantGppNHp (WT  or the E37A mutant) are plotted against the concentration of RalGDS-RBD (WT or the S29A mutant).
Binding curves  are fitted to the data, each leading to four DG8 values from which the coupling energy (DDG8int) between the amino  acid residues Ras R41 and RalGDS-RBD N23 is calculated (see the text).
  Figure 3.
A typical ITC experiment.
Ras was titrated with the  N23A mutant of RalGDS-RBD.
In  each step, 8 ml (except the first  step, 2 ml) of 800 mM Ras bound to  GppNHp were injected into the cell  containing 1.36 ml of 80 mM  RalGDS N23A.
  Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfaces 1045mutation of amino acid residues to alanine are  comparable to those in the Ras/RalGDS system  and, again, the change in binding enthalpy is, in  most cases, larger than the changes of the binding  free energy.
As observed for RalGDS binding to  Ras, binding to Rap seems to be achieved mainly  by the three positively charged residues Arg16,  Lys28 and Lys48 of RalGDS and by Tyr27.
Important residues in the Ras protein are Asp38 (which  is the classical mutant in the effector binding  region of Ras) and Tyr40, whereas in Rap Ile36  and Arg41 play significant roles, additionally.
  The results from isothermal titration experiments with single mutants of Raf, Ras and Raps  are summarized in Table 4.
In contrast to RalGDS  binding, the complex formation of Ras and Raf is  characterized by favorable enthalpy and entropy  changes, but similar to RalGDS, mutations of single  amino acids in the complex interface reduce the  amount of free energy of binding up to 3.3 kcal/  mol.
In agreement with the results of previous  studies,21 single mutations do not lead to a complete change of the thermodynamic characteristics,  i.e. binding of RalGDS mutants remains unfavorable with respect to the entropy change, whereas  interaction of Raf mutants is controlled by favorable enthalpy and entropy changes.
The values of  DDH8 and TDDS8, in general, are smaller for Raf  and do not exceed 3 kcal/mol.
However, it is  important to note that the single mutant Raf R89L  impairs binding very strongly.
The interaction of  this mutant with Ras is so weak that only a  dissociation constant of Kd .
500 mM can be estimated, which corresponds to a reduction in the  Table 3.

  1046 Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfacesamount of Gibbs energy of binding of at least  5 kcal/mol (representing more than half of the  total binding free energy).
Unfortunately, there is  no information available about enthalpy and  entropy changes for this mutant.
The amino acid  residue Arg89 of Raf-RBD seems to be a very hot  spot for the interaction with Ras.
Intriguingly,  Arg89 was the first residue reported in early genetic studies to be crucial for Ras/Raf signaling.27  Similar to the RalGDS complexes, the polar and  positively charged amino acid side-chains of the  effector contribute most to the interaction, namely  Arg59, Arg67, Lys84 and Arg89, which is in accordance with previous mutagenesis studies.28 Again  and not surprisingly, Asp38 is the most important  residue for interaction in the Ras protein.
  The results for mutants of Raf binding to Raps  are similar to those of binding to Ras.
Upon  mutation, the reduction of Gibbs energy of binding  leads to similar values, within the error range, indicating that the interactions across the interface are  similar to those in the Ras/Raf complexes.
These  data underline the suitability of the Raps/RafRBD complex as a structural model for the Ras/  Raf system.
Regarding the enthalpy changes, it is  important to note that the experiments of Raf-RBD  binding to Raps were done at 25 8C, leading to a  decrease in enthalpy change and a more favorable  entropy contribution for the wild-type and all  mutant complexes as compared to 37 8C.
The temperature dependence of the enthalpy change for  the binding of Raf to Ras has been addressed.21  Concerning the comparison of Ka values at 25 8C  and 37 8C, a twofold decrease of Ka is calculated  using a DH8 value of 210 kcal/mol, which corresponds to a DG8 value 0.4 kcal/mol larger (less  negative) at 37 8C.
Earlier ITC experiments using  Ras bound to mantGppNHp instead of GppNHp  demonstrated an increased Ka value of the effector  complex of only 1.5-fold.21  Calculated energetic contributions of  single mutations  The experimental values described above give  only a global description of the changes in stability  produced by the mutagenesis and their respective  enthalpic and entropic contributions.
In order to  gain more insight into the contribution of specific  interactions (i.e van der Waals, H-bonding, electrostatics, solvation, etc), we have predicted the  effect of the mutations using a force-field, FOLDX,22 that deconstructs the free energy change into  different terms that correspond roughly to the  physical terms mentioned above.

  Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfaces 1047the stability of the complexes, several assumptions  are required.
First, we assume that the structure of  the isolated monomers is similar to that in the complex.
Superimposition of Ras with or without  RalGDS or Raf, and superimposition of RalGDS  with or without Ras, shows very small conformational changes that could be due to packing  effects.
Any conformational change upon complex  formation will imply an energetic cost when compared with the monomer, and will result in an  over-prediction of the residue contribution.
The  second assumption is that upon mutation no  major conformational changes take place in the  monomer or in the complex.
Any reorganization  of the structure in the complex upon mutation  will result in overprediction of the interaction  energy.
Underprediction of interaction energies  will result either from the force-field or from errors  in the structure (crystallographic errors due to  resolution problems, Asn, Gln side-chain O and N  swapping or crystal contacts).
The stability of the  complex will be the result of the difference in  energy between the isolated monomers and the  complex plus the energy derived from the  facilitation of complex formation due to favorable  electrostatic complementarity (effects on kon).29  The former can be estimated directly using the  crystal structures, while the latter is estimated by  using an empirical approximation.
This empirical  approximation assumes that in the pre-complex  the orientation of the two molecules is similar to  that of the complex, but the interactions are loose  and the main contribution is electrostatic interactions (see Materials and Methods).29  With the above considerations, we proceeded to  realize in the computer all the point mutations in  the Ras-RalGDS and Ras-Raf complexes.
In  Tables 3 and 4 we show the average of the FOLDX22 calculated energy costs for the mutations on  the different crystal structures or in the two molecules of a crystal unit.
With few exceptions, the  calculated values are quite similar in different  crystal structures, suggesting that they are capturing conformational states of similar energies.
  For the Ras/RalGDS complex, the individual R  values using the average experimental data for the  two molecules17 in the asymmetric unit are 0.81  and 0.86 (1LFDa and 1LFDb), respectively, while if  we used the calculated average it is 0.88 with a  slope of 0.84.
Adding the calculated value for the  global interaction energy, we find an R value of  0.95 with a slope of 0.99 (Figure 4(a)).
Similar  values are obtained for the other X-ray structure,16  for all mutations except those involving residues  covered by the missing sequence segments of the  RalGDS structure (i.e. I14A).
  Regarding the Ras/Raf-RBD complex, we have  used two structures, 1GUA and 1CLY.
As in the  case of the Ras/RalGDS complex, we find an overall good correlation and similar values for the two  structures.
For 1CLY the R value is 0.77, while for  1GUA it is 0.72.
For the average of the calculated  values, R is 0.77 with a slope of 0.62.
Addition of  the calculated energy of the complex results in an  R value of 0.96 with a slope of 1.1 (Figure 4(b)).
It  is important to mention here that FOLD-X predicts  a very large loss of binding energy for the RafR89A  mutant (,5 kcal/mol), in agreement with the  experimental data.
  Interestingly enough, the predicted binding  energy for the two complexes is quite close to the  experimental value (Tables 3 and 4).
Taking into  account the large numbers used to calculate the  binding energy (Table 5), this means that the  force-field is capturing the essential energy terms  that determine the complex stability.
  Analysis of the different terms that FOLD-X uses  to calculate the energy (see Materials and  Methods), shows the opposite contribution of  Figure 4.

  1048 Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfacesdifferent terms that balance each other to produce  the free energy change.
In some cases, the electrostatic contribution on kon has a strong impact in  the final binding energy.
In other cases, H-bonds  or hydrophobic plus van der Waals interactions  dominate.
Finally, for some mutants, formation or  destruction of water bridges (water molecules  making two or more H-bonds to the protein) can  have a significant contribution.
In Table 5 we  show a summary of the contribution of the  different terms to complex formation.
As can be  seen, DDG for complex formation is the result of  many different opposing terms: H-bond formation,  electrostatics in the complex (and their effect on  kon), the hydrophobic effect and van der Waals  favoring complex formation; main-chain and sidechain entropy, and polar desolvation all act to  oppose.
The majority of the energy terms are  similar in both complexes, with the main  differences being a larger H-bond contribution in  the Ras/RalGDS complex (23.8 kcal/mol), while  the kon contribution is larger in the Ras/Raf  (22.4 kcal/mol) and the entropy cost smaller  (0.8 kcal/mol).
Thus, we would expect a larger  enthalpic term in the first and a more favorable  entropic cost in the second.
This fits very neatly  with the ITC results, where the enthalpic contribution is 23.6 kcal/mol more favorable in Ras/  RalGDS and the entropic contribution is  24.2 kcal/mol more favorable in the Ras/Raf  complex.
  Energy landscapes  We wished to compare the distribution of the  binding energy across the protein/protein interface  for the two effector complexes.
To this end, we  selected surface representations of the complex  structures and opened the two protein interfaces  outwards by 908, so that the interface areas are  towards the reader.
This allows a view over the  contacting amino acid residues buried in the  interface of the complex.
In Figure 5, they are  color-coded according to their energetic contributions for binding, as quantified by ITC.
The distributions of the enthalpy and entropy changes  inferred by mutation are shown for the Ras/Raf  complex in Figure 5A and B. The color graduations  for the enthalpy and entropy changes range from  red (the wild-type residue is favoring interaction)  to blue (unfavoring) as indicated by the bar in  Figure 5.
For many mutations the enthalpy and  entropy changes compensate each other (as seen  by deep red and blue colors) leading to only a  small value of DDG8.
In a much smaller number of  examples, both, enthalpy and entropy changes are  favorable.
  The Gibbs energy distribution on the interface of  Ras and Raf (including the estimated value for Raf  R89) is presented in Figure 5C.
Similar to what is  seen in Figure 5A and C, the energy distribution  on the surface of the Ras protein and the effector  is complementary.
This is expected and has been  observed in mutational studies of other protein  complexes.
Below, we will analyze in greater detail  the interactions between distinct pairs of amino  acid residues.
Strikingly, the distribution is very  different from the Ras/RalGDS complex in  Figure 5D.
Despite the similarity of the structures,  the energetic profile of the interactions looks  different.
Particularly, a very hot spot is observed  in the Ras/Raf complex, whereas a more even distribution over the interface is found in the Ras/  RalGDS complex.
The interface of Ras/RalGDS  shows the basic amino acid residues Arg16, Lys28  and Lys48 colored deeply red because they  contribute strongly to the interaction, whereas the  negatively charged amino acid residues Asp47,  Glu52 and Glu53 have only a minor effect on  binding.
  For most residues of the Ras/RalGDS interface,  it is the enthalpy change that favors binding and  that is compensated by an unfavorable entropy  change.
For a few residues, however, it is the  other way round. This could be expected, considering the DH8 and DS8 values of the wild-type  complex, which shows a negative DS8 value.
In  the Ras/Raf complex, the situation is not so clear,  due to the lack of DDH8 and DDS8 data for the  Arg89 mutant; these are likely to be significant in  magnitude.
Interestingly, from comparison of  Figure 5A and B, one can expect a deep red spot  in B instead of the black one, which means estimating a highly favoring entropy contribution of  Arg89, as we know that the prevailing blue color  in B on the Raf side must have a strong red  counterbalance.
  As we have revealed the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of Ras with the effector  RBDs of RalGDS and Raf, it would be interesting  to make general statements about the interaction  of single amino acid residues.
We can find only  poor correlation between removal of special type  of interacting residues and the resulting thermodynamic parameters.
We found a high enthalpy  loss for mutations of amino acid residues involved  in ionic interactions (Lys, Asp, Arg, Glu) and a  smaller enthalpic loss after destruction of H-bonds  as a result of mutation of polar amino acids (Ser,  Thr, Asn, His).
For ionic interactions and H-bonds,  the effects of the entropy contributions are  different, but the favorable entropy changes  Table 5.

This reflects a general trend that has  been found in other studies as well.30 The finding  that hot-spots of binding energy often involve  lysine, aspartic acid, arginine and tyrosine confirms findings in the literature.31 Ras/effector complexes have only few hydrophobic amino acid  side-chains in their interface and the small number  of mutations of these residues does not show a  general rule of the thermodynamic effect; the  entropy change is positive for some cases but for  others it is negative.
Possible reasons for this are  the variations of distances and angles of the interacting side-chains and the varying involvement of  water molecules.
  Energetic contributions of single pairs of  amino acids  An amino acid side-chain on one side of the protein/protein interface usually establishes contacts  to more than a single residue on the other side.
  Depending on the size and the geometry, two or  more amino acid side-chains or part of the mainchain come into its close proximity.
We were interested in the energy contributions made by distinct  pairs of amino acid side-chains.
Therefore, we performed a double mutant cycle analysis as  described earlier for other systems.32,33 In such a  cycle, the contribution to the interaction made by  residue X in protein 1, together with residue Y in  protein 2, is calculated from a set of four experiments: (i) measurement with both wild-type proteins (X,Y); (ii) with wild-type of protein 1/mutant  of residue Y in protein 2 (X,Y ! A); (iii) with the  mutant of residue X in protein 1/wild-type of  protein 2 (X ! A,Y); and (iv) with the mutant of  residue X/mutant of residue Y (X ! A,Y ! A).
  The results are summarized in Tables 6 and 7  together with the corresponding enthalpy and  entropy contributions.
DDG8int, is calculated from  the experiments just described according to the  following equation:  DDG8int  DG8X;Y 2 DG8X;Y!A 2 DG8X!A;Y   DG8X!A;Y!A 1a  With the definition for DDG8 given above, rewriting  equation (1a) as equation (1b):  DDG8int  DDG8X!A;Y  DDG8X;Y!A  2 DDG8X!A;Y!A 1b  makes it clearer that we expect the value of DDG8int  to be zero if the sum of the changes observed for  the two single mutations is the same as the result  for the double mutant, thus indicating that the  effects of the mutations are independent and therefore additive.
In contrast, a value different from  zero indicates a coupled effect of the two residues  X and Y, where positive and negative values  represent repulsive and attractive interactions,  respectively.
One major assumption of the double  mutant cycle approach is that no significant conformational changes should take place upon the  individual or double mutations.
Although for individual mutations this is quite reasonable, in the  case of a double mutation involving buried  residues this is more questionable, due to the  large cavity created.
Any conformational  rearrangement will tend to go in the direction of  decreasing the free energy of complex formation.
  As a result, we could find lower interaction  energies than expected and in some cases we  Figure 5.

All Figures  were prepared using the program MOLMOL.55  1050 Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfacescould even obtain numbers suggesting a favorable  interaction energy, which does not mean a direct  interaction between two residues.
On top of that,  the accumulation of experimental errors in four  measurements could be large and therefore a  coupling energy DDG8int can be considered to be  significant only when the absolute value is larger  than 0.5 kcal/mol.
  We have carried out the double mutant cycle for  a selection of residue pairs, both experimentally  and computationally (Tables 6 and 7).
The Ras/  RalGDS-RBD interaction involves some contacts  with medium energy values (around 21 kcal/  mol) and a few hot-spots contributing more than  22 kcal/mol.
Significant attractive coupling  energies (DDG8int values ,20.5 kcal/mol) are  found mainly between polar amino acid residues,  but there are some repulsive interactions (DDG8int  values .0.5 kcal/mol).
One of the first  observations is that we find some significant  interactions (.0.5 kcal/mol) between residues  that are not in contact, or that cannot establish an  indirect interaction via a water molecule or an  electrostatic interaction.
Examples are RasQ25-  RalGDSN25, RasV29-RalGDSH49, RasD38-  RalGDSY27, RasD38-RalGDSS29 and RasY40-  RalGDSY27.
Those cases can be explained by an  accumulation of experimental errors or by a relaxation of the structure upon doing the double  mutation.
In the case of the RasD38-RalGDSS29  and RasD38 with RalGDSY27 interactions, the  fact that similar interaction energies are found for  the Rap/RalGDS complex, suggests that they are  not an experimental error, but rather the result of  a structure relaxation in the double mutant.
In  fact, both RalGDS Ser29 and Tyr27 are on the  same RalGDS b-strand and on the opposite face of  the b-sheet, in the same locality as the side-chain  of Asp38.
Another interesting case is that involving  Glu37 and Ser29.
These two residues do not make  contact directly but interact through a water  molecule that binds also to the side-chain of  Lys48.
This water bridge could explain the favorable interaction energy observed.
Apart from  these, we find favorable coupling between Ras  Glu37 with RalGDS Arg16 and Tyr27 and of  Ras Asp38 with RalGDS Lys48.
In the case of Ras  Arg41 and RalGDS Asn25, there is conflicting  experimental evidence and, moreover, they do not  make contact.
In all these cases, and within the  Table 6.

a The side-chains of these residues are separated by more than 4 A , and therefore DDG8int should be close to zero, unless there are  some conformational rearrangements.

b The experimental error on these data is 0.5 kcal/mol due to the low affinity.
  Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfaces 1051experimental error, we can predict the observed  interaction energies reasonably well. There are  some repulsive interactions (RasE31/RalGDSD47  and RasS39/RalGDSY27), which are predicted  correctly within the error limits.
  The results of double mutant cycles of Ras and  Raps associating with Raf-RBD are summarized in  Table 7.
As in the previous case, there are two  cases in which there is no interaction between the  residues and we find an experimental interaction,  RasI36/RafR59 and RasV45/RafN64, which  could be explained as above.
We observe the  following favorable interactions: RasI21/RafV88,  RasE31/RafK84, RasD33/RafK84, RasE37/  RafR59, RasE37/RafK84, RasD38/RafR59 and  RasD38/RafT68.
In all cases except one, we could  reproduce the experimental data within the error.
  The single failure is for the interaction between  RasAsp38 and Raf Thr68.
Both residues make a  side-chain H-bond and the interaction energy is  estimated to be around 1.6 kcal/mol.
The reason  behind the prediction failure is that upon mutation  of one of the two side-chains, a water bridge is  created that contributes favorably to the complex.
  In the double mutant cycle the water bridge is  eliminated, but there is ample room for the formation of a network of water molecules that are  not considered, since they do not make at least  two H-bonds to the protein complex (this is a  limitation of the FOLD-X approximation).
We  found attractive interactions of Glu31 and Asp33  of Ras with Lys84 of Raf of 20.7 and 20.6 kcal/  mol, respectively.
This is in accordance with the  structural data, taking the Raps/Raf structure as a  model (Figure 1(b)), where two salt-bridges are  formed between these amino acid residues.
The  sum of these coupling energies is 21.3 kcal/mol.
  As found earlier, under different experimental  conditions,15,21 two high-affinity complexes are  observed, Rap/RalGDS (29.9 kcal/mol) and Ras/  Raf (210.0 kcal/mol), and two complexes with  lower affinity Ras/RalGDS (28.4 kcal/mol) and  Rap/Raf (28.6 kcal/mol).
Residue 31 in the Ras  protein was identified to be responsible for Raf  binding specificity.15 The binding specificity of Ras  and Rap can be explained quantitatively, based on  the results of the latter set of double mutant cycles.
  The sum of the Glu31 and Asp33 interactions corresponds to the difference in free energy of binding  between the Raf complexes with Ras and Rap  (21.4 kcal/mol).
As seen in the structure of the  Raps/Raf complex, Lys84 can form salt-bridgelike contacts to Glu31 and Asp33, leading to similar  energetic contributions of these two interactions (as  Table 7.

  1052 Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfacesshown here but in contrast to Shirouzu et al.,34 who  show only Glu31 to be important).
Also for  RalGDS, residue 31 of Ras and Rap seems to be  responsible for the difference in free energy of  binding mentioned above.
For this system, the  double mutant cycle analysis revealed repulsive  interactions between Asp47 of RalGDS and Glu31  of Ras (1.3 kcal/mol), which again corresponds to  the observed difference between Ras and Rap  (1.5 kcal/mol).
As we lack a full set of mutations  in the Rap interfaces of the complexes with the  effectors we cannot exclude the possibility that  there are more residues different between Ras and  Rap and responsible for the different affinities.
  In general, excluding interaction energies  between non-contacting residues, the prediction  algorithm is reasonably successful in reproducing  the observed experimental energies.
  Discussion  At a time when many different genomes are  being sequenced, with many new proteins being  found to be involved in a multitude of variant protein/protein interactions, it is important to determine the interactions responsible for affinity and  specificity.
Ultimately, this will allow us to predict  which of the multiple possible combinations of  members of two protein families forming a complex are physiologically relevant.
A very interesting case is the complex made by Ras and various  effector proteins, among them Raf and RalGDS.
  Many members of the Ras family have been  described in the human genome, as well as their  effector proteins, and it is not clear which combinations of members of this family, if any, will be  possible.
Even single point mutations like E31 to  Lys between Ras and Rap could decrease the binding energy to Raf and increase it towards RalGDS.
  Here, we have performed an exhaustive mutagenesis analysis, involving both experimental and  theoretical analysis with the objective of dissecting  the relative contribution of different interactions  towards affinity and specificity of the above complexes, as well as validating computer prediction  algorithms.
Validation of prediction software is  important if we would like in the future to carry  out an in silico screening of putative Ras-effector  interactions at a genome level.
  Our experimental and theoretical analysis shows  that the stability of the complex is the result of  many different opposing interactions, and that  different RBDs could bind with affinities similar to  that of Ras using different combinations of these  interactions.
However, in both cases electrostatic  interactions play a very important role in the  complex, by facilitating the formation of the precomplex and increasing kon.
It is difficult to assess  experimentally the role of the main-chain interactions that result in the elongation of the Ras  b-sheet.
Energy calculations with FOLD-X (data  not shown) indicate that it contributes significantly  to complex formation.
Why are electrostatic interactions and H-bonds favored over hydrophobic  interactions?
One explanation could be to facilitate  the dissociation of the Ras/RBD complex, since  hydrophobic interactions reduce the dissociation  rate constant and increase the rate constant of  association,35 thus allowing fast formation of the  complex followed by an easy dissociation once the  RBD domain has performed its function.
  Energy landscapes  In previous studies it has been shown that binding of various effector proteins to members of the  Ras family is very specific.21 This is especially  astonishing because the RBDs all show the same  ubiquitin-like fold and the Ras proteins are very  similar, especially in their effector-binding region.
  This specific recognition of a partner protein by  only one member of a protein family seems to be  important in many biological processes.36 Therefore, the specificity must be coded on the surface  by different determinants of binding energy.
  Here, we have analyzed in detail the energetic  properties of two prominent Ras/effector complexes, which enabled us to build energy landscapes for their contact area.
Using both,  experimental and theoretical studies, we found  that the shape of these two energy landscapes  appears to be different: for the Ras/RalGDS complexes, the binding energy is distributed relatively  evenly across the interface, with a few hot-spots  contributing around 13 kcal/mol to the complex  affinity.
Taking the sum of all significant coupling  energies measured in this system, we arrive at a  figure of 28.9 kcal/mol, which is surprisingly  close to DG8  28.4 kcal/mol for the Ras/RalGDS  interaction.
In contrast to the Ras/RalGDS energy  landscape, in that of the Ras/Raf complex the  amino acid residue Arg89 of Raf represents a single  and very hot spot.
This amino acid residue is  surrounded by hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, which on their own contribute only little to  the binding energy.
Possibly, this is a special type  of complex formation postulated for complexes  with high affinity.31 An amino acid residue contributing strongly to the binding energy should be  shielded from surrounding water, and other  amino acid residues form a kind of ring around  this hot-spot.
Arg89 of Raf-RBD is an ideal candidate for a hot-spot residue of this kind, because it  is located directly in the middle of the interface  and its high energetic contribution could be  explained by forming many non-covalent interactions for optimal orientation.
This would explain  also the fact that even the affinity of Raf R89K is  reduced drastically (data not shown), because the  lysine residue cannot take part in as many noncovalent interactions as the arginine residue.31  Based on sequence homology investigations,  Ponting & Benjamin have defined, on the basis of  homology to RalGDS/RalGDS-like and AF6/  canoe, a novel protein family called RA (Ras  Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfaces 1053association) domains.36,37 Until now, however, it  has not been investigated whether all these RA  domains will indeed bind to Ras or to members of  the Ras family.
As they are predicted to have  ubiquitin-like structure, one could aim in future at  predicting the affinity in complex with Ras, using  theoretical tools.
In the SMART database one finds  a subdivision of effector molecules in the RA and  RBD families, with slightly different consensus  sequences.38,39 Interestingly, the effectors RalGDS  and Raf analyzed here are found to be in different  families; RalGDS belongs to the RA family and  Raf to the RBD family.
This might explain the  different binding modes seen in the energy landscapes determined here. It will be interesting to  see whether one can find some general properties  among effector proteins of a particular family to  account for how they interact with Ras proteins.
  Mutagenesis prediction  As stated above, one of the main assumptions in  predicting the changes in energy upon mutation is  that neither the structure of the isolated proteins,  nor that of the complex changes upon mutation.
  Another important assumption is that, from the  energetic point of view, the structure of the proteins involved will be the same in the complex or  in isolation.
Surprisingly enough, both assumptions seem to hold, since we can predict with  reasonable accuracy the energetics of the different  mutations analyzed here.
However, this is not the  case for some of the double mutants involving residues that are not in direct or indirect contact in the  complex.
In this case, it is quite likely that upon  introducing two large destabilizing mutations, the  structure of the complex relaxes and, as a result,  an interaction energy is found experimentally that  does not correspond to a direct energy interaction  between the two residues.
In any case, it is important to emphasize the quality of the predictions,  suggesting that computer design methods could  be used to engineer mutations in protein complexes.
Furthermore, in direct relevance to this  case, it should be possible to screen in silico a wide  range of putative Ras/effector complexes.
  Materials and Methods  Mutagenesis, protein purification and  nucleotide exchange  The coding DNA for the RBDs of the effectors RalGDS  (residues 790886, here termed 197) and Raf (residues  51131) was cloned in pGEX4T3 and pGEX2T, respectively.
Protein expression in Escherichia coli BL21 cells,  thrombin cleavage of the GST fusion proteins and purification were performed as described.19,40 Some mutants of  RalGDS- and Raf-RBD were prepared in earlier studies  and new mutants were produced here using the QuikChangee Site-Directed-Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).
  Ha-Ras, Rap1A (termed Ras and Rap) and all mutant  proteins of Ras and Rap were cloned in ptac vector and  expressed using E. coli strain CK600K.
In the case of  Rap, pGRO/EL was co-transformed in the cells expressing the E. coli Hsp60 chaperonin.
The expressed Ras  and Rap proteins were purified, and the bound  nucleotide was exchanged for the non-hydrolysable  nucleotides GppNHp or mantGppNHp as described.19  After nucleotide exchange, the Ras proteins were purified from non-bound nucleotide by gel-filtration using  50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM  dithioerythritol.
In the case of Raf-RBD wild-type and  mutants, the buffer contained 100 mM NaCl.
The protein  concentrations were measured by the Bradford method  using bovine serum albumin as a standard.41  Fluorescence measurements  For some mutant complexes of Ras and RalGDS, we  determined the dissociation constants (Kd values) using  the GDI assay as described.19,20 The GDI effect is based  on the observation that the nucleotide exchange rate of  Ras proteins is decreased as a result of effector RBD  binding.
We used 0.5 mM Ras bound to mantGppNHp  and increasing RalGDS-RBD concentrations.
The dissociation of the fluorescent nucleotide was initiated by  the addition of 100-fold excess of non-labeled GTP.
The  time-course of the resulting fluorescence change was  monitored using a Perkin Elmer Life Sciences LS50  instrument.
The excitation and emission monochromators were set to 360 nm and 450 nm, respectively,  and the slits to 5 nm resolution.
  Microcalorimetry  The thermodynamic parameters of Ras/effector interactions were determined using an isothermal titration  calorimeter (MCS-ITC, MicroCal, Inc.) as described.26 In  all experiments, the effector RBDs were placed into the  sample cell at a concentration between 10 mM and  80 mM, depending on the expected association constant.
  The concentration of the Ras proteins in the syringe was  tenfold higher compared to the effector concentration in  the cell.
For data evaluation, the manufacturers software  was used as described.21 For all experiments, 50 mM  TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM dithioerythritol was used as the buffer, including the fluorescence experiments.
All experiments with Raf-RBD  solutions contained 100 mM NaCl in addition, as this  protein tends to precipitate at high protein concentration  and at low ionic strength.
  Energy minimization and structure refinement  Prior to the calculation of the free energy changes  upon mutation in the complexes, we carried out an  energy minimization step to eliminate bad contacts and  optimize the geometry.
The following PDB structures:  1CLY, 1GUA, 1LFD, and the Ras/RalGDS structure  from Vetter et al.  16 were loaded on the Swiss-PdbViewer42  and subjected to three steps of 50 cycles of steepest  descent minimization.
In the case of 1LFD, we separated  the two complexes (called complex a and b) and treated  them separately as different structures.
Once the  structures were minimized, we proceeded to a visual  inspection of the interaction surface of the different complexes.
It is well known that the orientation of Asn and  Gln side-chains regarding the carbonyl and amide  groups cannot be determined from crystal structures.
It  is in the refinement procedure that the crystallographer  1054 Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfacesdetermines their position and it has been found that in  many cases this is not the correct one.24,43  FOLD-X energy prediction  The FOLD-X energy function includes terms that  have been found to be important for protein stability.
  The free energy of unfolding (DG) of a target protein is  calculated using equation (2):  DG  DGvdw  DGsolvH  DGsolvP  DGwb  DGhbond   DGel  DGkon  TDSmc  TDSsc  TDStr 2  where DGvdw is the sum of the van der Waals contributions of all atoms with respect to the same interactions  with the solvent.
DGsolvH and DGsolvP are the difference in  solvation energy for apolar and polar groups, respectively, when going from the unfolded to the folded state.
  DGhbond is the free energy difference between the  formation of an intramolecular H-bond compared to  intermolecular H-bond formation (with solvent).
DGwb is  the extra stabilizing free energy provided by a water  molecule making more than one H-bond to the protein  (water bridges) that cannot be taken into account with  non-explicit solvent approximations.44 DGel is the electrostatic contribution of charged groups, including the helix  dipole.
DGkon reflects the effect of electrostatic interactions on kon.
  29 DSmc is the entropy cost for fixing the  backbone in the folded state.
This term is dependent on  the intrinsic tendency of a particular amino acid to  adopt certain dihedral angles.45 DSsc is the entropic cost  of fixing a side-chain in a particular conformation.46 DSsc  is the loss of translational and rotational entropy upon  making the complex.
  The energy values of DGvdw, DGsolvH, DGsolvP and  DGhbond attributed to each atom type have been derived  from a set of experimental data, and DSmc and DSmc  have been taken from theoretical estimates.
The van der  Waals contributions are derived from vapor to water  energy transfer, while in the protein we are going from  solvent to protein.
  Effect of solvent exposure determined by the atomic  occupancy (Occ)  Many experimental studies show that interactions at  the surface of a protein usually contribute less to the  stability of a protein than in the core.47,48 This can be  rationalized as an effect of increased flexibility at the  protein surface in an environment close to that of  the unfolded state.
Therefore, an important part of the  energy calculation is based on the inclusion of solvent  effects in an implicit manner, except in the special case  of water-bridges.
To estimate the solvent accessibility of  a given atom, we used the solvent contact model,49  which considers the volume occupied by protein atoms  around the target atom, called the occupancy (Occ).
The  occupancy of a given atom i, Occi, is the sum of the  fragmental volumes of the atoms surrounding this atom  within a threshold distance of 6 A .
  50,51  In FOLD-X, the atomic free energy of solvation, the  van der Waals and the electrostatic interactions together  with the entropic terms are scaled with respect to the  atomic occupancies (Occ).
As a first approximation, we  assume that the strength of an interaction (solvation  effects, van der Waals or electrostatic) and the entropic  cost for fixing the conformation of a residue should  vary linearly with the atomic occupancy Occi. For each  atom i, the unscaled energy terms are multiplied by the  scaling factor (Sfacti) that is calculated from the atomic  occupancy Occi as:  Sfacti  Occi 2 Occminti  Occmaxti 2 Occminti 3  where Occmin(i) and Occmax(i) are the minimal and maximal occupancies of an atom of type ti as estimated by  Topham et al.  52  Exceptions  Polar groups desolvation.
For non-charged polar  residues and non-charged polar backbone atoms, the  solvation penalty of the polar groups is calculated by  first looking at the number of H-bonds they are  making.
If this number is equal to the maximum they  can make, then we apply full desolvation penalty independent of the solvent accessibility. If the number is  less, we divide the desolvation penalty by the number  of H-bonds and we subtract this value multiplied by  the number of H-bonds made from the desolvation  value.
  For the main-chain and side-chain entropy, which are  calculated at the residue level and not at the atomic  level, we consider the mean value of the occupancies of  the atoms that compose the main-chain and the sidechain, respectively.
  Side-chain entropy cost.
For residues not making an  electrostatic or H-bond interactions, we correct the  entropy contribution by the Sfacti. For the rest, we  check the electrostatic and H-bond contribution, and if  these contributions are higher than the side-chain  entropic cost corrected by the Sfacti we increase the  entropic cost value to match the electrostatic and  H-bond contributions (provided that they are not  higher than the maximum entropic cost value, in which  case we apply full entropy cost).
  Main-chain entropy cost.
Here, we do the same thing as  for the side-chain entropy.
The only difference is that  we look as well to the residues preceding and following  the target residue.
If those are making backbone  H-bonds, then we penalize more the main-chain  entropy contribution of the target residue.
  Electrostatic effects on kon.
Theoretical and experimental studies29,53 have shown that favorable electrostatic interactions could enhance the association rate of  proteins.
This enhancement is due to a favoring of  productive relative conformations that will lead to the  stable complex.
The enhancement can be calculated  empirically by assuming that the associated proteins  will form a looser complex that will later be rearranged  by rotation and translational diffusion.
The second  assumption is that the subunits in this looser complex  will, on average, have a similar orientation as in the  final complex but separated by a layer of water.
Under  these assumptions, the stability of these looser complexes will be dominated by electrostatic interactions.29  On the basis of these assumptions Vijayakumar et al.  29   http://fold-x.embl-heidelberg.de derived a very simple approximation that predicts  Energy Landscaping of Ras/Effector Interfaces 1055with good correlation the effect of electrostatic interactions on kon.
  We have introduced this effect in a similar way,  although we have simplified the procedure.
Essentially,  we use the same approximation as that used by  Vijayakumar et al.  29 but we do not explore different  orientations of the two molecules and we do not separate  them.
  DGkon  332qiqe  1r  e2kr2a  1  ka 4  where DGkon is the contribution to the binding energy  due to the electrostatic effect on the kon rate, qi and qe  are the charges of the atoms involved, 1 is the dielectric  constant in water (we use a value of 88), r is the distance  between the two atoms in the crystal structure, k introduces the effect of the ionic strength (equation (5)) and a  is an empirical correction term similar to that used by  Vijayakumar et al.  29 The comparison between the calculated changes in kon for the barnase/barstar complex  using our simplified version and the method of  Vijayakumar et al.  29 shows that our simplified approach  captures quite well the effect of charged point mutations  on kon values (data not shown).

We consider a cost of 2 kcal/mol for  making a complex between the two molecules.
This  value was proposed by Freire and co-workers, based on  the results of calorimetry studies.54  Determination of DDG values for complex formation.
In  order to estimate the change in stability of the complex  AB upon mutation, we assume that the two molecules  making the complex do not suffer major conformational  changes compared with the free forms A and B.
