Neutralizing Epitopes on the Extracellular Interferon g  Receptor (IFNgR) a-Chain Characterized by Homolog  Scanning Mutagenesis and X-ray Crystal Structure of  the A6 FabIFNgR1-108 Complex  Satoshi Sogabe2  , Fiona Stuart  1  , Christoph Henke1  , Angela Bridges1  Geoffrey Williams1  , Ashley Birch1  , Fritz K.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd  Pharmaceutical Research-New  Technologies, 4070, Basel  Switzerland  The extracellular interferon g receptor a-chain comprises two immunoglobulin-like domains, each with bronectin type-III topology, which are  responsible for binding interferon g at the cell surface.
The epitopes on  the human receptor recognized by three neutralizing antibodies, A6,  gR38 and gR99, have been mapped by homolog scanning mutagenesis.
In  this way, a loop connecting b-strands C and C0 in the N-terminal domain  was identied as a key component of the epitopes bound by A6 and  gR38, whereas gR99 binds to the C-terminal domain in a region including  strands A and B and part of the large C0  E loop.
The epitope for A6 was  conrmed in a crystal structure of a complex between a recombinant  N-terminal receptor domain and the Fab fragment from A6, determined  by X-ray diffraction to 2.8 A resolution.
The antibody antigen interface  buries 1662 A 2 of protein surface, including 22 antibody residues from  ve complementarity determining regions, primarily through interactions  with the CC0 surface loop of the receptor.
The oor of the antigen binding cavity is formed mainly by residues from CDR L3 and CDR H3  while a surrounding ridge is formed by residues from all other CDRs  except L2.
Many potential polar interactions, as well as 13 aromatic sidechains, four in VL, six in VH and three in the receptor, are situated at the  interface.
The surface of the receptor contacted by A6 overlaps to a large  extent with that contacted by interferon-g, in the ligand  receptor complex.
However, the conformation of this epitope is very different in the  two complexes, demonstrating that conformational mobility in a surface  loop on this cytokine receptor permits steric and electrostatic complementarity to two quite differently shaped binding sites.

The crystal structure, recently reported  (Walter et al., 1995), of recombinant extracellular  human IFNgR in a 2:1, receptor:ligand complex  with IFNg revealed in atomic detail how the extracellular portions of two IFNgR chains bind the  homodimeric (2  17 kDa) IFNg at the cell surface.
  Other cytokine receptor superfamily members  whose crystal structure in a complex with a receptor ligand have also been reported include the  receptors for GRH (De Vos et al., 1992), PRL  (Somers et al., 1994), EPO (Livnah et al., 1996), IL-1  (Schreuder et al., 1997; Vigers et al., 1997) and TF  (Banner et al., 1996).
An additional transmembrane  IFNgR b-chain (or accessory factor), however, is  necessary for species specic signal transduction  by IFNg (Marsters et al., 1995), and it is not yet  clear from a structural viewpoint how this b-chain  interacts with the IFNg (IFNgR)2 complex.
  There is currently great interest in the mechanisms of ligand recognition by members of the cytokine receptor superfamily.
The cytokine binding  sites are, in several cases, formed by a small set of  closely spaced surface loops that extend from a  b-sheet core, much like the antigen binding sites on  antibodies.
Crystallographic studies on GRHR,  PRLR, IFNgR and EPOR have indicated that the  ability of these receptors to specically recognize  different ligands may arise through sequence  diversity in the surface loops, as well as through  local and global conformational diversity  (Kossiakoff et al., 1994).
In the work described  here, recognition of the extracellular IFNgR by  three surrogate ligands, in the form of neutralizing  mAbs (denoted A6 (Aguet & Merlin, 1987), gR38  and gR99 (Garotta et al., 1990)) has been studied.
  These three mAbs inhibit binding of human IFNg  to native and recombinant human IFNgR. It was,  therefore, of interest to enquire how the structural  epitopes bound by these neutralizing mAbs, and  the mechanisms of their recognition by the receptor, are related to those involved in IFNg binding.
  The extracellular IFNgR monomer comprises  two domains (domain D1 from residue 14-102, and  domain D2 from residue 114-221){, each resembling an Ig fold with FBN-III topology.
In each  domain, the chain forms two antiparallel b-sheets  composed of b-strands A, B, E and G, F, C and C0  (Figure 1).
The interdomain angle between D1 and  D2 is approximately 120 in the IFNgR, which is  similar to that seen in TF, but greater than the  90 angle observed between the corresponding  domains in the GRHR, the PRLR and the EPOR.
  The domain linker in the IFNgR chain (residues  103 to 113) includes a helical turn, similar to that  seen in GRHR, PRLR, TF and EPOR, but contains  a cysteine residue (Cys105) that forms a disulde  bridge with Cys150 located in the BC loop in D2.
  This disulde is buried in the extensive interdomain interface.
  Equivalent residues on each extracellular IFNgR  chain bind identical 2-fold related surfaces on the  IFNg homodimer in the 1:2, ligand:receptor complex.
These include residues in the CC0 and EF  loops, and the F and G b-strands of D1, the helical  turn in the linker, and the BC and FG loops from  D2.
As noted earlier (Walter et al., 1995), aromatic  receptor residues (Tyr49, Trp207 and Trp82) contribute almost one-third of the total buried surface  area (total 960 A 2  ) in each binding interface.
  Here, the epitopes on the extracellular human  IFNgR recognized by A6, gR38 and gR99 have  been characterized by homolog scanning mutagenFigure 1.

  { The IFNgR chain is numbered sequentially  assuming residues Glu1Met2Gly3.... correspond to the N  terminus of the mature receptor after cleavage of the  signal peptide (Aguet et al., 1988).
VH and VL of mAb  A6 are numbered according to Kabat et al. (1991), as  given earlier (Bridges et al., 1995).
Antibody residues are  named as follows: residue-type H(or L)-chain;residue  number.
Residues in the recombinant IFNgR1-108 chain  have the prex I.  Epitopes on the Interferon   Receptor 883esis (Cunningham et al., 1989).
In addition, a crystal structure has been determined to 2.8 A resolution of a complex formed between an Fab  fragment derived from A6 and a recombinant D1  of the IFNgR (residues 1 to 108 with a Cys105Ser  mutation, and an additional two residues (Val-Pro)  at the N terminus, denoted here IFNgR1-108).
A6  and gR38 were shown earlier to bind overlapping  epitopes located in IFNgR1-108  , whereas gR99 recognizes an epitope within D2 between residues 100  and 229 (Williams et al., 1995).
In the A6 FabIFNgR1-108 complex reported here, the CDRs of the  antibody interact primarily with the CC0 surface  loop of the receptor.
The antibody epitope thus  overlaps to a large extent the site contacted by  IFNg, in the ligand  receptor complex.
However,  the conformation of this surface loop is quite different in the two complexes, providing an example of  how local conformational mobility in a cytokine  receptor permits steric and electrostatic complementarity to two quite differently shaped binding  sites.
  Results and Discussion  Production and mutagenesis of IFNgR  The human extracellular IFNgR residues 1 to 229  (IFNgR1-229  ), with a c-myc peptide tag (Evan et al.,  1985) fused to its C terminus, was produced by a  secretion expression system in Escherichia coli.
The  afnities of this protein to the mAbs A6, gR38 and  gR99, as well as to the ligand IFNg10 (Dobeli  et al., 1988), were compared with those for wt  extracellular IFNgR produced in a baculovirus  expression system (Gentz et al., 1992) using a SPR  biosensor (Pharmacia BIAcore2) (data not shown).
  The E. coli-derived IFNgR1-229 has a slightly lower  apparent afnity for mAbs A6 and gR99; however,  in all cases the differences between E. coli and  insect cell-derived receptor are less than twofold.
  The absence of glycosylation in the E. coli-derived  protein is one possible reason for the small differences observed.
  The mAbs A6, gR38 and gR99 recognize conformational epitopes on the human IFNgR, but do not  bind mouse IFNgR signicantly or the reduced  and denatured human IFNgR (Aguet & Merlin,  1987; Garotta et al., 1990).
Homolog scanning  mutagenesis was therefore used to map the epitopes recognized by A6, gR38 and gR99 on the  receptor surface.
For this purpose, the panel of  mutants shown in Table 1 were prepared using the  E. coli secretion expression system.
A comparison  of the human and mouse extracellular receptor  sequences is given in Figure 2.
  The CD spectra of all mutants had shapes similar to that of wt receptor, with a small positive  maximum at 235 nm and a large negative maximum at 195 nm, essentially as described earlier for  the wt receptor (Fountoulakis & Genz, 1992).
This  indicates that the mutants and wt have similar  folds.
This conclusion is also supported by the  observation that all N-terminal domain mutants  were bound normally by gR99, whereas all receptors with mutations in the C-terminal domain were  recognized normally by A6, as assayed using the  BIAcore instrument.
  The effects of the mutations on binding to A6,  gR38 and gR99 are summarised in Table 1.
  Mutants 6 and 8 show a greatly reduced afnity  for A6 and gR38, mainly due to a decrease in  apparent kon on the biosensor surface (data not  shown).
The region altered in mutant 6 corresponds to the CC0 loop seen at the interface in the  crystal structure of the A6  IFNgR1-108 complex,  described below.
This CC0 loop is, therefore, correctly identied by mutagenesis as an important  part of the A6 conformational epitope.
  Beneath the CC0 loop in the A6  IFNgR1-108 crystal structure is a second loop (the EF loop) formed  by residues that are altered in mutant 8.
As discussed below, the A6 Fab makes only a few contacts with this EF loop and their disruption may  not be sufcient to account for the observed loss of  afnity of mutant 8 with A6.
Alternatively, the EF  loop may exert an inuence on the conformations  accessible to the CC0 loop when bound to A6,  which may be critically altered in mutant 8.
The  mutagenesis results conrm that the gR38 and A6  epitopes overlap (Williams et al., 1995), and show  that both are located in the region of the CC0 loop.
  However, small differences in apparent koff values  between the binding of individual mutants by  these antibodies were observed, although the magnitude of the effects were small (4factor of 2; data  not shown).
Thus the receptor epitopes bound by  A6 and gR38 are very closely related, but not identical.
  Mutants 13, 14 and 21 are severely disabled in  their afnity for gR99 (Table 1), whereas, with the  exception of mutants 18 and 20, where the KD  values are reduced by a factor of 5 to 6 in this  assay, the other mutants show close to wt afnity.
  The residues altered in mutants 13, 14 and 21 are  spatially adjacent on one face of the receptor,  dened by strands A and B and part of the large  C0  E loop of the C-terminal Ig-like domain.
As  shown in Figure 3, this region of the receptor does  not appear to overlap the surface buried in the  IFNg-IFNgR complex.
Nevertheless, the intact  mAb (Garotta et al., 1990) and single-chain Fv fragment derived from gR99 (Bridges et al., 1996) were  shown by radioimmunoassay to inhibit IFNg binding to native receptor on human Raji cells.
From a  structural viewpoint, the mechanism of inhibition  by gR99 is unclear.
We note, however, that modeling studies (Walter et al., 1995) have suggested that  acidic residues near the C0  E loop (altered in  mutant-21) may be important in binding basic residues in the C-terminal tail of IFNg.
The C-terminal  IFNg residues beyond 122 extend into the solvent  and from the crystal structure do not appear to be  important for receptor binding.
However, biochemical assays have shown that Arg129 is an  essential part of a functionally important C-term884 Epitopes on the Interferon   Receptorinal IFNg sequence that is required for full receptor  binding afnity (Haelewyn et al., 1997).
  Crystal structure of the A6-IFNgR1-108 complex  The structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement techniques using search models  for the Fv and Fchl parts of the Fab as described in  Materials and Methods.
A summary of the renement results is given in Table 2.
Interpretation of  the density of the receptor domain was greatly  aided by the availability of a model for this  domain (Chene et al., 1995; le Du et al., unpublished data).
The nal distribution of the mainchain dihedral angles is presented in a Ramachandran plot in Figure 4.
Over 97% of the non-glycine  and non-proline residues lie inside favored or  additional allowed regions as dened in PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), which is slightly  better than the distribution expected for a structure  rened to 2.8 A resolution.
  The rened model comprises 442 of the 540 residues present in the complex and 30 well-determined water molecules (see Table 2).
The structure  is well dened for the Fv part of the Fab fragment,  for most of the receptor domain and particularly  for the antibody  antigen interface, which is the  area of prime interest in this study.
However, a  large fraction of the residues in the Fchl part (85 of  203) are very poorly dened in the electron density  and have been removed from the model.
The Fchl  chain segments that have been retained in the  model still have much higher average B-factors  than the other three domains (Table 2).
Neither  domain in Fchl is involved in any crystal contacts  and, given their small interface with the Fv  domains, considerable positional disorder is indicated.

  Epitopes on the Interferon   Receptor 885and Methods), the density resulting from averaging over all populated states of these disordered  domains still makes a signicant contribution to  Bragg scattering.
A single structural model with  isotropic B-factors is inadequate to model this density and the somewhat high R-factor is likely to  result from not modeling this residual density.
The  average B-factors of the Fv domains (47 A 2  ) and of  the receptor antigen (59 A 2  ) are consistent with an  intrinsic B-factor of 58 A 2 of these crystals.
  The antigenantibody interface  As illustrated in Figure 5, the CC0 loop of the  receptor domain reaches into the shallow antigen  binding site formed by the CDRs of the A6 Fab  fragment.
The total surface area buried on complex  formation is 1662 A 2 (Figure 6), which is similar to  that reported for other antibody protein antigen  complexes (Davies & Cohen, 1996).
The HyHEL5  HEL complex constitutes a comparable example  with a buried surface area of 1761 A 2 (calculated as  described in Figure 6).
Examination of the crystal  contacts shows that the receptor domain also  makes quite an extensive crystal contact with  another symmetry-related VH domain.
Compared  to the recognition interface formed by the CDRs as  described below, the buried surface area in this  crystal contact is about 30% smaller (1200 A 2  ) and  only a few CDR residues on the outside face of VH  contribute.
  The spatial arrangement of the many residues  contributing to the extensive antigen antibody  interface is shown in Figures 7 and 8 and the residue  residue interactions are schematically represented in Figure 6.
The contact surface of the  mAb A6 comprises 22 residues from ve CDRs, 13  and 9 residues from VH and VL, respectively.
The  oor of the binding cavity is formed mainly by  residues from CDR L3 and CDR H3 while the surrounding ridge is formed by residues from all  CDRs except L2.

IFNg (2  17 kDa) is shown in pink and  green, the IFNgR in white (N-terminal domain D1) and yellow (C-terminal domain D2) (see Figure 1).
The red and  blue regions are those where changes are introduced in mutant 6 (CC0 loop) and 8 (EF loop) (red), and 13 (strand A),  14 (strand B) and 21 (C0  E loop) (blue) (see Table 1).
  886 Epitopes on the Interferon   Receptorbonding interactions observed in the interface  (Table 3) indicate that polar interactions are  important for specic antigen recognition (open  bars in Figure 6).
In addition, many aromatic residues located in the interface contribute to van der  Waals contacts between the antigen and the antibody (lled bars in Figure 6).
Indeed, 13 aromatic  side-chains are situated at the interface, four in VL  (TyrL30, TyrL91, TrpL92, TrpL96), six in VH  (TyrH32, TrpH52, TrpH53, TyrH58, TyrH99,  HisH100B) and three in the receptor (TyrI49,  TrpI56, TrpI82).
The frequent occurrence of aromatic residues, particularly Tyr and Trp, in antibody combining sites has been noted (Padlan,  1990; Davies & Cohen, 1996).
  The epitope of the receptor fragment is discontinuous but 80% of the contact surface occurs with  residues of its CC0 surface loop (I47 to I56).
Residues from the adjacent loop I76 to I84 contribute  only 13%, and only 7% is contributed by residues  I98 and I99, which make a rather loose contact.
  The side-chains of TyrI49 and AsnI53 lie adjacent  on one face of the CC0 loop and constitute the part  of the epitope that reaches deepest into the binding  cavity.
The hydroxyl group of the buried tyrosine  makes two hydrogen bonds with residues of CDR  H3 and one face of its phenyl group becomes buried through non-polar contacts with the side-chains  of ArgL32 and TrpL92. One NH bond from the Nd2  atom of the buried AsnI53 is directed towards two  backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues from  CDR L3 (Table 3).
The other points to the center of  the six-membered ring of TrpL96 located at the  bottom of the antigen binding site (3.8 A from N to  center of ring) and suggests an NH aromatic ring  hydrogen bond (Levitt & Perutz, 1988).
Similarly,  the Nz atom of LysI47 is 3.9 A from the center of  the six-membered ring of TrpL92.
Together with  two hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl  groups of TrpL96 and AsnI48 a stereochemically  almost optimal hydrogen bonding pattern results  for this (presumably) ammonium nitrogen.
Tight  interactions, which include six hydrogen bonds  (Table 3), are also observed between residues  GlyI50, ValI51 and LysI52 and the CDRs of the  heavy chain.
In the whole interface there is no  residual electron density, indicating the absence of  ordered solvent molecules, and this is consistent  with the lack of sufciently large void volumes.
  Structure of the IFNgR fragment  
The epitope on the IFNgR1-108 domain recognized by A6 largely overlaps the contiguous surface that is recognized by IFNg (Walter et al., 1995).
  The overall backbone structures of IFNgR1-108 as  observed in the complexes with mAb A6 and IFNg  are very similar, with the exception of surface loop  (I48 to I54), as illustrated in Figure 9(a).
For both  complexes the CC0 loop plays an important role in  recognition fully consistent with the neutralizing  activity of mAb A6.
In addition, a signicant displacement towards the adjacent CC0 loop is seen  Table 2.

  Epitopes on the Interferon   Receptor 887for the EF loop (residues I76 to I79) in the A6  complex.
  In the CC0 loop conformation observed here  (Figure 9(b)), the sheet interaction between strands  C and F is extended by one residue, equivalent to  one additional main-chain hydrogen bond compared to the situation seen in the complex with  IFNg.
Additional hydrogen bonding interactions  are also indicated between the carboxamide oxygen of AsnI79 (EF loop) and the main-chain NH  groups of ValI51 and LysI52 of the CC0 loop as  well as between the carboxamide groups of AsnI79  and AsnI48.
Finally, four intraloop hydrogen  bonds are seen in the CC0 loop conformation  observed in the A6 complex as compared to only  one in the more open conformation observed in  the complex with IFNg.
The more-closed conformation observed here may thus be the preferred  conformation of this loop in the unliganded receptor and the conformation seen in the complex with  IFNg may only be induced upon ligand binding.
  However, the conformational change of the CC0  loop correlates with a displacement of the adjacent  EF loop (Figure 9(a)) which, in the intact receptor,  also interacts with residues of the C-terminal receptor domain.
For the CC0 loop to occur in the closed  conformation in the unliganded receptor would  thus need some adjustment in these interdomain  interactions to accommodate such a 2 to 3 A shift  in the position of the EF loop.
  The mAb A6 binds the human IFNgR with high  afnity, but shows essentially no afnity to the  rather homologous mouse IFNgR (54% identity).
  The three-residue deletion in the CC0 loop of the  mouse receptor (Figure 2) leads to a truncated CC0  loop of the same length and most likely a similar  conformation as observed in TF (Muller et al., 1994;  Harlos et al., 1994).
The deleted residues correspond to G50 to K52 and, as seen in Figure 6, this  would inevitably give rise to a signicantly  reduced contact area in the epitope.
It thus appears  that the much reduced afnity of the mAb A6 for  Figure 4.

  888 Epitopes on the Interferon   Receptorthe mouse receptor, and mutant 6 of the homolog  scanning mutants (Table 1), results primarily from  the deletion of a signicant part of the CC0 loop.
  Homology modeling suggests that mutant 8  should have a similar conformation in the EF loop  region to the wild type.
The large reduction in af-  nity of mutant 8 is difcult to rationalize in terms  of a perturbation of its direct contacts with A6.
An  alternative explanation is an indirect effect of the  mutated residues on the conformation of the CC0  loop.
For example, as seen in Figure 9(b), the sidechain of AsnI79 hydrogen bonds to two backbone  NH groups and possibly to AsnI53.
Its replacement  by valine would disrupt these interactions and  thereby destabilize the optimal conformation for  binding A6.
  Several examples of the binding of a common  set of amino acid residues by different binding  sites with no or little similarity have been reported.
  The structure of the complex between the monomeric human growth hormone and its dimeric  receptor showed that the same set of residues on  the two receptor monomers binds to different parts  of the hormone (De Vos et al., 1992).
Lescar et al.  (1995) found that two antibodies with low homology in the variable regions bind to almost the  same epitope of lysozyme. And the anti-hen egg  white lysozyme mAb D1.3 forms complexes with  lysozyme and the anti-D1.3 mAb E5.2 through  essentially the same combining site residues (Fields  et al., 1995).
The relevance of these observations  has been discussed by Colman (1997) in the context  of viral antigenic variation.
In all the above cases,  the structure of the region recognized by two  different `ligands' is essentially identical apart from  local conformational adjustments.
In our case,  however, a rather dramatic conformational change  is observed, in which the tip of the receptor loop  (I51 and I52) is displaced over a distance of 8 A ,  and the two `ligands' (mAb A6 and IFNg) therefore  recognize quite different structures formed by the  same receptor residues (Figure 9).
  Comparisons with other Fab structures  The analysis of antibody fragments of known  structure has revealed that, with the exception of  CDR H3, the other ve CDRs adopt preferred  main-chain conformations, or canonical structures  (Chothia et al., 1992, 1989).
CDR H1 (canonical  structure H1:3) and H2 (canonical structure H2:1)  of A6 have similar sequences and backbone conformations to those in the HIV-1 neutralizing mAb  50.1 (Rini et al., 1993).
The backbones (N, Ca  , C0  ) of  CDR H1 (H26 to H35) and H2 (H50 to H65) of A6  and 50.1 can be superimposed with an r.m.s.
deviation of 0.4 A .
CDR H3 of A6 is, however, seven  residues longer than that in Fab 50.1, and these  additional residues largely account for the quite  differently shaped combining sites of these two  mAbs.
  Similarly, the backbone atoms of CDRs L1 (L24  to L34; canonical form L1:2) and L2 (L50 to L56) of  A6 can be superimposed together onto L1 and L2  of the anti-lysozyme mAb D1.3 (Fischmann et al.,  1991) with an r.m.s.
deviation in the backbone  atoms of 0.35 A .
CDR L3 of A6, however, does  not correspond to the canonical forms 1, 2 or 3  identied for L3 loops by Chothia (1989).
The  cause is the lack of Pro95 in this k L-chain.
The  crystal structure of the Fab from mAb CRIS-1,  reported recently (Guarne et al., 1996), also lacks a  ProL95, and has the same CDR-L3 backbone conformation as that seen in A6 (r.m.s.
deviation over  L89 to L98 A 0.23 A ), which therefore appears to  constitute a new canonical structure for CDR L3  loops that lack ProL95.
  Outlook  The results reported above raise several interesting questions concerning the mechanisms of cytokine and antibody recognition by the IFNgR.  Firstly, the quite different conformations of the CC0  loop seen in the complexes with IFNg and A6  suggest a considerable degree of local backbone  mobility in this region on the IFNgR surface.
This  has implications also for those interested in the  homology modeling of cytokine receptors of undetermined 3D structure.
Another important issue is  the extent to which this local mobility plays a role  in the mechanism of ligand recognition.
Unfortunately, no data on the structure or mobility of the  free IFNgR are available.
From a structural viewpoint, the conformation observed in the complex  with A6 appears more stable in the absence of a  ligand than the open conformation seen in the  complex with IFNg.
A simple rigid-body docking  of receptor to ligand, in a lock-and-key-like process  appears unlikely.
Secondly, the high concentration  of aromatic residues (Tyr, Trp and His) observed  Figure 5.

Since the extracellular IFNgR, IFNg and the antibody fragments  can be prepared conveniently, this system should  be amenable to a more detailed structure  function  analysis, which may shed light on the mechanisms  of ligand recognition by this receptor.
  Materials and Methods  Secretion of the human IFNgR1-229 and mutants  in E. coli.
  The extracellular portion of the wt human IFNgR (residues 1 to 229) was produced by secretion into the periplasm in E. coli HB2151.
cDNA encoding the receptor  (Aguet et al., 1988) was amplied by PCR using primers  that include NcoI and NotI sites.
The PCR product was  cloned after digestion with NcoI and NotI into the phagemid pHEN1 (Hoogenboom et al., 1991) to afford  pOCI656.
The receptor is thereby fused via a short -Ala3-  linker at its C terminus to a 14-residue peptide including  an epitope recognized by the anti-c-myc tag mAb 9E10  (Evan et al., 1985).
  E. coli HB2151 transformed with phagemid encoding  wt IFNgR1-229 (or mutant) was selected on 2TY agar containing 1% glucose and 100 mg/ml ampicillin at 30C.  Colonies were transferred into 2TY (15 ml) containing  1% glucose and 100 mg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 30C. This medium (5 ml) was added to fresh  2TY medium (500 ml) again with glucose and ampicillin.
  After growth at 30C to A550  0.5 to 1, the cells were  pelleted, resuspended in fresh 2TY medium with  100 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.01 mM IPTG.
After growth  for 16 hours at 30C and centrifugation, the cells were  resuspended in Tris-HCl (100 mM, pH 8.0), 0.5 M  sucrose and 0.5 mM EDTA (1 ml).
The same buffer solution (9 ml) containing lysozyme (2 mg/ml) was then  added, diluted with a further 20 ml buffer, and then  20 ml water was added together with PMSF (1 mM),  benzamidine (1 mM) and NaN3 (0.04%).
After 20 minutes, cells and debris were removed by centrifugation  and the supernatant was applied to an immunoafnity  column prepared by crosslinking mAb 9E10 to CNBractivated Sepharose (Pharmacia).
The column was  washed with sodium phosphate (50 mM, pH 7.0, 0.04%  NaN3), and bound protein was eluted with glycine-HCl  (50 mM, pH 2.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.04% NaN3) and  immediately neutralized with sodium phosphate (4 M,  pH 7.0).
The eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer  A (Tris-HCl, 25 mM, pH 8.0) and then chromatographed  on a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) with a gradient from 0 to 65% buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M  NaCl, pH 8).
The product was >95% homogeneous on  SDS-PAGE, and wt as well as all mutants gave the correct N-terminal amino acid sequence.

  Epitopes on the Interferon   Receptor 891and mutants 6 and 13 (Table 1) were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and gave peaks consistent  with the expected masses.
The concentration of wt receptor was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis,  from which a molar extinction coefcient was determined (e  48,000 M1 cm1  ) at 280 nm (A280).
Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation using a  20 mM solution of wt IFNgR1-229 in sodium phosphate  buffer (50 mM, pH 7.2) and NaCl (150 mM) gave a molecular mass of 26.9 kDa (calculated mass  27.587 kDa),  and sedimentation data were consistent with a monomeric native form.
CD spectra of the wt and mutant  IFNgR proteins were recorded on a Jasco J720 instrument  at a protein concentration of 10 mM in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.2).
  Mutagenesis of the IFNgR1-229  General cloning methods were as described by  Sambrook et al. (1989).
A total of 24 of the 26 homolog  scanning mutants (Table 1) were prepared by mutagenesis of IFNgR1-229 cDNA using PCR methods (Li &  Shapiro, 1993; Chen & Przybyla, 1994).
This involved  using mutagenic primers encoding the changes required,  pOCI656 (vide supra) as template, and two invariant  anking primers that contain an NcoI site in the 50 primer and a NotI site in the 30 primer.
The nal PCR products were digested with NcoI and NotI and ligated  between the corresponding cloning sites in pHEN1.
The  remaining two mutants (11 and 26) were also prepared  by PCR methods, using a mutagenic oligonucleotide as  the 30 primer in a standard PCR.
Prior to expression,  each mutant (in the expression vector pHEN1) was  sequenced throughout the entire open reading frame, on  both DNA strands, using dye terminator chemistry (Perkin Elmer), to conrm that only the desired nt changes  had been introduced.
  BIAcore measurements  Measurements were carried out on a BIAcore instrument (Pharmacia Biosensor) at 25C, with PBS (50 mM  sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl) containing 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant-p20 as running buffer.
  Protein was immobilized on CM5 sensor chips by random amine coupling, as described in the BIAcore  methods manual.
Coupling was performed in sodium  acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 4.0) at a protein concentration  of 100 mg/ml (for mAbs) or 24 mg/ml (for receptor).
The  level of immobilization corresponded typically to 500 to  1,000 resonance units (RU), which gave rise to Rmax  values on ligand binding of 70 to 200 RU.
Around 10,000  RUs of gR99 were immobilized for determination of  active free receptor concentrations from initial binding  rates (mass transport-limited conditions) (Karlsson et al.,  1993).
IFNg lacking the ten C-terminal residues  (IFNg10) (Dobeli et al., 1988) was used for binding  assays.
Protein concentrations in stock solutions in PBS  (phosphate-buffered saline) were determined from A280  measurements after calibration by quantitative amino  acid analysis (1 mg/ml corresponds to: A280  1.7 for  IFNgR1-229; A280  1.35 for mAb; A280  1.0 for IFNg10),  and also for receptor from mass transport-limited initial  binding rates.
A ow rate of 10 ml/min and an injection  volume of 30 ml were used routinely.
The ow rate and  injection volume for protein determinations under mass  transport-limited conditions were 2 ml/min and 10 ml,  respectively.
gR99 and IFNgR surfaces were regenerated  by injection of glycine buffer (10 ml, 0.1 M, pH 2.5).
These  conditions were not suitable for regeneration of A6 or  gR38 surfaces.
However, the relatively high koff for  receptor from these mAb surfaces enabled repeated use  without injection of complex-destabilizing solutions for  regeneration.
The response returned fully to baseline  level within 5 to 15 minutes after the end of sample injection.
Analyte concentrations used for kinetic analyses  were: IFNg10 binding to immobilized IFNgR, 13 assays  in the range 10 to 500 nM; IFNgR binding to immobilized A6, 7 assays in the range 10 to 150 nM; IFNgR  binding to immobilized gR38, 7 assays in the range 20 to  300 nM; and IFNgR binding to immobilized gR99, seven  assays in range 10 to 100 nM. IFNgR mutants 6, 8, 13, 14  and 21 (see Table 1) with reduced afnity for mAbs were  analyzed at concentrations in the range 0.25 to 28 mM.  Mass transport-limiting gR99 surfaces were calibrated  using 5 to 50 nM wt receptor.
The specicity of the mAb  surfaces was checked by injection of individual domains  of the IFNgR as fusion proteins with thioredoxin (Trx),  prepared as described (Williams et al., 1995).
Trx-IFNgR1-  108 bound only to A6 and gR38 mAb surfaces, whereas  Trx-IFNgR100-229 recognised only the gR99 mAb surface.
  Specicity in binding to the IFNgR surface was veried  by injection of IFNg10 in admixture with IFNgR1-229,  Trx-IFNg1-108 or Trx-IFNgR100-229. As expected, only in  the latter two cases was binding observed.
No background binding was observed on injecting receptor or  IFNg10 over a blank CM5 sensor surface.
  BIAcore data analysis  Binding curves were analyzed using BIAevaluation  software (version 2.1).
KD values were calculated from  the ratio of dissociation (koff) to association (kon) rate constants.
The baselines of sensorgrams were set to zero.
  The koff values were derived by tting a one-minute  period of the dissociation phase to the equation  (O'Shannessy et al., 1993):  R  R1ekoff tt1  R, response in RUs, t, time in seconds; t1, start time for  dissociation; R1, response at t1.
The kon values were calculated by tting the response during sample injection to  the equation:  Table 3.

A plot of ks against C yields a  straight line with a slope equivalent to kon.
The standard  deviation in the kinetic parameters was <25% between  repeated analyses with different preparations of the  same protein.
  BIAcore analyses of wt IFNgR, in which levels of  immobilized protein and analyte ow rates were varied,  showed that mass transport limitation had insignicant  effects on the calculated kinetic parameters.
Several  mutants showed koff values >0.02 s1  , and for these  cases a second method of determining KD was used.
The  steady state binding response (Req) was measured and  KA (1/KD) was derived from tting a plot of Req against  analyte concentration, according to the equation  (Karlsson et al., 1991):  Req  KACRmax=KAC  1  koff could then be calculated by dividing kon by KA.
  The use of high levels of immobilized gR99 resulted in  linear initial binding rates (ro) for the receptor in the concentration range 5 to 50 nM. The concentrations of active  mutant proteins could then be determined using a calibration curve of ro against concentration for wt receptor  (Karlsson et al., 1993).
The active concentration of most  mutants was similar to the concentration determined  spectrophotometrically.
The active concentration of  mutants with decreased afnity for gR99 could not be  determined in this manner.
  Formation and purification of the A6  Fab-IFNggR1-108 complex  The mAb A6 was digested with pepsin in sodium  acetate buffer (100 mM, pH 4.0).
Upon complete digestion, the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with Tris, and cysteine  (20 mM) was added.
After 30 minutes, iodoacetamide  was added (30 mM), and the Fab was puried by Protein  G afnity chromatography, by elution through a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (gradient with buffer A (ethanolamine-HCl (25 mM, pH 9.3)), and buffer A plus NaCl (0.5  M)), and nally using a Mono-P 5/20 column (gradient  with buffer A, and buffer A with polybufferHCl (Pharmacia), pH 7.0).
The IFNgR1-108 was prepared as  described (Williams et al., 1995), and mixed in 50%  Figure 9.

The complex was puried by gel  ltration (Superose-12) eluting with Tris (0.1 M, pH 8),  NaCl (100 mM, EDTA (2 mM), IFNgR1-108 (50 nM) and  NaN3 (0.08% w/v), and concentrated to 20 mg/ml in  Tris (25 mM, pH 8.0), NaCl (25 mM) and EDTA  (0.5 mM) for crystallization.
  Crystallization and data collection  Crystals of the complex were grown by the hangingdrop vapor diffusion method at room temperature and  reached a maximum size of 0.4 mm  0.3 mm  0.3 mm.
  Droplets (3 ml) of protein solution mixed with 0.5 ml  reservoir solution were equilibrated against a reservoir  containing 10% (w/v) PEG ME 5000, NaCl (0.5 M) buffered with Bis/Tris (50 mM, pH 5.5).
The diffraction data  were collected using an imaging plate detector (MarResearch) mounted on a FR591 rotating anode X-ray generator (Enraf) equipped with focusing mirror optics  (Supper).
For data collection, a crystal was soaked for a  few minutes in a buffer containing 30% glycerol in  addition to the components of the reservoir, picked up in  a small loop, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred into a nitrogen gas stream (120 K; Oxford Cryosystem) on the Mar goniostat.
Indexing and integration  of the diffraction data (400 frames of 0.25, 600 s/frame)  were performed by the MARXDS program package  (Kabsch, 1988).
The rather dramatic fall off in the diffracted X-ray intensity beyond 3.2 A resolution made  long exposure times necessary to obtain acceptable statistics in the highest resolution ranges (Table 4).
A Wilson  (1949) plot with data between 6.0 and 2.82 A yields an  intrinsic temperature factor of 58 A 2 for these crystals.
  There is one molecule of the complex per asymmetric  unit corresponding to a VM of 3.1 A 3  /Da (Matthews,  1968).
  Structure solution and refinement  The structure of the complex was solved by the molecular replacement method using AMoRe (Navaza,  1994).
In order to nd the best search models, a sequence  homology search was done comparing the VH, VL, CH1  and CL domain sequences of mAb A6 (Bridges et al.,  1995) with the corresponding domain sequences of Fab  structures available from the Brookhaven Protein Data  Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977).
For the Fv part the highest  sequence identities were found with VH of Fab 50.1 (80%  identity; entry code 1GGB; Rini et al., 1993) and VL of  Fab B72.3 (65% identity; entry code 1BBJ; Brady et al.,  1992).
The search model of this part was constructed  using the in-house modeling program Moloc having its  own force eld for energy minimization (Gerber &  Muller, 1995).
First, the Fv of 50.1 was superimposed  onto the Fv of B72.3 and one domain of each was then  chosen so as to make the chimeric Fv with the highest  homology to A6.
Subsequently, all side-chains different  from the mAb A6 sequence were corrected and residual  strain removed through energy minimization using  Moloc.
CDR H3 was not present in Fab 50.1 and the corresponding residues H95 to H102 of mAb A6 were thus  omitted from the search model.
The Fchl part was  assumed to be identical in sequence to that present in  Fab HyHEL-5, entry code 2HFL (Sheriff et al., 1987) and  was thus taken unchanged from this structure.
A preliminary model for IFNgR1-108 (missing residues I1 to I10  and I89 to I93) was available from the structure determination of the IFNgIFNgR complex (Chene et al., 1995;  le Du et al., unpublished data).
  Rotation and translation searches were rst carried  out separately for the Fv and Fchl models with diffraction data in the range 10 to 3.5 A .
The search with Fv  yielded one clearly best solution.
The top rotation function peak had a signal of 15.9 s (8.9 s for the second  peak) and yielded a correlation coefcient of 0.32 and  R-factor of 0.51 in the translation function search (0.22  and 0.54 for the second peak).
Similar searches with  Fchl alone were inconclusive.
However, including the  Fv solution in Fchl translation searches with the top ten  Fchl rotation peaks yielded the best translation function  solution for the top rotation function peak (8.2 s).
After  rigid body renement in AMoRe the correlation coef-  cient was 0.37 and the R-factor 0.49.
Although the  improvement in the R-factor appeared marginal the correctness of this solution was strongly supported by the  fact that the Fv and Fchl fragments joined up in precisely the way expected for a Fab fragment.
Attempts to  determine the position of IFNgR1-108 by molecular replacement methods using the known Fv and Fchl positions  in the translation search were unsuccessful.
  Subsequent structure renement was carried out with  X-Plor (Bru nger, 1992b) and model building using Moloc  and O (Jones et al., 1991).
Rigid-body optimization of the  four Fab domains (VH, VL, CL and CH1) using diffraction  data between 10 and 3.5 A resolution followed by positional renement and some minor model corrections  reduced the R-factor to 0.40.
A subsequent sigmaweighted electron density map (Read, 1986) revealed  Table 4.

Rigid-body  renement of the now ve domains (VH, VL, CL, CH and  IFNgR1-108) was then followed by a number of cycles  comprising model (re)building, positional renement  (using the parameters of Engh & Huber (1991)) and  renement of individual B-factors.
The free R-factor (5%  of the data) was used to monitor and verify improvements during renement of the model.
In the course of  this procedure two regions missing in the search model  could be unambiguously built and were added to the  model (CDR H3 and I89 to I93).
Major model rebuilding  was indicated in loop I47-I56 of IFNgR1-108 and a simulated annealing omit electron density (Bru nger, 1992a)  for this region is shown in Figure 10.
Consistent with  the poor signal of the Fchl part observed in the molecular replacement searches, the B-factors of the atoms of  the CL and CH1 domains rened to rather high values.
  The electron density for the whole Fchl part was weak,  fragmented in many areas and completely missing for  most residues of surface loops.
Therefore, only the best  determined chain segments with continuous electron  density were retained from these two domains (see  Table 2).
Another three disordered residues were  removed from the C terminus of the receptor domain.
  Finally, a small number of water molecules were  assigned to the strongest difference Fourier peaks on the  surface of the three well-dened domains taking hydrogen bonding criteria into consideration.
A bulk solvent  correction as available in X-Plor was used throughout  renement using values of 0.25 A , 0.35 e/A 3 and 50 A 2  for the parameters solrad, solden and the smoothing Bfactor respectively as described in detail by Kostrewa  et al. (1997).
The rened coordinates have been deposited with the Brookhaven Data Bank, accession code  1jrh.
