  Edited by R. Huber  Keywords: barley -amylase/subtilisin inhibitor; subtilisin; Savinase;  inhibition; X-ray crystallography  Introduction  Subtilisins represent a large class of microbial serine proteases, of which those secreted by the Bacillus  species (e.g., BPN from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens,  subtilisin Carlsberg from Bacillus subtilis and Savinase from Bacillus lentus) are the most studied.
Subtilisins are endopeptidases with a catalytic triad consisting of Asp32, His64 and Ser221 (with BPN  numbering used consistently1  ).
Subtilisins are globular proteins, with the active site situated in a  shallow groove on the surface.
The mechanism is  identical with that of trypsin-like family enzymes but  is evolutionary and structurally different.2 The substrate binding cleft of Savinase provides six subsites  for binding of the side chains of the protein to be  degraded, designated S4S2 (nomenclature according to Ref. 3).
Inhibitor residues corresponding to the  subsites are numbered P4P2, and adjacent inhibitor  residues are numbered sequentially; cleavage occurs  between the P1 and P1 residues.
More than 50% of  the 275 amino acids have been subjected to mutagenesis, and this has provided great insight into enzyme catalysis.4 Furthermore, subtilisins are important industrial enzymes, being used in various fields  such as detergent production, food production, feed  production, leather and textile processing, pharmaceutical production, diagnostics and waste management.5 The three-dimensional fold is highly conserved, with a central seven-stranded parallel -sheet  flanked on both sides by -helices.68 There is a highly  conserved calcium binding site in most Bacillus sub-  *Corresponding author.

There is a second and  much weaker ion binding site on the surface 32   away from the strong calcium site that coordinates to  residues 195 and 197.
This region actually has two ion  binding sites close to each other; one accommodates  sodium and the other accommodates calcium.
These  two sites cannot be occupied simultaneously.4  Complexes of the serine proteases with proteinaceous inhibitors have been the object of intensive  study.
Inhibitors identified to date fall into about 20  structural families.9 Proteinaceous subtilisin inhibitors are found in 3 families [Potato I inhibitor family,  Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) family and  Kazal inhibitor family7,10,11] and are all canonical inhibitors.
The structures of inhibitors from all 3 classes  have been solved in complex with a subtilisin: chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI-2, from the Potato I inhibitor family)7 and SSI (from the SSI family) both in  complex with subtilisin Novo (BPN)  10 and the turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3, from the  Kazal inhibitor family) in complex with subtilisin  Carlsberg.11 Although the 3 families of inhibitors  have different overall folds, they all interact with  subtilisin via a structurally conserved exposed loop  surrounding the fully exposed P1 residue.
The  interaction is stabilised through a highly conserved  hydrogen bonding pattern.7,1215  Hordeum vulgare -amylase/subtilisin inhibitor  (BASI) is a double-headed inhibitor that acts both on  -amylase 2 (AMY2) from barley and on serine proteases from the subtilisin family.
BASI is thought to  have two functions: to control degradation of starch  during premature sprouting16 and to protect the seed  from pathogen-derived subtilisin-type serine  proteases17 (for a review, see the work of Bellincampi  et al.18 and Nielsen et al.19).
It is a single-chain protein  of 181 amino acids and belongs to the Kunitz-P-type  inhibitor family.16,20,21 BASI shares about 30%  sequence identity with Kunitz-type inhibitors from  other plants that contain two conserved disulfide  bridges.22 The closest homologues to BASI are from  wheat (WASI) and rice, and these share 92% and 58%  sequence identities, respectively.23,24 The structure of  BASI has been solved in complex with AMY225 and  barley thioredoxin (HvTrxh2)26: In both complexes,  BASI displays the -trefoil topology.
BASI does not  inhibit barley thioredoxin but rather serves as a  substrate.
  In this study, we present the X-ray structure of  BASI in complex with the B. lentus subtilisin Savinase, which shows that BASI inhibits subtilisins in a  novel way.
  Results and Discussion  Architecture of the BASISavinase complex  There are two independent complexes in the asymmetric unit, with very similar structures: superposition of the two results in a root-mean-square (rms)  difference of 0.8  over 450 C atoms.
The inhibitor  binds to the active site of the enzyme, situated in a  shallow groove on the surface (Fig. 1), in agreement  with biochemical experiments that supported a  strictly competitive inhibition mode.27 Eighteen residues of the inhibitor interact with 28 residues of the  enzyme.
The overall contact area between the enzyme and the inhibitor is 1800 2  , which is equivalent or slightly higher than areas in other subtilisinproteinaceous inhibitor complexes (Fig. 2a,  upper panel).28 In the standard mechanism for  canonical protein inhibition of serine proteases, the  inhibitor binds to the protease in a substrate-like  manner, with the protease interacting loop kept in a  well-ordered conformation.
BASI residues Ala86  Thr89 bind to Savinase S5 to S2 by hydrogen bonding.
At the interface, there are 144 contacts less than  4 . BASI residues Ala86Thr89 (P5P2) make 77  contacts with 17 residues in Savinase, 7 of which are  hydrogen bonds.
In the cleft leading to the active site,  the P4P2 residues make five main chainmain chain  hydrogen bonds, which follow the expected hydrogen bonding pattern typical for P4P2 interactions  (Fig. 2, lower panel).6 Two additional side chain  main chain hydrogen bonds are formed between  BASI Ala86Savinase Ser126 and BASI Tyr87Savinase Ser130.
  Savinase fold and mobility  Savinase displays the subtilisin-like fold with the  same topology as reported previously.2 Superposition of the C atoms from the two Savinase molecules in the asymmetric unit gives an rms difference  of 0.3  for 269 C atoms.
Superposing the current  model on native Savinase (1SVN)2 gives a similar  rms of 0.3  over the same 269 C atoms.
There is no  significant rearrangement of Savinase side chains in  the active site on BASI inhibition.
  BASI fold and mobility  In the complex, BASI displays the -trefoil topology with the same topology as reported previously.25,26 Superposition of the 181 C atoms from the  two independent BASI molecules gives an rms difference of 1.1 . Furthermore, BASI can be superposed  with the BASI molecule (chain C) in complex with  AMY2 (1AVA)25 and with the BASI molecule in complex with HvTrxh2 (2IWT),26 resulting in rms differences of 2.3 and 1.8 , respectively (based on 181  and 179 C atoms, respectively).
The relatively high  differences for superposition of BASI are due to the  high level of flexibility of the loops (definition of  loops and -strands as in Vallee et al.25).
Twenty-eight  residues, all situated in loops found on the surface of  BASI, have B-factors above 50.
When those residues  are omitted from the superposition and the remaining 153 C atoms are superposed, the rms difference  drops to 0.8 , whereas if only the core structure,  omitting all loops, is superposed, the rms is 0.5   (62 C  ).
In the BASIAMY2 complex, a large part of  682 Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisinthe BASI surface is tightly bound in the interface; the  loops involved in the BASIAMY2 interface are  therefore in a different conformation compared with  the BASISavinase complex.
The rms value drops to  1.4  (113 C atoms used, BASISavinase chain C and  1AVA chain C) when residues involved in the AMY2  binding are omitted from the superposition (Fig. 3).25  Positioning of the metal ions  All subtilisins are calcium dependent, and many of  the Bacillus enzymes have a conserved strong  calcium binding site (site A) and a weaker ion  binding site (site B).2,7,8 In addition to the four  peptide chains, 4 calcium ions, 6 sodium ions and 24  Fig. 2.

  Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisin 683chloride ions were modelled into the electron  density.
All identified ions are present in the crystallisation solution.
Two of the calcium ions are bound  in site A and coordinate to Savinase as previously  described.2,7,8,29 The other two calcium ions are coordinated to Savinase Val153 and four water molecules; there is no coordination with BASI.
Site B is  occupied by a sodium ion in both complexes (Fig. 1).
  Comparison of the two complexes in the  asymmetric unit  The overall structures of the two complexes are  essentially identical.
However, there are some small  differences, with one significant difference in the  enzymeinhibitor interface.
The buried surface area  in the interface of the AC complex is 1866 2  , while  that of the BD complex is 1798 2  .
  28 In the interface,  only two BASI residues, Arg61 and Arg85, differ  significantly in the interface area contribution, due to  side chain rearrangement (Fig. 4).
The solvent-accessible surface (SAS) for the two residues was calculated (Table 1) in order to better understand the  effects of the side chain rearrangements on the interface area.
The biggest difference arises from Arg61.
  Taking the entire residue into account, 77% and 86%  of the SAS are covered by BASI itself in the C and D  chains, respectively; in addition, when BASI is  bound to Savinase, 70% and 0% of the SAS are  covered by Savinase in the AC and BD complexes,  respectively.
Thus, Arg61 contributes to the interface  area with 60 and 0 2 in the AC and BD complexes,  respectively.
The opposite situation is seen for Arg85,  which contributes to the interface area with 40 and  80 2 in the AC and BD complexes, respectively.
  Furthermore, in the AC complex, BASI Ala181 has  seven contacts with Savinase Thr132, two of which  are hydrogen bonds; on the other hand, in the DB  complex, Ala181 is not involved in the interface.
In  general, there are more contacts and hydrogen bonds  in the AC complex compared with the BD complex.
  These differences probably reflect differences in the  crystal contacts of the two complexes.
The D chain is  more solvated than the C chain, and this could  explain the difference observed in the mobility of the  two chains.
  Comparison with other subtilisininhibitor  complexes  BASI interacts with Savinase via an exposed loop,  but the length of the loop differs from that observed  in the complexes previously reported (Fig. 2).
Whereas the subtilisin interacting loops in the previous  structures constitute the P4P2 residues, the loop in  BASI is composed of the P5P2 residues (Ala86  Thr89).
After the P2 residue, the BASI loop is pulled  out of the Savinase cleft, as Cys90 (which would be  the P1 residue) forms a disulfide bond with Cys43.
  This moves the potential scissile bond, between  Cys90 and Leu91, 6.4  away from the active serine,  compared with about 2.6  in the other three types of  inhibitors (Fig. 2, lower panel).
Since the interacting  loop in BASI is shorter, the triple-stranded -sheet  seen in other subtilisinproteinaceous inhibitor complexes is missing (Fig. 2, lower panel).
This is a novel  Fig. 3.

  684 Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisinway for a proteinaceous inhibitor to interact with a  subtilisin.
The inhibition is basically canonical, but as  the interacting loop is shorter, it lacks the reactive  bond.
As the potential scissile bond is pulled away  from the active serine, BASI is not degraded, in  contrast to other known serine protease inhibitors  where the P1P1 bond is slowly degraded by the  enzyme.3032 This suggests that the BASIsubtilisin  complex is more stable than other known subtilisin  inhibitor complexes.
The cysteine that prevents BASI  from being degraded is conserved in the close homologues in WASI23 and rice -amylase/subtilisin  inhibitor,24 which can be assumed to share this  novel mode of interaction.
  Biological role and regulation of BASI  In addition to inhibiting Savinase, BASI inhibits  AMY2 from barley, and indeed both enzymes can be  inhibited simultaneously.16,33 The Savinase inhibition is calcium independent, while the AMY2 inhibition is calcium dependent, as there is a fully hydrated  calcium ion in the interface between BASI and AMY2  that is absent from the AMY2 structure.25 It has been  suggested that the calcium ion in the BASIAMY2  interface plays an important role in the regulation of  the AMY2 inhibition.33 Amylases in grains must be  inhibited to prevent premature sprouting, but the  inhibition needs to be regulated in order for the seed  to germinate at a later point.
The ability of BASI to  simultaneously inhibit AMY2 and Savinase, the  possible regulatory role of the calcium ion in the  BASIAMY2 interaction and the unregulated nature  of the BASISavinase interaction are consistent with  the proposed biological roles of BASI: to prevent  premature sprouting and to inhibit pathogenderived proteases.
The AMY2 and the Savinase  binding sites are located on opposite surfaces of BASI  (Fig. 5).
Therefore, the ternary complex between  AMY2, BASI and Savinase might occur naturally,  although it has not yet been isolated to date.
  Savinase inhibition by BASI mutants  The binding loop of CI-2 is supported and conformationally constrained by an extensive network of  hydrogen bonds and intramolecular interactions.7,34  This network is not present in BASI, but BASI has a  more extended hydrogen bond network between the  P5P2 residues and the residues in the subtilisin  groove.
Although BASI and CI-2 hydrogen bond to  Savinase in the same manner with respect to the P4  P2 residues and the cores of the loop consisting of the  P7P2 residues have the same conformation, only the  P2 residue is conserved (BASI Thr89 and CI-2 Thr58).
  All BASI P7P2 residues were mutated individually  to those present in the CI-2 P7P2 sequence to gain a  better understanding of the role of each residue in the  Table 1.

  Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisin 685inhibition.
In addition, Y87A and T89A, two BASI  point mutations, previously reported to have a 3.5-  fold decrease in affinity and no affinity change, respectively,35 were included in this study.
  The effect of the mutations on the inhibition of  Savinase was assayed on N-Suc-AAPF-pNA (Nsuccinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine  4-nitroanilide).
The Ki values increased for all  mutants, ranging from a few to more than 120-fold  (Fig. 6 and Table 2).
Mutation of the outermost residues of the P7P2 loop (P7, F84V; P6, R86G; P2, T89A)  had little effect on Ki, while mutation of the P3P5  residues resulted in changes ranging from 11-fold to  more than 120-fold.
Both the A86T and the Y87T  mutants showed a 25- to 30-fold reduction in Ki.
  Ala86 is situated in a hydrophobic pocket, and,  presumably, introducing a hydrophilic residue destabilises the interaction.
In the wild-type BASI, Tyr87 is  involved in a side chain hydrogen bond to Savinase  Ser130.
When mutated into a residue with a shorter  side chain, the hydrogen bond is presumably lost; the  Y87A mutant showed an 11-fold decrease in affinity.
  The Y87A mutant was previously reported to increase Ki by only 3.5-fold35 compared with the 10-  fold increase seen here.
In addition, Bnsager et al.  reported a value for Ki for the wild-type enzyme  higher than that measured in this study.
The differences seen in the two studies must be due to experimental differences, including assay conditions, protein expression, protein purification method and  protein modifications.
  The most significant change in inhibition effect  results from mutation of the P3 residue (T88V).
The  side chain of Thr88 forms two intramolecular hydroFig.

  686 Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisingen bonds to Cys90 and Leu91; in addition, there are  several intramolecular interactions between the  Thr88 side chain and the BASI backbone, which are  presumably lost when valine is introduced.
  From the present study, it is clear that Ala86, Thr87  and especially Thr88 are important for Savinase inhibition, and all are conserved in the wheat inhibitor,  while only Ala86 and Thr88 are conserved in the rice  inhibitor.23,24 The variation in loop sequence in  subtilisin inhibitors suggests that the side chains  play a major role in constraining the loops in the right  conformation necessary for subtilisin inhibition.
  Sequence conservation of protease inhibiting  loops  Within inhibitor families, there is high sequence  variability in the interacting loops, with some clear  amino acid preferences.
The Kunitz-P-type inhibitors  from soybean have a conserved proline at the P3  position, whereas in the barley, wheat and rice inhibitors, there is a threonine.9 The present study shows  that threonine is crucial for BASI inhibition of Savinase.
In canonical inhibitors, the side chain of the P3  residue is not involved in the interface with the  enzyme, as it points away from the enzyme and towards the solvent or the inhibitor itself.6 In contrast,  in the BASISavinase complex, the side chain of  Thr88 forms hydrogen bonds with the backbones of  Cys90 and Leu91, leading to stabilisation of the P5  P2 loop.
When the polar OH moiety of Thr88 is  replaced by a hydrophobic CH3 (T88V), the loop is  no longer restrained in the conformation necessary  for binding, and the inhibitory power is lost.
  Proteinase K inhibition by cereal Kunitz-P-type  inhibitors  A low-resolution structure of the WASI, which  shares 92% sequence identity with BASI, has been  solved in complex with proteinase K.36 Given the  high sequence identity between BASI and WASI, the  ability of BASI to inhibit proteinase K was tested, and  it was observed that BASI inhibits proteinase K to the  same extent as it inhibits Savinase (data not shown).
  A model of the complex between BASI and proteinase K was generated by superposing proteinase  K [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1OYO] onto Savinase  in complex with BASI (the coordinates for the proteinase KWASI complex are not available).
Although proteinase K and Savinase share only 37%  sequence identity, the region around the active site  superposes well and the enzymeinhibitor interface,  including the hydrogen bonding pattern, is conserved.
The only clash in the interface is seen between the side chain of proteinase K Tyr104 and BASI  Tyr87.
However, a significant side chain rearrangement has been reported in the proteinase K complex  with WASI, leading to stacking of proteinase K  Tyr104 and WASI Tyr86 (equivalent to BASI Tyr87),  thereby contributing to the tight binding in this  complex.36 It is reasonable to assume that the same  side chain rearrangement would occur in a proteinase K complex with BASI.
  Conclusions  In this study, the first cereal Kunitz-P-type inhibitor in complex with a subtilisin has been determined.
BASI inhibits subtilisin in a novel way, as the  interacting loop only includes the P4P2 residues,  while the interacting loop of inhibitors from other  families consists of the P4P2 residues.
The interacting loop is pulled away from the active serine by a  disulfide bridge between Cys90 and Cys43, preventing cleavage of the inhibitor.
BASI also inhibits proteinase K, and it is reasonable to assume that the  same residues are involved in the interface, based on  superposition of Savinase and proteinase K. The roles  of the loop residues have been analysed by mutating  them one by one.
All seven variants showed increased Ki values, ranging from a few times to more  than 120 times.
The P3 residue (Thr88) is shown to be  crucial for the inhibition, as it stabilises the conformation of the interacting loop, through hydrogen bonding and intramolecular interactions with the BASI  backbone.
  Materials and Methods  Cloning  All constructs were cloned as described previously.37  The BASI gene was synthesised by PCR-based gene synthesis.38 All oligonucleotides were purchased from  Invitrogen.
BASI cDNA without signal sequence and the  truncated -factor secretion signal37 was amplified and  combined using splicing-by-overlapping extension PCR.
  All constructs were subcloned in the TOPO vector using a  TOPO Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen).

  Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisin 687Protein expression, purification and characterisation  Wild-type BASI and all seven variants were expressed as  reported previously.37 Mutation did not alter the expression levels, indicating proper global folding of the proteins.
  Molecular size and purity were verified by SDS-PAGE and  mass spectroscopy (not shown).
BASI was precipitated  from the supernatant by adding solid ammonium sulfate  [(NH4)2SO4] to a final concentration of 3.2 M, and the solution was stirred for 30 min.
The precipitate was collected  by centrifugation (20,000g, 20 min) and dissolved in a  minimal volume of buffer A (20 mM CH3COOH/NaOH,  pH 5.0).
The dissolved BASI was transferred to buffer A by  gel filtration (desalting) on a G25 Sephadex column.
The  desalted BASI solution was slightly turbid, and this turbidity was removed by 0.45-m filtration.
The filtrate was  applied to a HighLoad SP-Sepharose column equilibrated  in buffer A. After washing with buffer A, the column was  eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (00.5 M) in buffer A  over 10 column volumes.
Fractions from the column with  BASI were pooled and diluted 10 times with deionised  water to reduce the conductivity.
The diluted BASI pool  was applied to a SOURCE S column equilibrated in buffer  A. After washing with buffer A, the column was eluted  with a linear NaCl gradient (00.5 M) in buffer A over 10  column volumes.
BASI-containing fractions from the  column were analysed by SDS-PAGE, and pure fractions  were pooled.
G25 Sephadex, HighLoad SP-Sepharose and  SOURCE S are column materials from GE Healthcare.
  Crystallisation  Savinase was purified by affinity chromatography and  ion-exchange chromatography.
BASI and Savinase were  mixed with a small molar excess of BASI.
The mixture was  dialysed overnight in 10 mM Mes (4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid) and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 6.0, and concentrated  by centrifugation in an Amicon Ultra-15 device (with a  cutoff of 5000 Da, Millipore Corporation).
The BASISavinase complex was concentrated to 23 mg ml1 in 10 mM  Mes buffer, pH 6.0, and 2 mM CaCl2.
Crystallisation  screening was conducted using sitting-drop vapour diffusion with Crystal Screen 1, Crystal Screen 2, Index Screen  (all from Hampton Research) and PACT Screen (Molecular  Dimensions Limited).
Small single crystals were obtained  in index screen condition A9 (0.1 M BisTris, pH 5.5, and  3 M NaCl).
Subsequently, hanging-drop vapour diffusion  was applied to optimise those conditions that had led to  the most promising results, as well as exploring a range of  different pH levels and types and concentrations of  precipitant.
Drops containing 1 l of the protein and 1 l  of reservoir solution were equilibrated against 500 l of  reservoir solution at 18 C.
Crystals suitable for X-ray  diffraction were obtained from 0.1 M sodium acetate  buffer, pH 5.6, and 4 M NaCl in the form of bipyramids of  average dimensions 0.4 mm  0.3 mm  0.3 mm, which  appeared after 510 days.
  Data collection and processing  Prior to data collection, crystals were mounted in nylon  CryoLoops (Hampton Research) and vitrified.
No cryoprotectant was required due to the high concentration of  NaCl in the mother liquor.
Data were collected at ESRF  ID23-1 at 100 K with an ADSC Q315 detector.
The crystals  diffracted to a resolution of 1.85  and belong to the  primitive tetragonal space group P41212, with unit cell  parameters a=b= 100.64  and c= 216.24 . There are two  molecules of the BASISavinase complex per asymmetric  unit giving a Matthews coefficient39 of 2.77 3  /Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 56%.
The intensity data  were indexed, integrated and scaled using the HKL2000  package with DENZO and SCALEPACK40 (Table 3).
  Structure solution and refinement  The structure was solved by molecular replacement  using the program PHASER,41 with the wild-type Savinase  (PDB ID 1SVN) and BASI (PDB ID 1AVA) molecules as  independent components in the rotation and translation  parameter search.
Both complexes of BASISavinase were  clearly placed in the asymmetric unit, and the R-factors  after the first 10 cycles of maximum-likelihood refinement  by REFMAC542 were 25.8% and 33.6% for Rcryst and Rfree,  respectively.
  The model was completed by visual inspection of the  2FoFc and FoFc electron density maps using the program Coot.43 Non-crystallographic symmetry averaging  was used to improve the map, and non-crystallographic  symmetry restraints were applied during the first steps of  refinement.
The R-factors converged to 23.3% and 28.1%  for Rcryst and Rfree, respectively.
  At this stage, a number of water molecules were added  to the model using Coot.
The data were at first refined to  2 . In the final part of the refinement, the data set was  reprocessed to 1.85 , but with the Rfree test set of reflections imported from the original 2- data set.
This improved the electron density maps and helped rebuild the  flexible loops.
Following several steps of refinement,  combined with visual checking of the model, Rcryst and  Rfree dropped to 20.2% and 23.9%, respectively.
The final  model contains 6620 non-hydrogen protein atoms and 574  water molecules.
Electron density peaks greater than the  Table 3.

  688 Novel Inhibition Mode of a Subtilisin3 level were identified as 4 Ca2+, 6 Na+ and 24 Cl ions, all  present in the crystallisation medium.
The average B-factor  for main chain atoms is 34.3 2  .
The refinement statistics  are summarised in Table 3.
  The Ramachandran plot was defined by Procheck,44 and  the distribution of residues is summarised in Table 3.
  Interface calculations  The interface area of the complex between Savinase and  BASI was obtained by evaluating the solvent-accessible  area of A12 of the complex and then the solvent-accessible  areas of A1 and A2, the surface areas of dissociated Savinase  and BASI, respectively, and then computing B= (A1+A2  A12).
The surfaces were computed analytically using the  Lee and Richards algorithm28 and a probe radius of 1.4 .  Inhibition of Savinase and proteinase K  BASI wild type, F84V, R85G, A86T, Y87I, Y87A, T88V  and T89A (seven concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 nM)  were preincubated with Savinase or proteinase K (40 nM)  for 10 min at room temperature in 50 mM glycine, pH 9.8,  150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM CaCl and 0.01% Triton X-100.
N-SucAAPF-pNA (Sigma S 7388) was added (five concentrations  ranging from 0.16 to 6.4 mM, in 250 l).
Changes in absorbance at 405 nM were measured and converted into  initial rates of reaction.
Km, Vmax and Ki were calculated for  all BASI variants by non-linear regression; competitive inhibition was calculated using GraphPad prism, version  5.01 (GraphPad Software).
