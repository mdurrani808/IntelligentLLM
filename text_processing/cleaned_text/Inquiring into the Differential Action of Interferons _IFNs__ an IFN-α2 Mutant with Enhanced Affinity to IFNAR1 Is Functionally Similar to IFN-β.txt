Here we combined  biophysical and functional studies to explore the mechanism that allows the alpha and beta IFNs to act  differentially.
For this purpose, we have engineered an IFN-2 triple mutant termed the HEQ mutant that  mimics the biological properties of IFN-.
Compared to wild-type (wt) IFN-2, the HEQ mutant confers a  30-fold higher binding affinity towards IFNAR1, comparable to that measured for IFN-, resulting in a much  higher stability of the ternary complex as measured on model membranes.
The HEQ mutant, like IFN-,  promotes a differentially higher antiproliferative effect than antiviral activity.
Both bring on a down-regulation  of the IFNAR2 receptor upon induction, confirming an increased ternary complex stability of the plasma  membrane.
Oligonucleotide microarray experiments showed similar gene transcription profiles induced by the  HEQ mutant and IFN- and higher levels of gene induction or repression than those for wt IFN-2.
Thus, we  show that the differential activities of IFN- are directly related to the binding affinity for IFNAR1.
Conservation of the residues mutated in the HEQ mutant within IFN- subtypes suggests that IFN- has evolved to  bind IFNAR1 weakly, apparently to sustain differential levels of biological activities compared to those induced  by IFN-.
  Type I interferons (IFNs) form a family of multifunctional  cytokines initially described for their direct antiviral effect but  now also recognized as major elements of the immune response (19, 46).
Differential activities of IFN subtypes have  been reported (3) and used in the clinic for the treatment of  various pathologies, including viral hepatitis (IFN-2) and  multiple sclerosis (IFN-) (32).
All type I IFNs are recognized  by a single shared receptor composed of two transmembrane  proteins, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2.
Because of the much faster  kon and much slower koff of IFN-2 towards IFNAR2 than  those measured for IFNAR1 (18, 34, 40), a two-step assembling mechanism was proposed for the interaction between  IFN and the two receptors (Fig. 1B).
After binding of IFN-2  to IFNAR2 (ka1), IFNAR1 transiently associates in a second  step to the complex (ka2) (18, 25).
Owing to the short lifetime  of the IFN-2IFNAR1 interaction, the complex dissociates  (kd2) and reassociates (ka2) in a fast manner.
Thus, depending  on the receptor surface concentrations and ligand binding affinities, only part of the bound ligand is involved in the active  ternary complex.
  After formation of the ternary complex, the interferon signal  is transduced through the receptor-associated JAK kinases,  with the STAT transcription factors as their main targets (3).
  Typically recognized by the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-like folds  of their extracellular domains, IFNAR2 and IFNAR1 are regarded as a binding protein and an accessory transducing factor, respectively (48).
A difference in the ligand dissociation  constants of the two chains is implicit in the definition (25, 33).
  Still, both contribute to the creation of high-affinity binding  sites (6, 9, 18).
The combination of a common beta chain  with different recognition chains is a feature of heteromeric  receptors that respond differentially to different ligands.
The  ability to interact with different alpha chains establishes potential network connections for differential receptor expression  (22).
In cases where the alpha chains, such as IFNAR1, possess  the capacity of interacting with elements of different signaling  pathways, they may establish connections for differential gene  expression (37).
  The human type I IFNs comprise 13 distinct nonallelic alpha  subtypes, one beta subtype, and one omega subtype (2).
As  expected for a family with marked sequence and structural  homology and a common receptor, the activities of the type I  IFNs largely overlap (31).
Nevertheless, numerous instances of  relative differences in activity have been noted (8, 15, 27, 29,  36, 39, 44).
The emerging picture is that functional differences  appear only in specific physiological contexts. It was noted that  a possible functional difference between the IFNs may reside  in their potential to bind tightly to IFNAR1 (25, 45).
  For the present study, we aimed to understand the molecular difference between IFN- and IFN-.

These include a markedly increased antiproliferative but not antiviral activity, differential gene expression  as monitored using gene arrays, and specific down-regulation  of the IFNAR2 receptor.
Our results support the notion that  the type I interferons are not functionally redundant, despite  sharing a common receptor and prominent activities.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Site-directed mutagenesis.
Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR  amplification of the expression plasmid pT72C2 with 18- to 21-nucleotide  primers containing the mutated codon, using the high-fidelity pwo (Boehringer  Mannheim) and Pfu (Stratagene) polymerases as described previously (36).
  Protein expression, purification, and labeling.
IFN-2 and IFNAR2-EC (extracellular domain) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by ion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography (35).
IFNAR1-EC was expressed in  Sf9 insect cells and purified as described previously (25).
Both IFNAR2-EC and  IFNAR1-EC carried a C-terminal decahistidine tag for oriented tethering on  membranes.
Protein purity was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions.
The concentration  of active IFN-2 protein was determined for all mutants by analytical gel filtration with IFNAR2-EC (36).
For ligand binding studies, IFN-2 and IFN- were  site-specifically labeled using maleimide chemistry.
IFN- was labeled directly at  its free cysteine residue, C17, by incubation of a twofold molar excess of Oregon  Green 488 maleimide (Molecular Probes) for 2 h in HEPES-buffered saline.
  IFN-2 was labeled with Oregon Green 488 after incorporating an additional  cysteine residue (S136C mutation), which has been shown not to affect the  interaction with IFNAR1-EC or IFNAR2-EC (18).
  Ligand binding studies.
The binding of fluorescently labeled IFN to IFNAR1-EC  and IFNAR2-EC and the formation of the ternary complex on solidly supported  lipid bilayers were studied by simultaneous total internal reflection fluorescence  (TIRFS) and reflectance interference (RIf) detection (18).
Association and dissociation rate constants were determined from binding curves measured by TIRFS.
  Receptor surface concentrations were quantified from the RIf signal, which provides  an absolute, mass-sensitive signal.
Binding assays on solidly supported membranes  were carried out with unilaminar vesicles containing chelator lipids fused on the  surface of the RIf transducer (18, 25).
IFNAR1-EC and IFNAR2-EC were tethered  to these membranes through their C-terminal His tags, thus mimicking membrane  anchoring of the receptor subunits.
For this study, ternary complex stability was  monitored as the rate of ligand dissociation and was studied at different receptor  surface concentrations after saturating the IFNAR2 binding sites by injection of 100  nM fluorescently labeled IFN.
  Antiviral and antiproliferative assays.
Antiviral activities of wild-type and  mutant IFN-2 were assayed as the inhibition of the cytopathic effect of vesicular  stomatitis virus on human WISH cells (42).
  The antiproliferative assay with WISH cells was conducted by adding IFN at  serial dilutions to the growth medium in flat-bottomed microtiter plates and  monitoring the cell density after 72 h by crystal violet staining.
  The 50% activity concentrations (c50) as well as the sensitivities of cells to  increasing amounts of interferon were deduced from an IFN dose-response  curve (Kaleidagraph; Synergy Software), using the following equation (equation 1):  y  A0  A/[1  (c/c50)  s  ], where y is the absorbance and reflects the relative  number of cells, A0 is the offset, A is the amplitude, c is the IFN concentration,  and s is the slope.
  The experimental error () for both assays was 35%.
Therefore, a 2 confidence level would suggest that differences smaller than twofold between interferons are within the experimental error.
  Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of cell surface receptors.
  293T cells were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium supplemented  with 10% fetal calf serum.
They were treated with 1 nM IFN for 2 h, detached  with 5 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in phosphatebuffered saline containing 3% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mM EDTA.
The mouse  monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) AA3-AB2 and D5, specific for IFNAR1 or IFNAR2, were used at a concentration of 3 g/ml.
The signal was amplified with  biotinylated rat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals) and streptavidinallophycocyanin (BD Biosciences).
Samples were analyzed with a FACSCalibur  instrument in the presence of propidium iodide to exclude dead cells.
  IFN-induced luciferase activity.
The HL116 cell clone was derived from the  HT1080 cell line after stable transfection of a plasmid carrying the luciferase  gene controlled by the IFN-inducible 6-16 promoter.
Cells were treated for 6 h  with increasing doses of IFN and were lysed.
The luciferase activity was quantified in a luminometer (EG&E Berthold) as described previously (27).
The  experiment was performed in replicates for each concentration.
  Spotted oligonucleotide microarray experiments.
Poly-L-lysine-coated glass  microarrays containing 18,000 different probes (human oligonucleotide set;  Compugen) were purchased from the Center for Applied Genomics, New Jersey.
  The microarrays were probed with a mixture consisting of cyanine 3 (Cy3)- or  Cy5-labeled cDNAs, representing IFN treatment versus no treatment (control).
  RNAs (100 g) extracted from WISH cells (RNeasy Midi kit; QIAGEN) following IFN treatment or no treatment as a control were subjected to reverse  transcription (Moloney murine leukemia virus H-minus point mutant reverse  transcriptase enzyme; Promega) with aminoallyl-modified dUTP nucleotide  (aa-dUTP; Ambion) at a 4:1 aa-dUTP-to-dTTP ratio.
The cDNAs were labeled  with an N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent probe (Amersham)  through aa-dUTP.
Labeled cDNAs from treatment and control cells were mixed  with equivalent amounts of fluorescent dye (100 pmol each) in 2 SSC (1 SSC  is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate), 0.08% SDS, 6 l of blocking  solution (Amersham), and water to 100 l.
This target mixture was denatured at  95C for 3 min, chilled, and applied between a raised coverslip (LifterSlip; Erie  Scientific Company) and the array.
The slide was then sealed in a microarray  hybridization chamber and submerged in a darkened water bath set at 55C for  hybridization.
After 12 h, the slide was washed for 5 minutes in 2 SSC0.5%  SDS at 55C, 5 minutes in 0.5 SSC at room temperature, and 5 minutes in  0.05 SSC at room temperature.
It was then quickly dried by spinning for 3 min  at 1,000 rpm and stored in the dark until scanned.
Each condition (IFN treatment) was represented by two dye-swap microarray replicates.
  Microarray image and data analysis.
Scanning of the hybridized microarrays  was performed with a DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies), which  excites the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores at 532 nm and 635 nm, respectively, with  a spatial resolution of 10 m.
Automatic spot detection and green and red  fluorescent signal quantitation for each spot were done with SpotReader software (Niles Scientific).
Automatic background subtraction, data normalization,  processing (e.g., log transformation of ratios), filtering, and cluster analysis were  done with GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics).
To correct for possible differences in input RNA concentrations and in the Cy3 and Cy5 labeling efficiencies, the treatment signal was normalized to that of the control channel, using the  ratio of the total signal from both channels (Loess normalization) per subarray  (12-by-4 separated blocks in the array) to also account for spotting pin variations.
  The ratio between the normalized and control signals was taken as the level of  gene induction.
Data were filtered using SpotReader output flags, an indication  of the quality of the spot, and by the distance between replicates for each gene.
  The starting list of IFN-modulated genes was composed of genes whose expression was beyond a 1.7-fold threshold under at least two conditions, tolerating  only one absent (A) flag (GeneSpring translation of SportReader flagging),  indicative of a noisy spot, under all conditions per given gene.
This criterion  was chosen after the realization that genuine up- or down-regulation was always  observed for more than one IFN treatment, so choosing two conditions was a  minimum.
A low-stringency threshold was necessary to include IFN-stimulated  genes (ISGs) modified at relatively low levels.
This gene subset was exported into  an Excel worksheet, together with the mean treatment-to-control ratio value, the  individual replicate values, the t test P value, which is an estimate of the microarray technical error based on the distance between replicates, and the flag  codes.
Genes were then screened for significance by comparing the distances  between replicates and between conditions and also considering P values and  flags.
This manual analysis was necessary because statistical selection by analysis  of variance left out clearly IFN-modified genes, i.e., gave false-negative results,  because of the small number of replicates per condition.
Mean values beyond the  1.7-fold threshold but having one replicate below this threshold, with no other  conditions with similar and significant levels, were considered products of technical noise.
Genes with no significant up-/down-regulation under any condition  were excluded.
Cluster analysis was done on the final list after importing it back  into GeneSpring.
  RESULTS  Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the IFNAR1 binding interface on IFN-2 suggested that this weak protein-protein  interaction (KD  1.5 to 5 M) (24, 40) lacks binding hotspots.
  However, three mutations were found to increase binding twoto fourfold (40).
For this study, these three IFN-2 mutations  (H57A, E58A, and Q61A) were combined to create a triple  1890 JAITIN ET AL.

   on March 11, 2015 by MAHIDOL UNIV FAC OF MED http://mcb.asm.org/ Downloaded from IFN-2 mutant protein, hereafter termed the HEQ mutant  (Fig. 1A, red patch).
The mutated residues are spatially adjacent and are located next to the six residues found to impair  IFNAR1 binding upon mutation (Fig. 1A, blue patch).
The  HEQ mutant residues are located opposite the modeled binding site for IFNAR2.
  Ternary complex stability is enhanced by the HEQ mutant  compared to that induced by IFN-2.
First, we characterized  the biophysical properties of the HEQ mutant.
The binding of  IFNs to IFNAR1-EC or the formation of the ternary complex  including IFNAR1-EC and IFNAR2-EC was studied by  TIRFS.
IFNAR1-EC and/or IFNAR2-EC was tethered to solidly supported lipid bilayers (Fig. 1C).
The dissociation kinetics  of the binary complexes of wild-type (wt) IFN-2, the HEQ  mutant, and IFN- from IFNAR1-EC alone are compared in  Fig. 1D.
A 30-fold increase in complex lifetime (kd) was observed for the HEQ mutant and IFN- compared to IFN-2  (Table 1).
In contrast, very similar association rate constants  (ka) were obtained for all three species.
From these data, an  equilibrium dissociation constant of 150 nM was determined  according to the equation KD  kd/ka for the HEQ mutant/  IFNAR1-EC complex.
This can be compared to the KD of 5  M for wt IFN-2 and 100 nM for IFN-.
The binding affinity  of the HEQ mutant for IFNAR2-EC is similar to that measured for wt IFN-2 (5 nM), which is about 10-fold weaker  than that of IFN- (Table 1).
Thus, only the affinity of the  HEQ mutant towards IFNAR1, and not that towards IFNAR2,  is similar to that measured for IFN-.
  IFN induces biological activity by the formation of a ternary  complex (IFNAR1-IFN-IFNAR2) in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry (3).
  Because of cooperative binding to the two surface-bound  receptor subunits, the apparent ligand binding affinity for the  ternary complex is higher than binding to either receptor alone  and depends on the relative and absolute receptor surface  concentrations (18, 25).
The increased stability of the ternary  complex was probed by measuring the IFN dissociation kinetics.
The dissociation of IFN-2, the HEQ mutant, and IFN-  was measured at different concentrations of IFNAR1-EC and  IFNAR2-EC at stoichiometric ratios (Fig. 1E to G).
Since we  intended to compare the effects of the affinities of IFNs towards IFNAR1 on binding to the ternary complex, we used the  I47A mutant of IFNAR2 for IFN- measurements.
The dissociation rate constant of IFN- towards I47A IFNAR2 is  exactly that of IFN-2 towards wt IFNAR2 (Table 1).
While  for IFN-2 the dissociation kinetics strongly depends on the  receptor surface concentration (Fig. 1E), overlaying slow dissociation curves were observed for IFN- and the HEQ mutant (Fig. 1F and G), demonstrating the higher efficiency of  IFNAR1-EC recruitment to the ternary complex by IFN- and  the HEQ mutant.
The concentration-dependent dissociation  of wt IFN-2 suggests that at sufficiently high receptor concentrations, it would dissociate as slowly as IFN- or the HEQ  mutant.
Thus, the efficiency of ternary complex formation is a  combined function of surface receptor concentrations and  binding affinities towards the individual receptors.
  Down-regulation of IFNAR receptors upon IFN induction.
It  was shown previously that the level of surface expression of  the IFNAR1 receptor is down-regulated upon the addition of  IFN-2 (16, 23) and that the receptor complex formed by  IFN- is more stable than that formed by IFN- (45).
For this  study, we measured the relative levels of expression of both the  IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 receptor components upon treatment  of 293T cells with 1 nM wt IFN-2, HEQ mutant IFN, or  FIG. 2.
IFN-induced down-regulation of IFNAR surface receptors.
  293T cells were treated with 1 nM of wt IFN-2, the HEQ mutant, or  IFN- for 2 h. Cell surface levels of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 were  quantified by FACS analysis using AA3 and D5 MAbs, respectively.

  VOL. 26, 2006 IFN-2 MUTANT FUNCTIONALLY SIMILAR TO IFN- 1891   on March 11, 2015 by MAHIDOL UNIV FAC OF MED http://mcb.asm.org/ Downloaded from IFN- for 2 h. The level of IFNAR1 surface expression was  reduced approximately twofold under these conditions for all  three IFNs (Fig. 2, top panel).
In contrast, IFNAR2 levels were  reduced only by the addition of IFN- or the HEQ mutant but  not by wt IFN-2 (Fig. 2, bottom panel).
This result suggests  that down-regulation of IFNAR2 is due to the increased stability of the ternary complex.
  Antiviral and antiproliferative potencies.
Antiviral and antiproliferative activities of interferons were measured with  WISH cells (Fig. 3).
Again, the HEQ mutant activity profile  was comparable to that of IFN-.
Despite the large increase in  binding affinity of the HEQ mutant towards IFNAR1, its antiviral potency was only twofold higher than that of wild-type  IFN-2.
In contrast, the HEQ mutants antiproliferative activity was increased  25-fold, which was comparable to the 42-  fold increase for IFN- (Table 2).
The increased antiproliferative activities correlated with the increased affinities of these  two IFNs towards IFNAR1.
In addition, we found that the  slope (s) in equation 1 was significantly steeper for IFN- than  for either IFN-2 or the HEQ mutant (Fig. 3B and Table 2).
  Moreover, the recorded cell density using IFN- was much  lower than that with IFN-2 or the HEQ mutant, even at the  highest concentrations (Fig. 3B; note the difference in minimal  absorbance values).
The differences in slope and cell density  relate to different rates of activation of the antiproliferative  response, which is the only aspect in which the HEQ mutant  behaves like wt IFN-2 and is distinguished from IFN-.
  Expression regulation of 6-16 promoter.
One of the more  prominent IFN-stimulated response element-driven inducible  genes is the abundantly expressed 6-16 mRNA, which has been  classically used as a marker for STAT1 and STAT2 activation  by type I IFNs, which, together with IRF9, will form the ISGF3  transcription factor (30).
For this study, we treated HL116 cells  (HT1080 cells expressing the luciferase gene controlled by the  6-16 promoter) with wt IFN-2, the HEQ mutant, or IFN- for  6 h and then measured the luciferase activity.
The level of  activity was expressed relative to that in untreated cells (0%) or  cells treated with an excess of IFN (100%).
Fifty percent activity was achieved by adding a 4 pM concentration of either  the HEQ mutant or IFN- or 10 pM wt IFN-2 (Fig. 4).
This  difference in the midpoint of activation of the 6-16 promoter  was in line with the difference in antiviral potencies between  these IFNs but much below the difference in antiproliferative  activities.
  The HEQ mutant induces an ISG expression profile similar  to that of IFN-.
Gene microarray technology has been used  for monitoring ISG expression (11, 12, 21, 26).
For this study,  the effects of IFNs on gene expression were monitored by  FIG.

WISH cells  were incubated for 16 h with 0.3 nM IFN-2 (1,000 antiviral  units [IU]/ml), 3 nM IFN-2, 0.3 nM HEQ mutant, or 0.15 nM  IFN- (1,000 IU/ml).
The last three promoted 90% antiproliferative responses in WISH cells, while for 0.3 nM wt IFN-2  the antiproliferative response was below 10% (Fig. 3B), allowing a correlation between biological response and gene activation profiles.
Each condition was represented by two dye-swap  experiments of IFN treatment versus no treatment.
In addition, four replicates of microarray experiments consisting of no  treatment versus no treatment were used as controls.
The ratio  between the normalized and control signals was taken as the  level of gene induction.
The modified gene subset, defined by  a 1.7-fold threshold in at least two different IFN treatments  (for details, see Materials and Methods), was composed of 395  expression-modulated genes (data available on request).
In  Fig. 5A, the IFN-induced expression levels of these genes were  plotted in ascending order according to their relative expression.
The black dots represent the ratios between the two  channels on the control chip, which provide an estimate of the  random fluctuation; the low levels of random fluctuation in the  control experiment (0.65- to 1.6-fold) provide a high degree of  confidence in the quality of the data.
  In general, the gene expression levels for IFN- and the  HEQ mutant were similar (Fig. 5A), while those for wt IFN-2  (0.3 nM) were significantly lower.
Applying 3 nM wt IFN-2  gave intermediate levels of gene expression.
Figure 5B shows  the levels of induction of all IFN-induced genes plotted relative to the levels of induction upon treatment with IFN-.
The  genes were sorted in ascending order according to the ratios of  expression induced by IFN- to that induced by 0.3 nM IFN-2  (IFN-/0.3 nM IFN-2 ratios).
The figure shows that on a  per-gene basis, the variation in expression levels between  IFN- and the HEQ mutant was similar to the random noise,  as determined from the control (0.65- to 1.6-fold change).
  Also, comparing the relative expression levels induced by 0.3  and 3 nM wt IFN-2 showed that while the levels were higher  for the latter, the same set of differentially induced genes for 3  nM IFN-2 was also differentially induced by 0.3 nM IFN-2,  albeit to a lesser extent.
Cluster analysis of the gene activation  profiles was done with GeneSpring analysis software.
Figure  5C shows that the gene expression profiles for IFN- and the  HEQ mutant are the closest, followed by that for treatment  with 3 nM wt IFN-2.
Again, the gene expression profile for  0.3 nM wt IFN-2 is farther away.
The gene expression profiling results are in excellent agreement with the differential  biological activities observed for IFN- and IFN-2, also demonstrating that the HEQ mutant is an IFN-2 with characteristics of IFN-.
  Table 3 lists a group of genes selected from the total data  (data available on request) according to their differential levels  of activation or functional impact.
The functional classification  in Table 3 results from the manual integration of gene ontology (data available on request) gene functions found at the  GeneCards database (http://www.genecards.org/index.shtml)  and through NCBI.
The expression of most known ISGs was  affected by all IFN treatments.
However, 927 (IFITM1), a  well-defined ISG, was not induced by any of the IFN conditions.
This can be explained by a cell-type-specific IFN responsiveness, rather than technical error, resulting in a low signalto-noise ratio in all eight IFN microarray experiments.
  The effects of IFN- and the HEQ mutant on the expression  of most of the genes were much stronger than the effects  induced by IFN-2 at equivalent antiviral units.
This trend was  also observed at other time points (unpublished data).
For a  few interesting exceptions, namely, IFIT4 and IFI35, upregulation by 0.3 nM IFN-2 was consistently lower than that by  IFN- and the HEQ mutant.
The stronger IFN- effect on cell  growth can be correlated with the earlier induction/repression  of many genes involved in proliferation or apoptosis (e.g.,  repression of the apoptosis inhibitor DAD1 and ornithine decarboxylase [ODC1], a gene involved in cell growth and proliferation control whose overexpression was linked to tumor  progression).
In addition, nine histone genes were up-regulated, and two were down-regulated (unpublished data), which  might correlate with changes in genomic DNA structure during  cell growth inhibition or apoptosis.
Still, not a single gene was  found which was strongly up- or down-regulated by either the  HEQ mutant or IFN- but not regulated by wt IFN-2.
For  example, the MX1 gene was up-regulated 60-fold by IFN-  and the HEQ mutant, but only 6- and 16-fold by 0.3 nM and 3  nM wt IFN-2.
The TLR3 gene was up-regulated 7.7-fold by  IFN- and 6.1-fold by the HEQ mutant, but only 1.3- and  2.5-fold by 0.3 nM and 3 nM wt IFN-2.
  DISCUSSION  The question of whether IFNs have differential activities has  been asked repeatedly since the different IFN genes have been  discovered.
Most of the attention has gone toward investigating  whether the response to IFN- is different from that induced by  IFN- (1, 7, 11, 15, 17).
At the level of receptor recruitment, a  prominent feature of IFN- compared to IFN-2 is an  50-fold  higher affinity towards IFNAR1 (18).
For this study, we have  FIG. 4.
Expression regulation of the 6-16 promoter upon IFN induction.
HL116 cells (HT1080 cell line expressing the luciferase gene  controlled by the 6-16 promoter) were treated with wt IFN-2 (open  circles), the HEQ mutant (filled circles), or IFN- (open squares) for  6 h. The luciferase activities are expressed relative to that in untreated  cells (0%) or cells treated with an excess of IFN (100%).
  VOL. 26, 2006 IFN-2 MUTANT FUNCTIONALLY SIMILAR TO IFN- 1893   on March 11, 2015 by MAHIDOL UNIV FAC OF MED http://mcb.asm.org/ Downloaded from engineered an IFN-2 triple mutant (with H57A, E58A, and  Q61A mutations) that binds IFNAR1 30-fold tighter than the  wild-type protein.
Thus, the binding affinity of the HEQ mutant  for IFNAR1 is about equal to that of IFN-, although its binding  affinity for IFNAR2 is 10-fold lower.
Strikingly, the HEQ mutant  exhibits several functional characteristics of IFN-, including (i)  substantially increased antiproliferative but only slightly changed  antiviral activity and ISGF3 formation; (ii) ligand-induced downregulation of IFNAR2 cell surface expression; and (iii) similar  patterns of gene activation for the HEQ mutant and IFN-.
Our  study clearly demonstrates that important functional differences  between IFN- and wt IFN-2 are due to their different affinities  for IFNAR1.
A higher affinity for IFNAR1 increases the apparent binding affinity of the cellular receptor, but furthermore, it has  the following consequences on ternary complex stability: (i) more  efficient recruitment of IFNAR1 and (ii) a longer lifetime of the  ternary complex, as seen in our biophysical studies (Fig. 1).
The  fact that differential signal activation of IFNs apparently depends  on receptor cell surface concentrations and can be compensated  for by the ligand concentration suggests that the affinity towards  IFNAR1 can limit ternary complex formation, which leads to  higher potencies of IFN- and the HEQ mutant than that of  IFN-2.
Interestingly, differential recruitment of IFNAR1 affects  the antiproliferative response much more strongly than the antiviral response, leading to differential response patterns at low  ligand concentrations.
Thus, the signal transduction pathways required for antiproliferative activity make use of a stable ternary  complex, while ISGF3 formation requires only a transient receptor complex.
Studying effector recruitment in vivo will be required  for elucidating the molecular basis of these differences, and the  FIG. 5.
Effects of IFN on gene expression, as monitored by spotted oligonucleotide microarray experiments.
We compared the expression  profiles of four conditions consisting of WISH cells incubated for 16 h with 0.3 nM wt IFN-2, 3 nM wt IFN-2, 0.3 nM HEQ mutant, and 0.15  nM IFN-.
Each profile represents an experiment with IFN treatment versus no treatment with dye-swap microarray duplicates.
In addition, a  control expression profile was obtained from the ratio of both channels for untreated cells.

  VOL. 26, 2006 IFN-2 MUTANT FUNCTIONALLY SIMILAR TO IFN- 1895   on March 11, 2015 by MAHIDOL UNIV FAC OF MED http://mcb.asm.org/ Downloaded from HEQ mutant will be a powerful tool for such studies.
Furthermore, our results confirm previous reports that the differential  activity of IFN- (and also the HEQ mutant) is not qualitative but  can only be observed at specific ligand concentrations.
This was  observed for both biological activities and gene induction patterns.
  The HEQ mutant boosts binding affinity and biological activity, similar to IFN-.
In a previous study, we analyzed separately the three IFN-2 mutations that comprise the mutations in the HEQ mutant (40).
The individual mutations  increased binding to IFNAR1 and biological activity two- to  fivefold.
For the H57A and Q61A mutants, which had twofold  increased binding, a similar increase in biological activity was  observed.
However, for the E58A mutant, which had a fivefold  increase in affinity for IFNAR1, some differential increase in  antiproliferative over antiviral activity was observed (3.3- versus 5.4-fold).
Taken together with the HEQ mutant data presented here, this suggests a clear maximum for increased antiviral activity stemming from increased IFNAR1 binding.
  Two additional observations are important for understanding the mechanisms of IFN activation.
One is that in our  experimental system, some IFN-induced activities are not differentiated between IFN-2 and IFN-, while others are.
The  second is that different IFN concentrations activate the antiviral versus the antiproliferative response in WISH cells (picomolar versus nanomolar concentrations), albeit for IFN-2 the  difference is 1,000-fold, whereas for IFN- or the HEQ mutant  the difference is only 50-fold.
In Daudi cells, low concentrations of IFNs (pM) already cause growth arrest, which may be  linked to higher levels of the interferon receptors on the surfaces of Daudi cells than on WISH cells (6).
A recent report  has suggested that tumor cells have a reduced level of interferon receptors, making them resistant to the antiproliferative  activity of IFNs (49).
Thus, it seems that interferon receptor  concentrations affect the biological activities of IFNs.
This  model would nicely explain the IFN--specific activity in a  Tyk2-deficient background which results in a reduced number  of IFNAR1 receptors on the cell surface (38).
Figure 1 clearly  shows that at low IFNAR1 concentrations, the ternary complex  is formed only with the HEQ mutant and IFN-, which bind  IFNAR1 tightly, and not with IFN-2.
Indeed, the native, low  receptor surface concentrations have been suggested to limit  ternary complex formation (50).
  Surprisingly, the three mutated residues of the HEQ mutant  are fully conserved between all IFN- subtypes.
Since these  mutations cause an increase in antiproliferative activity but  only a small change in antiviral potency, one may conclude that  IFN- subtypes are not optimized to promote strong antiproliferative activity.
This conclusion is supported by the similar  binding affinities and biological activities found for IFN-2 and  four other alpha interferon subtypes (alpha1, alpha 8, alpha16,  and alpha21) (J. Piehler and G. Uze, unpublished data).
This  should not be surprising, as the foremost activity of IFN- is to  induce an antiviral state, whereas IFN-, which is specifically  induced in response to nonviral inducers such as Toll-like  receptor stimulation (4), is most likely to be involved in subtle  regulations of cellular differentiation of the monocyte lineage  (5, 46) that could be reflected by the antiproliferative activity  on cell lines.
Of course, for a drug against a disease such as  cancer, an increased antiproliferative activity of IFN would be  desired.
Our data suggest that by further increasing the affinity of  IFN for IFNAR1, such an increased activity could be achieved,  even in cancer cells that have lost their responsiveness to IFNs by  receptor down-regulation (49).
  Our proposed mechanistic model for the establishment of  differential IFN effects might be similar to other signaling  systems.
For example, a viral mimic of interleukin-10 (vIL-10)  has been identified, which confers only a subset of activities  found for IL-10 (28).
In this case, differential signal activation  by vIL-10 was not due to the structure of the complex, which is  similar, but was ascribed to the  200-fold lower affinity toward  IL-10 receptor 1 (IL-10R1) (51).
Indeed, a single mutation of  vIL-10 increasing the affinity toward IL-10R1 was able to recover IL-10-like activities (13).
Strikingly, the activity of vIL-10  also critically depends on the cell surface concentration of  IL-10R1 (14), confirming the key role of binding affinities for  receptor recruitment to the plasma membrane.
A second example of differential activation would be the activities of insulin and insulin-like growth factor.
It was shown that, depending  on their concentrations, insulin and insulin-like growth factor  can bind to either their homologous or heterologous receptors  and trigger different biological responses, which also depend  on the surface receptor concentration (10, 47).
  A more unified model of signal transduction promoted by  IFN emerges from our results: we suggest that differential  activation is a function of surface receptor concentrations and  of binding affinities towards individual receptors.
The assumption made in previous reports that the uniqueness of IFN- is  a consequence of structural differences in the receptor complex or that IFN- binds additional factors (15, 27) does not fit  with the results obtained with the HEQ mutant.
In light of our  findings, it was interesting to reanalyze the work of Runkel et  al. (44) describing the loss of IFN--specific activities for mutants with mutations at positions 86 and 92.
These mutations,  which are located at the IFNAR1 binding site on interferon  (20, 40, 43), apparently reduce the binding affinity for IFNAR1,  and hence it is not surprising that the mutants now have the  characteristics of IFN-.
Our data also demonstrate that the  binding affinity towards IFNAR1 is directly related to the antiproliferative activity of IFN.
The gene activation pattern also  suggests a linear response to the IFN concentration and binding affinity.
All genes upregulated by the HEQ mutant or IFN-  are also upregulated by wt IFN-2, although at higher ligand  concentrations.
All of these observations support a relatively  simple mechanism of induction of differential responses by  differential recruitment of IFNAR1, which is a limiting factor  in ternary complex formation.
The next stage of study is to  elucidate which signaling pathways are sensitive to differential  IFNAR1 recruitment and how this is converted into complex  biological responses.
