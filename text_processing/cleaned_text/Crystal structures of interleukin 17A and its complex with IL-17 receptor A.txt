ARTICLE  Received 1 Nov 2012 | Accepted 12 Apr 2013 | Published 21 May 2013  Crystal structures of interleukin 17A and its  complex with IL-17 receptor A  Shenping Liu1  , Xi Song1  , Boris A. Chrunyk1  , Suman Shanker1  , Lise R. Hoth1  , Eric S. Marr1 & Matthew C. Griffor1  The constituent polypeptides of the interleukin-17 family form six different homodimeric  cytokines (IL-17AF) and the heterodimeric IL-17A/F. Their interactions with IL-17 receptors  AE (IL-17RAE) mediate host defenses while also contributing to inflammatory and autoimmune responses.
IL-17A and IL-17F both preferentially engage a receptor complex containing one molecule of IL-17RA and one molecule of IL-17RC.
More generally, IL-17RA  appears to be a shared receptor that pairs with other members of its family to allow signaling  of different IL-17 cytokines.
Here we report crystal structures of homodimeric IL-17A and its  complex with IL-17RA.
Binding to IL-17RA at one side of the IL-17A molecule induces a  conformational change in the second, symmetry-related receptor site of IL-17A.
This change  favors, and is sufficient to account for, the selection of a different receptor polypeptide to  complete the cytokine-receptor complex.
The structural results are supported by biophysical  studies with IL-17A variants produced by site-directed mutagenesis.

Cytokines of the interleukin-17 family promote the  maintenance of both adaptive and innate immunity111.
  Dysregulation of their production may contribute to  inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid  arthritis, psoriasis and asthma1,2,1214.
As such, they are attractive  targets for therapeutic interventions1518.
  The IL-17 cytokines are dimeric proteins: six homodimeric  forms are designated IL-17A through IL-17F, and heterodimeric  IL-17A/F is also known19,20.
Five receptor polypeptides are  named IL-17RA through IL-17RE.
  Convincing evidence shows that IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17A/F  require a heterodimeric receptor complex comprising IL-17RA  and IL-17RC for signaling1925.
More generally, IL-17RA is  shown to be a shared receptor for other IL-17 cytokines, with  different receptor chains joining it in complex with the  cytokines2,3,8,22,23,2630.
IL-17RA has high affinity for IL-17A,  B100-fold weaker affinity for IL-17F, and an intermediate  affinity for the IL-17A/F heterodimer1922.
It has much weaker  affinities for IL-17B, C, D and E2,7,8,22,2628,31.
  In keeping with the general picture of how a cytokine is  recognized by two different receptors (for example, IL-4 by IL4Ra and gc)32, the interaction between an IL-17 and its primary  receptor displays sufficiently high affinity to permit binding when  the cytokine at physiological concentrations can diffuse freely  relative to the membrane-bound receptor2,3,8,22,23,2630, while a  secondary receptor can be bound with more moderate affinity  suited to an interaction that takes place in the two-dimensional  space of the membrane2,7,8,22,26,27,28,31.
The intermediate  complex formed by an IL-17 and its primary receptor  determines the exact binding surface presented to the secondary  receptor.
For IL-17 dimers, measured affinities indicate that this  new binding surface must disfavor binding of the primary  receptor, while creating features that favor binding of the  secondary receptor.
Overall, defining the structural features of  intermediate and complete IL-17 complexes is a key to  rationalizing the specificity inherent to the system as a  whole1,11,33.
  Crystal structures are available for free IL-17F21, for IL-17A in  complex with an antibody34, and for an IL-17F/IL-17RA  complex22.
In all these structures, the homodimeric cytokine  displayed a cystine-knot fold with two intramolecular disulfides  similar to that of nerve growth factor35.
However, the important  N-terminal region of IL-17A was disordered in the structure of  the antibody complex34, and we demonstrate in this report that  the mechanism by which the IL-17F/IL-17RA complex was  suggested to disfavor binding of a second IL-17RA22 is not  supported by new structural data presented herein.
In addition, as  IL-17RC is the high affinity receptor for IL-17F20,22,25, the IL17F/IL-17RA complex may not be the physiologically relevant  intermediate complex of IL-17F.
Nevertheless, the IL-17F/IL17RA structure has given the first direct insight into the mode of  binding, showing that the receptor binds the cytokine by engaging  both its polypeptide subunits at their interface.
More structures of  IL-17 and detailed analysis have been needed, and we report  herein two new structures that add greater detail to our  understanding of how IL-17 and its receptors recognize each  other.
  The first structure reported here is that of a free IL-17A  homodimer in which the N terminus is more completely defined  than in the previously solved antibody complex.
The newly  defined elements contribute to the structural integrity of the free  homodimer.
In the second structure, which is that of an IL-17A/  IL-17RA intermediate complex, it becomes apparent that through  an allosteric mechanism, conformational shifts in the same  N-terminal elements strongly disfavor binding of a second  molecule of IL-17RA.
Similar allosteric effects appear to explain  why IL-17F bound to one molecule of IL-17RA exhibits much  weaker affinity for a second IL-17RA polypeptide.
Supported by  mutagenesis studies, our structures also provide a structural  rationale for differences between the respective affinities of IL17RA for different IL-17 cytokines.
  Results  Generating suitable protein reagents for crystallizations.
  Purification and crystallization of IL-17A (UniProtKB accession  code Q16552) expressed in mammalian or insect cells can be  complicated by heterogeneous post-translational protein  modifications7,19,20,21,34,36.
To avoid these problems, we expressed  a recombinant IL-17A that lacked the first 10 N-terminal residues  of the mature cytokine, and had two further mutations; these were  N45D, to suppress N-glycosylation at the single canonical site,  and C106S, to eliminate the free thiol group predicted to be  exposed by elimination of its disulfide partner at C10.
A construct  encoding a precursor to this protein was expressed with good  yield in mammalian cells, fully processed and secreted as the  desired homodimeric product, and purified by standard methods.
  In surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, its affinity  (Kd  7 nM) for IL-17RA ECD was in the same range as that of  recombinant wild-type IL-17A (Kd  1.3 nM).
It crystallized  readily.
  The amino-acid sequence of IL-17RA (UniProtKB accession  code Q96F46) includes seven canonical sites for N-glycosylation.
  After it was found that a recombinant form of the protein  expressed in insect cells was multiply glycosylated, two of the sites  were mutated (N175D and N234D) and deglycosylation of IL17RA at the remaining five sites was attempted using  N-glycosidase F. LC-MS peptide mapping showed that N36 and  N211 were successfully deglycosylated, but N18, N23 and N194  resisted complete deglycosylation.
Mass spectrometry of  N-glycopeptides in tryptic digests indicated that fucosylated  oligomannose-3 glycans accounted for the great majority of  sugar groups.
  Deglycosylated IL-17RA double mutant had essentially the  same affinity for IL-17A as recombinant wild-type IL-17RA  (Kd  1.9 nM versus 1.3 nM), and was free of aggregation.
Using  immobilized biotinylated IL-17A, only one binding event  was observed in SPR between either the wild-type or mutant IL17A and either wild-type or mutant IL-17RA, for concentrations  of IL-17RA up to 150 nM. The IL-17A/IL-17RA complex sample  used for crystallization ran in size-exclusion chromatography as a  complex of IL-17A homodimer bound to a single IL-17RA  molecule, even with total protein concentrations up to 9 mg ml  1.
  Structure determination of IL-17A and its complex with IL17RA.
Crystals of IL-17A diffract to 2.48 , and contain one IL17A dimer in the asymmetric unit.
The structure was determined  by the molecular replacement method, and refined well without  any Ramachandran outliers (Table 1).
  The IL-17A/IL-17RA complex crystals diffracted anisotropically to 2.9  along the c* axis and 3.3  in the perpendicular  directions (Table 1).
The IL-17A/IL-17RA complex crystal  structure was also determined by molecular replacement.
The  asymmetric unit of the complex crystal contains two copies of the  IL-17A/IL-17RA 2:1 complex.
In general, complex 1 (chains A, B  and C) is more ordered than complex 2 (chains D, E and F).
  IL-17RA in complex 1 (chain C) can be modeled from residues  2273 (numbering starts with the mature receptor), and residues  2272 (chain F) are visible in the electron density in complex 2  (Supplementary Fig. S1 illustrates electron density quality).
All  the predicted disulfide bonds in IL-17RA ECD can be built in  both complexes.
Electron densities for the remaining glycans were  ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms2880  2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 4:1888 | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms2880 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications  & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
All rights reserved.observed at N18, N23 and N194 of both IL-17RA molecules.
In  the following discussion, we concentrate mostly on complex 1 for  structural analysis.
  Owing to poor electron densities in some areas, the final  refined IL-17A/IL-17RA complex model has a few Ramachandran outliers (Table 1).
These outliers (residues 40 and 103105  of IL-17A chains B and E) are located at the 01 and 34 loops of  IL-17A (see below for structure descriptions).
  Unbound IL-17A homodimer is highly symmetric.
Two IL-17A  monomers form a parallel dimer, and they are highly similar  (Fig. 1a).
The root mean square deviation (rmsd) from all Ca  atom pairs in the dimer is 0.36 , and almost all side chains can  be superimposed very well.
  Each IL-17A monomer contains a pair of anti-parallel b-sheets,  one built from strands 1 and 2 and the second from strands 3 and  4 (Fig. 1a).
The overall structure adopts a cystine-knot fold35.
  Consistent with the flexibility observed in the N terminus of  antibody-bound IL-17A, each constituent monomer of the  unbound IL-17A is disordered at the N terminus up to residue  18 and in the long connecting peptides 2942.
The two isolated  peptides 1928 form anti-parallel b-strands (strands 0); each runs  parallel with strand 4 of the other monomer (Fig. 1a).
  Connections between strands 0 and the rest of the molecules  are deduced from the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex structure  discussed below, and are consistent with those of the unbound  IL-17F structure.
The C-terminal peptides 127132 of IL-17A are  disordered in both monomers.
  The N-terminal region of the unbound IL-17A dimer is less  compact than its C-terminal region.
Except for those involving  strands 0, interchain interactions concentrate in its C-terminal  region (Fig. 1b).
The C-terminal region of the IL-17A is further  rigidified by the presence of two intrachain disulfides in each  subunit (Fig. 1b).
The importance of strands 0 in the structural  integrity of IL-17A dimer is supported by the failure of constructs  lacking this sequence element to express properly in mammalian  cells.
Therefore, even though the N terminus of IL-17A is  certainly more flexible than the C terminus, the interactions  involving strands 0 appear to be essential contributors to  maintaining a stable molecule.

All rights reserved.Comparison of the new structure for unbound IL-17A dimer  with that of its antibody complex finds great similarity between  the two (rmsd of 0.89  for 110 out of 147 pairs of Ca atoms).
  However, strands 0, parts of strands 3 and 4, and loop 34 are  disordered in the antibody-bound IL-17A dimer (Fig. 1c).
These  peptides are well defined in the new structure, and they will be  shown below to form the region that disfavors binding of a  second IL-17RA molecule.
Antibody-bound IL-17A was also very  symmetric, with rmsd of 0.53  for all Ca atoms in the dimer.
  The structural match between the unbound IL-17A and IL-17F  is better for the respective C-terminal regions than for the N  termini (rmsd of 0.66  for 88 out of 166 pairs of Ca atoms in the  dimer) (Fig. 1d).
However, all b strands (04) are preserved  between IL-17A and IL-17F.
The unbound IL-17F dimer is also  highly symmetric (rmsd of 0.43  from 110 out of 121 pairs of Ca  atoms in each monomer), but two-fold symmetry breaks down at  peptides 1422 and 106107, including the C17C107 interchain  disulfide, with deviations up to 3.5 .  Overall structure of the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex.
As reported,  the IL-17RA ECD contains two type III fibronectin domains, D1  and D222.
The D1 domain of IL-17RA interacts with both chain  A and chain B of IL-17A.
IL-17RA D2 interacts mainly with IL17A chain A (Fig. 2a).
  The two IL-17A/IL-17RA complexes in the asymmetric unit  have very similar overall structures, and all the Ca atom in the  two complexes can be superimposed (rmsd value of 0.52 ).
They  are also very similar to the IL-17F/IL17RA complex (Fig. 2a), with  rmsd values of 1.1  and 0.89  when the maximum matching  distances were set at 3.5  and 1.9 , respectively, in  superimpositions (455 and 412 pairs of Ca atoms out of 469 in  total, respectively).
Based on these statistics, the maximum  matching distance is set at 1.2  in all the following conformation  analysis and modeling, to minimize inaccuracy in transformation  matrix.
  The strands 0 and loops 01 and 34 in the cytokines, and  loops A-B and D-F in IL-17RA domain D2 deviate significantly  between the IL-17A/IL-17RA and IL-17F/IL-17RA complexes  (Fig. 2a).
Some of these differences are probably due to variations  in crystal contacts.
For example, the 34 loops of both cytokine  chains in the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex are involved in crystal  contacts, but this is not the case in the IL-17F/IL-17RA complex.
  The AB and DF loops of the IL-17RA D2 domain have  different crystal contacts between IL-17A/IL-17RA and IL-17F/  IL-17RA complexes.
These deviating peptides do not locate at the  binding interface (Fig. 2a).
Other discrepancies are due to the  sequence differences between IL-17A and IL-17F in strand 0 and  loop 01.
  The IL-17RA/IL-17A complex structure was obtained using  deglycosylated IL-17RA double mutant and truncated IL-17A.
In  contrast, the IL-17RA/IL-17F complex structure was obtained  from fully glycosylated IL-17RA and full-length IL-17F with an  intact interchain disulfide bond.
Despite these differences, the two  complexes share high overall similarity, supporting the view that  the mutations and enzymatic deglycosylation do not disrupt IL17RA interactions with IL-17A.
Furthermore, no potential  N-glycosylation site in any component of either the IL-17A/IL17RA or IL-17F/IL-17RA complexes was located at a binding  interface (Fig. 2a).

All rights reserved.are mostly disordered in both complexes.
The interchain disulfide  bond in IL-17F is disordered in its complex with IL-17RA.
  Binding to IL-17RA induces large conformational changes in  the N-terminal region of the IL-17A dimer, but the C-terminal  parts of both chains remain conformationally fixed.
Because of  these conformational changes, only 37 Ca atoms in chain A and  57 in chain B in the C-terminal half of the IL-17A dimer,  superimpose well with the unbound IL-17A dimer (rmsd 0.58 ).
  Relative to the unbound IL-17A, the entire N-terminal half of  chain A bends away from IL-17RA (Fig. 2b).
In chain B, strands  12 bend slightly toward IL-17RA, and the 12 and 34 loops  move away from the A0  A and FG loops of the D1 domain,  respectively (Fig. 2b).
In addition, both strands 0 move  significantly, but maintain their interchain interactions  (Fig. 2b).
IL-17RA binding also displaces the loop 01 in chain  B of IL-17A and makes it almost completely ordered; in contrast,  this loop in chain A remains disordered (Fig. 2b).
  In the IL-17RA complex, the C-terminal peptide 127131 of  IL-17A chain A becomes ordered and forms a parallel b-sheet  with strand G of the IL-17RA D2 domain.
In IL-17A chain B, this  peptide remains disordered (Fig. 2a and b).
  The N-terminal regions of IL-17F also undergo major  conformational changes upon IL-17RA binding (Supplementary  Fig. S2).
Because of these conformational changes, only 71 Ca  atoms in chain A and 59 in chain B (out of 104 in each chain)  superimpose well with the unbound IL-17F dimer (rmsd 0.59 ).
  Conformational changes in the receptor-bound IL-17A allow it  to avoid steric clashes with the A0  A, CC0 and FG loops of the  IL-17RA D1 domain, while also forming several favorable  interactions (Fig. 2b).
Loops A0  A and FG of IL-17RA may  not be able to change conformation easily, being rigidified by  numerous interactions within the IL-17RA molecule, including  the C26C95 disulfide (Fig. 2a and b).
  Specific interactions between IL-17A and IL-17RA.
As the  global conformation of IL-17RA complex with IL-17A or IL-17F  is conserved, side chain interactions are likely to account for  differences in affinities of IL-17RA for different IL-17.
Before the  complex forms, symmetrical IL-17 homodimers have two  equivalent potential IL-17RA binding sites.
In contrast, the IL17A/F heterodimer has two non-equivalent sites.
IL-17RA binds  IL-17A at one such site, interacting extensively with both  monomers to bury a total of B2220 2 of surface area (Fig. 3a).
  Three IL-17RA-binding regions can be designated on the IL17A homodimer: regions i and ii, formed by the N-terminal  region and central b-strands of IL-17A, respectively, and each  contacting the IL-17RA D1 domain; and region iii, where the  C-terminal region of IL-17A contacts the IL-17RA D2 domain  (see Fig. 3a for the overview of mapping of these regions and their  detailed views.
Also see Supplementary Fig. S3 for comparisons of  these binding regions between IL-17A and IL-17F).

All rights reserved.understanding the sequence specificity of IL-17A/IL-17RA  interactions, the interacting residues are highlighted in a sequence  alignment of IL-17 family members (Fig. 3b).
  At region i, the ends of strands 3 and 4, loop 12 and the  beginning of loop 01 in chain B of IL-17A interact with loops  A0  A and FG of IL-17RA (Fig. 3a).
Two major polar interactions, involving R101 of IL-17A and W31 of IL-17RA, are conserved in all IL-17 cytokines at this region (Fig. 3a and b).
There  is also an IL-17A- and IL-17F-specific water-mediated interaction  at this region between S64 of IL-17A (S65 of IL-17F) and K135 of  IL-17RA (Fig. 3a).
An S65L mutant of IL-17F was recently  identified in patients with impaired mucocutaneous IL-17  immunity against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus5.
  Region ii, the major binding interface between IL-17A and IL17RA, contains many specific hydrophilic interactions.
Chain B  of IL-17A contributes strands 1 and 2 and the C terminus of loop  01, and chain A contributes its strands 3 and 4.
The CC0 loop  of the receptor D1 domain forms a majority of the interactions,  with assistance from E127 on strand F (Fig. 3a).
Among the  residues at this region, D42, R55, V65 and W67 are unique to IL17A, and N32, S40, Q94, E95 and L116 are identical between IL17A and IL-17F (Fig. 3b).
  Region iii is mainly formed between the C-terminal region of  IL-17A chain A and the D2 domain of IL-17RA (Fig. 3a).
Among  the residues that interact with IL-17RA, Y85 and H86 are unique  to IL-17A at this site (Fig. 3b).
The C-terminal peptide 127131 in  chain A of both IL-17A and IL-17F forms a parallel b-sheet with  strand G of the receptor (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. S3).
The  sequence in peptide 127131 is mostly conserved between IL-17A  and IL-17F, but is divergent in other IL-17s.
  In summary, the higher affinity of IL-17RA for IL-17A  compared with IL-17F is attributable to multiple interactions  formed with the receptor that favor IL-17A over IL-17F.
These  are from cytokine chain B at region ii and chain A at region iii.
  When IL-17RA binds the IL-17A/F heterodimer at either of the  two sites on the cytokine, it cannot have the favorable interactions  that IL-17A homodimer achieves at both regions ii and iii,  explaining the intermediate affinity with the heterodimer.
  Other interactions are common to IL-17A and IL-17F, but  cannot be made by other IL-17 cytokines.
Examples (using IL17A numbering) are S64 at region i, E95 at region ii, and peptide  127131 at region iii.
The lack of these favorable interactions may  weaken the affinities of IL-17B-E for IL-17RA.
  Mutagenesis studies of IL-17A.
The structural basis for the  difference in affinity between IL-17A and IL-17F for IL-17RA  was further probed by site-directed mutagenesis.
IL-17A residues  R55 and W67 at region ii and Y85 and H86 at region iii were  each independently replaced by the corresponding residues in IL17F, and the respective affinities for IL-17RA ECD of the four  resulting IL-17A mutants (R55V, W67V, Y85I and H86S) were  measured by SPR (Fig. 4a).
Each mutation caused a 1.55.0-fold  increase in Kd relative to the recombinant wild-type cytokine  (Fig. 4b).
  Allosteric mechanism governing receptor complex composition.
In some ligand receptor complexes, binding of the first  receptor presents a different high-affinity binding site for the  second, identical receptor37.
This does not happen in the case of  IL-17A and IL-17F.
The puzzle here is why a second IL-17RA  cannot bind symmetrically to the IL-17A or IL-17F dimers, and  achieve the same affinity as the first IL-17RA.
Possible  explanations include steric interference between two IL-17RA  molecules in such a complex22, and/or conformational allosteric  effects induced in the cytokine when it binds the first IL-17RA.

To answer this question, we modeled the binding of a second  IL-17RA molecule to the IL-17RA/IL-17A, using the two-fold  rotational symmetry that relates two IL-17A monomers (Fig. 5).
  We then checked which of the two mechanisms can account for  the selection of IL-17A homodimer against the binding of a  second IL-17RA.
  Contrary to the earlier report22, we saw no steric clashes  between two IL-17RA molecules (Fig. 5, top).
The same modeling  exercise showed that only the C-terminal half of the IL-17A  dimer in IL-17RA complex obeys the native two-fold symmetry  (rmsd 0.46  for 144 Ca pairs), and the N-terminal part of the IL17A dimer deviates significantly (Fig. 5).
This structural  asymmetry is caused by the large and different conformational  changes required in each IL-17A polypeptide for binding to IL17RA (Fig. 2b). Because of this structural asymmetry, region i0  (equivalent of region i for the second IL-17RA) on IL-17A is  deformed and severe steric clashes would occur there if a second  IL-17RA binds (Fig. 5, bottom).
  At region i0  , the A0  A loop of a second IL-17RA D1 would clash  with strands 3 and 4 of IL-17A chain A (Fig. 5, bottom left).
Severe  steric clashes are also observed at strands 0 for a second IL-17RA  (Fig. 5, bottom right).
When the first IL-17RA binds to IL-17A,  these strands can move freely to avoid steric clashes (Fig. 2b).
The  same accommodation for a second IL-17RA is blocked by the first  IL-17RA molecule already bound to IL-17A (Fig. 5, bottom).
  For residues that clash at region i0 (Fig. 5, bottom right), their  symmetry-related mates form region i (Fig. 3a).
None of these  residues are near the glycosylation sites (Fig. 2a), and the  mutations introduced in our samples should have minimal  effects on the deformation of region i0  .
  In the analysis above, only clashes involving residues in  secondary structures of the IL-17A dimer are considered  (Fig. 5).
These secondary structures (strands 0, 3 and 4) should  be preserved (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Clashes involving loops 12  and 34 of IL-17A chain A at region i0 (Fig. 5) might be avoidable  if they could move freely.
Region ii0 and iii0 do not seem to have  any problem with the binding of a second IL-17RA.
  Consideration of the published IL-17F/IL-17RA complex  structure indicates that the same allosteric mechanism also  underpins the weak affinity of this complex for a second IL17RA (Supplementary Fig. S2).
The C-terminal half of the IL-17F  dimer (102 out of 171 pairs of Ca atoms) obeys the two-fold  symmetry (rmsd 0.51 ), and the N-terminal half deviates  significantly.
The single steric clash that appeared in the IL-17F/  IL-17RA structure report (between two H212 side chains)22 could  be due to the inclusion of non-equivalent N-terminal residues in  the IL-17F dimer in the determination of its two-fold symmetry.
  Nevertheless, it could be avoided easily by repositioning the  exposed side chains.

Top: a modeled IL-17RA/IL-17A/IL-17RA complex.
The second  IL-17RA (orange ribbons) is built from the first receptor through two-fold rotation relating the two IL-17A monomers.
Superimposed with its two-fold  rotation-related copy (gray), experimentally observed receptor bound IL-17A shows significant distortions of the two-fold symmetry at the N terminus, but  remains symmetric at the C terminus.
The binding regions on IL-17A for the first and the second IL-17RA are labeled i, ii, and iii, and i0  , i00 and i000 respectively.
  The only close contact between receptor 1 and 2 is at the side chains of H212 (stick model), at a distance of 4.2 . Bottom: zoomed-in views of the clashes  between the second IL-17RA and IL-17A at region i0  .
Bottom right is a more detailed view with side chains of selected clashing residues shown in sticks.
Side  chains in gray indicate the optimal positions for interaction with the second IL-17RA.
For simplicity, clashing residues involving loops 12 and 34 of IL-17A  are not shown, because these loops might move freely.

All rights reserved.the differences in affinity of IL-17RA for different cytokines and  the molecular mechanism on which cytokine bound to one  molecule of receptor has such sharply diminished affinity for a  second receptor molecule of the same type.
  Thirteen residues are found to differ between IL-17A and IL17F at their interfaces with IL-17RA (Fig. 3b), and they may  account for B100-fold higher affinity of IL-17A for the receptor  than IL-17F.
In structure-guided mutagenesis studies, four singlesite mutations in IL-17A that replaced one residue with its IL-17F  equivalent all reduced the affinity of IL-17A for IL-17RA.
These  four substitutions alone will account for B22-fold difference in  affinity between IL-17A and IL-17F for IL-17RA (Fig. 4b and  Supplementary Table S1).
This analysis could have been further  strengthened by mutagenesis experiments demonstrating potential increase in affinity when IL-17F residues are replaced with its  IL-17A equivalents.
  The observations that IL-17RA adopts a conserved conformation in IL-17A and IL-17F complexes (Fig. 2a) and that some  major IL-17RA interacting residues are identical among all IL-17  cytokines (Fig. 3b) support the view of IL-17RA as a shared  receptor for other IL-17 cytokines2,3,8,22,23,2630.
IL-17RA may  serve as a secondary receptor for IL-17B-F once these cytokines  are captured by their primary receptors on the cell surface.
  Contrary to an earlier report22, an allosteric mechanism  explains well why homodimeric IL-17A and IL-17F tend to  disfavor binding of a second molecule of IL-17RA to their  respective IL-17RA complexes.
It remains less clear why IL-17A  and IL-17F also select against two-fold binding of IL-17RC, but  maintain reasonable propensities to co-bind IL-17RC and IL17RA to form complete complexes22.
The crystal structures of  complexes with IL-17RC are needed.
We can speculate that an IL17RC complex, and more generally, other IL-17 receptor  complexes, may use similar allosteric mechanisms to select IL17RA over the same type of receptors.
  Methods  Protein constructs and expression.
For crystallization, a DNA construct of IL17A double mutant (N45D/C106S) was made with the first 10 residues removed  from the mature IL-17A, using standard PCR and QuikChangeII site-directed  mutant genesis kit (Stratagen, CA, USA).
This truncated, double mutant IL-17A  construct was fused to a honeybee mellitin signal sequence and cloned into pCMV  vector.
IL-17A constructs with further truncations (20- and 34 N-terminal residues  removed) were also made, but they did not express in HEK293 cells.
  For SPR studies, constructs of the full-length wild-type IL-17A and its R55V,  W67V, Y85I and H86S single mutants were made with an N-terminal biotin  acceptor peptide tag followed by a His6 tag, using the native signal peptide for  secretion.
HEK293F cells were transfected with the DNA constructs using Freestyle  Max Reagent (Invitrogen, NY, USA) according to the suggested protocols for  expression.
  The ECD of IL-17RA used in this study, including the signal peptide, was cloned  into a pFastBac vector with the carboxyl terminal fused to a thrombin cleavage site  and a FLAG epitope.
The DNA construct was transfected into Sf9 insect cells  (Gibco) using Cellfectin II Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the suggested protocols for expression.
To facilitate crystallization of the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex, a  construct encoding N175D and N234D double mutant IL-17RA was expressed in  similar fashion from insect cells.
For SPR studies, the wild-type IL-17RA ECD was  made.
  Protein purification.
The cultured cell media for the wild-type and IL-17A  mutants were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was filtered through  a 0.22-mm filter.
Ni-NTA Superflow resin was used for batch binding overnight.
  The resin was washed and then eluted with imidazole gradient in phosphate saline  buffer (PBS, pH  7.4).
Fractions containing IL-17A were pooled and further  purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex75 column.
Fractions  containing properly dimeric IL-17A were pooled.
For crystallization, the truncated  IL-17A double mutant was concentrated to 10 mg ml  1 for crystallization using  10-kDa cutoff Vivaspin columns (GE LifeSciences, NJ, USA).
  The cultured cell medium for IL-17RA ECD was collected and filtered as above.
  Anti-FLAG antibody conjugate agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) resin was used  for purification.
Protein was eluted with 200 mg ml  1 FLAG peptide in PBS,  dialyzed into PBS to remove FLAG peptide and then concentrated using Vivaspin  columns.
The concentrated IL-17RA protein was further treated with peptide  N-glycosidase F (New England BioLabs, MA, USA) at 37 C for 3 h. Deglycosylated  IL-17RA was further purified on a size-exclusion Superdex 300 column  equilibrated with PBS.
  The IL-17A/IL-17RA complex used for crystallization was generated by mixing  enzymatic deglycosylated IL-17RA double mutant with slightly excess amount of  truncated IL-17A.
IL-17A/IL-17RA was separated from the unbound IL-17A on a  Superdex 300 size-exclusion column equilibrated with PBS.
Fractions containing  the IL-17RA-IL-17A complex were concentrated to 9 mg ml  1 for crystallization  trials.
  Crystallization and structure determination.
Both the unbound IL-17A and  IL-17A/IL-17RA complex were crystallized using either sitting drop or hanging  drop vapor diffusion methods.
The crystallization of the unbound IL-17A was done  at 22 C. The crystallization drops were formed by mixing 1 ml of the truncated  IL-17A at 10 mg ml  1 in PBS with 1 ml of well solution of 100 mM sodium citrate  buffer, pH 5.06.0, 612% 2-propanol, and 10% w/v PEG10k.
Crystals appeared in  minutes and reached full sizes overnight.
These unbound IL-17A crystals were  soaked briefly in a cryo solution that consists of mother liquor plus 25% ethylene  glycol before flashed cooled in liquid nitrogen.
  Crystallization of the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex was carried out at 22 or 4 C.  The complex at 9 mg ml  1 in PBS was mixed with a well solution of 0.1 M Tris  HCl, pH 7.38, 2025% Sokalan CP5 (Molecular Dimensions, Newmarket, UK).
  Crystals appeared overnight and grew to full size within a few days.
Complex  crystals were soaked briefly in a cryosolution consisting of the mother liquor plus  30% glycerol and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen.
  Data sets for both unbound IL-17A and IL-17A/IL-17RA complex crystals were  collected at the APS IMCA 17-ID beamline (APS, Chicago, USA) and processed  with program autoPROC38 or HKL200039.
Further data manipulations were  carried out using the CCP4 program suite40.
Structure determination was  performed by molecular replacement with program PHASER41, using the IL-17A  model in the antibody complex and IL-17F/IL-17RA as models for the unbound  IL-17A and IL-17A/IL-17RA structures, respectively (PDB accession codes: 2VXS  and 3JVF).
Structure refinements were carried out with BUSTER with the TLS  option42,43. During refinements, local structural similarity restraints were used,  which greatly minimizes bias toward enforcing similarity in areas of real structural  differences43.
Manual model building was carried out with COOT44.
Data  collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1.
  Surface plasmon resonance.
Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a ProteOn XPR36 (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
To enable the experiments  with the WT and mutant IL-17A proteins, the receptor was first biotinylated by  reaction with sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin (Pierce) under stoichiometric conditions  for 30 min at room temperature.
Following the reaction, the sample was desalted to  remove the excess biotin for capture.
Receptor was then captured onto an NLC  sensor chip to a level of B200 RU.
The running buffer for all SPR experiments was  10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% p20.
The WT and mutant IL-17A proteins  used in these binding experiments were diluted in running buffer to the respective  starting concentrations and serially diluted in three-fold increments.
Proteins were  loaded for 2 min over two receptor surfaces with dissociation times of 400 s.  Because of the very slow off-rate for the proteins from the receptor, the surface was  regenerated using a pulse of 3 M MgCl2 after each injection.
This regeneration step  was shown to quantitatively remove IL-17A from the receptor.
Proteins were run in  triplicate over the two surfaces generating six individual sets of data for analysis.
  Data analysis was performed using the ProteOn analysis software.
All data were fit  to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
