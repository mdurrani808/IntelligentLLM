DOI 10.1016/j.immuni.2007.12.018  SUMMARY  Immunodominant and public T cell receptor (TCR)  usage is relatively common in many viral diseases  yet surprising in the context of the large naive TCR  repertoire.
We examined the highly conserved  Vb17:Va10.2 JM22 T cell response to the influenza  matrix peptide (58-66)-HLA-A*0201 (HLA-A2-flu)  through extensive kinetic, thermodynamic, and  structural analyses.
We found several conformational adjustments that accompany JM22-HLA-A2-  flu binding and identified a binding hotspot within  the Vb domain of the TCR.
Within this hotspot, key  germline-encoded CDR1 and CDR2 loop residues  and a crucial but commonly coded residue in the  hypervariable region of CDR3 provide the basis for  the substantial bias in the selection of the germlineencoded Vb17 domain.
The chances of having a  substantial number of T cells in the naive repertoire  that have HLA-A2-flu-specific Vb17 receptors may  consequently be relatively high, thus explaining the  immunodominant usage of this clonotype.
  INTRODUCTION  The cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to the HLA-A*0201 influenza-virus matrix peptide (amino acids 5866, sequence  GILGFVFTL) complex (HLA-A2-flu) is dominated by T cell receptors (TCRs) of the Vb17 clonotype (Bowness et al., 1993; Gotch  et al., 1987; Lawson et al., 2001a, 2001b; Lehner et al., 1995;  Morrison et al., 1992; Moss et al., 1991).
Vb17 immunodominance emerges through repeated influenza-virus infections, indicating that Vb17-bearing TCRs offer particularly good solutions  to the problem of peptide-major histocompatability complex  (pMHC) binding in the context of T cell proliferation and T cell  memory, rather than being the consequence of an initial bias in  the peripheral repertoire (Lawson et al., 2001a, 2001b).
The  high-resolution crystal structure of the Vb17 TCR-HLA-A2-flu  complex (Stewart-Jones et al., 2003) confirmed that the Vb17-  bearing receptor JM22 conforms to general rules of TCRpMHC docking, including an orthogonal binding mode, and  revealed clues to the structural basis for the predominant use  of the Vb17 domain in HLA-A2-flu recognition.
The immunodominant TCRs are characterized by a highly selected amino acid  sequence in the CDR3b loop displaying variable codon usage  and typically consisting of arginine-serine-serine-tyrosine  (RSSY), although some sequence variations, for example arginine-glycine-alanine-tyrosine (RGAY), have been reported  (Lehner et al., 1995).
The JM22 structure contains the RSSY  motif, and the complex reveals that the highly conserved arginine  at position 98 and serine at position 99 dock into a notch formed  between the HLA-A2 and the flat plain vanilla flu peptide  (Davis, 2003; Stewart-Jones et al., 2003).
Additionally, the Q52  and D32 side chains in CDR2b and CDR1b hydrogen bond to  the peptide, and the combination of these two residues is unique  to the Vb17 sequence.
As a well-characterized immunodominant  response, emerging over multiple rounds of infection and clonal  selection, the binding of the Vb17 clonotype (exemplified by  JM22) to HLA-A2-flu is a highly selected interaction and a  good model for human T cell immunodominance.
  Exactly how TCR-pMHC binding leads to successful T cell  activation, proliferation, and memory generation is still uncertain.
  T cell activation has been correlated with a variety of TCR-pMHC  binding properties in solution, including the half-life (dissociation  rate contant or koff) (Matsui et al., 1994; Savage et al., 1999), the  heat capacity change (Krogsgaard et al., 2003), and the number  of sequential binding events that occur in a given time (serial triggering) (Valitutti and Lanzavecchia, 1997; Valitutti et al., 1995).
  Further, the mechanism of TCR triggering remains controversial  (reviewed in Choudhuri and van der Merwe [2007]), and vital  aspects of the process remain to be elucidated.
  Structures of TCR-pMHC complexes show a semiconserved  diagonal binding mode with the Va and Vb domains positioned  over the peptide N- and C-terminal halves, respectively (Garboczi et al., 1996; Garcia et al., 1996, 1999; Rudolph et al.,  2006; Stewart-Jones et al., 2003; Turner et al., 2006).
Individual  crystal structures represent snapshots raising the question of  how physiological the structures are.
Recently, Tynan et al. reported that a TCR binding to a super-bulged 13-mer peptide  presented by human leucocyte antigen (HLA) B*3508 could  Immunity 28, 171182, February 2008 2008 Elsevier Inc. 171adopt two distinct orientations (Tynan et al., 2005).
The extent,  however, to which this observation may be generalized to other  TCR-pMHC complexes and its significance for the process of  T cell-antigen recognition remain undefined.
  Surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) studies have provided  kinetic and thermodynamic insights into the process of TCR  binding.
These interactions are generally weak and of slow kinetics relative to cell-cell surface interactions with comparable affinities (van der Merwe and Davis, 2003).
TCR-pMHC binding is  generally driven by favorable enthalpic changes that overcome  an entropic penalty, although an exception has been noted (Ely  et al., 2006).
The energetic landscapes of some TCR footprints, including those specific for the human T cell leukemia  virus type-1 and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have been dissected by TCR mutagenesis and binding studies at a nonphysiological temperature (25C), and contributions from all three CDR  loops have been identified in different studies (Borg et al., 2005;  Gagnon et al., 2003, 2005; Kersh et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2000;  Manning et al., 1998).
Conformational change in the JM22 TCR  has been inferred from a large entropic penalty for binding (Willcox et al., 1999) and from published unliganded and liganded  TCR structures.
Conformational changes can range from large  (KB5-C20) (Reiser et al., 2002) to small (1G4) (Chen et al.,  2005).
Generally, the CDR3 loops undergo greatest conformational change (Chen et al., 2005; Garcia et al., 1996; Kjer-Nielsen  et al., 2003; Reiser et al., 2002).
  We addressed several unresolved issues in JM22-HLA-A2-flu  binding, including (1) which residues are responsible for the  binding affinity and how this relates to TCR immunodominance,  and (2) the role of flexibility and conformational change before  and after TCR binding.
To this end, we undertook 22 kinetic  analyses and ten thermodynamic analyses of TCR mutants.
  Our results revealed an energetic hotspot of binding within the  interaction interface with a crucial involvement of the germlineencoded Vb17 framework as well as R98 in the CDR3b.
We  also analyzed five liganded TCR complexesthe unliganded  JM22, and a mutant JM22(S99A) complexthat provided a series of crystallographic snapshots of the JM22 receptor before  and after binding.
We observed a series of conformational  adjustments in the TCR, including a scissoring motion of the  Va domain, readjustment of the interfacial water structure, and  stabilization of the CDRs on binding.
A pivoting, or rocking,  motion centered on the binding hotspot is revealed from the  structures of JM22:HLA-A2-flu complex crystal forms.
Most of  the recognition is encoded by the germline of Vb17, with the  notable exception of the R98 residue in the hypervariable portion of CDR3b, suggesting that although much of the striking immunodominance of Vb17 may be attributed to a pre-existing  fit for HLA-A2-flu, some adaptation in the hypervariable region  is crucial.
  RESULTS  Crystal Structures of pMHC, Unliganded,  and Complexed TCR  Soluble forms of the JM22 TCR and the HLA-A2-flu were  separately refolded, purified, and crystallized as unliganded  components or as a complex.
Numerous conditions yielded  crystals of the TCR-pMHC complex.
Datasets were collected,  and structures refined (resolution, Rcryst, Rfree in parentheses)  for the JM22 TCR crystals (1.96 A , Rcryst = 20.4, Rfree = 27.9),  HLA-A2-flu (1.6 A , Rcryst = 19.1, Rfree = 24.2), and two unique  (i.e., additional to the 1.4 A resolution complex) crystal forms  for the JM22:HLA-A2-flu complex (2.4 A , Rcryst = 19.6, Rfree =  27.2 and 2.5 A , Rcryst = 21.8, Rfree = 28.8) plus a complex with  the mutant VbS99A JM22:HLA-A2-flu (2.3 A , Rcryst = 21.9, Rfree =  28.1) were collected (Table 1).
The unliganded TCR and the 2.4  A and 2.5 A TCR-pMHC complex crystal structures had one molecule or complex per crystallographic asymmetric unit, whereas  the unliganded HLA-A2-flu, the 2.3 A JM22(S99bA):HLA-A2-flu  complex, and the 3.6 A resolution JM22:HLA-A2-flu complex  crystal structure all contained two copies.
Molecular replacement  followed by rigid-body refinement indicated that the relative orientations of pMHC and TCR for both copies of the complex in the 3.6  A resolution crystal structure fell within a range seen in the higherresolution complexes (see below), and, given the limited resolution, this crystal form is therefore not discussed further.
Lattice  contacts did not involve the peptides in either of the two copies  of the HLA-A2-flu structure, thus providing unbiased views of  the epitope structure and associated hydration shell.
Overall, we  present a complete series of structures of the pre- and postbound  states of these receptors at high resolution and multiple snapshots  of the TCR-MHC complex in different crystal forms.
This provided  a substantial set of structural data from which several key characteristics for the process of TCR-pMHC recognition in this immunodominant system can be distilled.
  Conformational Changes upon Binding  The JM22 TCR underwent two distinct types of conformational  change on binding HLA-A2-flu: a marked scissoring effect of  the variable domains (Figure 1A) and a CDR3-loop repositioning  (Figures 1B and 1C).
Whereas the repositioning of the CDR3a  and CDR3b loops is consistent with observations from previous  studies, where structures of unliganded and liganded TCRs are  available (Chen et al., 2005; Garcia et al., 1996; Kjer-Nielsen  et al., 2003; Reiser et al., 2002), the magnitude of the JM22  Va:Vb scissoring motion was considerably greater than any  previous observation.
Unusually, the high-resolution of the structures permitted direct observation of changes, on binding, in the  water structure associated with the pMHC; some water molecules remained semifixed, whereas others moved to new positions or were ejected from the surface (Figure 1D).
  Superimposing all JM22 TCR structures via the beta chain  showed the Va domain hinges in a scissoring motion in the vicinity of the Q38a-Q39b salt bridge near the Va:Ca linker region  (residues 110113).
The Va domain changed orientation with  respect to the Vb domain by approximately 7.0 on binding the  HLA-A2-flu (Figure 1A).
The hydrophobic core side chains (Table  S1 available online) in the Va:Vb domain interface did not show  markedly altered conformations in switching between these  two states; however, each state was stabilized by numerous  unique interdomain contacts.
Many of the conserved Va:Vb  interface contacts comparing bound and unbound states were  hydrophobic, facilitating the scissoring.
Although not all Va10.2  TCR V framework residues that contact the Vb17 TCR V framework were unique to Va10.2, the combination of residues S34,  Y36, Q38, G41, E42, G43, P44, L46, and T49which are from  the Va10.2 TCR V framework and contact the Vb17 domainis  Immunity  Molecular Basis for TCR Immunodominance  172 Immunity 28, 171182, February 2008 2008 Elsevier Inc.unique to Va10, potentially explaining why the Va10.2 domain is  preferentially coselected with the Vb17-R98S99 domain.
This  Va-Vb relative reorientation indicates that the V domains of the  JM22 immunodominant TCR can undergo similar structural  changes to those of antibody V domains on binding antigens  (Colman, 1988), providing a further parameter to optimize the  fit of a TCR to its cognate pMHC.
  The structures of the constant domains in the three crystal  structures of the liganded JM22 were almost identical; however,  the unliganded JM22 showed considerable structural differences (Figure S3).
The anticlockwise scissoring motion of the  Va domain on the Vb domain appeared linked to a conformational  change into the Ca, which undergoes substantial rearrangements.
In particular, the disordered regions in the unliganded  structure (a145a148 and a158a170), which were omitted  from the refined coordinates because of lack of electron density,  became ordered in the liganded complexes.
  Superimposition of individual V domains in bound and  unbound states illustrates that both CDR3 loops undergo  marked conformational change in the antigen-combining site,  whereas CDR1 and CDR2 loops underwent almost no change.
  Although the CDR3 loops of the unbound JM22 structure were  involved in contacts to neighboring molecules in the crystal  molecules that may have influenced the selection and stability  of the observed conformationsthe implication is that in unbound JM22 the CDR3 loops can adopt one or more conformations that differ from those required to bind HLA-A2-flu.
Between  bound and unbound structures, the whole of the CDR3a loop  swiveled by some 8, and the main-chain atoms at the apex  moved by 5 A (Figure 1B).
The tip of the CDR3b loop underwent  a repositioning of some 5 A in the main chain (Figure 1C).
Some  Vb17 framework side chains readjusted slightly (e.g., F30a) on  binding pMHC.
The side chains bearing the conserved CDR3b  RSSY (98101) motif found in nearly all Vb17 TCRs responding  to HLA-A2-flu were radically reorientated on binding (Figure  S2).
The R98b guanadinium headgroup is repositioned by some  7 A , enabling it to dock into a notch (Stewart-Jones et al.,  2003) formed between the HLA-A2 a2 helix and the peptide,  the S99b is also repositioned by 7 A , and the side chain of  Y101b underwent a near 180 flip from between the CDR3  loops to interact with the a2 helix.
  Very subtle changes in the conformation of the peptide could  be observed on ligation of the pMHC with the JM22.
The side  chain of Q155, previously considered as a gatekeeper (Tynan  et al., 2005) side chain on the a2 helix, underwent a switch in conformation on JM22 binding, allowing the conserved CDR3b R98  Table 1.

Although the  unliganded HLA-A2-flu structure was previously determined to  2.5 A resolution (Madden et al., 1993) in a different crystal form  and the peptide structures were broadly identical, the higher resolution allowed refinement of many water molecules associated  to the complex.
  Of the total of nine pMHC-associated water molecules present  at the TCR binding surface of the unliganded HLA-A2-flu, five  were either markedly shifted or ejected from the interface on  TCR binding, whereas four water molecules remained broadly  fixed (Figure 1D).
Few water molecules were tightly bound to  the unliganded TCR CDR loops, and none corresponded with  the positions found at the interface.
The water molecules at the  interface acted as molecular glue and formed hydrogen-bonding bridges between the epitope and the TCR.
The water trapping will contribute to the entropic penalty indicated by the thermodynamic data for wild-type (WT) JM22 binding (Willcox et al.,  1999), and changes in hydrogen-bond numbers and distribution  were likely to contribute to the substantial thermodynamic differences observed for many of the JM22 mutants described below.
  SPR studies have indirectly indicated that TCR interactions  with pMHC involve the stabilization of a flexible recognition  interface (Willcox et al., 1999).
Our high-resolution structures of  the unliganded HLA-A2-flu complex (1.6 A ), JM22 TCR (1.96  A ), and JM22:HLA-A2-flu (1.4 A ) permitted the direct observation  of changes in temperature-factor distribution (a reflection of  degree of conformational variation) on binding and thus allowed  us to study this stabilization in detail.
A substantial reduction in  temperature factors was most apparent in the CDR-loop atoms  engaged on formation of the complex but also extended into  the Vb17:Va10.2 framework (Figure 1E).
This stabilization  reflects an entropy reduction that is compensated by the  favorable enthalpic gain of forming numerous interprotein interactions.
Additionally, water molecules trapped within the interface displayed low temperature factors similar to those of the  protein atoms (B 18 A 2  ) yet formed hydrogen bonds and thus  were likely to contribute to the large, balanced entropic and  enthalpic changes that accompany JM22 recognition (Willcox  et al., 1999).
  Biophysical Characterization of Immunodominant  TCR-pMHC Binding  Using the previously characterized 1.4 A JM22-HLA-A2-flu complex structure and sequence analysis of Vb17-bearing clones  (Lehner et al., 1995; Stewart-Jones et al., 2003), we identified  twelve key contact amino acids and mutated these residues to  alanine, glycine, or a similar residue in order to assess their  contribution to binding (Figure 2).
Only TCR residues with side  chains that contacted the pMHC were selected for mutagenesis.
  The effects of these mutations on the affinity, kinetics, and thermodynamics of binding were determined by SPR (Tables 2 and  3).
Mapping on the TCR structure the effects of the mutation  on Kd (Figure 2B) revealed a central hotspot in the area  surrounding S99b residue; the hotspot consisted of D32b,  Q52b, and I53b, and R98b, mutation of which had a very adverse  effect on binding (Figure 2B).
Curiously, however, the mutation of  the S99b, which is located at the center of this hotspot, and in the  center of the binding interface, had little impact on the binding  affinity.
  The D32bA mutation on CDR1b caused a 93% reduction in  binding affinity (Table 2).
This substantial reduction reflected  the key role of the D32b side chain in binding the influenza-virus  matrix peptide, forming hydrogen bonds to peptide at T8 and  bridging a water molecule in the binding interface (Figures 2A  and 2C).
The influenza-virus peptide mutation T8G also substantially reduced the JM22 TCR binding affinity (data not shown),  such that the affinity became almost undetectable; however,  the T8G peptide mutation may have induced change in the structure of the peptide.
  The Q52bA mutation on CDR2b completely abrogated detectable binding.
This result is consistent with the key structural role  of this residue, which formed two hydrogen bonds to the aminocarboxyl backbone of the peptide at P4 and P6 (Figures 2A and  2C).
Structurally, Q58b stabilized and orientated Q52b, in addition to forming a water-mediated bridge to the G4 carbonyl  group of the peptide.
Mutation of Q58b to alanine resulted in  an approximate 50% decrease in binding affinity, almost all of  which can be attributed to a faster koff.
Although Q58bE had  almost exactly the same affinity as the wild-type, it had a faster  koff counterbalanced by a faster kon.

  Immunity  Molecular Basis for TCR Immunodominance  174 Immunity 28, 171182, February 2008 2008 Elsevier Inc.indicated that this mutation had favorable entropic and unfavorable enthalpic effects, consistent with the loss of a water  bridge.
  The N55bA mutation substantially decreased the binding affinity by increasing the koff and decreasing the kon.
Thermodynamic  analysis of the mutant revealed a substantially less favorable  change in binding enthalpy, partially compensated by a reduced  entropic penalty.
The D56bA mutation increased both the kon and  the koff, with little change in the affinity of binding.
Both N55b and  D56b form parts of an extensive network with water molecules  that facilitated hydrogen bonding to HLA-A2 (Figures 2A and 2D).
  Surprisingly, mutations of I53b generally had an adverse effect  on binding despite the fact that the I53 side chain makes only van  der Waals contacts to the HLA-A2 a1 helix and peptide  (Figure 2A).
Binding was partially restored by mutation to leucine  and almost completely restored by mutation to valine, suggesting that this residue plays an important structural role in supporting the receptor in its bound state (discussed below).

General Overview of JM22 Contact Residues and the  Effects of Mutations on Affinity for HLA-A2-flu  (A) Looking down at the HLA-A2-flu ligand, the peptide in yellow can be  seen to sit between the alpha helices of HLA-A2 in white.

The CDR2a loop is  excluded from the figure because it makes no direct contacts to the peptide and minimal contacts to HLA-A2.

CDR3a residues that make main-chain contacts only at  the interface and were therefore not mutated are colored gray.

Q96a  and G97a make no direct contact to peptide or HLA-A2 and thus were  not selected for mutation.
HLA-A2 is depicted in white, peptide  (GILGFVFTL) in yellow, CDR1a in pink, CDR3a in turquoise, CDR1b in  green, CDR2b in magenta, and CDR3b in blue.
  The coselection of an arginine-serine motif at positions 98  99 on the CDR3b has been identified as a key feature of the  Vb17 TCR immunodominant response (Lehner et al., 1995;  Moss et al., 1991; Stewart-Jones et al., 2003).
In a sequence  analysis of thirteen different patients expressing 38 different  Vb17-bearing cytotoxic T cell clones in response to HLA-A2-  flu, 30 clones had the R98 residue and 32 clones had the S99  residue via variable codon usage, suggesting a strong selection pressure for both residues.
Where the R98 residue was  not selected, in five of eight cases, Jb1.2 and a conserved  YGYTF motif were utilized, suggesting an alternative binding  strategy (Lehner et al., 1995).
The crystal structure of the  JM22-HLA-A2-flu complex indicated that the R98b makes  four hydrogen bonds and slots into a notch on the surface  of the HLA-A2-flu complex (Figures 2A and 2C), and as expected, the R98bA mutation abrogated measurable binding.
  The Y101bA mutation displayed a slight decrease in binding affinity but a markedly faster kon, consistent with the large conformational adjustment observed for Y101b upon binding (see previous section) and the absence of stabilizing van der Waals  contacts conferred by this residue at the interface.
The thermodynamic data show a large entropic penalty compensated by  favorable enthalpic changes, which may indicate increased solvent trapping in the large space vacated by the bulky tyrosine  residue.
  The wild-type and S99bA mutant shared similar affinities.
  Genetic data indicate that this residue is conserved (Lehner  et al., 1995), and it could be seen in the various JM22-HLA-A2-  flu complex crystal structures that S99 forms a direct hydrogen  bond to the peptide at V6 (Figures 2A and 2C).
Therefore, it  was expected that binding affinity should be adversely affected  by mutation.
However, the S99bA mutant has slightly increased  association and dissociation rates, increased heat-capacity  change, and a greatly decreased enthalpy and entropic penalty.
  Immunity  Molecular Basis for TCR Immunodominance  Immunity 28, 171182, February 2008 2008 Elsevier Inc. 175To investigate the role of the naturally conserved S99b residue,  we determined the crystal structure of the S99bA mutant  receptor in complex with HLA-A2-flu to 2.3 A resolution  (Figure S1).
Three hydrogen bonds are absent in the mutant  structure, including one direct and one water-mediated hydrogen bond to the peptide at the G4 carbonyl, as well as a hydrogen  bond to the amine group of Q52b.
However, all remaining  hydrogen-bonding groups retained at least one partner in the  S99bA-HLA-A2-flu structure, and in comparisons of wild-type  and mutant structures, there was little observable shift in the  relative position of the interface water molecules.
  One striking feature of WT JM22 TCR binding HLA-A2-flu is  that the binding kinetics were very temperature sensitive, with  the koff increasing dramatically with temperature (Willcox et al.,  1999).
This temperature dependence was also observed with  the various JM22 mutants, including S99bA (Figure 3).
An important consequence of this temperature sensitivity is that absolute  differences in koff increased dramatically with temperature.
Thus  the small absolute differences in koff between WT and S99bA  JM22 binding at 25C became much greater at physiological  temperatures (Figure 3 and Table 2).
Because T cell activation  is believed to be strongly dependent on, and extremely sensitive  to, TCR koff (Matsui et al., 1994; Savage et al., 1999), these data  suggest that the relative absence of Vb17-S99bA receptors in  the population could result from their substantially faster koff at  physiological temperatures.
Alternatively, the conservation of  the S99Ab residue may be due to genetic bias resulting from  the high frequency of serine codons (six available) or to preferential incorporation of particular nucleotides in the recombination  process (Venturi et al., 2006).
  The main contribution of the codominant Va10.2 clonotype  appeared to be the water-mediated stabilization of the R98b  guanadinium headgroup by residues S31a, S32a, and Q34a  (Stewart-Jones et al., 2003) (Figures 2A and 2E).

For some mutants, little or no binding was observed at  the highest TCR concentrations used (~200 mM), and the Kd was assumed to be > 200 mM. a The koff measured for binding by the Y101bA mutant was close to the detection limit for the BIAcore; these koff and calculated kon values should therefore be considered approximations.
  bBecause the koff at 37C were too fast to measure directly, they were estimated by measurement of koff at a range of lower temperatures and extrapolation to 37C via an Arrhenius plot.
  Immunity  Molecular Basis for TCR Immunodominance  176 Immunity 28, 171182, February 2008 2008 Elsevier Inc.extent of this stabilization, we measured the binding properties  of S31aA, S32aA, and Q34aA mutants.
S31aA or S32aA mutations resulted in slower kon and faster koff rates.
In the case of  S32aA, these alterations were associated with an increased  enthalpy and entropic penalty of binding.
The Q34aA mutation  resulted in a somewhat increased kon, but a greatly increased  koff.
Thus, although these residues enhance the binding process,  they are not necessary for it to occur.
  The only CDR2a side chain to make contacts with the pMHC  is V51a; however, this mutant failed to refold.
Only main-chain  atoms from the CDR3a loop (residues 9497) contacted the  peptide, and the side chains of S95a and Q96a are orientated  into the solvent (Figure 2F).
Thus, alanine scanning could not  be applied to this loop.
Given that CDR3a undergoes a substantial conformational change upon binding (Figure 1B) and  makes direct contacts to the flu peptide at G4 (Figures 2A  and 2F), the length of the CDR3a may be important for peptide  recognition.
  Multiple Complex Crystal Forms Reveal Various Angles  of TCR Engagement  To assess the range of possible structures the JM22:HLA-A2-flu  complex could adopt and how this may be important in TCRpMHC recognition, we determined the structures of two further  crystal forms of the complex.
Thus these two crystal forms plus  the original complex structure provided in total three independent views of JM22 bound to HLA-A2-flu.
The TCR-pMHC interface contacts were broadly identical for all of the structures.
  However, the relative orientation (tilt) of the TCR when bound  to HLA-A2-flu varied by some 5.
The protein-protein interactions at the core of the interface were conserved for all of the  structures, whereas residues at the periphery accommodated  Table 3.

  Figure 3.
The Variation of koff with Temperature for the WildType and Mutant Receptors JM22 Binding HLA-A2-flu  The high-activation enthalpies of dissociation for WT and mutant JM22  binding (see Dz  HD in Table 3) lead to large absolute differences at higher  temperatures.
At 37C (310.15 K), the koff for WT and S99bA JM22 TCR  are estimated to be 1.5 s1 and 4 s1  , respectively (Table 2).
  Immunity  Molecular Basis for TCR Immunodominance  Immunity 28, 171182, February 2008 2008 Elsevier Inc. 177the subtle alterations in position by adjustments in their sidechain conformations, primarily at HLA-A2 Q72, Q155, and  R197 and TCR I53b.
These results suggest that once bound to  the HLA-A2-flu, the JM22 forms a rigid unit that is capable of flexing as a single entity from one tilt angle to another (Figure 4A).
  Analysis of the 1.4 A and the 2.4 A resolution crystal forms revealed that the pivot axis for the change in TCR tilt is positioned  at the conserved R98-S99 motif of the CDR3b loop (Figure 4B).
  This region of the interface has the highest density of hydrogen  bonds, with R98b and S99b side chains saturating their hydrogen-bonding potential with interactions.
In the 1.4 A resolution  crystal form, where the TCR showed the most extreme tilt toward  the a1 helix, the CDR2b side chain I53b adjusted its conformation because of the reduced space between the CDR2b loop  and the a1 helix (Figure 4C).
For this TCR orientation, the a1 helix  also flexed by up to 0.6 A under the CDR2b loop compared to the  other crystal forms and the unliganded HLA-A2-flu structure,  indicating that the a1 helix can function as a molecular shock  absorber to accommodate some degree of flexibility at the  TCR-pMHC interface.
  Binding studies of I53b mutants suggested that this residue  has a particular importance in stabilizing the rocking motion  of the TCR; I53bA, I53bG, and I53bN (N is a naturally occurring  amino acid at this position in other Vb frameworks) mutations  prevented binding entirely.
It thus appeared that the spacing  that the I53b side chain imposes on the CDR2b-loop interface  with the a1 helix is precisely matched to that required to position  Q52b for optimal engagement with the peptide.
The binding of  the I53bV and I53bL mutants supports the molecular-spacer  concept because valine is broadly similar to isoleucine.
The extra  Cd methyl group in I53b is not a major contributor to the interaction spacing, and this mutation affects binding only slightly,  whereas the mutation to leucine, with its longer side chain,  disrupts binding substantially.
Together, these data indicate  a model of binding in which the combination of the Q52b and  I53b side chains, which is not found in the germline of any other  human Vb domain, along with the CDR1b D32 side chain, is critical to the specific recognition of the HLA-A2-flu and provides  a basis for the immunodominant usage of the Vb17 framework  in the T cell response to the HLA-A2-flu.
  DISCUSSION  Public TCR usage is surprisingly common in many diseases, including cytomegalovirs (CMV), EBV, HIV, and flu, in the context  of the large naive TCR repertoire from which these shared  TCRs are selected (Turner et al., 2006).
TCR immunodominance  remains a perplexing phenomenon, contingent on factors as  diverse as antigen presentation, V(D)J recombination, thymic  selection, specificity, affinity, and activation.
Here we have thoroughly investigated the structural flexibility and binding properties of a highly immunodominant human TCR clonotype that  emerges over a series of infections and clonal selection events  in response to influenza infection.
We have identified key features in the JM22-HLA-A2-flu that differ substantially from previous reports of TCR-pMHC complexes, which correlate with this  receptors extreme immunodominance and report dynamic  Figure 4.
Structural Variation of the JM22:HLA-A2-flu Complex  (A) Relative orientation (tilt) of JM22 on HLA-A2-flu for three different crystal forms: 1.4 A (green), 2.4 A (magenta), and 2.5 A (blue).
Although for the viewpoint of  this panel the JM22 tilt in the 2.5 A complex appears intermediate between that in the other two complexes, this complex has an additional tilt component into the  plane of the paper.
  (B) With the program Hingefind, CDR3b of the immunodominant Vb17 chain was identified as the pivot-point of the rocking motion; the schematic shows the  1.4 A complex structure (gray) and the 2.4 A structure (Va in red and Vb in blue).
  (C) A comparison of the structures of the CDR2b loop (main chain and I53b side chain) and their interaction with the a1 helix of HLA-A2 for the 1.4 A and 2.4 A  crystal forms.

  Immunity  Molecular Basis for TCR Immunodominance  178 Immunity 28, 171182, February 2008 2008 Elsevier Inc.features of this complex that may apply to TCR-pMHC interactions more generally.
  We utilized extensive kinetic and thermodynamic analyses to  identify the hotspot residues of TCR binding.
The most crucial  hotspot residues in JM22 binding reside in the Vb17 domain  and include Q52b, I53b (CDR2), R98b (CDR3), and to a lesser  extent D32b (CDR1).
This finding is consistent with earlier reports  that located the majority of hotspot residues in CDR1 and CDR2  loops, but it contrasts with a more recent study on an immunodominant EBV-responding TCR in which the predominant contributions were attributed to the CDR3 loops (Borg et al., 2005;  Gagnon et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2000; Manning et al., 1998).
In  the JM22 complexes, the Vb domain contributes the entirety of  the hotspot of side chains crucial for binding and approximately  70% of the buried surface area in the bound complex, whereas  the Va domain makes a minimal energetic contribution to binding  and is largely exposed to the solvent (Stewart-Jones et al., 2003).
  This result contrasts with previous alanine-scanning studies that  have presented more balanced roles for the Va and Vb domains  (Borg et al., 2005; Gagnon et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2000; Manning  et al., 1998).
In addition to the conformational changes in this receptor that lock the TCR onto its cognate pMHC, these hotspot  residues induced at the interface an observable cooling effect  that can be traced 15 A into the TCR V domains.
This observation  illustrates a clear entropy reduction (and conformational change)  induced by an enthalpic gain of interreceptor bonds.
  From the structures of the complexes, the primary contribution  of the Va to binding the HLA-A2-flu is from the main chain of the  CDR3a loop, whereas the Va CDR1 and CDR2 loops are almost  completely exposed to the solvent.
The germline-encoded portion of the Vb17 CDR1 and CDR2 loops contribute substantially  to binding, in addition to the conserved CDR3 R98b and S99b  residues.
Given that these two latter residues can be encoded  by the greatest number of codons, it seems plausible that the  precursor frequency of Vb17 receptors, bearing R98b and  S99b, that are capable of binding the HLA-A2-flu is higher  than other HLA-A2-flu-specific TCRs, and this may underpin  the public and immunodominant characteristics of this TCR  clonotype.
  Surprisingly, although the S99b residue is surrounded by the  hotspot residues, R98b, D32b, Q52b, and I53b, and is consistently selected in Vb17 flu-responding clonotypes, the affinity  of the S99bA mutant at 25C was similar to wild-type affinity.
  The similarity in affinity was characterized by slightly faster kon  and koff rates for the S99bA mutant and by a loss of three hydrogen bonds from the structure.
The consistent selection of the  S99b residue when there is more or less random generation of  sequence in the CDR3b may be a result of genetic bias in the  V(D)J recombination process (Venturi et al., 2006); examination  of the original data indicates that this mechanism is consistent  with the codon usage for this CDR3 loop (Lehner et al., 1995),  where the R98b is preferentially encoded by CGG (11/30) or  AGG (13/30) codons (there are six Arg codons) and S99b is preferentially encoded by the AGC (18/29) codon (there are six Ser  codons).
Alternatively, the preference for S99b over A99b may  be a result of faster binding kinetics, particularly at higher temperatures in which the absolute difference is more pronounced.
  These data suggest that caution should be taken in interpreting  SPR data collected at 25C, especially with influenza, where T  cells operate at a range of temperatures from cooler mucosal  surfaces (20C or lower) to core temperatures during fevers  (4142) (Boron and Boulpaep, 2004).
Studies have also suggested that T cell proliferation in response to interleukins may  be many-fold higher at 39C than at 37 (Roberts, 1991).
Thus,  difficulty in correlating kinetic binding, activation, and in vivo  data may derive not only from the measurement of binding at  25 rather than at 37C, but also from the necessity of accounting  for variable T cell activation and proliferative capacity in areas of  local temperature deviation.
  We characterized unliganded TCR, pMHC, and complex structures, providing a complete series of structures to understand  this system.
Previous reports have demonstrated various degrees of CDR3-loop conformational change; however, in this  TCR-pMHC recognition process, the CDR3-loop conformational  change is accompanied by a Va-domain reorientation of 7,  a phenomenon that has only been observed to a minimal extent  in other TCR systems (Chen et al., 2005; Garcia et al., 1996; KjerNielsen et al., 2003; Reiser et al., 2002).
This is a clear example of  a substantial structural change propagating from the antigencombining site toward the constant domains on cognate  pMHC binding.
If such a conformational change is involved in signaling, it could conceivably participate in the immunodominance  of this receptor.
However, the absence of this large-scale conformational change in other TCRs studied thus far argues against  such a role.
Additionally, the binding process induces a reorganization of the hydration shell within the TCR binding footprint on  the pMHC.
Thus, the JM22 binding process involves CDR3-  loop rearrangement, a Va-domain reorientation propagating  a broad structural change of the Ca domain, a stabilization of  the TCR-antigen binding surface and framework, and remodeling  of the water structure within the interface.
These changes enable  the TCR to make highly specific interactions that give rise to the  required affinity for the selection of this immunodominant TCR.
  The multiple crystallographic snapshots of the JM22-HLA-A2-  flu complex structures revealed five variations in TCR binding  orientations.
Similarly, Tynan et al. (2005) found two different  orientations of TCR to pMHC for the HLA-B*3508-EBV complex  crystal structure.
This degree of variation suggests that a TCR  can approach a target pMHC from a range of different angles,  with docking facilitated by the conformational flexibility of the  CDR3 loops.
Additionally, flexion at the interface suggests  a mechanism by which the TCR can disengage from its ligand,  where if the tilt angle becomes too extreme, bonds at the  interface are broken.
Some support for the importance of this  rocking motion may be inferred from the results of multiple  mutations to the I53b residue.
The mutation of I53b to other residues except valine considerably diminishes binding, suggesting  that it may act as a balance point to stabilize the rocking motion  centered on R98b and position the Q52b residue appropriately to  hydrogen bond to the peptide.
Although TCR pivoting may be  a general phenomenon, the degree of receptor pivoting is likely  to correspond to the flexibility of individual TCR V domains and  of CDR3 loops and the fit of TCR to pMHC, and it may be of physiological importance.
Finally, this capacity for flexion may facilitate productive engagement with coreceptors in the immunological synapse.
  What are the structural and biophysical features of the JM22-  HLA-A2-flu system that lead to immunodominant selection of the  Immunity  Molecular Basis for TCR Immunodominance  Immunity 28, 171182, February 2008 2008 Elsevier Inc. 179Vb17 clonotype?
The range of structures presented here illustrates the dynamic nature of TCR recognition in greater detail  than has previously been possible.
Given that three out of four  key residues important for binding the HLA-A2-flu are derived  from the Vb17 invariant CDR1 and CDR2 loops, a substantial  bias for the use of this clonotype is encoded in the germline.
  The CDR3b thus requires minimal optimization by high-frequency residues (as judged from codon usage) to corecognize  the pMHC in the context of this optimal variable domain.
It  appears that these characteristics allow the Vb17 domain to  dominate the recognition surface of the HLA-A2-flu.
The degree  of specificity of the JM22 for its relatively featureless, plain  vanilla (Davis, 2003) ligand is striking.
That this exquisite specificity is largely encoded by the germline region of the Vb17  domain suggests that this domain may have coevolved with  the HLA-A2 to respond to the strong selection pressure of recurrent and often lethal influenza pandemics.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Protein Production and Purification  The engineering of a soluble form of the Vb17-Va10.2 immunodominant TCR  clone JM22 has been described previously (Stewart-Jones et al., 2003).
  Mutations were introduced into this sequence by overlapping PCR with T7 forward and reverse primers and complementary primers engineered to contain  the desired mutation.
All cloning was carried out in the Pett22b(+) vector  (Novagen).
Mutant and wild-type TCRs were expressed with the E. coli strain  BLR (Novagen), isolated as inclusion bodies, purified, resolubilized, and  refolded as described.
The refolded complexes were purified by anion  exchange, Ni+2, and gel-filtration chromatography, in which the wild-type  JM22 and all JM22 mutants purified were eluted at equivalent positions in  the final gel-filtration profile, indicating that monomeric refolded protein was  recovered.
Receptor quality was confirmed by comparisons of the solubility,  chromatographic activity, and nonreduced and reduced SDS-PAGE profiles  to those of wild-type receptor prepared here and in previous work (StewartJones et al., 2003).
  The peptide GILGFVFTL was refolded with the HLA-A2 heavy chain with a Cterminal biotinylation tag and b2M as described (Stewart-Jones et al., 2003).
  For crystallography, HLA-A2 without a biotinylation tag was used for refolding.
  Surface-Plasmon Resonance  SPR studies were performed with a BIAcore2000 as previously described  (Lee et al., 2004; Willcox et al., 1999).
C-terminal biotinylated pMHC was immobilized via covalently coupled streptavidin at levels of 1,200 to 1,600 RU.
  Binding kinetics of the JM22 TCR is not substantially limited by mass transfer at these immobilization levels (Willcox et al., 1999).
Wild-type and mutant  forms of the JM22 TCR were injected over multiple flow cells, and the binding response was determined by subtraction of the response measured on  a control flow cell, which containing no pMHC, from the response measured  in flow cells containing pMHC.
Affinity, kinetic, and thermodynamic parameters were determined as previously described (Lee et al., 2004; Willcox et al.,  1999).
Multiple kinetic datasets for most mutants were derived and were  consistent.
For affinity measurements at temperatures other than 25C,  these were generally performed once, and where multiple measurements  were made, the data presented are from single representative measurements.
  Crystallization and Data Collection  All crystallizations were performed with the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion technique, typically with drops containing 1 ml of protein solution and 1 ml of reservoir solution.
Single JM22-A2-flu complex crystals of three different crystal  forms grew at room temperature from a stoichiometric ratio of pMHC:TCR at  a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in 12% PEG8000, 50 mM MES (pH 7.4)  (2.4 A and 3.65 A structures); 11% PEG8000, 50 mM MES (pH 7.2); and  20% PEG3350, 200 mM NaI (pH 7.2) (2.5 A structure); the S99bA JM22-  HLA-A2-flu complex crystallized in 14% PEG 8000, 100 mM MES (pH 6.1),  1M NaCl.
The JM22 TCR crystallized in 20% ammonium sulfate, 100 mM  sodium cacodylate, pH 6.4 at 4C.
The HLA-A2-flu crystals grew from 12%  PEG 8000, 100 mM MES pH 6.5 at room temperature.
  Crystals were soaked briefly and sequentially in reservoir solutions containing 10% and 20% glycerol and then flash-cooled and maintained at 100K in  a cryostream (Oxford Cryosystem).
All datasets were collected on station  ID14.2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF; Grenoble,  France) equipped with ADSC-q4 (Area Detector Systems Corporation, San  Diego) charged-couple device (CCD) detectors except for one JM22-HLAA2-flu complex crystal form diffracting to 3.65 A with the in-house Rigaku  rotating anode generator (model RU-H3R) fitted with osmic blue confocal  optics and a mar345 detector.
Although diffraction from this crystal was  weak, a clear molecular-replacement solution for TCR and pMHC could be  obtained.
Details of the crystal space groups and unit cells are given below  and in Table 1.
Datasets was autoindexed and integrated with the program  DENZO, followed by scaling with the program SCALEPACK (Otwinowski  and Minor, 1997).
  Structure Determination and Refinement  All structures were determined by molecular replacement using the program  EPMR (Kissinger et al., 1999).
For the JM22-HLA-A2-flu complex crystal forms,  an initial molecular-replacement solution was obtained through use of HLA-A2  heavy chain and b2M from 1OGA followed by a second round of molecular replacement using the 1OGA TCR while maintaining the HLA-A2/b2 M solution  as a partial static flag.
The unliganded JM22 TCR structure was determined  by molecular replacement using the 1OGA TCR as an initial search model,  and the unliganded HLA-A2-flu was determined by molecular replacement  using the 1OGA HLA-A2-flu component as an initial search model.
  With CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) the models were subjected to several  rounds of rigid-body refinement of individual domains (a1a2, a3, b2M, peptide, Va, Vb, Ca, and Cb).
For the 3.65 A resolution JM22-HLA-A2-flu complex  structure, refinement proceeded no further than rigid-body refinement in REFMAC5 (data not shown; space group C2; unit-cell dimensions [a, b, c] 242.4  A , 47.9 A , 186.5 A ; cell angles [a, b, g] 90, 115, 90).
For all other structures,  rounds of refinement were carried out with standard CNS protocols for bulk  solvent correction and overall anisotropic B factor scaling, positional refinement, simulated annealing, and individual B factor refinement.
Manual refitting  of the models was carried out with the program O (Jones et al., 1991).
Final  stages of refinement, after water picking with ARP/wARP (Morris et al.,  2002), were done with a restrained translation liberation screw (TLS) refinement algorithm in REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997).
All regions of the  models densities were clear, except for the regions a146a148 and a156  a169 in the unliganded JM22 TCR, which were omitted from the TCR model.
