IpaA binds  directly to and activates the cytoskeletal protein vinculin after  injection in the host cell cytosol, and this was previously thought  to be directed by two amphipathic -helical vinculin-binding  sites (VBS) found in the C-terminal tail domain of IpaA. Here,  we report a third VBS, IpaA-VBS3, that is located N-terminal to  the other two VBSs of IpaA and show that one IpaA molecule  can bind up to three vinculin molecules.
Biochemical in vitro  Shigella invasion assays and the 1.6 A crystal structure of the  vinculinIpaA-VBS3 complex showed that IpaA-VBS3 is functionally redundant with the other two IpaA-VBSs in cell invasion and in activating the latent F-actin binding functions of  vinculin.
Multiple VBSs in IpaA are reminiscent of talin, which  harbors 11 VBSs.
However, most of the talin VBSs have low  affinity and are buried in helix bundles, whereas all three of the  VBSs of IpaA are high affinity, readily available, and in close  proximity to each other in the IpaA structure.
Although deletion  of IpaA-VBS3 has no detectable effects on Shigella invasion of  epithelial cells, deletion of all three VBSs impaired bacterial  invasion to levels found in an ipaA null mutant strain.
Thus,  IpaA-directed mimicry of talin in activating vinculin occurs  through three high affinity VBSs that are essential for Shigella  pathogenesis.
  Vinculin is a cytoskeletal helix bundle protein that strengthens and stabilizes focal adhesion complexes (1).
This occurs  through its ability to bind to actin and to force-activate talin  that is tethered to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin receptors (2,  3).
The N-terminal seven-helix bundle vinculin head domain,  Vh1, contains binding sites for talin and -actinin (4 6),  whereas the five-helix bundle tail domain, Vt, contains binding  sites for F-actin (7) and raver1 (810).
The activity of vinculin is  inhibited by intramolecular Vh1-Vt interactions that are severed by the binding of vinculin binding sites (VBSs) to the Vh1  domain (11), which triggers remarkable changes in the conformation of Vh1 and displaces Vt (6, 12, 13).
VBSs are  amphipathic -helices of about 19 residues found in vinculin  activators such as talin and -actinin (8, 9).
VBSs are also found  in the IpaA invasin, a T3SS2 effector of Shigella (14, 15).
Crystal  structures of Vh1 with various VBS complexes have shown that  these VBSs usually insert into and contort the N-terminal fourhelix bundle subdomain of Vh1 (6, 12, 15, 16).
However, binding to the C-terminal four-helix bundle subdomain of Vh1 has  also been observed with some VBSs, and this occurs via a helix  addition mechanism where the VBS simply binds to the fourhelix bundle without altering its structure (15).
  Shigella spp. are Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, intracellular pathogens that are the principal cause of bacterial dysentery in humans (17).
Indeed, dysentery provoked by Shigella  causes 1.1 million deaths a year, mostly in children in underdeveloped countries (18).
To enter into intestinal epithelial cells of  the host, Shigella requires extensive remodeling of the actin  cytoskeleton that is directed by virulence determinants that are  transferred through the T3SS (19).
Four invasins, IpaA, IpaC,  IpgB1, and IpgB2, function in a coordinated manner to direct  host cell entry (2023).
  IpaA is a 633-residue protein that harbors an N-terminal  chaperone binding domain, a disordered central region, and an  all-helical C-terminal tail domain.
The last two C-terminal helices are tandem VBSs through which IpaA binds the Vh1  domain of vinculin (14).
We have shown that these VBSs are  required for maximal entry of Shigella into host cells and that  they activate vinculin by acting as very efficient mimics of talin  (14).
Furthermore, the vinculinIpaA complex also regulates  actin polymerization by modulating barbed end capping activity (24).
Although talin contains 11 VBSs, all of these appear to  be buried within helix bundles in the talin rod, and to activate  vinculin they must be released from these bundles by mechanical force, for example following integrin binding to matrix  components (25, 26).
By contrast, IpaA does not require preactivation to bind to vinculin (20), where its high affinity, tandem VBSs are available to bind to and activate vinculin (14).
  The two C-terminal VBSs of IpaA do not, however, fully  account for the activity of full-length IpaA, as Shigella expressing an IpaA mutant lacking these VBSs can still recruit vinculin  to bacterial entry sites and is only partially compromised in  bacterial invasion (14).
Thus, we posited that yet another VBS  * This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health  grants (to T. I.).

Here, we report a third  IpaA VBS (residues 488512), which also binds to and activates  vinculin.
The crystal structure of this IpaA-VBS3 in complex  with vinculin as well as biochemical and biological studies support a model where the three juxtaposed high affinity VBSs of  IpaA endow Shigella with the ability to rapidly and efficiently  activate vinculin at sites of pathogen entry.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Protein Purification and CrystallizationFor biochemical  studies, the newly identified VBS of IpaA (residues 488512;  IpaA-VBS3) was amplified by PCR from a virulence plasmid  derived from Shigella flexneri IpaBC strain (27).
The PCR  product was cloned into NdeI/EcoRI sites of the pET28a vector  (Novagen) and NheI/EcoRI sites of pMAL-c2e (New England  Biolabs) to generate pET28a-IpaA-VBS3 and pMAL-IpaAVBS3, producing IpaA-VBS3 with an N-terminal hexahistidine  tag and a maltose-binding protein, respectively.
Furthermore,  pMAL-IpaA-VBS3 was mutated at Val-499 and Leu-503 using  PCR mutagenesis technique (28) to produce pMAL-IpaAVBS3 V499E/L503Q.
  For crystallographic studies, the human vinculin head  domain (residues 1258; Vh1) followed by an internal ribosome-binding site and a start codon was PCR-amplified and  inserted into the EcoRI site of pET28a-IpaA-VBS3 to generate  the bicistronic expression vector pET28a-IpaA-VBS3-Vh1.
  Plasmids were transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)  strain (Novagen).
The binary complex of Vh1IpaA-VBS3 was  expressed in E. coli cells grown overnight in auto-induction  media (29) containing kanamycin at 30 C.
  The Vh1IpaA-VBS3 complex was purified by passage over  an affinity nickel column and size exclusion chromatography  column on an A kta FPLC system (GE Healthcare).
In brief, cells  were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in sonication buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM  imidazole), and the supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap HP  affinity chromatography column (GE Healthcare).
The column  was then washed with a linear gradient from 10 to 250 mM  imidazole to elute adsorbed proteins.
The elutions were pooled  and concentrated with a 30-kDa cutoff ultrafiltration unit  (Amicon), and the buffer was exchanged to phosphate-buffered  saline (PBS) for thrombin digestion.
A ratio of 0.1 unit of  thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich) to 1 mg of Vh1IpaA-VBS3 was used,  and samples were incubated at room temperature for 4 h.  Digestion by thrombin was confirmed by SDS-PAGE.
Vh1  without the affinity tag was then loaded onto a Superdex 200  26/60 sizing chromatography column that was equilibrated  with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1  mM DTT.
The fractions containing Vh1IpaA-VBS3 were  pooled and concentrated to 30 mg/ml.
  Crystal screening on 96-well plates using commercial screening solutions and the TTP LabTech Mosquito crystallization  robot identified several crystallization hits.
Best diffracting  crystals were obtained from a reservoir containing 0.1 M sodium  citrate, 20% PEG-3350, and 0.1 M cacodylate (pH 7.2).
  For biochemical studies, the human Vh1 domain, full-length  human vinculin, and the human Vt domain were purified as  described previously (14).
Wild type IpaA-VBS3 and mutant  IpaA-VBS3 V499E/L503Q, having N-terminal maltose-binding  protein tags, were purified by a single step amylose affinity  chromatography column (New England Biolabs) following the  manufacturers instructions.
  Data Collection and Structure DeterminationCrystals of  the Vh1IpaA-VBS3 complex were briefly soaked in a step gradient of cryoprotectant solutions (the reservoir solution supplemented with 5, 10, and 20% of ethylene glycol) and flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen.
A complete x-ray diffraction data set  to 1.61- Bragg spacings was collected at 100 K using a wavelength of 0.9795  on the SER-CAT beamline 22ID at the  Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.
  The data were processed with AutoPROC (30), which utilizes  the XDS program (31) as the data-processing engine.
The structure of the Vh1IpaA-VBS3 complex was determined by molecular replacement using BALBES (32), a component of the CCP4  programs suite version 6.1.3 (33), using the Vh1 from the  Vh1IpaA-VBS1 structure (14) as a search model.
  Crystallographic refinement of the Vh1IpaA-VBS3 structure was performed using the program BUSTER (34) applying  both translation, libration, and screw-motion and the local  structure similarity restraint approach to enforcing noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) (35), interspersed by cycles of manual rebuilding with Coot (36).
The model was analyzed with the  CCP4 (33) program WATNCS to identify NCS-related water  molecules, showing that 600 of the 804 water molecules obeyed  the NCS.
Chain identity and the residue number of these water  molecules were reassigned to the related protein chains so that  the NCS-related water molecules have the same residue number.
These were then subsequently included in the NCS definitions for the final rounds of refinement.
One ordered cacodylate per heterodimer was identified, modeled, and refined  under NCS restraints; each led to the ordering of the Lys-199  side chain through water-mediated electrostatic interactions.
Structure validation was carried out with MolProbity  (37).
Detailed crystal parameters, data reduction statistics,  and refinement parameters are provided in Tables 1 and 2,  respectively.
  Native PAGE AssaysFor binding studies, native PAGE was  performed with a PhastGel system (GE Healthcare) according  to the manufacturers instructions.
10 M of Vh1 was incubated  with IpaA-VBS3 in 5:1, 5:3, and 1:1 molar ratios at room temperature for 10 min before analysis on an 825% gradient  native gel.
Vh1Vt displacement assays with IpaA-VBS3 were  performed as described previously (14).
  Surface Plasmon ResonanceBinding studies of wild type  IpaA-VBS3 and mutant IpaA-VBS3 A495K to Vh1 were performed at 25 C using a Biacore 2000 (Biacore AB, Uppsala,  Sweden) equipped with a carboxymethyl dextran-coated gold  surface (CM5 sensor chip; Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden).
The  carboxymethyl groups on the chip were activated with 1-ethyl3-[(3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide to form the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of carboxymethyl dextran.
Vh1 (0.75 M to about 1.5 M) in 10 mM  sodium acetate (pH 4.5) was immobilized at densities of about  3002700 resonance units on the surface of several CM5 sensor  chips through amine coupling.
The remaining reactive sites on  the surface were blocked by reaction with ethanolamine.

  Association rate constants of the binding was measured by  flowing wild type or mutant IpaA-VBS3 in 10 mM HEPES buffer  (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween 20, and 3%  DMSO at a flow rate of 20 l/min over reference or sample  surfaces.
After each injection, the dissociation rate constant of  the IpaA-VBSs was measured by flowing buffer only over the  surfaces.
The Vh1 surfaces were regenerated with 20 mM phosphoric acid after each binding cycle.
Data fitting was performed  using BIAEvaluation 4.1 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden).
The  binding dissociation constants were calculated from the  observed on- and off-rates for the interactions.
  Plasmid ConstructsThe deletion of IpaA-VBS3 was generated using a PCR-based deletion strategy (38) on plasmid  pCR2.1:ipaA (10), using the primers 5-CGCGCAGACTAATGCGGCCATGGTCAGAAGTGTTGAGGCAC-3 and 5-  GTGCCTCAACACTTCTGACCATGGCCGCATTAGTCTGCGCG-3, which generate a deletion of residues 489511  (AVBS3).
The ACterm construct deleted for residues 550  633, including IpaA-VBS1 and IpaA-VBS2, was described previously (10).
To generate the AVBS3Cterm construct,  pCR2.1:ipaAVBS3 was digested with SnaBI and ApaI, subjected to end-filling using T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated to  generate deletions of residues 550 633.
All constructs were  verified by DNA sequencing.
  Secretion AssayShigella strains were grown to mid-exponential phase, and Congo Red was added at 100g/ml to induce  type III secretion as described previously (39).
Secreted proteins from the bacterial supernatants were precipitated and  analyzed by Western blotting with antibody specific for IpaA.  FIGURE 1.

Vh1 is shown as a  cartoon, and the IpaA-VBSs is shown in a ball-and-stick representation.
-Helices 1 through 4 of Vh1 are labeled.
The 20 central residues of the IpaA-VBSs  (IpaA-VBS1, residues 611 630; IpaA-VBS2, residues 565584) were aligned with IpaA-VBS3 (residues 491510) with r.m.s.d.
of 0.37  and 0.38 , respectively,  resulting in almost identical Vh1-bound subdomain structures except for the C-terminal region of -helix 1 that unfurls upon VBS binding.
The C-terminal  four-helix Vh1 subdomain, which is only partially shown, adopts several relative orientations with respect to the N-terminal four-helix bundle subdomain  (shown) due to the flexibility between the two Vh1 subdomains.

The asterisk, colon, and period symbols below the sequence each represent identity, and high and low conservation, respectively.
The most  C-terminal VBS is IpaA-VBS1, and the most N-terminal VBS is IpaA-VBS3, a nomenclature that reflects the timing of their discoveries rather than their position  in the polypeptide chain.
IpaA-VBS residues in red are those that are involved in major hydrophobic interactions with Vh1, and those in blue have hydrogen  bonding interactions with Vh1.

  Gentamicin Protection AssayBacterial internalization was  performed using the gentamicin protection assay as described  previously (39).
Semi-confluent HeLa cells were challenged  with bacteria grown to mid-log phase at a multiplicity of infection of 200 bacteria per cell for 30 min at 37 C in RPMI 1640  medium containing 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.3).
Samples  were washed twice with PBS buffer and incubated for another  30 min at 37 C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf  serum and 50 mg/ml gentamicin.
Samples were washed three  times with PBS buffer containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM  CaCl2, lysed in 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and plated onto  trypticase soy plate for colony-forming unit determination.
  Actin Co-sedimentation AssayFull-length human vinculin  protein was filtered using a 0.02-m syringe filter and diluted  with PBS to a final concentration of 15 M. Each IpaA-VBS  dissolved in PBS was then added to full-length vinculin at a 1:2  (vinculin:IpaA) molar ratio and incubated for 20 min at room  temperature.
G-actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc.  and polymerized following the manufacturers instructions.
  The final concentration of F-actin was adjusted to 60M in PBS.
  7 l of F-actin and 33 l of each vinculinIpaA complex were  mixed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then  centrifuged at 100,000  g for 25 min.
Supernatants and pellets  were resolved on SDS-PAGE using a PhastGel system (GE  Healthcare).
  RESULTS  Identification of Novel VBS in IpaAWe identified residues  488512 as a predicted amphipathic -helix using the Phyre  server (41) that has 47% and 42% sequence identity with IpaAVBS1 and IpaA-VBS2, respectively.
Helical wheel comparison  and sequence alignment suggested that this predicted -helix  might function as a third VBS of IpaA (IpaA-VBS3; Fig. 1).
We  therefore performed several binding and crystallographic studies to test if our newly identified IpaA-VBS3 is a bona fide third  VBS for IpaA.  Crystal Structure of the Vh1IpaA-VBS3 ComplexVinculin  binds to IpaA with its N-terminal seven-helix bundle domain  coined Vh1.
We therefore crystallized Vh1 in complex with  IpaA-VBS3.
The crystal structure of Vh1IpaA-VBS3 complex  was determined to 1.61  resolution (Tables 1 and 2).
This  resolution represents by far the highest resolution Vh1VBS  structure to date, where eight Vh1talin-VBS structures were  determined at 3.3  to 1.8  resolution (6, 12, 42, 43), respectively, and Vh1IpaA-VBS1 and Vh1IpaA-VBS2 structures  were solved to 2.7  (14) and 3.2  (15) resolution, respectively.
  The final model consists of two Vh1IpaA-VBS3 heterodimers,  two cacodylate ions, and 804 water molecules in the asymmetric unit.
The model has no protein geometry violations according to MolProbity results (37).
The Ramachandran plot analysis  shows that all residues fall in allowed regions.
MolProbity (37)  and clash scores are 0.79 (99th percentile) and 0.75 (100th percentile), respectively, when compared with 1.6  resolution  structures or worse that are available in the PDB.
Electron density is missing for the last IpaA-VBS3 residue in one heterodimer in the asymmetric unit and for the last two IpaAVBS3 residues in the other heterodimer in the asymmetric unit,  with temperature factors increased (from under 20 2 to over  50 2  ) for the last two modeled residues in either IpaA-VBS3  (supplemental Fig. S1).
  The structure of the Vh1IpaA-VBS3 complex closely resembles the crystal structures of Vh1 in complex with other IpaAVBSs (Fig. 1B).
Indeed, the Vh1IpaA-VBS3 complex structure  superimposes well with the other Vh1IpaA-VBS structures  (PDB entries 2gww, Vh1IpaA-VBS1; and 2hsq, Vh1IpaAVBS2) with r.m.s.d. of 1.9  and 2.46 , respectively, for 241 C  positions.
Furthermore, the Vh1 N-terminal four-helix bundle  subdomain (residues 8126) that binds to the IpaA-VBSs  superimposed with r.m.s.d. of 1.37  and 1.46 , respectively.
  The superposition of one subdomain alone is better due to the  relative movement of the two four-helix bundle subdomains  relative to each other (Fig. 1B).
  Vh1-IpaA-VBS3 InteractionsThe 1.6  resolution Vh1  IpaA-VBS3 crystal structure allows a clear definition of the vinculin-IpaA interaction.

  IpaA Has Three Vinculin Binding Sites  JULY 1, 2011VOLUME 286NUMBER 26 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 23217   at Univ of St Andrews on April 11, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from are hydrophobic and contributed by eight residues: IpaA residues Ile-492 and Phe-493 interact with Vh1 residues Thr-8,  Ile-12, Val-57, Gly-58, Leu-123, and Phe-126; IpaA residue Ala495 with Vh1 Leu-54 and Val-57; IpaA residue Val-499 with  Vh1 Ala-50, Val-51, Leu-54, and Ile-115; IpaA residue Leu503 with Vh1 Val-16, Ile-20, Ser-112, and Ile-115; IpaA residues Leu-506 and Ile-507 with Vh1 Val-16, Ile-20, Leu-23,  Leu-40, Pro-43, Val-44, and Leu-88; and IpaA residue Ile510 with Vh1 Leu-108.
These interactions contribute up to  72% (835 2  ) of the total interface (1,152 2  ) between IpaAVBS3 and Vh1.
  Three interactions between IpaA-VBS3 and Vh1 are mediated by ordered water molecules, and all of these involve Vh1  residues residing on -helices 1 and 2 as follows: the main  chain carbonyl of Vh1 Ile-12 and side chain of IpaA Asn-501;  the main-chain carbonyls of Vh1 Pro-43 and IpaA Ser-502; and  main chain carbonyls of Vh1 Ala-50 and IpaA Ala-495.
Additionally, a few notable hydrogen bonding interactions are  formed by IpaA residues Arg-489, Glu-490, Lys-497, Thr-500,  Ser-504, and Ser-508, as described below.
  Comparison of Vh1 Binding to IpaA-VBS3 Versus Other VBSs  Comparison of the IpaA-VBSs bound to Vh1 shows that a  highly conserved 19-residue core -helix directs interactions of  IpaA with vinculin (Fig. 1B and supplemental Figs. S2 and S3).
  Previous mutagenesis studies (14) have shown that equivalent  Tyr residues of IpaA-VBS1 (Tyr-613) and IpaA-VBS2 (Tyr567) are important for high affinity binding to vinculin compared with the talin VBSs (14).
IpaA-VBS3 has a Phe at this  position that interacts with Vh1 similar to that seen for the  other two IpaA-VBSs.
  There are two conserved hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl group of Vh1 residue Ile-12 in all three IpaA-VBS complex crystal structures, with the IpaA-VBS side chain (Thr-500  in IpaA-VBS3, Ser-574 in IpaA-VBS2, and Thr-620 in IpaAVBS1) and the side chain of Vh1 residue Gln-19 with the  hydroxyl of the IpaA-VBS serine (504, 578, and 624, respectively).
In contrast, equivalent residues are not strictly conserved in the VBSs of talin and are often substituted by Ala and  polar amino acids, respectively.
Additionally, Lys-497 of IpaAVBS3 engages in an additional hydrogen bonding interaction  with Ser-11 and Glu-14 of Vh1, and the equivalent residues  have high temperature factors in the IpaA-VBS1 ( 120 2 for  Lys-617, PDB entry 2gww) and IpaA-VBS2 (over 150 2 for  Lys-571, PDB entry 2hsq) structures.
Moreover, the aliphatic  side chain of IpaA Lys-497 also engages in hydrophobic interactions with vinculin Ile-12.
Importantly, IpaA-VBS3 residue  Lys-497 is conserved among the three IpaA-VBSs (Lys-571 and  Lys-617 in VBS2 and VBS1, respectively).
The interaction  between Ser-496 of IpaA-VBS3 and Vh1 is less favorable compared with the equivalent interaction in the other two VBSs of  IpaA (Ala-570 and Ala-616) due to burial of the polar side  chain.
However, two electrostatic interactions are formed by  residues outside of the 19-residue VBS core that further stabilize the binding of Vh1 with IpaA-VBS3 as follows: Arg-489 and  Glu-490 interact with Glu-60 and Arg-56 of Vh1, respectively  (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3).
  IpaA Harbors Three VBSsWe used native gel shift mobility  assays to test whether IpaA-VBS3 binds to the vinculin Vh1  domain in solution (Fig. 2A).
Indeed, the Vh1IpaA-VBS3 complex formed under physiological conditions and binding was  saturated at equimolar ratios.
Mutation of conserved small  hydrophobic residues of VBSs to polar or charged residues disrupts Vh1 binding (25).
Thus, we tested the binding of the  IpaA-VBS3 V499E/L503Q mutant and found this double  mutant did not bind to Vh1 (Fig. 2B).

  Wild type IpaA-VBS3 at 100 nM, 33.3 nM, 11.1 nM, 3.7 nM, and 1.23 nM for the  traces from top to bottom, respectively (top panel), and mutant IpaA-VBS3  A495K at 100 nM, 100 nM, 33.3 nM, 33.3 nM, 11.1 nM, 3.7 nM, and 1.23 nM for the  traces from top to bottom, respectively (bottom panel), were injected in 3-fold  dilution series over a reference or Vh1-immobilized surface, and the binding  rate constants of IpaA were measured.
The results obtained from duplicate  injections of each sample over three Vh1 surfaces were normalized by subtracting the reference value.
Representative sensograms are shown.
The calculated Kd was 0.054 nM (wild type, top) and 1 nM (A495K mutant, bottom),  respectively.

  IpaA Has Three Vinculin Binding Sites  23218 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 286NUMBER 26JULY 1, 2011   at Univ of St Andrews on April 11, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from To determine the binding affinity of IpaA-VBS3 for Vh1, we  used surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 2C).
In agreement with  the native gel shift mobility assays (Fig. 2A), the stoichiometry  was 1:1.
The binding affinity Kd of IpaA-VBS3 for Vh1 was  0.054 nM (Fig. 2C), which is significantly higher than that of  IpaA-VBS2 (6.61 nM) (14) but similar to that of IpaA-VBS1  (0.11 nM) (14).
The lower binding affinity of IpaA-VBS2 is  accounted for Lys-569, as mutating this residue to an alanine (as  seen in IpaA-VBS1; Ala-615) increased its affinity about 12-fold  to 0.53 nM (14).
We therefore tested if the equivalent alanine  residue in IpaA-VBS3 (Ala-495) was also responsible for its  tighter binding.
Indeed, mutant IpaA-VBS3 (A495K) lowered  the affinity about 20-fold to 1 nM. Thus, the higher affinity of  IpaA-VBS3 is in part due to Ala-495 (Fig. 2C).
  Finally, to determine the total number of VBSs present in  IpaA, we determined the stoichiometry of the Vh1IpaA complex (supplemental Figs. S4 and S5).
Indeed, three molecules of  Vh1 bound one molecule of IpaA. Thus, IpaA harbors three  VBSs, and a single IpaA molecule can potentially bind to and  activate three molecules of vinculin.
  Deletion of All Three IpaA VBSs Impairs IpaA Function during Bacterial Invasion of Epithelial CellsTo test the role of the  IpaA VBSs in the invasion of Shigella into epithelial cells, we  generated the IpaA strains lacking residues 488512 (AVBS3)  or residues 488512 and 550 633 corresponding to the deletion of all three VBSs (AVBS3Cterm).
These mutants were  subcloned into a bacterial expression vector and introduced  into an ipaA Shigella mutant strain.
As shown in Fig. 3A, type  III secretion of AVBS3 and AVBS3Cterm was readily  detected, at levels that were at least equivalent to that of the  FIGURE 3.Deletion of all three of the VBSs ofIpaAimpairsIpaA functionin  bacterial invasion.

The behavior  of F-actin is not affected by IpaA-VBS3 alone (lanes 5 and 6).
Thus, IpaA-VBS3  is sufficient to activate the latent F-actin binding functions of vinculin.

Right gel, vinculin co-sediments with F-actin if  it is pre-bound by IpaA-VBS3 (lanes 5 and 6), and this is comparable with  vinculin activated by IpaA-VBS1 (lanes 1 and 2) or IpaA-VBS2 (lanes 3 and 4).
  IpaA Has Three Vinculin Binding Sites  JULY 1, 2011VOLUME 286NUMBER 26 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 23219   at Univ of St Andrews on April 11, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from ACterm mutant lacking both IpaA-VBS1 and IpaA-VBS2  (residues 550 633).
Gentamicin protection assays (Fig. 3B)  indicated that expression of the AVBS3 mutant restored invasion functions to levels similar to those of full-length IpaA. As  described previously (10), complementation with the ACterm  containing a deletion of the previously identified IpaA-VBS1  and IpaA-VBS2 sites resulted in partial complement bacterial  invasion (14).
The AVBS3Cterm mutant, however, failed to  complement the ipaA mutant Shigella (Fig. 3B).
Thus, deletion  of all three IpaA-VBSs severely impairs IpaA invasion  functions.
  Activation of Vinculin by IpaA-VBS3The similar binding  mode of IpaA-VBS3 with the other IpaA-VBSs suggested that  IpaA-VBS3 can activate vinculin, which requires severing of the  intramolecular head-tail (Vh1-Vt) interaction that clamps vinculin in its inactive conformation (7).
To test this, we incubated  IpaA-VBS3 with the pre-formed Vh1Vt complexes.
The Vt  domain was efficiently displaced by IpaA-VBS3 (Fig. 4A).
Thus,  IpaA-VBS3, like IpaA-VBS1 and IpaA-VBS2, is sufficient to  trigger vinculin activation.
  A hallmark of activated vinculin is its ability to bind to F-actin, which is mediated by the Vt domain (7).
Thus, we tested  whether IpaA-VBS3 was sufficient to activate the latent F-actin  binding functions of full-length human vinculin by performing  F-actin pulldown assays.
Notably, vinculin that was pre-activated by incubating with IpaA-VBS3 readily bound to F-actin  (Fig. 4B).
In contrast, only minute amounts of native vinculin  bound to F-actin.
Finally, the extent of vinculin activation by  IpaA-VBS3 as measured by F-actin binding was similar to that  triggered by the binding of IpaA-VBS1 or IpaA-VBS2 (Fig. 4C).
  Thus, IpaA-VBS3, like IpaA-VBS1 and IpaA-VBS2, can trigger  the latent F-actin binding functions of vinculin.
  DISCUSSION  Our studies revealed that the IpaA invasin of Shigella harbors  three tandem high affinity binding sites that bind to and activate vinculin.
Specifically, our biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that a third VBS of this invasin is located  N-terminal to the two C-terminal VBSs, and they demonstrated that all three VBSs of IpaA can function in a redundant  manner to sever the head-tail interaction that normally locks  vinculin in its inactive conformation and that all three IpaAVBSs are capable of activating the latent F-actin binding functions of full-length vinculin, a hallmark of activated vinculin at  focal adhesions (7).
Finally, our 1.6  crystal structure of IpaAVBS3 in complex with vinculin, by far the highest resolution  structure of any vinculinVBS complex to date, with the resolution for previously determined Vh1IpaA complexes ranging  from 2.7  to 4 , revealed that this VBS also functions in an  analogous manner to the two other VBSs of IpaA, by acting as a  talin-VBS mimic that avidly inserts into the N-terminal fourhelix bundle subdomain of Vh1 to generate an entirely new  helix bundle structure.
  Vinculin is required for the efficient entry of Shigella into the  host cell (39).
The fact that IpaA harbors three likely functionally redundant VBSs explains the paradox that an IpaA C-terminal deletion mutant that lacks IpaA-VBS1 and IpaA-VBS2 is  competent to rescue an ipaA deletion mutant for Shigella invasion (14).
Here, we posit that IpaA-VBS3 provides these functions, as it can bind to and activate vinculin at sites of pathogen  entry.
Accordingly, deletion of all three VBSs in IpaA compromised bacterial invasion, similar to those observed in an ipaAdeficient Shigella strain.
  Finally, it is quite striking that the three high affinity VBSs of  IpaA appear in tandem in the C-terminal tail of IpaA. Tandem  repeats of the IpaA VBSs are somewhat comparable with those  seen in talin, where its 11 VBSs bind vinculin upon force-induced activation of the talin rod domain (26).
However, unlike  talin-VBSs, the IpaA-VBSs are readily available for binding  without activation (supplemental Fig. S4).
Indeed, IpaA-VBS1  (residues 611 633), IpaA-VBS2 (residues 565587), and IpaAVBS3 (residues 488512) are separated by linkers of only 24 or  53 residues, respectively (Fig. 5).
The high local concentration  of these VBSs would also ensure tight binding to vinculin.
  Indeed, our binding studies suggest that IpaA can simultaneously bind up to three Vh1 molecules, a scenario that would  stabilize the focal adhesion-like complexes seen at pathogen  entry sites (Fig. 5) (44).

Vinculin activation by IpaA. IpaA has three VBSs that can activate  vinculin by the binding of any one of its three VBSs (IpaA-VBS1, red; IpaAVBS2, yellow; and IpaA-VBS3, blue) to the vinculin head domain (VH) by helix  bundle conversion, which severs vinculin head-tail interactions (indicated by  the change in color).
Activated vinculin can then bind to F-actin through  Vt-mediated interactions.
The three VBSs of IpaA serve to amplify the  response and/or promote simultaneous binding of IpaA to several vinculin  molecules, which would promote actin cross-linking at sites of Shigella entry.
