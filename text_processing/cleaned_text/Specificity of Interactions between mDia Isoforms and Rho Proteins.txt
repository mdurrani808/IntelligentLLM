Specificity of Interactions between mDia Isoforms and  Rho Proteins*  Received for publication, July 23, 2008, and in revised form, September 26, 2008 Published, JBC Papers in Press, September 30, 2008, DOI 10.1074/jbc.
M805634200  Michael Lammers, Simon Meyer, Dorothee Ku hlmann, and Alfred Wittinghofer1  From the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Physiology, Department of Structural Biology, Otto-Hahn-Strasse 11,  44227 Dortmund, Germany  Formins are key regulators of actin nucleation and polymerization.
They contain formin homology 1 (FH1) and 2 (FH2)  domains as the catalytic machinery for the formation of linear  actin cables.
A subclass of formins constitutes the Diaphanousrelated formins, members of which are regulated by the binding  of a small GTP-binding protein of the Rho subfamily.
Binding of  these molecular switch proteins to the regulatory N-terminal  mDiaN, including the GTPase-binding domain, leads to the  release of auto-inhibition.
From the three mDia isoforms,  mDia1 is activated only by Rho (RhoA, -B, and -C), in contrast to  mDia2 and -3, which is also activated by Rac and Cdc42.
Little is  known about the determinants of specificity.
Here we report on  the interactions of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 with mDia1 and an  mDia1 mutant (mDiaN-Thr-Ser-His (TSH)), which based on  structural information should mimic mDia2 and -3.
Specificity  is analyzed by biochemical studies and a structural analysis of a  complex between Cdc42Gpp(NH)p and mDiaN-TSH.
A triple  NNN motif in mDia1 (amino acids 164166), corresponding to  the TSH motif in mDia2/3 (amino acids 183185 and 190192),  and the epitope interacting with the Rho insert helix are essential for high affinity binding.
The triple N motif of mDia1 allows  tight interaction with Rho because of the presence of Phe-106,  whereas the corresponding His-104 in Rac and Cdc42 forms a  complementary interface with the TSH motif in mDia2/3.
We  also show that the F106H and H104F mutations drastically alter  the affinities and thermodynamics of mDia interactions.
  The dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton play an important  role in many physiological processes, e.g. cytokinesis, cell  migration, cell morphology, and phagocytosis (13).
Although  the Arp2/3 complex leads to the formation of a branched actin  network and is regulated by WASP and VASP and others, the  formins and the protein Spire catalyze the nucleation and  polymerization of unbranched actin filaments (3 8).
Formins  are multidomain proteins characterized by formin homology  domains.
All formins contain the FH22 domain, the actual catalytic machinery for actin polymerization, which is often in tandem with FH1, a polyproline domain mediating profilinactin  recruitment (913).
The FH3 domain is believed to play a role  in the subcellular localization of the protein and is the least  conserved FH domain (12, 1416).
  The formins are subdivided into seven groups as follows: Dia  (diaphanous), DAAM (dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis), FRL (formin-related gene in leukocytes), FHOD  (formin homology domain-containing protein), INF (inverted  formin), FMN (formin), and delphilin (24).
The structure of the  FH2 domain from yeast and mouse showed a doughnut-shaped  all-helical molecule, which forms a dimer binding with  high affinity to actin (13, 1721).
From the structure of the FH2  alone and in complex with tetramethylrhodamine-labeled actin  and from biochemical experiments, the mechanism of actin  polymerization by the formin was described as a stair-stepping  mechanism, where the FH2 dimer binds to the barbed ends of  actin filaments as a leaky capper that processively catalyzes  barbed-end actin assembly (11, 13, 17, 2228).
The processive  movement could be shown in vitro as well asin vivo (11, 22, 23).
  For most formins, the tandem arrangement of FH1-FH2  domains is necessary for function.
FH1 contains several  stretches of poly-L-prolines that are targets for Src homology 3  and WW domain-containing proteins and for profilin (19, 29,  30).
By binding to G-actin as well as to FH1, profilin delivers  actin monomers to the barbed end of the filament and increases  the concentration of actin near the FH2 domain (13, 28).
Therefore, FH1-FH2 accelerates the association rate for ATP-G-actin  monomers at the barbed end, but it also accelerates the hydrolysis rate of actin-bound ATP (11, 22).
This leads to the release of  profilin from the barbed-end making this site accessible for the  next round of G-actin incorporation (11).
  N-terminal to the FH1/FH2 domains, the subclass of Diaphanous-related formins contains a regulatory unit consisting of  the GBD and FH3 domains (mDiaN in short), which interact  with the C-terminal Diaphanous-autoregulatory domain  (DAD) (3136).
The deletion of either GBD or DAD leads to a  constitutively active protein that induces actin stress fibers and  serum-response factor-dependent nuclear transcription (25,  3739).
The Drosophila protein Diaphanous was isolated in  Drosophila as a gene involved in cytokinesis.

Binding of activated small GTP-binding proteins  from the Rho family leads to the release of the inhibitory interaction between DAD and mDiaN and activation of the FH2 that  is not yet completely understood (3133, 35, 40).
  It has been shown by us and others that mDiaN consists of  three subdomains as follows: GBDN, Armadillo repeat region  (ARR) also called DID (Diaphanous-inhibitory domain), and  dimerization domain (Dim) (33, 35, 40).
The structure of the  mDiaN in complex with activated RhoC shows that Rho interacts via switch I and II with the GBD but also with the ARR via  the Rho insert helix.
The DAD-binding site on mDiaN (DID)  has also been described biochemically and structurally (32).
  The structure shows that the 16 highly conserved residues of  the DAD core region (DCR) form an -helix, which binds to the  ARR in a site not directly overlapping with the Rho-binding site  (32, 41).
Nevertheless, Rho actively dissociates DAD from its  binding site via long range electrostatic repulsion and short  range steric clashes (32).
  Small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (small GNBP, G  proteins) cycle between a GDP-bound inactive form and a  GTP-bound active form (42 44).
They interact with their  effector proteins preferentially in the GTP-bound form (44, 45).
  This discrimination is because of the conformation of two loop  regions, switch I and II, that adopt a defined conformation  when connected to the -phosphate.
Rho proteins interact with  a number of different effectors, which in turn regulate the actin  cytoskeleton either directly, as with mDia, or indirectly by modifying the activity of actin-binding proteins (44, 4653).
Binding motifs in Rho effectors are divergent, with a Cdc42/Racinteractive binding motif in Cdc42/Rac effectors WASP,  WAVE, ACK, and PAK (47, 54).
The Rho effectors Rhophilin,  Rhotekin, and protein kinase N, and ROCK bind via an antiparallel coiled-coil motif (47, 55, 56), whereas mDia binding to  Rho is again via a different structural motif (35).
The common  feature of these interactions is that Rho proteins not only  recruit their effectors to a particular membrane site but that  they also allosterically activate the effector (5, 47, 57).
This  involves the release of an intramolecular autoinhibited state  that can be found in the cases of kinases, e.g. ROCK, protein  kinase N, or PAK, but also in the case of WASP, WAVE, and  mDia1 (47).
For mDia1 the release of autoinhibition by Rho  binding does not lead to full activation of the actin polymerization activity catalyzed by FH2 (25, 40).
  The activation of Rho proteins plays an important role in  spatio-temporal regulation of the actin cytoskeleton inside the  cell.
Very often, different signal transduction pathways via Rho  proteins lead to similar or overlapping cellular responses (58).
  Effectors of Rho proteins are nevertheless not promiscuous in  responding to either Rho and its homologues, i.e. RhoA, -B, -C,  or to Cdc42 and Rac and its homologues such as TC10.
Because  a particular Rho protein interacts with a number of structurally  different effectors via the highly conserved switch I and II  regions, a high plasticity in the interface is required (59).
  Numerous Rho family effectors have been described so far,  defined as proteins that only bind to the GTP-bound state.
  ROCK I and II and Rhotekin specifically interact with and are  activated by binding of Rho but not Rac or Cdc42 (39, 60).
It has  been postulated that for ROCK II only residue Glu-40 of RhoA  is important for discriminating between RhoA, Cdc42, and  Rac1 (61).
The Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif containing  proteins PAK, WASP, and WAVE and others are specific effectors for members for either Rac or Cdc42 but do not interact  with Rho.
  In case of mDia, the situation is different in that mDia1 specifically binds to and is activated by RhoA, -B, and -C (39),  whereas mDia2 and -3 seem to be highly promiscuous and activated by RhoA-C, Cdc42, and RhoD (36, 39, 62, 63).
The question to ask is whether, like in protein kinase C-related kinase,  the effector binds to multiple Rho family members at different  binding sites or whether different G proteins use the same binding site.
Here we analyzed the specificity of interaction between  mDia isoforms and Rho proteins.
We show that Rho, Rac, and  Cdc42 use a similar binding site and that most of the specificity  is determined by a Asn-Asn-Asn (triple N) motif of mDia1 that  is replaced by Thr-Ser-His (TSH) in mDia2 and -3.
On the Rho  site, specificity is determined by a Phe-His substitution of Phe106.
We also observe for the first time that the insert helix, a  specific hallmark of Rho proteins, is involved in effector binding  and specificity.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Recombinant ProteinsProteins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusions using the vector pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences).
All proteins were expressed in Escherichia  coli BL21(DE3) cells.
Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.7 (37 C,  160 rpm) and induced with 100 M isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 20 C for mDiaN and mDiaN-TSH and  at 18 C for RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42.
Cells were harvested and  resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM  NaCl, 2 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 5 mM MgCl2 in cases of  RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) containing 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mM EDTA.
Cells were lysed by microfluidizing; the extract was applied to a GSH-Sepharose column  (Amersham Biosciences), and the column was washed with  buffer B (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM -mercaptoethanol, 5 mM MgCl2).
The fusion protein was digested  with 5 units of thrombin (Serva) per mg of glutathione S-transferase fusion protein on the column overnight at 4 C.
Final  purification was done with size exclusion chromatography in  buffer B using a Superdex S200 for mDiaN and mDiaN-TSH or  S75 for RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42.
  Point mutations were made using the QuikChange method  of Stratagene.
Mutant proteins were purified like the wild type  proteins.
Concentrations of mDiaN and mDiaN-TSH were  determined using the absorption at 280 nm under denaturing  conditions with the extinction coefficient deduced from the  sequence, and RhoA/Cdc42/Rac1 concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay.
Rho was purified and loaded with  Gpp(NH)p and mant-Gpp(NH)p as described elsewhere (35).
  Rac1 and Cdc42 were purified using the same strategy.
  Stopped-flow KineticsThe experiments were done at 20 C  using a SX18 MW Applied Photophysics apparatus (Leatherhead, UK).
The mant fluorophore (Molecular Probes) was  excited at 366 nm with a bandpass of 6.4 nm.
Emission (at 450  Interactions between mDia Isoforms and Rho Proteins  DECEMBER 12, 2008VOLUME 283NUMBER 50 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 35237   by guest on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from nm) was recorded using a 408-nm cutoff filter.
All measurements were done with a final concentration of 100 nM mantGpp(NH)p-loaded GNBP/mutated GNBP.
Increasing concentrations of wild type or mutant mDiaN (115 M) were used in  the experiments using pseudo first-order conditions.
The  observed fluorescence transients were fitted to a single exponential function to obtain kobs.
The association rate constant  kon was derived from the slope of kobs versus protein concentration.
The dissociation rate constants were obtained by mixing a  preformed 100 nM mDiaNRhoAmant-Gpp(NH)p (or mutated  proteins) complex with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Rho protein.
All measurements were done in buffer C (300 mM NaCl, 50  mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM -mercaptoethanol, 5 mM MgCl2),  which in experiments with RhoA additionally contained 5 mM  MgCl2.
GraFit 3.05.0 was used for data analysis.
  ITC MeasurementsThe interaction of mDiaN/mDiaN-TSH  and RhoA/Cdc42/Rac1 and DAD-(11451200) and mutants  was done by ITC based on Wiseman et al. (64) (MicroCalTM;  VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter).
All measurements were carried  out in buffer B at 20 C.
DAD, RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 (or  mutants) (syringe) were stepwise-injected to the mDiaN,  mDiaN-TSH solution (cell).
The heating power per injection  was observed over the reaction time until equilibrium was  reached.
The data were analyzed using the software provided by  the manufacturer.
  Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution  Crystals of the mDiaN[TSH] domain (69 451) in complex with  Cdc42-(1178)Gpp(NH)p were grown in buffer D containing  Bistris propane, pH 8.8 (pH adjusted with citric acid), 26%  PEG3350, 250 mM sodium tartrate to a size of 100  200   100 M using the hanging drop/vapor diffusion method.
The  protein was solved in buffer B containing 100 mM NaCl, 20  mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 5 mM  MgCl2.
1 l of protein solution of various concentrations  (2.5, 5, and 10 g/l) was mixed with the reservoir solution.
  After 1 day crystals were grown to their final size and flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen using reservoir solution with 35%  PEG3350 as cryoprotectant.
  Data set collection has been performed at the Swiss Light  Source, Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland (Table 4).
  The native dataset was collected at 100 K on beam line PXII at a  wavelength of 0.95  using a Mar225 CCD detector.
Data were  indexed, integrated, and scaled with the XDS package (65).
  Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement with  the program Molrep (66) using the mDiaNRhoC (PDB code  1Z2C) as a search model.
The initial solution containing two  Cdc42Gpp(NH)pmDiaN-TSH complexes per asymmetric unit  was subjected to crystallographic simulated annealing as implemented in CNS (67).
The program Coot (68) was used to build  the model into the 2Fo  Fc and Fo  Fc maps in iterative rounds  of NCS refinement, including translation, liberation, and  screw-rotation parameters with REFMAC (69).
The final model  has a good geometry with 100% of all residues in the allowed  regions of the Ramachandran plot as judged by the Molprobity  server (70).
A summary of data collection and refinement statistics is given in Table 4.
Figures of molecular structures were  prepared with PyMOL (71).
  CoordinatesThe structure factors and coordinates have  been deposited at the PDB with PDB code 3EG5.
  RESULTS  Specificity of the DAD-N-terminal Auto-inhibitory InteractionActivation of mDia1 involves binding of RhoGTP,  which actively dissociates the interaction between the regulatory N terminus and the C-terminal DAD of mDia1 (32) (see  Fig. 1A for domain organization of mDia1).
The crystal structure of the [mDiaNDAD] complex showed that the DCR (see  Fig. 1B for an alignment of DCRs) forms an -helix that interacts mainly via hydrophobic interactions with the ARR of  mDiaN and that the binding sites of DAD and RhoAGpp(NH)p  on mDiaN are partially overlapping such that a ternary complex  cannot be formed (32).
Although the C-terminal basic region  1196RRKRG1200 of DCR is not visible in the crystal structure  (32), its deletion in DAD-(11451200) reduces the affinity  toward mDiaN 73-fold to 8 M (Fig. 1C), as determined by ITC.
  To exclude that this extra part of DAD interferes with the Rhobinding site and thereby contributes to specificity, we tried to  locate the binding site for the basic region of DAD in mDiaN.  We reasoned that a negatively charged patch near the third  helix of ARM5 and the Dim domain could represent the binding site of the basic motif.
Single, double, and triple mutants of  acidic residues were introduced (E358R, E358R/E362R, and  E358R/E362R/E366R, respectively), and binding of the mutant  constructs toward DAD-(11451200)was followed by ITC.
  Although only marginal effects on affinity could be measured  for the single point mutation (E358R), an additive effect on  affinities is observed for the single, double, and triple mutant  (388 nM, 1.01 M, and 2.15 M) (Fig. 1C) with the affinities  converging to the value measured for the DAD construct lacking the C-terminal basic region.
These experiments clearly  establish that the C-terminal basic region of DAD interacts  with the negatively charged patch located on mDiaN remote  from the Rho-binding sites (Fig. 1D).
Thus, an involvement of  this part of DAD in generating specificity toward activated Rho  proteins appears unlikely.
  Major Specificity DeterminantsBy analyzing the RhoC  mDiaN complex structure and comparing them to the sequence  of mDia2 and -3, we identified a triple Asn motif (Asn-164  166) of mDia1 in the central portion of the interface, which is  replaced by TSH in mDia2/3 (Fig. 2, A and C).
Asn-165 and  Asn-166 are located in the loop connecting ARM1 (ARM is  Armadillo repeat motif) and ARM2 of the ARR of mDiaN and  are apparently required for the correct positioning of the Arg68R (throughout the whole text, superscripts R, C, NNN, and  TSH indicate residues of Rho, Cdc42, wild type mDiaN-NNN,  and mutated mDiaN-TSH, respectively), a residue being highly  crucial for the binding because it wedges deeply into the space  between the GBDN and ARR subdomains of mDiaN (35) (Fig.  2C).
From the residues of Rho that are in interaction distance  with the triple Asn motif only, Phe-106 is variant among Rho,  Rac, and Cdc42, and in the latter two it is replaced by His (Fig. 2,  B and C).
This together with our previous finding that mutation  of F106H in Rho drastically reduces the affinity to mDia1 (35)  argue for Phe-106 of Rho and His-104 of Cdc42/Rac being  major determinants of affinity and probably specificity on the G  Interactions between mDia Isoforms and Rho Proteins  35238 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 283NUMBER 50DECEMBER 12, 2008   by guest on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from protein site.
Because constructs of mDia2 and -3 were not available in soluble form, we mutated the mDia triple Asn motif to  Thr-Ser-His (termed mDiaN-TSH) to produce a mimic of  mDia2 and mDia3 for studying its influence on specificity of  Rho family proteins to mDia isoforms.
  Although the interaction between RhoA (bound to  Gpp(NH)p) and mDiaN could previously not be detected by  isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) under high salt conditions (300 mM NaCl, see Experimental Procedures), a KD of 9  nM could conveniently be determined at low salt, with favorable  values for enthalpy and entropy (Fig. 3A and Table 2).
This is  very similar to what was previously found by stopped-flow fluorescence measurements under high (35) or low salt,3 indicating that the affinity is not salt-sensitive in contrast to the  enthalpy of the reaction.
Furthermore, insertion of the TSH  motif into mDiaN did not affect its binding affinities to DADs of  mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3, as confirmed by ITC (Table 1).
We then  investigated binding of RhoA, Rac1,  or Cdc42 to mDiaN and mDiaNTSH using ITC (Fig. 3 and Table 2).
  Whereas mutation of the triple N  motif to TSH does not change the  affinity toward RhoA (9 nM) (Fig. 3,  A and B), it increases affinity toward  Cdc42 and Rac1 such that it  becomes easily measurable (Fig. 3, C  and D).
Although the interaction of  RhoA toward either mDiaN or  mDiaN-TSH is highly exothermic,  driven by both enthalpy and  entropy, the interactions of Cdc42  and Rac1 toward mDiaN or mDiaNTSH, are endothermic, with a compensating favorable entropy.
As a  control we also measured binding of  DAD-(11451200) to mDiaN-TSH,  which was basically unperturbed as  compared with WT, an endothermic enthalpy, and a KD of 115 nM  (Table 1).
  We further assayed via ITC the  influence of the Phe-106 to His substitution in Rho and of His-104 to  Phe in Rac1 and Cdc42 on binding  to mDiaN and mDiaN-TSH.
Mutation of Phe-106 to His in RhoA leads  to 20-fold reduced affinity to mDiaN  and to a drastically reduced affinity  to mDiaN-TSH (KD  1418 nM),  whereas wild type RhoA has an  equal affinity to both mDiaN and  mDiaN-TSH (KD  9 nM in both  cases).
For Rac1 and Cdc42 the  exchange of His-104 with the more  hydrophobic Phe in turn increases  the affinities of Cdc42 and Rac toward mDia1N by 55- and  28-fold, respectively, and is similar with either the triple N or  TSH motif (Fig. 3, E and F, and Table 2).
  A notable feature of the His-Phe substitutions is that introduction of Phe dramatically alters the enthalpy of the binding  reaction (Fig. 3 and Table 2).
For Rac1 and Cdc42, the H104F  mutation shifts the reaction enthalpy of binding from endothermic to exothermic, with a difference in H of between 3.7  and 4.6 kcal/mol, irrespective of whether wild type or mDiaNTSH is used.
Although this leads to an increase in affinity, it is  still partly diminished by a decrease in favorable (positive)  entropy of G of 1.52.2 kcal/mol, an effect often observed in  protein-protein interactions as the so-called enthalpy-entropy  compensation (72).
For RhoA the opposite F106H exchange is  less dramatic, with a decrease in favorable enthalpy of 1.4 (for  WT) and 2 kcal/mol (for TSH), and does not significantly modify the entropy term of the binding reaction.
This, at least in  part, explains why RhoA shows the highest affinity to both 3 M. Lammers, unpublished data.

  Interactions between mDia Isoforms and Rho Proteins  DECEMBER 12, 2008VOLUME 283NUMBER 50 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 35239   by guest on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from mDiaN and mDiaN-TSH compared with Rac1(H104F) and  Cdc42(H104F).
Rho binding is tighter because of favorable  enthalpy and entropy contributions.
  Rho Insert Helix and SpecificityFrom the biochemical  experiments presented above, it is obvious that the specificity  and affinity of the interactions between mDia isoforms and Rho  subfamily members is not entirely due to the central contact  point located between the GBD and ARR subdomains of mDia.
  A particular structural feature of Rho proteins is an extra helix  located between the fifth -strand and the fourth -helix of the  canonical Ras fold, the so-called Rho insert helix (Fig. 4).
In the  crystal structure of the RhomDia complex, the Rho insert helix  is close enough to the interface to assume a contribution to the  interaction (Fig. 4A).
Residues in direct contact distance (cutoff  level 3.6 ) include Lys-133R and Met-134R from one partner  and Glu-345NNN and Asn-346NNN from the other partner.
The  interaction is mediated via a salt bridge between Lys-133R and  Glu-345NNN, which then enables Met-134R and Asn-346NNN to  come into van der Waals interaction distance. Although not  directly involved in the interaction with Rho, Ile-299NNN  appears to play a crucial role in stabilizing the spatial integrity of  the insert helix-binding site via a long range hydrophobic interaction with Ile-344NNN, which then can correctly position GluFIGURE 2.

Strikingly, there is considerable  sequence variability for the residues involved in this interaction  among Rho proteins and mDia isoforms (Fig. 4, B and C).
  Although Asn-346NNN is completely conserved among mDia1,  -2, and -3, Glu-345 present in both mDia1 and -2 (Glu-368) is  replaced by Lys (Lys-360) (Fig. 4B) in mDia3.
Lys-133 of Rho is  also present in Cdc42 (Lys-131), whereas Rac1 has a Glu-131 at  this position.
Met-134 of Rho in turn is replaced by Asn-132 in  Cdc42 and by Lys-132 in Rac1 (Fig. 4C).
  We thus studied the influence of residues involved in this  interaction via stopped-flow binding kinetics (results are summarized in Table 3).
Replacing the positively charged Lys-133R  by a negatively charged Glu to disrupt the salt bridge with Glu345D results in an 8-fold decreased affinity caused by an 8-fold  decrease in the association rate constant ka.
Surprisingly, mutation of Glu-345D to Lys shows only a very small decrease in  affinity to RhoA. Mutation of Met-134NNN to Glu decreases the  affinity of Rho to mDiaN by a factor of 2, whereas mutation of  Met-134NNN to Ala has no effect implying that electrostatic  repulsion between the negative charges of M134ER and Glu345NNN has more impact on the affinity than the decreased  hydrophobic interactions resulting from the M134AR  exchange.
Mutation of Lys-135R  , conserved among Rho proteins but not directly involved in the interaction, to Ala and to  Glu does not show an effect on binding.
Interestingly, mutation  of Ile-299NNN, which does not directly interact with RhoC in  the crystal structure, to either Ala or Glu drastically reduces the  affinity to Rho by 3000- and 7000-fold, respectively, which is  mainly due to a 2250- and 3600-fold increase in the dissociation  rate constant, respectively. Because binding of DAD is not  affected by the Ile-299NNN mutations as confirmed by ITC  measurements (data not shown), we conclude that the Ile299NNN mutations disturb the local structural integrity of the  interface to the Rho insert helix.
  Structure of the Cdc42Gpp(NH)pmDiaN-TSH Complex  To analyze the structural basis of the determinants of specificity, we solved the x-ray structure of the complex between  Cdc42Gpp(NH)p and the mDiaN-TSH mutant.
Due to the only  micromolar affinity of the complex, Cdc42Gpp(NH)p and  mDiaN-TSH were purified separately and mixed with 1:1 stoichiometry prior to crystallization.
Initial crystals of the space  group P321 were optimized to a final size of 100  200  100  m suitable for data collection.
Molecular replacement with  the RhoCmDiaN complex (PDB 1Z2C) structure as search  model revealed a solution with two Cdc42mDiaN-TSH complexes per asymmetric unit, which eventually was refined to 2.7   resolution (see Table 4 for data collection and refinement  statistics).
The overall structure is very similar to that of the  RhoCmDiaN complex, with Cdc42 occupying the same binding  site as RhoC and no appreciable differences in the GBD and the  ARR subdomains (Fig. 5, A and B) reflected in the low root  mean square deviation value of 1.65 . Superimposition of  Cdc42mDiaN-TSH-with the three available structures of  mDiaN, in complex with DAD (32,  41) and with RhoCGpp(NH)p (35),  reveals that the dimerization  domain is oriented differently in  each of these structures (Fig. 5B)  due to different bending of the  C-terminal half of the long helix  (17) connecting ARR and Dim  (Fig. 5C).
The orientation of  Cdc42Gpp(NH)p in the mDiaNTSH complex is essentially the same  as RhoGpp(NH)p in the mDiaN  complex (Fig. 5B), and the structures of both G proteins are basically identical (Fig. 5D).

  Because of sequence comparison with the consensus Armadillo  repeat motifs, we now consider the first Armadillo repeat of  mDiaN to be incomplete rather then the ARM5.
ARM1 contains only the second and the third -helices.
17 is thus the  third -helix of ARM5.
The differences in 17 and ARM5 positions indicate a conformational flexibility of the dimerization  domain relative to the rest of the molecule.
  Structural Basis of SpecificityA schematic summary of the  interactions found in the Cdc42mDiaN-TSH complex structure is given in Fig. 6A.
The superimposition of the two complex  structures reveals that the regions involved in complex formation overall align quite well.
Cdc42 binds via switch I and switch  II regions in a basically analogous manner as described previously for the Rho complex (34, 35).
The switch I region, as  already observed for the Rho complex, exclusively interacts  with the GBD of mDia (Fig. 6B).
Residue Phe-37C in switch I  undergoes hydrophobic interactions with the aliphatic side  chains of both Met-115TSH and Leu-104TSH, although Phe-37C  adapts a different rotameric conformation as compared with  Phe-39R in the Rho complex.
Although in the Rho complex a  salt bridge is formed between Glu-40R and Lys-107NNN, no  such interaction is found for the corresponding residue Asp38C probably due to its smaller side chain impeding a closer  distance to the -amino group of Lys-107TSH (Fig. 6B).
In line  with this, the electron density for the side chain of Lys-107TSH is  less well defined arguing for more flexibility because of a weaker  interaction.
The absence of this salt bridge may thus contribute  to the weaker affinity of Cdc42 to mDiaN-TSH as compared  with Rho.
  A notable feature of the switch II region is that it is invariant  among Rho isoforms AC, Cdc42, and Rac isoforms 13.
As in  the Rho complex, switch II of Cdc42 interacts with both the  GBDN and the ARR subdomains.
In the superimposition of the  two complexes, the switch II regions almost perfectly align (Fig.  6C).
The side chain of Asp-67R displays a polar contact to the  side chain of Asn-164NNN in the triple NNN motif.
No such  interaction can be formed with Asp-65C because of the N165T  mutation in mDiaN-TSH.
Here the -methyl group of Thr164TSH points toward the carboxyl side chain of Asp-65C.
The  orientation of Arg-66C is almost identical to that of Arg-68R  ,  which we have previously proven to be one of the major contributors of the affinity of Rho to mDia binding (35).
  The higher resolution of the Cdc42mDiaN-TSH complex  structure allowed us to localize protein-bound solvent.
Two  water molecules are coordinated in the polar interface surrounding switch II of Cdc42 and the GBDN and the ARR subdomain (Fig. 6C).
Wat195 is coordinated by the main chain  carbonyl of Thr-164TSH and the side chain amino group of Asn217TSH and closely located to the guanidinium side chain of  Arg-66C.
A second water molecule, Wat189, is caged by hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Met-94TSH and Asp-63C  and the main chain nitrogen atom of Asp-65C.
Although the  lower resolution of the RhomDiaN complex structure did not  reveal such details, enough space in combination with an equivalent protein anatomy is present for a similar water coordination network.
  The major difference between mDia1 and mDia2/3 in the G  protein binding interface is the NNN-TSH substitution.
In the  superimposition of the two complex structures, the NNN motif  and the THS motif adapt the same backbone conformation (Fig.  6C).
The -amido group of the Asn-165NNN side chain is  involved in a polar contact to the carboxyl group of Glu-102R  .
  Furthermore, Asn-165NNN forms a hydrophobic interaction to  Phe-106R via its -methyl group.
In contrast, Ser-165TSH is only  involved in the formation of a nonpolar interaction with its  -methyl group and His-104C.
Both Asn-166NNN and His166TSH interact via their main chain carbonyl with the side  chain of Arg-68R  /Arg-66C.
The side chain of His-166TSH presents a more extended hydrophobic surface for interaction with  His-104C compared with the smaller polar side chain of Asn166NNN.
A space-filling representation in this area of the interface shows a better complementation with the more bulky  hydrophobic side chain of His-166TSH compared with the  smaller polar side chain of Asn-166NNN (Fig. 7, A and B).
In the  case of mDiaN-NNN, a tunnel large enough to harbor water  molecules is located close to the hydrophobic surface created  by His-105R and Phe-106R (Fig. 7A), whereas this tunnel is completely occluded in the Cdc42mDiaN-TSH complex by the  TABLE 3  Stopped-flow kinetic analysis of interaction of WT and mutant Rho  with mDiaN  The following abbreviations are used: kd, dissociation rate constant; ka, association  rate constant; KD, kd/ka where KD is dissociation equilibrium constant.

  Interactions between mDia Isoforms and Rho Proteins  DECEMBER 12, 2008VOLUME 283NUMBER 50 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 35243   by guest on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from bulkier side chain of H166C, which creates a continuous hydrophobic surface (Fig. 7B).
We thus believe that the more  extended hydrophobic surface offered to His-103C and His104C, the better space complementation and the occlusion of a  solvent-filled tunnel in the Cdc42-binding surface on mDia are  responsible for the increased affinity of Cdc42 toward  mDiaN-TSH.
  Although the RhomDiaN complex shows an additional contact between the C-terminal end of the Rho insert helix and the  ARR (Fig. 4A), no such interaction is present in the  Cdc42mDiaN-TSH complex structure, and the distance  between the corresponding elements is longer (Fig. 5, B and D,  and Fig. 7C).
Instead, the -amino group of Lys-131C forms an  intramolecular salt bridge with Glu-127C thereby neutralizing  the positive charge of Lys-131C.
In contrast, the residue corresponding to Glu-127C is Arg-129R  , which might even amplify  the positive charge on Lys-133R thus strengthening the ionic  interaction with Glu-345NNN (compare Fig. 4C).
Notably, in  Rac1 Arg-129R is replaced by Glu-127Rac, and Lys-133R is  replaced by the negatively charged Glu-131Rac and could thus  be responsible for the differences in binding affinity toward  mDia isoforms.
  DISCUSSION  Here we have extended our analysis of the interaction of the  N-terminal part of mDia with their cognate G proteins and  whether this affects the auto-inhibitory regulation of these  formins.
We have furthermore dissected the molecular details  of the interface between Rho proteins and mDia to derive explanations for the specificity of their interactions.
  First, we show that the C-terminal polybasic region of the  C-terminal auto-inhibitory region does not overlap with the G  protein-binding site.
In previous structures of the mDiaNDAD  complexes (32, 41), only 16 residues comprising the DCR forming an amphipathic helix were visible.
Mutational analysis  shows that the effect of mutating the negative charges C-terminal to the DCR has an additive effect on the affinity of a DAD  peptide for the N terminus.
Although the release of autoinhibition by the binding of Rho is mediated by the mutual exclusive  binding of the core DAD region and G proteins, as analyzed  previously by biochemistry and structure (32, 40, 41), our studies here further confirm and extend previous assumptions that  the binding sites of G proteins and DAD relevant for affinity are  only partially overlapping.
The mutations in the polybasic  DAD-binding region on mDiaN did not influence Rho binding  (RhoA-mDiaN E358R/E362R, 9 nM; RhoA-mDiaN E358R/  E362R/E366R, 16 nM; data not shown).
This is strengthened by  our biochemical data that show that any of the mutations that  influence specificity and affinity of Rho binding have almost no  effect on DAD binding (Table 1) (32, 35).
It should be added  that the DAD regions of mDia1, -2, and -3 are sufficiently conserved, such that they bind with almost equal affinity to the  N-terminal part of mDia1, such that inhibition in trans between  mDia isoforms cannot be excluded (Table 1).
  We also show that Cdc42 binds in exactly the same position  as Rho and that the specificity of interaction between Rho, Rac,  Cdc42 versus mDia1, -2, and -3 isoforms is mediated mostly by  two surface epitopes in the complex interface.
Surprisingly, the  specificity is not dictated by sequence differences in the switch  regions even though both of them are involved in the interaction but is in line with the high sequence conservation of the  FIGURE 6.

  Interactions between mDia Isoforms and Rho Proteins  35244 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 283NUMBER 50DECEMBER 12, 2008   by guest on March 4, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from switches.
A minor contribution to specificity comes from the  switch I residue Glu-40 in Rho, which in Rac and Cdc42 is  Asp-38.
Switch II is completely conserved between Rho, Rac,  and Cdc42 and is involved in a large number of interactions.
  The first specificity epitope occurs in the central portion of  the interface where the mDia1 NNN motif is replaced by the  TSH motif of mDia2 and -3.
The crucial Arg-68R residue in  switch II, which inserts like a wedge into the interface formed  between GBD and ARR subdomains, is one of the most important mediators of the interaction and is conserved as Arg-66 in  Rac/Cdc42.
The substitution relevant for affinity and specificity  is the replacement of Phe-106 by His-104 in Cdc42/Rac.
The  structural analysis shows that the structures of the NNN and  TSH motifs, which form a loop connecting the third helix of  ARM1 and the first helix of the ARM2 of the mDiaN ARR,  superimpose very well.
The major effect of the replacements  seems to be a more complementary interface that is formed  when His-104C points toward the TSH rather than the NNN  module.
In the latter case a solvent-accessible tunnel remains in  the interface and would thus trap water molecules in the  Cdc42-mDia1 interface which would be negatively affecting the  affinity.
Our data also show that the Phe-106 residue in this part  of the interface is more important for high affinity than the  NNN motif, because its introduction into Rac increases affinity  drastically, whereas the effect is less pronounced in Cdc42.
  The second epitope involved in specificity is formed by the  Rho insert helix that contacts the ARR subdomain at the loop  connecting 16 and 17 of ARM5 of mDiaN. The insert helix is  a particular feature unique to the Rho subfamily of the Ras  superfamily.
Although the Rho insert helix has been implicated  previously to be involved in a number of biological effects, i.e.  the interaction of Rac with the NADPH oxidase (73) or for Rho  kinase activation by RhoA (74) and to be essential for membrane ruffling (75), no structural analysis has yet shown such an  interaction.
The evidence for the involvement of the insert helix  has mostly come from deletion experiments that may or may  not produce a proper folding protein.4 The analysis here shows  for the first time that the insert helix makes a substantial contribution to the affinity but may be even more important for the  specificity.
Although the interface between Rho and mDia1 is  very tight and complementary, the interface between Cdc42  and the mDia-TSH mutant leaves much space between the corresponding epitopes.
Although the difference in complementarity cannot directly be assigned to particular residues, the  sequence differences in the area are sufficiently different  between the three mDia isoforms to assume a significantly different surface.
Our mutational analysis shows that residues  apparently not directly involved in this interface have nevertheless a large effect on binding affinity.
We can thus speculate that  the replacement of the contact area by the respective sequences  from mDia2 and -3 would, in conjunction with the TSH motif,  create a high affinity protein for Rac and/or Cdc42.
  Previously, we have shown that Rho actively displaces DAD  from binding to the N-terminal region of mDia (34).
Due to the  partial overlap of RhoGTP and DAD, we have postulated a  two-step binding mechanism in which the G protein makes a  preliminary contact for a loosely bound complex in a first step.
  In a second step, steric interference and charge-charge repulsion lead to dissociation of DAD and formation of a tight complex.
In such a scenario, the Rho insert helix might thus make a  first weak interaction which, however, already differentiates  between the Rho isoforms RhoA, -B, and -C and Cdc42/Rac.
  The second step involves the central portion of the interface,  where the interaction with the NNN or TSH motif leads to a  tight binding complex where DAD is released and the FH2  domain is ready to polymerize actin.
Whether or not the FH2  domains, once released from auto-inhibited mDia, have the  same activity toward actin polymerization remains to be  determined.
