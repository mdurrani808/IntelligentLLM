T Cell Receptor Binding Transition States and Recognition of Peptide/MHC   Rebecca L. Davis-Harrison, Francis K. Insaidoo, and Brian M. Baker*,,  Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Walther Cancer Research Center, 251 Nieuwland Science Hall,  UniVersity of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556  ReceiVed August 21, 2006; ReVised Manuscript ReceiVed NoVember 20, 2006  ABSTRACT: T cell receptor recognition of peptide/MHC has been described as proceeding through a twostep process in which the TCR first contacts the MHC molecule prior to formation of the binding transition  state using the germline-encoded CDR1 and CDR2 loops.
The receptor then contacts the peptide using  the hypervariable CDR3 loops as the transition state decays to the bound state.
The model subdivides  TCR binding into peptide-independent and peptide-dependent steps, demarcated at the binding transition  state. Investigating the two-step model, here we show that two TCRs that recognize the same peptide/  MHC bury very similar amounts of solvent-accessible surface area in their transition states.
However,  1300-1500 2 of surface area is buried in each, a significant amount suggestive of participation of peptide  and associated CDR3 surface.
Consistent with this interpretation, analysis of peptide and TCR variants  indicates that stabilizing contacts to the peptide are formed within both transition states.
These data are  incompatible with the original two-step model, as are transition state models built using the principle of  minimal frustration commonly employed in the investigation of protein folding and binding transition  states.
These findings will be useful in further explorations of the nature of TCR binding transition states,  as well as ongoing efforts to understand the mechanisms by which T cell receptors recognize the composite  peptide/MHC surface.
  T cell receptor (TCR)1 recognition of a peptide bound and  presented by a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  molecule is required for the initiation and propagation of a  cellular immune response, as well as selection of the T cell  repertoire.
Structural studies of TCR-peptide/MHC ternary  complexes have indicated that TCRs contact both the peptide  and the MHC molecule, with the MHC typically contributing  two-thirds or more of the contacted surface area (1).
Despite  the small contribution of the peptide to the buried surface,  TCRs generally maintain high levels of peptide specificity,  but this is contrasted by an inherent cross-reactivity (reviewed  in refs 2 and 3).
This duality of specificity and crossreactivity is a key feature of T cell biology, yet a clear picture  of its physical basis has yet to emerge.
Although recent  descriptions of cross-reactive binding suggest that it remains  highly peptide-specific (3, 4), degenerate peptide/MHC  binding has been implicated in a variety of T cell functions,  including thymic selection (5), the scanning of multiple  peptides (6), and TCR signaling (7).
  On the basis of  analysis (8), or the effects of mutations  on association kinetics relative to their effects on binding  affinities, Wu et al. have proposed a conceptually appealing  yet controversial two-step model for TCR recognition of  peptide/MHC (9).
This model, which neatly integrates the  concepts of peptide specificity and binding degeneracy, posits  that the germline-encoded TCR CDR1 and/or CDR2 loops  are driven to contact the MHC molecule early in the  recognition process, prior to the occurrence of the TCRpeptide/MHC binding transition state.
Contacts to the peptide  are then made as the transition state decays to the bound  state.
The model subdivides the ligand recognition process  into peptide-independent and peptide-dependent steps, demarcated at the binding transition state.
  Other than the  analysis of Wu et al. (9), there have  been few characterizations of TCR-peptide/MHC transition  states that could yield insight into this process.
A number  of studies have measured activation energies for TCR binding  (6, 10-12), indicating that movement of a TCR from the  unbound state to the transition state is typically characterized  by a high activation enthalpy and either a positive or negative  activation entropy.
However, as these thermodynamic values  are also dependent upon the properties of the unligated  proteins, they cannot be directly used to infer structural  details about the association phase of the binding reaction.
  An exception is the elegant study of Lee et al. (12), who  showed that the G10 TCR recognizes a native and single  amino acid variant HIV epitope bound to the class I MHC  HLA-A2 with nearly identical activation thermodynamics,  despite the observation that the two peptides have different  conformations in the free peptide/MHC complexes.

  1840 Biochemistry 2007, 46, 1840-1850  10.1021/bi061702p CCC: $37.00  2007 American Chemical Society  Published on Web 01/24/2007TCR-bound states, these results suggest that peptide conformational changes occur upon relaxation from the transition  state to the bound state, i.e., after formation of the TCRpeptide/MHC transition state.
  A6 and B7 are two different TCRs that both recognize  the Tax peptide (LLFGYPVYV) presented by HLA-A2.
The  A6 and B7 TCRs bind Tax/HLA-A2 with nearly identical  affinities and kinetics, and they both bury approximately  2000 2 of solvent-accessible surface area in the bound state  (10, 13, 14).
We recently showed that the thermodynamics  associated with movement from the unbound states to the  transition states are also very similar for A6 and B7, although  there are large differences in the thermodynamics for  movement from the transition states to the bound states (10).
  The similarities in the association phases of the A6 and B7  binding reactions are consistent with a common association  mechanism as predicted by the two-step binding model,  although, as noted above, the thermodynamic values provide  no details regarding the structural properties of the transition  states.
  To gain further insight into the nature of the A6 and B7  binding transition states (or, more formally, the transition  state ensembles), we used m values, or the dependence of  free energies on denaturant, to measure the amount of  solvent-accessible surface area buried in the two binding  transition states.
Again consistent with the two-step model,  we find that the A6 and B7 transition states are very  similar: both transition states bury 65-70% of the total  buried surface area, amounting to 1300-1500 2  .
However,  burial of such a large amount of surface in either transition  state is unlikely to be achieved by the germline-encoded  CDR1 and CDR2 loops alone, suggesting large contributions  from the CDR3 loops and the Tax peptide.
Consistent with  this interpretation, analysis of peptide and TCR variants via   analysis indicates that stabilizing contacts to the central  tyrosine of the Tax peptide are formed within both transition  states.
The data are thus in conflict with the two-step model  as originally formulated, as are transition state models  generated using the principle of minimal frustration (i.e.,  binding reactions proceeding with a low probability for  contacts in the transition state that are not present in the  bound state) (15-17).
These results are discussed in terms  of both specific A6 and B7 recognition of Tax/HLA-A2 and  TCR recognition of peptide/MHC in general and will be  useful in further explorations of the nature of TCR binding  transition states and ongoing efforts to understand the  mechanisms by which T cell receptors recognize the  composite peptide/MHC surface.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Proteins and Peptides.
Wild-type and mutant A6 and B7  TCRs and peptide/HLA-A2 complexes were refolded from  Escherichia coli inclusion bodies and purified as described  (10).
Peptide/HLA-A2 concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically as described (10).
Peptides were synthesized and purified locally using an ABI 433A instrument.
  Peptide purity and molecular weight were confirmed by  analytical HPLC/mass spectrometry.
The S31RA and Y104A  mutants of the A6 and B7 TCRs were generated via  QuickChange mutagenesis (Strategene) and refolded and  purified similarly to wild type.
Mutations were confirmed  via forward and reverse DNA sequencing.
  Biacore Measurements.
Steady-state and kinetic Biacore  experiments were performed as described (10).
Briefly, A6  or B7 TCR was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip using amine  coupling.
Peptide/MHC was injected over both reference and  ligand-coupled cells simultaneously, and each injection was  repeated twice.
For steady-state experiments, a flow rate of  5 L/min was used.
Two separate concentration series were  injected, from 1 to 50 M. For kinetic experiments, the flow  rate was 100 L/min.
Two separate concentration series were  injected, ranging from 3 to 100 M depending on the  experiment.
All injections were double-referenced using  buffer injections and protein injections over a blank flow  cell (18).
Experiments were performed at 25 C in HBS-EP  buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA,  0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) prepared in our laboratory  with the indicated concentration of urea.
HBS-EP/urea  solutions were made fresh the day of each experiment.
In  the urea experiments, to minimize any influence of weaker  peptide binding to HLA-A2, we avoided the use of low Tax/  HLA-A2 concentrations and maintained the Biacore sample  block at 4 C.
  Analysis of Binding and Dissociation Data.
Binding and  dissociation data as a function of urea concentration were  analyzed globally to provide free energy changes in the  absence of urea and the derivatives of G with respect to  urea concentration, or m values.
For the steady-state binding  data, 22 (A6) or 24 (B7) data sets were fit globally to a  single-site binding model of the form:  where K was represented as  RUmax in eq 1 was a local variable for each data set indicating  the activity of each surface, whereas G and m  eq in eq 2  were global variables common to all data sets.
G thus  represents the binding free energy change in the absence of  urea, and m  eq represents G/[urea].
For presentation of  the steady-state binding data in Figure 1, each data set was  normalized to its fitted RUmax to illustrate the effects of urea  on binding.
  For dissociation data, 55 (A6) or 44 (B7) Biacore  dissociation phases were normalized to the beginning value  and globally fit to a single-exponential decay of the form:  where k was represented as  A0 and b in eq 3 were local variables for each data set  indicating initial amplitudes and baseline offsets, whereas  Goff  q and moff  q in eq 4 were global variables common to all  data.
Goff  q represents the activation free energy for dissociation in the absence of urea, and moff  q represents  Goff  q /[urea].
Approximately 2 s of data was excluded  from the beginning of the Biacore dissociation phases to  RU ) RUmax  K[Tax/HLA-A2]  1 + K[Tax/HLA-A2] (1)  K ) exp(- G + m  eq[urea]  RT ) (2)  y ) A0 exp(-kt) + b (3)  k ) (  kbT  h ) exp(- Goff  q + moff  q [urea]  RT ) (4)  TCR Binding Transition States Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 7, 2007 1841account for disturbances arising from subtraction of the bulk  refractive index shift.
The differing number of data sets for  A6 vs B7 was due to the improved activity of A6 on Biacore  CM5 sensor surfaces (10).
No statistically significant changes  were seen in the fitted global parameters if the number of  A6 dissociation phases fitted was reduced to the same  number of B7 dissociation phases, owing to the large number  of degrees of freedom in the global analyses (see below).
  Global analysis was performed with OriginPro 7.5 (OriginLab).
The steady-state analyses had 257 degrees of freedom  for the measurements with A6 and 219 for the measurements  with B7.
The dissociation analyses had 13091 degrees of  freedom for A6 and 9775 for B7.
There was no significant  parameter correlation in any of the four analyses.
Values of  R2 for each fit were >0.99.
  The value of mon  q , or the dependence of the activation free  energy for association on urea concentration, was calculated  from the sum of m  eq and moff  q .
We used this approach rather  than fitting Biacore on-rates as a function of urea, as offrates are more objectively determined by surface plasmon  resonance and more easily lend themselves to the kind of  global analyses performed here.
Furthermore, the concentrations used in the kinetic experiments were not optimal for  determining accurate on-rates across all urea concentrations  (18).
  Errors in m values were propagated to account for the error  in mon  q and the mon  q /m  eq ratio.
 values were determined  using -ln(kon,mutant/kon,wild type)/ln(KD,mutant/KD,wild type), accounting for and propagating experimental error in rates and  equilibrium constants to arrive at experimental errors in .  When both were available, calculations of  values used  affinities determined by steady-state rather than kinetic  measurements.
Error propagation was performed using  standard statistical approaches as described (10).
All errors  and error bars are reported at one standard deviation.
  Binding data for the TCR mutants and Tax-Y5W peptide  were analyzed similarly, except that experiments were not  collected as a function of urea.
Affinities were determined  by analysis of steady-state binding data, off-rates by analysis  of Biacore dissociation rates, and on-rates from the ratio of  koff to KD.
  CD Spectroscopy.
CD spectra as a function of urea were  collected at 25 C using an Aviv 62DS instrument.
Protein  solutions of 3 M were prepared in 20 mM NaH2PO4 and  75 mM NaCl, pH 7.4.
Urea was added to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8,  and 1 M concentrations using a stock concentration of 6.25  M urea, 20 mM NaH2PO4, and 75 mM NaCl, pH 7.4.
  Peptide Dissociation.
Peptide dissociation from HLA-A2  in 0.6 M urea was measured using steady-state fluorescence  anisotropy with a fluorescent Tax peptide variant (Tax3K5Flc) as described (19).
Briefly, 7.5 nM labeled peptide/  HLA-A2 was mixed with 7.5 M unlabeled Tax peptide and  the decrease in anisotropy measured vs time using a Beacon  2000 instrument (Invitrogen).
Conditions were 10 mM  HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.6 M urea, pH 7.4, at 25 C.
  Data were fit using a single-exponential decay function.
  Molecular Dynamics Simulations.
Coordinates for the free  TCRs were extracted from the A6- and B7-Tax/HLA-A2  crystal structures (13, 14).
Missing side chains were added  using the WHATIF server (20).
For the A6 TCR, the CR  domain was modeled in using the coordinates from the A6-  Tax-P6A/HLA-A2 crystal structure (21).
Hydrogens were  added using the Protonate tool of the AMBER 8 suite (22).
  Using the xLEaP tool, the TCRs were immersed in TIP3P  water boxes such that no protein atoms were less than 12   from any side.
Sodium cations were added for neutrality.
  This resulted in systems consisting of 61914 atoms for the  A6 TCR and 62749 atoms for the B7 TCR.
Dynamics  simulations were then performed using the Sander module,  with parameters from the parm99 set.
Equilibration consisted  of 10000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization,  followed by 20 ps of MD with restraints applied to the  proteins to equilibrate the water.
A series of energy minimizations were then carried out to relax the proteins, whereby  the restraints were gradually eliminated.
The systems were  then warmed to 300 K over three MD simulations for a total  of 480 ps of dynamics.
This was followed by production  runs of 16.9 ns for A6 and 16.4 ns for B7.
The SHAKE  algorithm was used, allowing the use of a 2 fs time step.
  Long-range electrostatics were treated via particle mesh  Ewald.
Trajectory analysis was carried out with the Ptraj  tool.
  Determination of Buried Surface Areas.
Buried solventaccessible surface areas were calculated with the program  ACCESS (Scott Presnell), using a probe radius of 1.4  and  a slice width of 0.05 . Buried surface areas were determined  as the negative of the surface area of the complex minus the  sum of the surface areas of the two free proteins.
Coordinates  of the free A6 and B7 TCRs either were extracted from the  A6- or B7-Tax/HLA-A2 crystal structures or were from  molecular dynamics simulations of the free receptors.
For  determination of surface areas buried by individual CDR  loops or loop combinations, calculations were done using  only the coordinates for the CDR loop amino acids for the  TCR components.
  RESULTS  Equilibrium and Kinetic m Values for the Interactions of  A6 and B7 with Tax/HLA-A2 Indicate Their Transition States  Bury Similar Amounts of Surface Area.
Commonly reported  in protein denaturation experiments, an m value is the  dependence of the free energy change on the concentration  of denaturant, typically urea or guanidine hydrochloride  (recently reviewed in ref 23).
As chemical denaturants  destabilize proteins by preferentially interacting with the  protein rather than solvent (24, 25), m values are also a  representation of a proteins solvent-accessible surface area  (26).
m values can be determined for equilibrium measurements, i.e., the dependence of the unfolding free energy  change on denaturant (m  eq), as well as for kinetic measurements, i.e., the dependence of the folding or unfolding rate  on denaturant (mq).
The ratio of kinetic-to-equilibrium m  values (mq  /m  eq) has seen considerable use in the field of  protein folding (e.g., refs 27-31), as this ratio provides the  amount of surface area buried in the transition state relative  to the amount of surface area buried in the folded state.
This  ratio is often interpreted as a measure of the amount of  native-like character possessed by a folding transition state.
  Ratios of m values can also be used to study proteinprotein interactions, reporting on the amount of surface area  buried in the binding transition state relative to the fully  bound state.
Although only a small number of studies have  1842 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 7, 2007 Davis-Harrison et al.been performed (32-34), the available data indicate that  protein-protein interactions can bury between 50% and 80%  of their total buried surface within the binding transition state.
  To examine the transition states formed between the A6  and B7 TCRs and Tax/HLA-A2, we measured TCR binding  affinities and dissociation kinetics as a function of urea  concentration, with urea ranging from 0 to 0.6 M. Higher  urea concentrations were avoided in order to limit destabilization of the proteins.
Measurements were performed using  surface plasmon resonance with the A6 or B7 TCRs coupled  to the sensor surfaces.
Experiments were performed under  conditions to maximize SPR data quality (18); our previous  work demonstrated no dependence of binding parameters on  coupling method or which protein was tethered to the surface  (10, 21, 35).
Steady-state binding and kinetic dissociation  data were analyzed globally as described in Materials and  Methods to determine the equilibrium and kinetic m values.
  Data are shown in Figure 1.
As expected, the affinities  weakened and dissociation rates increased with increasing  urea.
Figure 2 shows the data in traditional linear form, with  free energies determined from individual fits to the data at  each concentration of urea and straight lines generated from  the results of the four global analyses.
  The global parameters from each fit are shown in Table  1.
The free energy changes in the absence of urea compare  very well with those determined previously for the interactions of A6 and B7 with Tax/HLA-A2: our analysis yielded  values for KD and koff of 2.3 M and 0.10 s-1 for A6 and  1.3 M and 0.12 s-1 for B7; we previously reported values  of 2.2 M and 0.11 s-1 for A6 and 1.4 M and 0.13 s-1 for  B7 (10).
The various m values for A6 and B7 are slightly  different, consistent with the differing composition of the  two protein-protein interfaces (10).
There is a good correlation of the on, off, and equilibrium m values for each  interaction with the various heat capacity changes determined  previously (10), as expected from the relationship of both  parameters to changes in solvation (26) (R2 values for heat  capacity vs m value plots are 0.99 for both the A6 and B7  data alone and 0.91 for both data sets combined; if the  association values, which were derived from the equilibrium  and dissociation values, are excluded, the correlation is 0.93).
  Most interestingly, the kinetic-to-equilibrium m value ratios  are very similar for the A6 and B7 interactions and indicate  that the receptors bury 65-70% of the total buried solventaccessible surface area within their transition state ensembles.
  Low Urea Concentrations HaVe Little Influence on Protein  Structure or ActiVity.
To examine the effects of urea on the  A6 and B7 T cell receptors and the Tax/HLA-A2 complex,  we collected CD wavelength spectra as a function of urea  concentration (Figure 3).
Due to poor signal to noise at high  urea concentrations and possibly irreversible unfolding  transitions, we could not collect a complete protein denaFIGURE 1: Surface plasmon resonance data for A6 and B7 binding Tax/HLA-A2 as a function of urea concentration.

However, no  significant changes were seen in the spectra between 0 and  1 M urea for either TCR.
This minimal effect of urea on the  TCRs is especially clear when examining difference spectra  between data collected at 0.6 M urea, the highest concentration used in the binding and dissociation experiments, and 0  FIGURE 2: TCR binding free energies and activation energies for dissociation as a function of urea concentration.

As a second control for  the effects of urea on receptor activity, we compared the  activities (RUmax) of A6 and B7 SPR sensor surfaces  measured in the absence of urea and in the presence of 0.6  M urea.
These data indicated that 0.6 M urea resulted in  modest and reversible reductions in activity of 8 ( 3% for  the A6 surface and 8 ( 2% for the B7 surface (for  comparison, experiments where the temperature was shifted  from 12.5 to 28.5 C resulted in activity reductions of 16 (  2% for A6 and 30 ( 4% for B7; R. Davis-Harrison and B.  M. Baker, unpublished results).
  Urea had a larger effect on the Tax/HLA-A2 complex than  the TCRs, as evident by the difference spectrum in Figure  3C.
As significant destabilization of the molecule should  result in faster peptide dissociation, we further examined the  effects of urea on the Tax/HLA-A2 complex by measuring  the rate of peptide dissociation using fluorescence anisotropy.
  In this experiment (Figure 4), 0.6 M urea reduced the halflife of the peptide-MHC complex from 7.6 to 5.3 h at 25  C (amounting to a 30% increase in peptide off-rate).
By  comparison, a shift from 25 to 37 C results in a much more  substantial drop to 1.1 h (an 86% increase in peptide offrate) (19).
We concluded that although 0.6 M urea may have  a small effect on the Tax/HLA-A2, it does not significantly  destabilize the peptide/MHC complex (low concentrations  of Tax/HLA-A2 were avoided and samples were stored at 4  C prior to each injection to limit any influence from weaker  peptide binding).
  The Amount of SolVent-Accessible Surface Buried in the  A6 and B7 Binding Transition States.
Based on the TCRTax/HLA-A2 crystal structures, A6 and B7 bury 2000 2  of solvent-accessible surface area in the bound state (10, 13,  14).
The m value analysis thus yields an A6-Tax/HLA-A2  transition state that buries 1394 2 and a B7-Tax/HLA-A2  transition state that buries 1306 2  .
However, these calculations assume a rigid body interaction, which may not be the  case for many TCR-ligand interactions (e.g., refs 36-38).
  Although the structure of the unligated Tax/HLA-A2 molecule indicates only minor conformational differences between the bound and free states (14, 39), the structures of  the unligated A6 and B7 TCRs have not been determined.
  However, based on their fast binding kinetics relative to other  TCR-peptide/MHC interactions, neither A6 nor B7 TCRs  are predicted to populate significantly different conformational states prior to binding (10, 40).
In support of this  prediction, Chen et al. recently showed that the structure of  the 1G4 TCR, which binds the NY-ESO157-165 peptide  presented by HLA-A2 at a rate slightly slower than A6 or  B7 TCRs bind Tax/HLA-A2, is very similar in both the  bound and free states (41).
  Nonetheless, even small conformational differences in the  CDR loops between the free and bound states could impact  the calculations of buried surface areas and influence our  pictures of the two transition states.
To address this, we  performed unrestrained explicit-solvent molecular dynamics  simulations of the free A6 and B7 TCRs.
Using coordinates  output every 2 fs, we recalculated the amount of surface area  that would be buried by the A6 and B7 TCRs (additional  details of the MD simulations are provided as Supporting  Information).
Table 2 lists the amount of surface area buried  in the two transition states for three cases: (1) surface area  buried calculated using the TCR conformations present in  the two crystal structures, (2) surface area buried calculated  using the TCR conformations from the MD simulations that  show the greatest change in CDR loop conformation relative  to the crystal structures, and (3) the average amount of  surface buried calculated using each set of coordinates output  from the MD simulations.
Inclusion of the MD data increases  the amount of surface area buried in each interaction,  indicating that the MD simulations result in conformations  with greater solvent accessibility.
Using the simulated  coordinates raises the solvent-accessible surface area buried  in the transition states to 1500 2 for A6 and 1400 2  for B7.
  The shifts seen in the MD simulations for the A6 TCRs  are reflective of those observed experimentally in A6  recognition of variant Tax peptides presented by HLA-A2  FIGURE 4: Urea (0.6 M) has only a marginal influence on  dissociation of the Tax peptide from HLA-A2 as measured by  steady-state fluorescence anisotropy.

The shifts include  changes in CDR loop positions, including CDR3R and  CDR3 (maximum shifts of 4.4 and 4.8  at the apex of  the loops, respectively), but the loops are not wholly  remodeled, as seen in the structures of A6 with the TaxV7R variant (21) and the Tax-5K-IBA variant (42).
They  also include small shifts in R and  domain positioning, as  also seen in the A6-Tax-5K-IBA/HLA-A2 structure (42).
  Although as indicated above there is no structure of the free  A6 TCR which would be best for comparing with the results  of the MD simulations, the observation that the simulations  capture the kinds of structural changes seen with A6 supports  their use here.
Other than the structure with the Tax peptide,  there are no additional structural data for the B7 TCR.
  However, the B7 MD simulations result in similar structural  changes as seen in A6: shifts in CDR loop position  (maximum of 6.7  for CDR3R and 5.0  for CDR3) and  small changes in domain orientation, which we anticipate  mimic those observed experimentally with A6.
  Participation of Tyr5 in the A6 and B7 Binding Transition  States.
The buried surface areas determined by m-value  analysis do not indicate what structures are present at the  transition states, nor do they indicate what intermolecular  contacts may or may not be present.
As opposed to m values,   analysis allows one to directly evaluate whether a given  amino acid position participates in a transition state (8).  Indeed,  analysis and m values are frequently used as  complementary approaches to investigate the native-like  character of protein folding transition states (e.g., refs 27-  31).
For binding, a  value for an amino acid position is  defined as Gon  q /G  eq, where Gon  q represents the  effect of a mutation on the height of the transition state barrier  relative to the unbound state, and G  eq represents the  effect of a mutation on the overall binding free energy.
A   value near 1 indicates that any destabilizing effects of a  mutation arise only from a decrease in the on-rate and is  interpreted to mean that any stabilizing interactions made to  the site of mutation are fully formed in the binding transition  state.
A  value of zero indicates that any destabilizing  effects of a mutation arise only from an increase in the offrate and is interpreted to indicate that stabilizing interactions  made to the mutated position are only formed as the transition  state relaxes into the fully bound state.
Intermediate  values  are usually taken to indicate partial or weakened participation  of the mutated position in the transition state.
  We were particularly interested in the potential participation of peptide surface in the binding transition states.
In  the structures of both A6 and B7 with Tax/HLA-A2, Tyr5  of the Tax peptide projects up from the plane of the MHC  R1/R2 helices into pockets formed by multiple CDR loops,  including CDR3R and CDR3, and in A6, CDR1R (13, 14).
  Tyr5 is thus arguably the best position in the Tax/HLA-A2  molecule to evaluate the participation of peptide surface in  the A6 and B7 binding transition states.
Data for the A6  and B7 TCRs binding Tyr5 f Ala (Y5A) and Tyr5 f Phe  (Y5F) variants of the Tax peptide presented by HLA-A2 are  available (10, 43).
We also collected new data on the binding  of A6 and B7 to the Tyr5 f Trp (Y5W) Tax variant.
Binding  affinities and kinetics as well as  values calculated from  these data are shown in Table 3 (Biacore data for the Y5W  variant are shown in the Supporting Information).
  For the A6 TCR, the position 5  values range from 0.91  to 0.35.
Although the upper value of 0.9 for the Y5F  substitution has a large error ((0.6, resulting from the very  small G), the values for the Y5A and Y5W substitutions  are considerably more reliable (0.52 ( 0.10 and 0.35 ( 0.05).
  Altogether, the mean value for the A6 data is 0.6 (0.4 if the  value of 0.9 is disregarded).
For the B7 TCR, the position 5   values range from 1.0 to 0.25, with a mean of 0.6 (data  to calculate a  value for the B7 TCR with the Y5A  substitution are unavailable due to a lack of detectable  binding of B7 to the Tax Y5A variant; J. R. Clemens and  B. M. Baker, unpublished results).
These data, encompassing  multiple substitutions at position 5, strongly suggest that  stabilizing interactions to Tyr5 of the Tax peptide are formed  in both the A6 and B7 binding transition states.
  To further test whether Tyr5 participates in the A6 and  B7 TCR binding transition states, we evaluated by  analysis  select amino acids in A6 and B7 that contact Tyr5 in the  TCR-Tax/HLA-A2 crystal structures.
In A6, we chose Ser31  of CDR1R, whose side chain hydrogen bonds with the Tyr5  side chain hydroxyl at the top of the Tyr5 pocket in A6  (14).
In B7, we chose Tyr104 of CDR3, whose side chain  contacts the aromatic ring of the Tyr5 side chain, forming  one wall of the Tyr5 pocket in B7 (13).
Other candidates  were excluded as they either were very near the limit of our  definition of an interatomic contact (distances e4 ) or  involved charged amino acids participating in long-range  electrostatic interactions with HLA-A2 (40).

The  values, 0.74 ( 0.08 for  position 31R in A6 and 1.04 ( 0.08 for position 104 in  B7, further support the conclusion that stabilizing contacts  to Tyr5 are formed within both TCR binding transition states.
  Moreover, together with the  for Tyr5, the data imply that  the environment around Tyr5 in the two binding transition  states is similar to that seen in the bound states.
  Transition State Models Based on the Structures of the  Bound States Require CDR3 Participation in the Binding  Transition States.
Although inconsistent with the two-step  model (9), the m and  value experiments only give a limited  picture of the nature of the A6 and B7 binding transition  states: burial of a considerable amount of solvent-accessible  surface area and bound-like contacts to and from Tyr5 of  the Tax peptide.
To date, most work on the nature of protein  binding transition states has assumed that binding pathways  follow a smooth energy funnel toward the bound state (16,  44-46), with a low probability for contacts in the binding  transition state that are not present in the bound state.
This  assumption follows from a considerable body of work in  protein folding, in which theoretical folding models based  only on the topology of the native state are able to accurately  reproduce a wide range of structural, thermodynamic, and  kinetic observations (recently reviewed in ref 17), and builds  on the landscape theory of protein folding (47), also  applicable to binding (48, 49).
If we assume that this  principle of minimal frustration (15) holds for the A6 and  B7 interactions with Tax/HLA-A2, we can use the structures  of the bound states to generate models of the A6 and B7  binding transition states.
  Table 4 lists the amount of surface area buried by each  CDR loop (and loop combinations) in the A6 and B7  complexes, using the crystallographic structures as well as  the coordinates of the free TCRs generated by the MD  simulations (to aid in interpretation of Table 4, images  showing the position of each loop on Tax/HLA-A2 are  available in the Supporting Information).
For the A6 TCR,  transition state models that are compatible with these data  include those which bury significant portions of one or more  of the R chain loops along with CDR3 or all of the R chain  loops while the three  chain loops remain solvent exposed  [using the X-ray coordinates, the A6 transition state buries  1394 ( 100 2 (Table 2), CDR3 and CDR1R together bury  1368 2  , and all three R loops alone bury 1409 2  ].
Despite  the fact that the MD simulations indicate movement in the  CDR loops (see Supporting Information), this motion does  not greatly impact the solvent-accessible surface area buried  by the various loops.
We note that the  values exclude a  model in which the requisite amount of surface area is buried  by only CDR3R and CDR3, as this would prevent the  interaction between Tyr5 and Ser31 in CDR1R.
Thus, while  the surface area data do suggest that one or both CDR3 loops  participate in the transition state, this does not seem to be at  the expense of the germline-encoded loops.
  Slightly different results are seen with the B7 TCR.
Again  assuming that the minimal frustration principle applies,  through simple addition the amount of surface buried in the  transition state could be achieved by burial of the four  germline-encoded CDR loops [using the average MD  coordinates, the transition state buries 1394 ( 100 2 (Table  2), and the combined CDR1 and CDR2 loops bury 1388 2  in the bound state].
Realistically, however, docking of all  four germline-encoded loops could not occur without concomitant burial of at least some CDR3-associated surface.
  Furthermore, exclusion of CDR3 from the transition state  would prevent the participation Tyr104, in conflict with  the  value data.
Compatible transition state models for the  B7 TCR thus include those which fully bury all three loops  of the  chain and partially bury one or more loops of the R  chain or, vice versa, those which fully bury all of the three  R chain loops and partially bury one or more  chain loops.
  Other models within these two extremes are also possible,  yet participation of CDR3 is mandatory.
  DISCUSSION  The role of the transition state in T cell receptor recognition of ligand has recently been highlighted by a two-step  model in which TCR recognition proceeds via peptideindependent and peptide-dependent phases, demarcated at  the binding transition state (9).
The model neatly integrates  TCR binding degeneracy with peptide specificity and has  been implicated in a number of processes involving TCR  recognition of ligand (50).
Yet the model remains controversial (50, 51), with data from different TCR-ligand  Table 4: Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (2  ) Buried by CDR  Loops in the A6 and B7 TCR-Tax/HLA-A2 Complexesa  CDR loop or  loop combination  crystal  structureb  MD max

  TCR Binding Transition States Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 7, 2007 1847systems varying in their support of it (9, 12, 52, 53).
Here,  we sought to characterize the binding transition states of A6  and B7, two R T cell receptors which recognize the Tax  peptide presented by HLA-A2.
Our goal was to provide  additional experimental data relating to TCR binding transition states on which the two-step model could be tested or  refined.
  Using ratios of kinetic-to-equilibrium m values, we found  that the two TCRs bury 65-70% of their total buried surface  area in their binding transition states, a percentage comparable to that found in other protein-protein transition states  (32-34).
With the crystallographic structures of the TCRpeptide/MHC complexes as a reference, this amounts to  burial of 1300-1400 2 of solvent-accessible surface area.
  Attempting to account for conformational differences in the  TCRs between the bound and unbound states increases the  range to 1400-1500 2  .
Either range reflects burial of a  large amount of surface that would seem to necessitate a  significant number of contacts made from the TCRs to the  MHC-bound peptide (see Figure S1 in the Supporting  Information).
In support of this conclusion,  values for Tyr5  of the Tax peptide indicate that stabilizing contacts to this  position are made in both the A6 and B7 binding transition  states.
Reciprocal  experiments with two positions in A6  and B7 that contact Tyr5 further support this conclusion and  suggest that the environment around Tyr5 in the two  transition states is similar to that seen in the two TCRpeptide/MHC crystal structures.
  Additional insight into the nature of the two binding  transition states was gained by considering the surface area  buried by each CDR loop in the bound states.
This analysis  indicated that, for both A6 and B7, the amount of surface  area buried in the two binding transition states requires  participation of the CDR3 loops.
The models generated from  this analysis are speculative, as they require that contacts  not present in the bound state are minimally populated along  the binding pathway.
Although generally accepted in studies  of protein folding (17), the extent to which this principle of  minimal frustration applies in binding reactions has not been  experimentally well tested (54).
However, these models are  the simplest of those that are compatible with both the m  and  value data.
Alternative models for the binding  transition states would require burial of a large amount of  surface that is not buried in the bound state, with nonnative contacts formed not just by Tyr5 but also Ser31R in  A6 and Y104 in B7.
Conceivably, this could arise from  alternate CDR loop configurations within the transition states  and a positioning of the TCRs on the MHC molecules in a  fashion very different than seen in the crystal structures.
To  account for the data, however, the resulting transition states  would need to be radically different from the bound states.
  In the structure of the unligated Tax/HLA-A2 complex,  Tyr5 of the peptide projects up from the center of the peptide  backbone, which has a slight bulge characteristic of nonamers  bound to class I MHC molecules.
From the side of the  Tax/HLA-A2 complex, if the  strands of the peptide binding  groove are defined as the horizontal, the Tyr5 hydroxyl group  defines a high point on the peptide/MHC, just above the  extending side chains of Arg65 of the HLA-A2 R1 helix  and Gln155 of the HLA-A2 R2 helix (see Supporting  Information).
Thus it is perhaps not too surprising that the  A6 and B7 T cell receptors engage Tyr5 early in binding, as  noted by Wu et al. in their derivation of the two-step model  (9).
However, projection of amino acid side chains above  the MHC R1/R2 helices is not unusual in class I MHC  complexes: a survey of class I peptide/MHC structures in  the Protein Data Bank revealed a number of similar cases.
  Peptides presented in this fashion include nonamers, decamers, 11-mers, and in one case a 14-mer (55-64).
Thus,  although the exact details of any given TCR-peptide/MHC  binding transition state are probably heavily dependent upon  the nature of the bound peptide, contacts to projecting peptide  side chains within TCR-peptide/MHC binding transition  states may be relatively common.
  It is striking that the transition states with A6 and B7 are  so similar.
In previous work, we have shown that A6 and  B7 bind Tax/HLA-A2 with very different thermodynamics  (H and TS are both near 10 kcal/mol at 25 C), but  this arises almost entirely from how the two receptors move  from the transition state to the bound state (Hon  q and  Son  q are both near zero, with a negligible Cp,on  q ) (10).
  Thus, not only do A6 and B7 bury very nearly the same  amount of surface in their transition states, they bind with  nearly identical activation thermodynamics.
This could be  indicative of very similar structures formed within the two  transition states, an interpretation compatible with the m value  and  value data presented here. Yet, A6 and B7 have  different VR domains, and their CDR3 loops are entirely  different.
In the face of these sequence differences, how could  the activation thermodynamics and the nature of the two  transition states be so similar?
Perhaps the A6 and B7  transition states consist of actual intermolecular contacts to  protruding side chains only (such as Tyr5), with the majority  of the association energetics and surface removed from bulk  water, resulting not from intermolecular contacts but from  dehydration of similar surfaces as the molecules approach,  as discussed by Gabdoulline and Wade in their analysis of  protein-protein encounter complexes (65).
This binding  model would limit the formation of different interatomic  contacts that could give rise to differing activation energies,  yet is still compatible with the m and  value data indicating  removal of a significant amount of surface from bulk solvent  and a bound-like environment around Tyr5 of the Tax  peptide.
  The results with A6 and B7 are reminiscent of the recent  work of Lee et al., who studied the binding of the G10 TCR  to an HIV epitope and a single amino acid variant presented  by HLA-A2 (12).
Remarkably, the TCR bound both peptide/  MHC complexes with the same activation thermodynamics,  despite the fact that the peptides were found to occupy  different conformations in the free peptide/MHC complexes.
  Assuming the peptides adopted the same conformation in  the TCR-bound state, the authors interpreted their results as  the TCR initially engaging the MHC molecule relatively  independent of the peptide and then contacting the peptide  as the transition state decayed to the bound state, i.e., in the  context of the two-step model.
However, it is also possible  that the G10 TCR initially engages these ligands in a fashion  similar to that noted above (minimal interatomic contacts  along with the exclusion of bulk solvent, followed by  formation of specific contacts as the transition state decays).
  Additional work is needed to distinguish between these  possibilities.
  1848 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 7, 2007 Davis-Harrison et al.If the two-step model as originally formulated is not  generally applicable, is there an alternative which might  permit a physical distinction between the peptide and the  MHC molecule in TCR recognition of ligand?
Perhaps  certain TCR binding reactions proceed via the formation of  a binding intermediate resulting from strong interactions with  the MHC molecule [i.e., a state whose free energy is in  between fully bound and free, with fully bound and free  separated by multiple transition state barriers, as seen in the  interaction between RNase S and the S-peptide (32)].
  Although thus far there are no physical data suggesting the  existence of such an intermediate in TCR binding reactions,  its presence would be expected to be strongly dependent on  the nature of individual TCRs and peptides, and it could be  selected against during TCR positive selection (66).
Detection  of such an intermediate would therefore require careful  selection of systems and likely kinetic methods without the  low temporal resolution of surface plasmon resonance (67).
