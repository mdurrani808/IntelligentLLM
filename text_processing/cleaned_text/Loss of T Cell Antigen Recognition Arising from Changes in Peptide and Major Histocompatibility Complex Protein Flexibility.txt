  Results: Modification enhances the flexibility of the peptide and MHC.
  Conclusion: Dynamical consequences of peptide modification contribute to the loss in antigenicity.
  Significance: Potential dynamical consequences should be considered in the design of peptide-based vaccines and may underlie  aspects of T cell specificity.
  Modification of the primary anchor positions of antigenic  peptides to improve binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins is a commonly used strategy for engineering peptide-based vaccine candidates.
However, such peptide  modifications do not always improve antigenicity, complicating  efforts to design effective vaccines for cancer and infectious disease.
Here we investigated the MART-12735 tumor antigen, for  which anchor modification (replacement of the position two  alanine with leucine) dramatically reduces or ablates antigenicity with a wide range of T cell clones despite significantly  improving peptide binding to MHC.
We found that anchor  modification in the MART-12735 antigen enhances the flexibility of both the peptide and the HLA-A*0201 molecule.
Although  the resulting entropic effects contribute to the improved binding of the peptide to MHC, they also negatively impact T cell  receptor binding to the peptideMHC complex.
These results  help explain how the anchor-fixing strategy fails to improve  antigenicity in this case, and more generally, may be relevant for  understanding the high specificity characteristic of the T cell  repertoire.
In addition to impacting vaccine design, modulation  of peptide and MHC flexibility through changes to antigenic  peptides may present an evolutionary strategy for the escape of  pathogens from immune destruction.
  T cell receptor (TCR)5 recognition of an antigenic peptide  bound and presented by a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein underlies the cytotoxic immune response  to pathogens and cancer.
Many tumor or viral antigens are  poorly immunogenic, which can sometimes be attributed to  weak binding of the peptide to the MHC molecule, consequently resulting in low antigen density on the surface of a  presenting cell (1).
One approach for vaccine design involves  improving peptide-MHC affinity, with the goal of using the  modified peptides to convert naive antigen-specific T cells into  more sensitive effector T cells.
This strategy is often employed  when weak peptide binding results from the presence of suboptimal anchor residues within the peptide sequence (2, 3).
  Many clinical trials employing anchor-modified peptides have  been performed or are in progress.
  However, improving peptide binding by substituting suboptimal with optimal anchor residues does not always enhance  antigenicity, complicating efforts to engineer peptide-based  vaccines.
A clear example of this is seen with the MART-12735  melanoma antigen (sequence AAGIGILTV; referred to here as  AAG),6 which possesses an alanine at position 2 and binds  weakly to the restricting class I MHC molecule, HLA-A*0201  (HLA-A2).
Valmori et al. (2) found that when the second alanine of the AAG peptide was replaced with leucine, generating  the peptide ALGIGILTV (referred to here as ALG), peptide  binding to HLA-A2 was enhanced 40-fold, but antigenicity was  severely curtailed.
This result has been confirmed with multiple  T cell clones (4, 5) as well as staining experiments with pMHC  tetramers (5).
Interestingly, however, T cells that recognize the  ALG peptide poorly (or not at all) readily cross-react with a  * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grant  GM067079 from the NIGMS (to B. M. B.).

286, NO. 46, pp. 4016340173, November 18, 2011   2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Printed in the U.S.A.  NOVEMBER 18, 2011VOLUME 286NUMBER 46 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 40163   at Georgian Court College on March 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from decameric form of the native MART-1 peptide possessing a  glutamic acid at the N terminus (EAAGIGILTV; referred to as  EAA) (2, 4, 5).
Previously, these results were interpreted to indicate that anchor modification of the nonameric peptide altered  the conformation away from one shared by the native nonamer  and the decamer (6, 7).
  However, when the structures of the native and anchor-modified nonamers bound to HLA-A2 were determined, it was  observed that the alanine-to-leucine modification at position 2  had only a minor effect on the conformation of the peptide (4).
  Indeed, the structural differences between the AAG and ALG  nonamers were substantially less than the differences between  the AAG nonamer and the EAA decamer, leading us to question how multiple T cell clones could on one hand be highly  sensitive to a very small structural perturbation while on the  other tolerant of a much more dramatic structural difference.
  This question reflects the well appreciated yet poorly understood dichotomy of high specificity together with high crossreactivity that is characteristic of the T cell arm of the immune  system.
  Here we investigated the consequences of anchor modification of the MART-12735 AAG peptide, aiming to understand  how the anchor-fixing strategy fails despite achieving the goal  of enhancing peptide binding affinity with only minor conformational consequences.
We found that the alanine-to-leucine  substitution at position 2 increases the flexibility of the N-terminal half of the MART-1 peptide, leading to the subtle structural effects seen crystallographically.
Anchor modification  also increases the flexibility of the helices that form the peptide  binding domain.
The increased flexibility and thus higher  entropy of the complex with the modified ALG peptide contributes to the improvement in peptide binding to HLA-A2.
However, it will also raise the entropic cost for TCR binding to the  pMHC complex, contributing to a general loss in affinity with  MART-1-specific TCRs.
These results have implications not  only for vaccine design and other efforts to alter immunogenicity through peptide modification but also for our understanding of the mechanisms of viral and tumor escape from immune  destruction and the origins of T cell receptor specificity in  general.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Proteins and PeptidesRecombinant T cell receptor and  complexes between peptides and HLA-A2 were produced by  refolding from bacterially expressed inclusion bodies (HLA-A2  heavy chain and 2-microglobulin for MHC and  and  chains  for TCR) and chromatographically purified as described previously (8). Purified peptides were obtained commercially (GenScript) and verified through mass spectrometry.
The construct  for the DMF5 TCR utilized an engineered disulfide bond across  the  and  constant domains for improved stability (9).
  Circular DichroismCircular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed in an Aviv 62DS instrument as  described previously (10), monitoring a wavelength of 218 nm  and using a temperature increment of 0.3 C/min.
Solution  conditions were 20 mM sodium phosphate, 75 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4, and a protein concentration of 10M.
As unfolding  of peptideHLA-A2 complexes is irreversible, the data were fit  to a six-order polynomial, and the apparent Tm was taken from  the first derivative of the fitted curve.
  Surface Plasmon ResonanceSteady-state surface plasmon  resonance experiments were performed with a Biacore 3000  instrument as described previously (8), except that for measurements with the AAG and ALG peptides, the activity of the  sensor surface was fixed with the value determined with the  EAA decamer (11).
DMF5 TCR was coupled to the sensor surface using amine coupling.
PeptideHLA-A2 complexes were  injected in duplicate, utilizing a flow rate of 5 l/min.
Solution  conditions were 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet  P-20, pH 7.4, 25 C.
  X-ray CrystallographyCrystals of the AAGHLA-A2 complex were grown at 4 C from 24% PEG 3350, 25 mM MES, 0.1 M  NaCl, pH 6.5, using sitting drop/vapor diffusion.
Cryo-protection involved soaking crystals in crystallization solution supplemented with 20% glycerol for several seconds before freezing in  liquid nitrogen.
Diffraction data were collected at beamline  19BM of the Structural Biology Center at the Argonne National  Laboratory and processed with HKL2000 (12).
Structures were  solved with MOLREP (13) using the gp100209HLA-A2 structure (14) as a search model with coordinates for peptide and  solvent removed.
Structures were refined with Refmac5 (15)  and verified as described previously (4), except that Molprobity  (16) was used as an additional validation tool.
  Nuclear Magnetic ResonanceSpectra for AAG and ALG  bound to HLA-A2 were recorded at 277 K on a Bruker Avance  800-MHz magnet fitted with a cryogenic probe.
The NMR sample contained 250 M pMHC in a volume of 300 l using a  Shigemi NMR tube.
To enhance probe sensitivity, a low conductivity buffer (20 mM 2  D-BIS-TRIS buffer with 2  D-benzoic  acid, pH 7.4) was used (17).
Temperature calibration on the  cryogenic probe was performed using ethylene glycol.
1  H,15N  heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra were  obtained using a transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy  version of the pulse sequence (18, 19).
Spectra were processed  using TOPSPIN 1.3 (Bruker Biospin) and plotted using Sparky  3.113 (41).
  Molecular Dynamics SimulationsMolecular dynamics  simulations were performed with the AMBER 8 suite (20).
For  the 300 K simulations, we continued the simulations described  in Ref.
4 from their endpoints, utilizing the previously described  protocol.
Briefly, starting coordinates for the AAG simulation  were from the coordinates in the first molecule in the asymmetric unit of the previously solved structure (4).
Starting coordinates for the ALG simulation were from Sliz et al. (6).
Hydrogen  atoms were added, and the proteins were immersed in TIP3P  water boxes along with sodium cations for neutrality.
Equilibration consisted of multiple steps of energy minimization followed by short molecular dynamics runs in which restraints  were gradually removed.
Production runs utilized a 2-fs time  step with the SHAKE algorithm.
Simulations at 330 K used the  same protocol and the same prepared systems, with equilibration and production simulations performed at a temperature of  330 rather than 300 K. Trajectory analysis was performed with  the AMBER ptraj tool and in-house scripts.
  Peptide Dissociation KineticsPeptide dissociation from  HLA-A2 was monitored using fluorescence anisotropy as  Peptide Anchor Modification Enhances pMHC Flexibility  40164 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 286NUMBER 46NOVEMBER 18, 2011   at Georgian Court College on March 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from described previously (21, 22), utilizing a temperature-controlled Beacon 2000 instrument to monitor steady-state anisotropy (Invitrogen).
Solution conditions were 10 mM HEPES, 150  mM NaCl, pH 7.4.
AAG and ALG peptides were labeled with  fluorescein by replacing leucine at position 7 with a fluoresceinderivatized lysine.
Data were fit to either single or biphasic  exponential decays using OriginPro 7.5 (OriginLab), with the  dominant slow process for the biphasic decays interpreted as  resulting from peptide dissociation from the HLA-A2 heavy  chain as described in Ref. 21.
  RESULTS  The ALGHLA-A2 Complex Is Poorly Recognized by MART12735-specific TCRs in a Direct Binding ExperimentDespite  its improved binding to HLA-A2, the anchor-modified variant  of the MART-12735 nonamer (ALG) is recognized very poorly,  and in some cases not at all, in functional assays with T cells that  recognize the native peptide (AAG).
Although this result has  been replicated with a number of T cell clones and lines and also  seen with MHC-tetramer binding experiments (2, 4, 5), it  remains possible that these outcomes are attributable to issues  not related to TCR binding, such as preferential proteolysis of  the ALG peptide in cellular assays.
For this reason, we examined peptide binding to HLA-A2 and TCR binding to  peptideHLA-A2 complexes in direct assays with recombinant  protein.
  First, to confirm the improved binding of the ALG peptide to  HLA-A2, we examined the thermal stability of purified  peptideHLA-A2 complexes.
Using circular dichroism to monitor HLA-A2 unfolding, we found that the ALGHLA-A2 complex was substantially more stable than the AAGHLA-A2 complex (Fig. 1a); the Tm of the AAGHLA-A2 complex was 37 C,  whereas the Tm of the ALGHLA-A2 complex was substantially  higher at 51 C.
This large shift of 14 C is consistent with the  40-fold increase in peptide binding affinity measured previously in competition assays (2).
  We next examined TCR binding to peptideHLA-A2 complexes in a direct binding assay using surface plasmon resonance with a recombinant MART-1-specific TCR.
As shown in  Fig. 1b, in an experiment optimized to detect weak binding (11),  the DMF5 TCR (23) showed very weak binding with the ALG  peptide despite stronger binding with both the AAG nonamer  and the EAA decamer.
In terms of binding free energy, the loss  with the ALG peptide relative to the AAG peptide is at least 2.3  kcal/mol.
These data track the functional results with T cells  expressing DMF5, which of all the various MART-1 peptides  recognizes the ALG nonamer the weakest (4).
  Structures of the AAG and ALG NonamerHLA-A2 Complexes Indicate Greater Conformational Diversity for the ALG  Versus the AAG NonamerThe previously solved crystallographic structures of HLA-A2 bound to the AAG and ALG  peptides showed that peptide modification did little to alter the  conformation of the peptide or the MHC binding groove.
  Rather, modification had a subtle effect, introducing a small  degree of structural heterogeneity into the center of the peptide  (4).
Both the AAGHLA-A2 and the ALGHLA-A2 structures  had two pMHC molecules per asymmetric unit.
In the structure  with the native AAG nonamer, the backbones of the two peptides diverged in the center by only 0.5  (measured at the C of  Gly-5).
In the structure with the modified ALG nonamer, the  divergence at the Gly-5 C was larger at 1.5 . More dramatically, however, in the ALGHLA-A2 structure, the center of the  peptide in the first molecule in the asymmetric unit occupied  two conformations, differing by 180 flips of the  angle of  Ile-4 and the  angle of Gly-5.
The peptide backbone in the  AAGHLA-A2 structure, on the other hand, adopted only a  single conformation, corresponding to the non-flipped conformation in the ALGHLA-A2 structure.
  A complication of those data, however, was that the  AAGHLA-A2 and ALGHLA-A2 complexes crystallized with  different unit cell parameters, which could account for the  structural differences observed.
To more precisely compare the  structural properties of the peptides, we determined the structure of the AAGHLA-A2 complex in the same form as the  ALGHLA-A2 complex and at a resolution higher than that of  the previous structure (1.7 versus 1.9 ; Table 1).
The new  structure was essentially identical to the previous, with the  backbones of the peptides from the first and second molecules  in the asymmetric units superimposing on those in the earlier  structure with root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations of 0.2 and  FIGURE 1.
Anchor modification of the MART-12735 peptide strengthens  peptide binding to MHC but weakens TCR binding to pMHC.
a, thermal  stability monitored by circular dichroism indicates that the apparent Tm of the  ALGHLA-A2 complex is 14 higher than that of the AAGHLA-A2 complex,  consistent with the reported 40-fold increase in peptide binding affinity (2).
b,  although it recognizes the AAGHLA-A2 and EAAHLA-A2 complexes with  moderate affinities, the DMF5 TCR binds the ALGHLA-A2 complex very  weakly, consistent with the loss in antigenicity seen with the ALG peptide.
  Peptide Anchor Modification Enhances pMHC Flexibility  NOVEMBER 18, 2011VOLUME 286NUMBER 46 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 40165   at Georgian Court College on March 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from 0.1 , respectively (Fig. 2a).
Electron density for the peptides  was clear (Fig. 2b).
As with the earlier AAGHLA-A2 and  ALGHLA-A2 structures (4), there were no crystallographic  contacts to the peptides in either asymmetric unit of the new  structure.
  In the new AAG structure, the center of the peptide showed  slightly greater conformational variance than in the previous  structure.
Measured by the shift in the C of Gly-5 of the peptide, the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the new  AAGHLA-A2 structure diverged by 0.9 , compared with 0.5   in the older structure (Fig. 2c, left-hand side).
However, the  peptide backbone in the new AAGHLA-A2 structure did not  show the conformational flip seen in the ALGHLA-A2 structure (Fig. 2c, right-hand side).
The crystallographic data thus  confirm that when bound to HLA-A2, the anchor-modified  ALG nonamer possesses greater structural heterogeneity in the  center of the peptide than does the native AAG nonamer,  resulting in the population of an alternative flipped  conformation.
  NMR Confirms the Center of the ALG Nonamer Adopts Two  Distinct Conformations in the HLA-A2 Binding GrooveTo  examine the conformational properties of the ALG and AAG  nonamers bound to HLA-A2 in more detail, we synthesized the  peptides with 15N-labeled glycine at position 5 and examined  the two peptideHLA-A2 complexes via NMR.
1  H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation data were collected at 4 C  to ensure the stability of the pMHC complexes over the course  of the experiment.
  With the ALG nonamer, we observed two distinct peaks  (referred to as peak A and peak B) with relative populations of  81% (peak A) and 19% (peak B) (Fig. 3).
In contrast, we observed  only a single peak with the AAG nonamer.
This peak overlapped with that of peak A in the ALG spectrum.
These data  confirm the crystallographic observation of greater conformational heterogeneity for the center of the ALG nonamer when  bound to HLA-A2.
  Can the peaks in the NMR spectra be attributed to the flipped  and non-flipped conformers observed in the crystallographic  structures?
The population distribution in the ALG spectra  (81% peak A, 19% peak B) mimics the structural observations in  the ALGHLA-A2 crystal structure, where the flipped conformation was observed as an alternate conformation in just one  out of two molecules in the ALGHLA-A2 asymmetric unit (4).
  Similarly, only the non-flipped conformation was observed in  the AAGHLA-A2 structures, consistent with the existence of  just one peak in the AAGHLA-A2 NMR spectra.
These observations suggest that peak A corresponds to the non-flipped  conformation and peak B corresponds to the flipped  conformation.
  The assignment of the peaks to the flipped and non-flipped  conformations of the peptide is further supported when considering chemical environment.
The separation of peak A and  peak B in the ALG spectrum indicates two different environments for the Gly-5 NH group.
The flip in the center of the  peptide does indeed place the Gly-5 NH in a substantially different environment.
In its non-flipped conformation, the Gly-5  amide nitrogen is highly exposed, with a solvent-accessible surface area of 13.8 2 in the ALGHLA-A2 structure and 13.9 2  in the AAGHLA-A2 structure.
This is slightly greater than the  solvent-accessible surface area for the central amide nitrogen in  an extended pentaglycine peptide (13.4 2  ).
In contrast, the flip  in the peptide points the Gly-5 NH toward the base of the peptide binding groove, reducing the solvent accessibility of the  Gly-5 amide nitrogen over 3-fold to 4.1 2  .
  Chemical shift values move toward their random coil value  with increasing solvent accessibility (24).
The random coil proton chemical shift for a glycine NH (measured for the central  NH in a pentaglycine peptide) at 4 C is 8.66 ppm (25), close to  the value of 8.38 observed for peak A. As the Gly-5 amide nitrogen is exposed to a similar extent as in a pentaglycine random  coil, we can attribute peak A to the solvent-exposed nonflipped conformation.
Peak B thus corresponds to the flipped  conformation seen in the ALGHLA-A2 structure, shifted due  to its removal from bulk solvent.
  Molecular Dynamics Simulations Illuminate Differential  Peptide DynamicsWe next examined the conformational  behavior of the AAG and ALG peptides bound to HLA-A2 with  molecular dynamics simulations. Extending our previous work  (4), over the course of 50 ns of simulation time at 300 K, the  AAG peptide populated only the crystallographically observed  non-flipped conformation (Fig. 4a).
In contrast, the ALG peptide populated both the flipped and the non-flipped conformations, with the flipped conformation populated to a level of 15%  (Fig. 4b).
This was reached by only a single flip, suggestive of a  high energy barrier between the two conformations.
  Although the simulation results are consistent with those  from crystallography and NMR, the finite simulation time  leaves open the possibility that the agreement is fortuitous.
To  investigate further, we repeated the simulations at the elevated  TABLE 1  X-ray data collection and refinement statistics  Data collection  Source Advanced Photon Source 19BM  Space group P21  Cell dimensions  a, b, c () 58.2,84.1,84.0  , ,  () 90.0, 90.1, 90.0  Resolution ()a 201.68 (1.721.68)  Rsym or Rmerge 0.08 (0.47)  I/I 16.2 (2.1)  Completeness (%) 98.5 (96.9)  Redundancy 3.7 (3.6)  Refinement  Resolution () 201.68  No. of reflections 90,758  Rwork/Rfree 0.21/0.17  No. of atoms  Protein 6282  Ligand/ion 38  Water 816  B-factors  Protein 16.0  Ligand/ion 37.8  Water 24.6  r.m.s.

Over the course of 50 ns of simulation time at 330 K, the  AAG peptide did populate the alternate conformation, but at a  low level of 7% (Fig. 4c).
The ALG peptide, on the other hand,  populated the alternate conformation at a higher level of 39%  (Fig. 4d).
A second alternate conformation was also observed  (near 30/160 in the / plots in Fig. 4, c and d), indicative  of the greater sampling provided by the higher temperature  simulation.
As with the other alternate conformation, this was  populated to a greater extent in the ALG complex than in the  AAG complex.
  These results confirm the conclusions from the 300 K simulations, indicating the presence of a higher energy flipped conformation for the MART-12735 peptide.
However, the energy  of this state is lower in the ALG complex, allowing its greater  population and thus visualization via x-ray crystallography and  NMR.
  We examined the molecular dynamics simulations in more  detail by calculating atomic displacement (in the form ofB-factors)  FIGURE 2.

  Peptide Anchor Modification Enhances pMHC Flexibility  NOVEMBER 18, 2011VOLUME 286NUMBER 46 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 40167   at Georgian Court College on March 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from for the backbones of the AAG and ALG peptides from the 300 K  simulation.
As expected, the ALG peptide showed increased flexibility when compared with the AAG peptide.
The greater flexibility was distributed across the N-terminal half of the peptide, with  the highest degree at Ile-4 and Gly-5 (Fig. 4e).
Examining the data  further, we binned the ALG data into flipped and non-flipped conformations to examine the dynamics of the peptide in each of the  two conformations.
Surprisingly, the flexibility of the ALG peptide  in the non-flipped conformation was higher than that of the  flipped conformation.
On the other hand, when in the flipped conformation, the ALG peptide was even less dynamic than the native  AAG peptide (Fig. 4f).
The picture that emerges is that even when  they are sharing the same non-flipped conformation, the N-terminal half of the ALG peptide is more flexible than the AAG peptide.
  When ALG experiences a rare flip, however, the peptide stays relatively rigid.
  Differential Flexibility between ALGHLA-A2 and  AAGHLA-A2 Extends to the Helices of the HLA-A2 Peptide  Binding DomainWe next examined the HLA-A2 molecule in  the AAG and ALG simulations, hypothesizing that modification of the AAG peptide results in altered dynamics of the  HLA-A2 peptide binding domain.
Clear differences were  observed in the average displacement of the atoms in the helices  of the peptide binding domain, with an overall 20% greater flexibility in the ALG complex (Fig. 5a).
This included greater flexibility in the region of the 1 helix adjacent to the center of the  peptide but also reduced flexibility in the region of the 2 helix  adjacent to the center of the peptide (both highlighted in Fig.  5a).
Increased flexibility was also observed at the C-terminal  end of the 2 helix, similar to that observed by Fabian et al. (27)  in their analysis of the dynamical consequences of a polymorphism in the base of the binding groove in HLA-B27.
Fig. 5b  shows the differences in atomic displacement mapped to the  structure of the ALGHLA-A2 complex, illustrating the proximity between the center of the peptide and regions of the  1/2 helices with altered flexibility.
  As class I MHC 1 and 2 helices tend to move in collective  motions that can be summarized as a breathing of the peptide  binding groove (2729), we asked how distances between the   carbons of pairs of amino acids along the 1 and 2 helices  changed over the course of the simulations.
For the AAG and  ALG simulations at 300 K, we first computed the average distances between the  carbons of all pairs of amino acids along  the 1 and 2 helices.
The results for the AAG and ALG simulations were nearly identical (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating  that anchor modification did not appreciably alter the timeaveraged structure of the HLA-A2 peptide binding domain,  consistent with the crystallographic structures.
However, differences were observed when we examined the root mean  square (r.m.s.) fluctuations around the average distances.
Fig.  5c shows the differences in r.m.s.
fluctuations between the ALG  and AAG simulations for all pairs of  carbons across the 1  and 2 helices plotted as a heat map.
The fluctuations were  generally greater in the ALG simulation, in some places as  much as four standard deviations above the mean.
The results  were numerically significant, as indicated by the differences in  the histograms of the distance fluctuations in the two simulations (supplemental Fig. 1).
  The horizontal band outlined in Fig. 5c with dashed lines  showing greater fluctuations in the ALG simulation between  Lys-68 and Thr-73 on the 1 helix and Lys-144 and Leu-169 on  the 2 helix is of particular interest.
This region of the 1 helix  corresponds to that with higher atomic displacements highlighted in Fig. 5, a and b, and as noted above, it is adjacent to the  center of peptide.
The most intense portion of this band (outlined with a solid line) reflects fluctuations between this region  of the 1 helix and the region of the 2 helix with reduced  flexibility that is directly opposite.
We conclude from this that  substitution of Ala-2 with leucine in the MART-1 peptide leads  to enhanced fluctuations across the portion of the peptide binding groove that surrounds the center of the peptide.
  How might anchor modification of the peptide lead to greater  fluctuations of the HLA-A2 peptide binding groove?
In the ALG  simulation, the leucine side chain at position 2 of the peptide was  mobile within the HLA-A2 P2 pocket (Fig. 5d).
Due to the need to  avoid steric clashes, the greater dynamics of leucine 2 induced  greater dynamics in the side chain of His-70, which forms one  wall of the P2 pocket and is within the region of the1 helix with  the greatest degree of flexibilityin the ALGHLA-A2 complex.
The  movements in Leu-2 and His-70 also impacted the side chain  mobility ofTyr-99, whichis at the base of the P2 pocket and hydrogen-bonds to His-70 as well as Gly-3 of the peptide.
Thus, when  compared with alanine, the bulkier and more dynamic leucine in  the HLA-A2 P2 pocket can be directly connected to regions of the  peptide backbone and HLA-A2 1 helix that possess greater  dynamics in the ALGHLA-A2 complex.

The labeled ALG peptide had a substantially slower  rate of dissociation than the labeled AAG peptide, ranging from  10-fold slower at 15 C to 45-fold slower at 37 C (the initial  anisotropy of the ALG complex was 1020% lower at every  temperature, consistent with the greater flexibility of the peptide) (Fig. 6a).
We next used an Eyring analysis of dissociation  rates measured from 15 to 37 C to determine the thermodynamics of dissociation (21, 22).
As shown in Fig. 6b, the reduced  dissociation rate of the ALG peptide was attributable to a less  favorable activation entropy, i.e. when compared with the  native AAG peptide, the ALG complex gains less entropy as the  peptide moves from the bound state to the binding transition  state.
An interpretation of these data consistent with the molecular dynamics, NMR, and structural data is that the smaller gain  in entropy for the ALG peptide arises from a more dynamic  bound state.
Differences in solvation between the two transition states could also play a role given the more hydrophobic  leucine at position 2 of the ALG peptide.
This could help  explain the more favorable enthalpy change for dissociation of  the ALG peptide.
However, the concordance between the various sets of data suggests that dynamical differences between  the ALG and AAG pMHC complexes are a significant contributor to the dissociation thermodynamics.
  DISCUSSION  Anchor modification of peptides is a common strategy for  enhancing peptide-MHC binding affinity and is frequently used  in the design of peptide-based vaccine candidates for infectious  disease and cancer.
However, anchor modification is not always  successful at enhancing peptide immunogenicity.
Failures are  often attributed to the high sensitivity of the T cell receptor  FIGURE 4.

  Peptide Anchor Modification Enhances pMHC Flexibility  40170 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 286NUMBER 46NOVEMBER 18, 2011   at Georgian Court College on March 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from toward subtle chemical changes in antigenic peptides, although  the underlying mechanisms are usually not well understood.
  To examine how subtle peptide modifications can negatively  impact TCR recognition, we explored one of the most dramatic  failures of the anchor modification strategy reported: despite  substantially improving the interaction with HLA-A2, replacement of the suboptimal alanine at position 2 of the nonameric  MART-12735 melanoma antigen with leucine considerably  reduces or abolishes immunogenicity with a wide range of clonally diverse T cells (2, 4, 5).
This negative outcome has led to the  use of other MART-1 antigens in clinical trials for the immunological treatment of melanoma (e.g. Ref. 30) despite evidence  that the nonamer is the clinically relevant antigen in HLA-A2  individuals (31).
  The loss in immunogenicity with the modified MART-12735  nonamer is attributable to weaker TCR binding, as demonstrated here in a direct binding experiment with the DMF5  TCR.
However, anchor modification has only a minor structural effect on the peptide, leading to the partial occupancy of  an alternative flipped conformation for the central glycine at  position 5 of the peptide.
In the structures of two different  TCRs bound to the MART-12735 nonamer (32), there are no  interactions with the region of the peptide that is altered.
Further, as T cells that are sensitive to anchor modification also  recognize the decameric MART-12635 peptide, which possesses substantially greater structural variation in this region  (4), structural aspects alone cannot easily explain the poor recognition of the modified nonamer.
  The data presented here suggest a more general effect: rather  than altering the structure per se, anchor modification of the  MART-12735 peptide enhances ligand flexibility.
In addition to  inducing heterogeneity in the peptide, the enhanced flexibility  extends to the HLA-A2 1 and 2 helices, resulting in greater  breathing of the peptide binding domain.
The fluctuations in  the peptide and the peptide binding domain appear linked, with  the enhanced flexibility of the helices reducing steric barriers  that otherwise hinder peptide movement.
As protein flexibility  translates into conformational entropy, the result is that the  complex with the modified peptide possesses higher entropy.
  The higher entropy of the complex with the modified peptide  will have two consequences.
First, as the overall entropic penalty for binding will be reduced, binding of the peptide to  HLA-A2 will be improved to a degree beyond that expected  solely from the tighter packing and burial of hydrophobic surface associated with an alanine-to-leucine substitution at the P2  anchor position.
The peptide binding data are consistent with  this; anchor modification of the MART-12735 peptide  increases peptide binding to HLA-A2 by 40-fold (2).
For comparison, the same alanine-to-leucine P2 anchor modification in  the MART-12635 EAA decamer leads to a much smaller 2-fold  enhancement in binding affinity (2).
Importantly, there are no  indications that the modification in the decamer alters pMHC  structure or dynamics, and it does not negatively impact recognition by MART-1-specific T cells (4, 6).
  However, in addition to favorably impacting peptide binding  to HLA-A2, a higher entropy for the complex with the modified  MART-12735 peptide will negatively impact TCR binding.
  TCRs contact both peptide and MHC, and the majority of TCRs  whose structures have been determined focus on the center of  the peptide and the 1/2 helices (33).
This is true for the  DMF5 TCR used here, as well as the unrelated MART-12735-  specific DMF4 TCR (32).
As the formation of TCR-pMHC contacts in this region will necessitate a reduction in binding site  flexibility, the enhanced dynamics of the modified pMHC complex will result in a less favorable entropy change for TCR binding, translating into reduced affinity.
This effect has been seen  with the A6 TCR, which recognizes the Tax and Tel1p peptides  presented by HLA-A2.
The Tel1p peptide induces greater flexibility in the HLA-A2 2 helix, and as anticipated, receptor  binding occurs with a less favorable binding entropy change  (S  3 cal/K/mol) (34).
  In the case studied here, without a high affinity MART-12735-  specific TCR to quantify binding thermodynamics, the extent of  the increased entropic penalty for TCR binding resulting from  anchor modification of the peptide cannot be quantified.
Further, as different TCRs will require different contacts to pMHC,  FIGURE 6.

The much slower dissociation of  the ALG peptide is readily apparent.
b, Eyring analysis of peptide dissociation  data from 15 to 37 C.
The activation thermodynamics indicate that the  ALGHLA-A2 complex peptide gains less entropy moving from the bound to  the transition state, consistent with the greater flexibility seen in the  ALGHLA-A2 complex.
  Peptide Anchor Modification Enhances pMHC Flexibility  NOVEMBER 18, 2011VOLUME 286NUMBER 46 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 40171   at Georgian Court College on March 3, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from the overall impact will likely vary with different receptors.
However, the DMF5 TCR used here provides some guidance.
  Anchor modification to the MART-12735 peptide weakens the  KD of the DMF5 TCR from 68 M to greater than 3.3 mM,  amounting to an unfavorable loss in binding free energy of at  least 2.3 kcal/mol at 25 C. If we assume that this value is solely  attributable to conformational entropy, it translates into a minimum entropic penalty of 8 cal/K/mol.
In absolute terms, this is  not large as reported S values for TCR recognition of pMHC  span a 100 cal/K/mol range (35).
However, given the relatively  weak affinities and thus binding free energies associated with  TCR recognition of pMHC (and self-antigens in particular)  (36), the consequence of even a small gain in the entropic penalty for binding will be significant.
A 5 cal/K/mol increase in  binding S will convert TCR binding affinities occurring in the  range of 50100 M (a range typical for TCR recognition of  self-antigens) to 6001200 M, weaker than that typically  expected to result in a functional T cell response.
  This analysis leads us to consider a more refined view of TCR  specificity.
Receptor specificity, typically defined by changes in  peptide composition translating into a loss of recognition in  functional assays, is usually thought to arise from either the  disruption of favorable interactions or the introduction of unfavorable interactions between TCR and peptide.
This interpretation evokes the commonly held view that TCRs are highly  tuned toward the structure of a particular antigen.
We propose  that in the case of TCRs that recognize MART-1 antigens, this  is not the case.
The majority of these TCRs can in fact tolerate  substantial structural variation, as seen by the widespread  cross-reactivity between the 2735 AAG nonamer and the  structurally divergent 2635 EAA decamer (2, 4, 5), recently  visualized in crystallographic structures of the DMF4 and  DMF5 TCRs (32).
Rather, highly specific TCR recognition of  the MART-1 nonamer revealed by anchor modification may  arise because moderate TCR affinity allows what may be a relatively small increase in the entropic cost of binding to weaken  TCR affinity to levels that substantially weaken or fully ablate  the immunological response.
  Could this alternative view of specificity be a more general  phenomenon? It is notable that, at least for class I MHC molecules, the flexibility of the peptide binding domain seems to be  readily tunable via peptide or MHC alterations.
Complementing the data presented here, as noted above, we recently demonstrated that the flexibility of the HLA-A2 2 helix differs  when the Tax and Tel1p peptides are bound (34).
Fabian et al.  (27, 37, 38) have demonstrated that allelic variations as well as  peptide modifications induce different degrees of flexibility in  HLA-B27 subtypes.
It is thus possible that alterations in peptide  and MHC flexibility stemming from changes to antigenic peptides could explain other cases where T cells have been shown  to sense modifications to antigenic peptides despite any clear  indications of structural changes (e.g. Refs. 39 and 40).
  Altogether, these results suggest that further studies of the  dynamical consequences of peptide modifications are needed,  particularly in the design and optimization of peptide-based  vaccines.
Although predicting dynamical effects from structural alterations is challenging, the use of molecular simulations  in conjunction with structural information and other tools for  quantifying protein dynamics may be useful in such endeavors.
  Lastly, alterations of pMHC flexibility that weaken TCR binding could also serve as a mechanism for viral and tumor escape  from immune destruction.
