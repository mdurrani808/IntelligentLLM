ARTICLES  BMP signaling requires the binding of two types of receptor  serine/threonine kinases1,2.
The wrist epitope of BMP-2 binds BMP  receptor type IA (BRIA) and type IB (BRIB), whereas the knuckle  epitope binds BMP receptor type II and activin receptor type II3.
The  interaction of BMP with the receptor chains is under stringent control  of modulator proteins that bind to the ligand and, by blocking it,   prevent receptor activation and signaling46.
These proteins form  three distinct families, the noggin, chordin-SOG and DAN-cerberus  families, defined by the spacing between cysteine residues7.
The crystal  structure of the nogginBMP-7 complex has recently been described8.
  In accordance with previous findings that noggin interferes with  BMPs binding to both receptor types9, structural analysis showed that  the noggin binding sites of BMPs overlap with the wrist and knuckle  epitopes for receptor binding.
The functional epitope of BMPs  the pattern of residues determining specificity and affinity of noggin  bindingis not known.
The proteins of the noggin, chordin and DAN  families have different specificities and affinities for different BMPs5.
  Thus, different binding epitopes are likely to exist on the BMPs, and it  will be interesting to learn how these binding epitopes are constructed,  how they overlap with the receptor-binding wrist and knuckle   epitopes, and whether inhibitors could be generated that are specific  for each type.
  A medium-resolution structure analysis of the complex formed by  BMP-2 and the ectodomain of its high-affinity receptor BRIA showed  that the epitope of each protein comprises about 24 residues, burying a  total surface area of 2,310 2 on contact10.
Many possible hydrogen  bonds seem to exist at the interface, involving side chain and main  chain donors and acceptors.
A hydrophobic knob in hole contact has  been postulated to determine specificity and possibly affinity for type I  receptor binding.
However, an extensive mutational analysis of BMP-2  (ref. 3) and the BRIA receptor ectodomain11 showed no major binding  determinants at the interface, but numerous weak determinants.
Thus,  it remains unclear whether the binding affinity of this interface is generated through many weak interactions or whether there are major  binding determinants that have so far escaped detection owing to  experimental limitations.
  The present study was carried out to provide reliable data for future  structure-based molecular design of pharmacologically useful  inhibitors of specific BMPs.
We tried to identify the main determinants of BMP-2 for type I receptor binding through (i) a highresolution structure analysis of the complex to obtain a precise geometry for the hydrogen bonds; (ii) mutational analyses to vary side chain  (alanine, phenylalanine) and main chain (proline) hydrogen bond  determinants; (iii) interaction analysis of all variants to determine  their affinity for the receptor ectodomains and the human modulatory  proteins noggin, chordin domains CR1 (cysteine-rich domain-1) and  CR3, and gremlin; (iv) determination of the biological activity of the  variants in human promyoblast C2C12 cells and the mouse embryonal  carcinomaderived clonal cell line ATDC5.
  RESULTS  Hydrogen bonding in the BMP-2BRIAEC complex  The interface of BMP-2 and BRIA is distinct from other growth   factorreceptor interfaces.
The binding epitope of BMP-2 is highly  hydrophobic, with almost 60% of the contact surface area of 1,150 2  provided by hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1a,b).
As compared with the  binding epitopes of other growth factors, such as human growth   hormone12, interleukin-4 (ref. 13), erythropoietin14 or interleukin-6  (ref. 15), the hydrophobic contact area of BMP-2 is quite large.
A  hydrophobic wrist epitope seems to be characteristic of ligands of the  TGF- superfamily, as shown by structure-based sequence alignment.
  The knuckle epitope also has a hydrophobic core, as seen in the structures of the complexes BMP-7 with activin receptor II16, TGF-3 with  TGF- receptor II17 and activin A with activin receptor IIB18.

  Published online 4 April 2004; doi:10.1038/nsmb756  Molecular recognition of BMP-2 and BMP receptor IA  Sascha Keller, Joachim Nickel, Jin-Li Zhang, Walter Sebald & Thomas D Mueller  Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and other members of the TGF- superfamily regulate the development, maintenance  and regeneration of tissues and organs.
Binding epitopes for these extracellular signaling proteins have been defined, but hot  spots specifying binding affinity and specificity have so far not been identified.
In this study, mutational and structural analyses  show that epitopes of BMP-2 and the BRIA receptor form a new type of protein-protein interface.
The main chain atoms of   Leu 51 and Asp53 of BMP-2 represent a hot spot of binding to BRIA.
The BMP-2 variant L51P was deficient in type I receptor  binding only, whereas its overall structure and its binding to type II receptors and modulator proteins, such as noggin, were  unchanged.
Thus, the L51P substitution converts BMP-2 into a receptor-inactive inhibitor of noggin.
These results are relevant   for other proteins of the TGF- superfamily and provide useful clues for structure-based drug design.
  NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOLUME 11 NUMBER 5 MAY 2004 481   2004 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/natstructmolbiolARTICLES  contrast, the binding epitope of BRIA is less hydrophobic (30%) owing  to a stretch of polar and charged residues running across the binding  interface (Fig. 1b).
  The program HBPLUS19 identified ten intermolecular hydrogen  bonds in a single BMP-2/BRIA epitope (the dimer arrangement   comprises two epitopes with a total of 20 hydrogen bonds) (Table 1).
  BMP-2 provides five main chain atoms for hydrogen bonding and the  receptor provides four.
The residues engaged in hydrogen bonds are  clustered in two structural elements: the loop consisting of residues  Phe49Asn59 of BMP-2, and the short -helix and flanking sequences  (Asp84Arg97) of BRIA.
Two hydrogen bonds, BMP-2 Asp53  (N)BRIA Cys77 (O) and BMP-2 Ser69  (O)BRIA Gln94 (N), are formed exclusively  between main chain atoms, two more occur  between side chains, and four are mixed  hydrogen bonds formed between side chain  and main chain atoms (Table 1).
Eight of  these hydrogen bonds have donor-acceptor  distances (2.8  0.14 ) and N-O-C angles  ( = 137  11) as expected for bona fide  hydrogen bonds20.
The geometry of the  hydrogen bonds gives no hint for a ranking of  the contributions of individual bonds to  binding affinity.
  To explore whether the importance of  hydrogen bonds can be predicted from the  interface structure, we analyzed the residual  fractional accessibility (Fig. 1c).
This residual  accessibility in the complex correlates with  the location of a residue toward the core or  toward the periphery of the interface21.
Eight  of the ten interfacial hydrogen bonds occur  between residues located at the periphery.
  Only the two hydrogen bonds connecting the  receptor Gln86 side chain to the BMP-2  Leu51 main chain amide and carbonyl are  completely buried after complex formation  (Figs. 1c and 2a).
This interaction might represent a binding hot spot22.
  In addition, four water molecules that   have low temperature factors (B-factors) of  4050 2 (surrounding protein atoms have   B-factors of 35 2), and are in close proximity of the hot-spot Gln86 residue of BRIA, are  buried in the ligand-receptor interface  (Fig. 2b).
Three of these water molecules are  located near the side chain amide nitrogen  atom of BRIA Gln86 and form a hydrogenbonding network (Fig. 2b).
These water   molecules fill a sizeable cleft in the interface  with BRIA Lys97, blocking the entrance to the  cavity.
A single, isolated water molecule is  located in a space next to the side chain   carbonyl oxygen atom of BRIA Gln86.
This  cavity is blocked from the outside by residues  Phe49 and Pro50 of BMP-2.
  Mutational analysis of hydrogen bonds  To analyze the importance of hydrogen bonds  for affinity, we carried out interaction analysis  using BMP-2 and BRIAEC (extracellular  domain of BRIA) variants with two kinds of amino acid substitutions:  alanine substitutions introduced to disrupt side chain hydrogen bonds  (Table 1) and proline substitutions introduced to abolish hydrogen  bonding by the main chain amide group.
  Interaction analysis of BMP-2 variants with immobilized receptor  BRIAEC (Table 2) showed that the substitutions W28F, D53A and  Y103A have only minor effects on binding affinity.
The chargeintroducing substitution in variant S69R leads to a larger reduction in  affinity (17-fold).
Notably, the L51P and D53P substitutions result in  markedly lower affinities.
The apparent dissociation constant, KD, of  BRIAEC and L51P is >8,000 times higher than that of wild-type   482 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 5 MAY 2004 NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY  Figure 1 Architecture of the interaction of BMP-2 and BRIA.

   2004 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/natstructmolbiolARTICLES  BMP-2, and the KD of D53P is 53 times higher (Table 2 and  Supplementary Fig. 1 online).
Both show a similar difference in affinity for the BRIB receptor, indicating that identical determinants of  BMP-2 are used for binding of the two type I receptors.
This suggests  that the main chain hydrogen bonds disrupted in the two proline variants are major binding determinants, whereas the side chain bonds of  Trp28, Asp53, Ser69 and Tyr103 have only minor roles in the binding  to the BRIA and BRIB receptors.
  The affinity of the proline variants for the type II receptors, such as  activin receptors II (Table 2) and IIB as well as the BMP receptor II, is no  different from that of the wild type.
This confirms that the gross structure of the protein variants must not be much altered, as possible structural alterations (owing to the proline introduced) are not propagated to  the nearby epitope for type II receptor binding (the knuckle epitope).
  To identify binding determinants of BRIA, we prepared three receptor variants.
When immobilized on the biosensor, the receptor Q94P  variant bound BMP-2 with a threefold lower affinity than did the wildtype ectodomain (Table 2), indicating that the main chainmain chain  hydrogen bond lost contributes only marginally to binding.
We saw a  similarly small difference in affinity for S90A.
In contrast, the receptor  Q86A substitution resulted in an 89-fold higher KD for BMP-2.
  Because data for BMP-2 L51P had already shown that disruption of  this interaction leads to a large decrease in affinity, these results confirmed that the affected hydrogen bonds represent the major binding  determinants (see above).
Most notably, the hot spot identified by the  mutational analysis coincides with the hot spot suggested by the analysis of the residual fractional accessibility of the engaged donor and  acceptor groups (Fig. 1c).
However, the loss in affinity is less severe for  the receptor variant Q86A (Table 2) than for the BMP-2 substitution  L51P.
This discrepancy might be explained by compensating interactions with neighboring side chains in the receptor, such as Lys79,  Glu81 or Asp89, which might partially offset the effect of the deleted  carboxamide group of Gln86 (Fig. 1b).
Alternatively, the sterically  restricted Pro51 in BMP-2 L51P might introduce steric hindrance or  disturb nearby bonds by local structural rearrangements, for example  between the BMP-2 Asp53 backbone amide and the receptor Cys77  carbonyl, and thus the large decrease in binding affinity may be caused  by disruption of several interactions (Fig. 2a).
  Structure of proline BMP-2 variant L51P  To determine possible structural alterations, we subjected L51P and  D53P to crystallization.
Crystals of BMP-2 L51P could be obtained  under conditions similar to those for wild-type BMP-2 and had crystal  parameters almost identical to those of the wild-type protein  (Supplementary Table 1 online).
The variant D53P did not crystallize  under those conditions; crystals obtained from either ethanol or   2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol diffracted only to very low resolution and  were not analyzed further.
  Except for the site of mutation, the structures of wild-type BMP-2  and L51P are identical within the limits of error of the structure  determination method (Supplementary Fig. 2 online); the root mean  square (r.m.s.) deviation for the C-atom positions was 0.6 . We  observed larger changes only in the pre-helix loop comprising  residues Pro48His54.
The distances between the C positions of  these residues in the wild type and variant exceeded 1 , with the  largest difference being 1.8  for the C of Ala52 (Supplementary  Fig. 2 online).
The side chains of Leu51 (wild type) and Pro51 (variant) both point into the hydrophobic core of BMP-2 and show similar  van der Waals contacts with neighboring residues.

The preceding peptide bond (Phe49Pro50) in  variant L51P is in cis conformation.
This is also observed in the highresolution structure of the BMP-2BRIA complex.
In contrast, in the  structure of free BMP-2 (PDB entry code 3BMP), this peptide bond is  in the trans form.
However, this observation might be an interpretation error caused by the lower quality of the electron density map of  the wild-type BMP-2 data in this region.
For residues Asp53 and  His54, we observed only weak electron density for the side chains in  the data of wild-type BMP-2 and BMP2 L51P.
Therefore, we could  not unambiguously define the side chain conformations of both  residues.
  Notably, a comparison of the structures of BMP-2 in its free and  bound state showed that differences in the pre-helix loop are of similar  magnitude to those between wild-type BMP-2 and variant L51P.
This  suggests that the conformation of the pre-helix loop is neither preformed nor fixed.
On complex formation, the pre-helix loop probably  changes its conformation through induced fit enforced by the surface  geometry of the receptor.
High-temperature factors in the pre-helix  segment (Fig. 3b), indicating a flexible backbone support this hypothesis.
Therefore, differences seen between the structures of free wildtype BMP-2 and the variant L51P might not explain the loss of binding  affinity for BRIA, because the free structures do not reliably indicate  whether the pre-helix loop can adopt the conformation of the bound  form seen in the complex.
It seems puzzling, however, that the mutation of BRIA Q86A should have a much smaller effect on binding  affinity than the mutation of BMP-2 L51P, assuming that both mutations disrupt the same hydrogen bonds.
Additional effects from the  introduced proline residue must account for the much greater loss in  binding affinity in BMP-2 L51P.
  Superposition of the structure of BMP-2 L51P and the BMP-2  BRIAEC complex showed that part of the proline ring occupies the volume formerly used by the hydrogen bond between the BMP-2 Leu51  amide and the side chain carbonyl of BRIAEC Gln86 (Fig. 3a).
The  larger spatial requirement for the proline ring thus introduces steric  hindrance affecting the side chain of BRIAEC Gln86 (Fig. 3a).
To  accommodate Pro51 in the interface between BMP-2 and BRIA, its  side chain needs to be pushed back further.
Because of the rigid ring  structure that couples the N-terminal peptide bond to the ring orientation, this push causes the backbone carbonyl of Pro50 to move  toward the side chain of BRIAEC Gln86.
Thus, removal of one steric  hindrance introduces another one. One way or the other, steric hindrance cannot be avoided, possibly explaining the large loss of binding  energy by the mutation L51P.
  Proline variants and biological activity  We assessed the biological activity of the BMP-2 proline variants by  dose-dependent induction of alkaline phosphatase activity using both  promyoblast C2C12 cells and the more sensitive mouse embryonal  carcinomaderived clonal cell line ATDC5.
The dose of wild-type  BMP-2 resulting in half-maximal response (ED50) was 25 nM in  C2C12 cells and 8 nM in ATDC5 cells.
In contrast, BMP-2 L51P had  no measurable biological activity in either C2C12 (>1,600 nM) or  ATDC5 cells (>1,500 nM).
BMP-2 D53P showed ED50 values of   330 nM and 140 nM for C2C12 and ATDC5 cells, respectivelyabout  1317 times higher than those of wild-type BMP-2.
Thus, the decrease  in BRIA receptor affinity for the two BMP-2 proline variants parallels  their loss of biological activity (Fig. 4).
Because the proline substitution of BMP-2 Leu51 affects only the interaction with the type I receptor and not the interaction with the type II receptor, L51P might be  expected to function as a dominant-negative inhibitor.
However, we  did not observe such an effect when we applied concentrations of up to  250 nM of the variant to cells stimulated with 20 nM BMP-2 (data not  shown).
In comparison, the basal alkaline phosphatase activity in  ATDC5 cells was inhibited by the antagonistic BMP-2 A34D variant3  but not by L51P (Fig. 4a).

   2004 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/natstructmolbiolARTICLES  Proline variants as antagonists of modulator proteins  The lack of BMP-2 L51P to bind to BRIAEC raised the question of  whether the interaction with other binding proteins might also be  affected by the proline substitution.
Of particular interest is noggin,  which binds to BMPs with high affinity.
Other important modulator  proteins are chordin, which interacts with BMP-2 by means of two   cysteine-rich domains, and gremlin, which interacts through a   so-called DAN domain.
We immobilized each of these three proteins  at the surface of a biosensor and analyzed their interactions with   BMP-2 variants (Table 3).
  The dissociation constants, KD, of the two BMP-2 proline variants  for the complex with noggin were similar to those of wild-type BMP-2,  ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 nM. Thus, BMP-2 Leu51 and Asp53 are not the  main binding determinants for noggin, even though the noggin N terminus is in contact with the BMP-7 region, corresponding to BMP-2  Leu51 (BMP-7 Leu75) and Asp53 (BMP-7 Ser77, pre-helix loop)8, and  noggin inhibits BRIA binding to BMP-2.
  The affinities of BMP-2 for the chordin domains CR1 and CR3 and  for gremlin were 1030 times lower than for noggin (Table 3).
Again,  we found a similar KD for wild-type BMP-2 and the two proline variants, indicating that the binding of these proteins is not affected by the  proline substitutions.
Thus, the BMP-2 epitopes for both binding proteins must be different from the epitope for the BRIA receptor.
  L51P neutralizes noggin inhibition in C2C12 cells  BMP-2 induces the expression of alkaline phosphatase in starved  C2C12 cells.
An equimolar concentration of a noggin-Fc fusion protein inhibited this response to background levels (Fig. 5).
The inhibition of BMP-2 activity by noggin can be relieved in a dose-dependent  manner by L51P (Fig. 5).
At equimolar concentrations of L51P and  noggin, >80% of noggins inhibitory effect is neutralized.
This indicates that the receptor-dead L51P variant is an efficient inhibitor of  noggin.
This result is in accordance with physical binding studies  showing disruption of type I receptor binding and conservation of  noggin binding after BMP-2 L51P substitution (Fig. 4 and Table 3).
  DISCUSSION  The determination of binding affinity and specificity for type I receptor interaction by the wrist epitope of BMP-2 represents a new type of  molecular recognition in ligandreceptor complexes.
First, three main  chain groups involved in a hydrogen-bonding networkthe amide  and carbonyl of Leu51 and the amide of  Asp53are used as the main binding determinants.
Second, the large hydrophobic  patch, comprising 15 side chains, does not (as  we might have expected) contain a binding  free energy hot spot, but instead provides an  appropriate environment for the adjacent  hydrogen-bonding network.
Third, the   binding hot spot is located in a flexible loop  element that, upon complex formation,  becomes fixed as a result of induced fit.
  Mutational analysis, including analysis of  proline substitutions, was crucial in establishing that only the three hydrogen bonds  involving the main chain groups in the  hydrophobic core region are important   binding determinants.
Each of the hydrogen  bonds formed between peripheral groups can  be destroyed without substantial effect.
These  observations support the idea that main chain  groups embedded in a hydrophobic surrounding are good candidates  for functionally important hydrogen bonding.
  Structure and refolding after denaturation of BMP-2 are very permissive of amino acid substitutions.
The cystine knot seems to stabilize  the two-stranded -sheets and the loop regions.
The pre-helix loop  (Pro48His54), which is probably mobile in the free ligand, tolerates  even proline substitutions of Leu51 and Asp53 without substantial  structural alterations.
The introduced proline residue lacks the hydrogen bond donating group in the main chain; however, its side chain  can cause steric hindrance during receptor binding.
In BMP-2 L51P,  both effects are probably involved in the unusually large drop in binding free energy for binding to BRIA (G0 = 5 kcal mol1).
Half of this  loss is likely to be caused by the missing hydrogen bond, because the  binding free energy is reduced by G0 = 2.5 kcal mol1 in the receptor Q86A variant.
Modeling of the D53P variant suggests that a proline  residue at position 53 does not cause steric hindrance during receptor  binding.
  The interaction between BMP-2 and BRIAEC has an apparent dissociation constant of about 1 nM (ref. 4).
Complex formation is quite  slow compared to that in other receptor systems, with an association  rate constant, kon, of between 3  105 M1s1 and 5  105 M1s1.
This  could be explained by induced fit and immobilization of mobile binding determinants during receptor binding.
Notably, in the unbound  state the pre-helix loop of BMP-2 shows the highest temperature factors of all main chain atoms (Fig. 3b).
Upon complex formation, however, the temperature factors become much lower (Fig. 3b) and the  segment accordingly becomes very rigid.
The high mobility of the prehelix loop seems to be conserved within the BMP family, as corresponding segments in the structures of free BMP-7 (refs. 16,23),  NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOLUME 11 NUMBER 5 MAY 2004 485  1 10 100  ALP/ATDC5 (rel. units)  1.0  2.0  0.0  1.0  2.0  0.0  ALP/C2C12 (rel. units)  1 10 100  BMP protein (nM) BMP protein (nM)  BMP-2  BMP-2 L51P  BMP-2 D53P  BMP-2 A34D  BMP-2  BMP-2 D53P  BMP-2 L51P  a b  Figure 4 Biological activity of BMP-2 proline variants.

   2004 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/natstructmolbiolARTICLES  BMP-6 and GDF-5 also show elevated temperature factors (T.M.,  unpublished data).
In addition, the conformation of the pre-helix loop  differs significantly among the four BMP proteins, whereas the rest of  the backbone is similar.
The flexibility of the pre-helix loop also seems  to be retained in BMP-7 bound to the activin type II receptor16.
This is  plausible because the binding site for type II receptors is located in the  knuckle epitope and no contacts are made between the type II receptor  and the pre-helix region.
However, this region becomes rigid upon  binding of BMP-7 to noggin, owing to interaction of the pre-helix loop  with the noggin N terminus8,24.
The observed flexibility of the prehelix loop of the BMPs might therefore be a requirement for adaptation to different surface shapes of the various binding partners.
  Notably, mutation of Phe49 and Pro50 of the pre-helix loop to alanine  affects only the association rate of the complex; the dissociation rate,  which correlates with the complexs thermodynamic stability, is unaltered.
This suggests that these two residues, which bind into a  hydrophobic cleft close to Ile62 and Ile99 of BRIA, are required to put  the pre-helix loop into the backbone conformation necessary to form  the hydrogen-bonding network.
  Residue Leu51 is invariant in members of the BMP-2BMP-4, BMP5BMP-6BMP-7, and GDF-5GDF-6GDF-7 protein subfamilies, all  of which interact functionally with the receptors BRIA and BRIB.
  Gln86 of BRIA is invariant in the related BRIB receptor but not in  other type I chains.
This suggests that the hydrogen bond between  these residues is important for the binding of all the BMPs and GDFs  to the BRIA and BRIB receptors.
Notably, the hydrogen-bonding partners in the pre-helix loop of the ligand also participate in the interaction of the noggin N terminus and BMP-7: the backbone carbonyl of  BMP-7 Leu75 (equivalent to BMP-2 Leu51) interacts with the backbone amide of noggin His32, and the amide of BMP-7 Ser77 (equivalent to BMP-2 Asp53) forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of  noggin Tyr30.
In addition, the backbone torsion angles for the prehelix loop of BMP-2 and BMP-7 are very similar in their bound conformation, but differ in the unbound state.
Considering the very  different binding motifs of BRIA and noggin and their similar geometries in the bound conformation, this suggests that the two backbone  hydrogen-bonding elements might serve as a general recognition  motif in the BMP ligands, although these do not always represent a  main binding determinant as shown for the interaction of BMP-2 and  noggin (Table 3).
Notably, the pre-helix loop element is also important  for the binding of TGF- to its type I receptor25,26.
Oligopeptides comprising the residues of the pre-helix loop could be used as antagonists  of TGF- signaling, as could antibodies raised against this loop region.
  It therefore seems that the pre-helix loop represents a conserved recognition motif in the TGF- superfamily, despite considerable differences in the architecture of the ligand-receptor complexes observed in  the structures of BMP-7 bound to the activin type IIB receptor16 and  TGF-3 bound to the TGF type II receptor17.
  A further distinctive feature of the contact between BMP-2 and  BRIA is the small number of water molecules in the interface.
They are  located in the core of the contact surrounding the functionally important hydrogen bonds between the receptor Gln86 (NE2, OE1) and  BMP-2 Leu51 (N, O).
Three water molecules occupy a hollow space  close to the side chain NH2 of BRIA Gln86; the fourth is located close  to the oxygen atom of the side chain carboxamide group of BRIA  Gln86 (Figs. 1c and 2b).
All the water molecules form a hydrogenbonding network with BRIA Gln86 and surrounding neighbors.
Aside  from their possible function in the formation and stabilization of the  intermolecular bidentate hydrogen bonds between BMP-2 Leu51 and  BRIA Gln86, these water molecules could also serve as mobile spatial  building blocks to allow adaptation to different surface shapes of   different binding partners.
The limited promiscuity observed for the  ligand-receptor interaction in the TGF- superfamily probably  requires easy adaptation to changes in amino acid composition and  hence surface shape.
  Identification of the functional epitope of BMP-2 for receptor BRIA  binding is of interest for the development of specific inhibitors.
BMP2  interacts with numerous proteins beside type I and II receptor chains.
  Type II receptor interaction occurs at the knuckle epitope of BMP-2  and BMP-7 (refs. 3,16).
The identification of binding epitopes of  BMPs for the noggin-type, DAN-type, and chordin-SOG-type modulators is still in its infancy.
The recent X-ray structure analysis of the  BMP-7noggin complex represents a highlight in this respect8,24.
  According to the X-ray structure, noggin occupies and blocks the two  knuckle and the two wrist epitopes of the BMP dimer.
As discussed  above, the N-terminal segment of noggin has extensive contacts with  the pre-helix loop of the BMP, including the residues corresponding to  Asp53 and Leu51 in BMP-2.
Our results here indicate, however, that  the main determinants in BMP-2 for type I receptor binding are not  part of the BMP-2 epitope functioning in noggin binding.
  BMP-2 L51P binds with unaltered affinity not only to noggin but  also to other modulatory proteins, such as the chordins CR1 and CR3  and the DAN protein gremlin.
This opens up the possibility of developing receptor-dead inhibitors for other members of the chordin and  DAN families.
Possible targets are the DAN family member sclerostin,  which limits bone regeneration and anabolism in adults, or the  chordin family members CTGF or CYR61, which may be involved in  the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases.
The high affinity (subnanomolar  KD) of BMP-2 L51P for the dimeric noggin already provides distinct  discrimination in relation to DAN and chordin proteins that have up  to 50-fold lower affinities for BMPs.
A detailed analysis, for example  by screening against a large collection of BMP-2 variants, will be  needed to determine how the epitopes for these proteins overlap,  coincide or differ.
  The present experiments localize the main determinants of BMP-2  for BRIA binding in a continuous epitope in the pre-helix loop  (Pro48 to His54).

Such inhibitors might be useful for diseases (such as  fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, cranial synostosis and sclerosteosis) that involve bone overproduction resulting from elevated  BMP activity.
  METHODS  Preparation of proteins.
Preparation of BMP-2 variant and BMP receptor proteins was done as earlier described27,28.
Variants for BMP-2 or BRIAEC were  obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange (Stratagene)  methodology3.
Binding activity of the refolded BMP-2 variants was assessed by  measurement of the binding affinity for BMP type I and II receptor using  BIAcore methodology.
Preparation of the BMP-2BRIAEC complex for structure analysis was done as earlier described28.
  Crystallization of the proteins.
BMP-2 L51P was crystallized by hanging-drop  vapor diffusion at 21 C 15% (v/v) t-butanol, 0.1 M lithium sulfate and 0.1 M  sodium citrate, pH 5.0, using a protein concentration of 8 mg ml1.
  Crystallization of the BMP-2BRIAEC complex was done as earlier described10;  crystals for measurement at 100 K were obtained by co-crystallization with glucose as a cryoprotectant.
High-quality crystals for data acquisition were grown  from 0.75 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M imidazole, pH 7.0, and 30% (w/v) glucose  at 10 C using a protein concentration of 11 mg ml1.
  X-ray data acquisition.
Data for the complex of BMP-2 with BRIAEC were  obtained from a single crystal at 100 K at the beamline X06SA PX at the Swiss  Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland).
The data were processed  and integrated using the software MOSFLM version 6.2.1 (ref. 29) and scaling  was done using SCALA CCP4 version 4.2.1 (refs.
30,31); a summary of the processing statistics is given in Supplementary Table 1 online.
Diffraction data for  BMP-2 L51P were collected at room temperature on a Rigaku RU-300 X-ray  generator equipped with Osmic ConfocalBlue optics and a Rigaku R-AXIS  IV++ image-plate system.
Data from two crystals were collected, merged and  scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA2931.
  Structure determination.
The structure of the complex of BMP-2 with BRIAEC  was refined using the lower-resolution structure (PDB entry 1ES7) as a start  model.
The program REFMAC5 (ref. 32) was used for refinement, which was  followed by manual rebuilding of the model using the software QUANTA2000  (Accelrys).
One TLS group was defined for each chainthat is, BMP-2  monomers and each BRIAEC moleculeto correct possible anisotropy in the  data33.
The progress of refinement was monitored by cross-validation using a  test data set comprising 5% of the reflections34.
In the final round of refinement, Fobs  Fcalc difference electron density maps were used to identify 185  water molecules.
The final minimization cycle yielded an R-factor of 20.7% and  a value of 22.9% for Rfree.
The structure analysis of BMP-2 L51P was performed  using CNS 1.1 for simulated annealing and energy minimization.
The structure  of wild-type BMP-2 (PDB entry 3BMP) served as a starting model.
Manual  rebuilding of the model was based on A-weighted 2Fobs  Fcalc and Fobs  Fcalc  electron density maps; in the final round of refinement 13 water and 2 MPD  molecules were added.
The R-factor for the final structure of BMP-2 L51P is  21.5% and 23.5% for Rfree.
  Interaction analysis.
Interaction analysis was performed using a BIA2000 system.
Proteins were biotinylated and immobilized on CM5 streptavidin-coated  sensor chips (ref. 5).
The extracellular domains of BRIA, BRIB and ARII were  prepared and analyzed under conditions as described3.
Interaction with noggin-Fc, chordin and gremlin (R&D Systems) could be measured after regeneration of the chip surface with 0.1 M acetic acid, 1 M NaCl, and 6 M guanidinium  chloride.
The sensorgrams were evaluated using the software BIAevaluation  version 2.0 (BIAcore) assuming a 1:1 interaction.
Bulk face effects were corrected by subtracting the control flow cell (FC1) from all sensorgrams; nonspecific binding was negligible.
The analysis yielded kinetic constants for complex  formation (kon) and dissociation (koff).
The latter were evaluated at near saturating concentrations of analyte during the first 10 s of complex dissociation.
  The apparent binding constant of each variant was obtained using six or seven  analyte concentrations (10300 nM).
Mean values with a standard deviation of  35% for koff and 12% for kon were deduced from 612 independent  measurements.
Apparent dissociation constants, KD, were calculated either as  KD = koff/kon or by evaluating the dose dependency of equilibrium binding.
  Mean values together with the mean standard deviation are given in Tables 2  and 3.
  Biological activity in cell lines.
Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined in  serum-starved ATDC5 (Riken Bioresource Center, cell number RCB0565) and  C2C12 (ATCC CRL-1772) cells3.
The cells were stimulated at a density of   3  104 cells per well in a 96-well microtiter plate for 3 d with varying concentrations of wild-type or variant BMP-2 protein in 100 l of Dulbeccos modified  eagle medium (DMEM) containing 2% (v/v) calf serum.
Cells were washed  with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 100 l of 1% (v/v) NP-40  in alkaline phosphatase buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 9.6, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM  ZnCl2).
Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined by incubating lysed cells  for 15 min with 100 l alkaline phosphatase buffer plus 1 mg ml1 p-nitrophenylphosphate and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm.
One A405  absorbance unit corresponds to 1.5 nmol of p-nitrophenolate produced per  minute per 3  104 cells.
Relief of noggin inhibition was assessed by incubating  C2C12 cells with 20 nM noggin plus 20 nM BMP-2 and increasing concentrations (530 nM) of BMP-2 L51P.
Results are given as mean values from six  determinations done in parallel for each condition.
