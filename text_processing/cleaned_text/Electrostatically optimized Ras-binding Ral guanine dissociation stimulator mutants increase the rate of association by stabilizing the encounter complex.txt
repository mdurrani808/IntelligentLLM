Electrostatically optimized Ras-binding Ral guanine  dissociation stimulator mutants increase the rate of  association by stabilizing the encounter complex  C. Kiel*, T. Selzer, Y. Shaul, G.

Here, by using the  computer algorithm PARE, we designed a set of mutants of the Ras  effector protein Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator  (RalGDS) with optimized electrostatic steering.
The fastest binding  RalGDS mutant, M26K,D47K,E54K, binds Ras 14-fold faster and  25-fold tighter compared with WT.
A linear correlation was found  between the calculated and experimental data, with a correlation  coefficient of 0.97 and a slope of 0.65 for the 24 mutants produced.
  The data suggest that increased electrostatic steering specifically  stabilizes the encounter complex and transition state.
This conclusion is backed up by  analysis of the encounter complex and  transition state of the RalGDSM26K,D47K,E54KRas complex, with  both values being close to 1.
Upon further formation of the final  complex, the increased Coulombic interactions are probably counterbalanced by the cost of desolvation of charges, keeping the  dissociation rate constant almost unchanged.
This mechanism is  also reflected by the mutual compensation of enthalpy and entropy changes quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry.
The  binding constants of the faster binding RalGDS mutants toward  Ras are similar to those of Raf, the most prominent Ras effector,  suggesting that the design methodology may be used to switch  between signal transduction pathways.
  Members of the Ras-related superfamily of GTP-binding  proteins are small, 20- to 25-kDa proteins that bind  guanine nucleotides very tightly and cycle between an inactive  GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state (1, 2).
In the  GTP-bound state, Ras proteins can interact with effector molecules as downstream targets, thereby communicating signals  into different pathways (3).
In recent years, many effector  molecules, such as c-Raf, Ral guanine dissociation stimulator  (RalGDS), AF6, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have been  identified.
These effectors do not share biological functions or  sequence homology except for the common Ras-binding domain  (RBD).
This domain is responsible for binding to the effector  region of RasGTP.
The structures of all RBDs resolved so far  share a common fold that is similar to that of ubiquitin (reviewed  in ref. 4).
Despite these structural similarities, biochemical  studies have shown that the various effector RBDs interact with  proteins of the Ras family with different affinities that dictate the  specificity of the interaction (5).
  An important feature of Raseffector RBD interactions is the  high charge complementarity found between the proteins in the  complex.
Ras has a net negatively charged binding site, whereas  the effector RBDs have a net positively charged binding site.
As  a result, the rate of association between them was found to be  very high and contributes significantly to the affinity of the  complex (6, 7).
Furthermore, differences in binding affinities for  some of the Raseffector complexes are a consequence of  different association rate constants, with the dissociation rate  constants being at a similar range (6, 7).
For example, the high,  nanomolar affinity of the binding of Raf-RBD to Ras is attributed to the very high kon value, which stems from the strong  electrostatic complementarity between the RasRaf-RBD binding sites.
In contrast, the electrostatic complementarity between  Ras and RalGDS-RBD binding sites is poor, accounting for their  slower rate of association and lower affinity.
It seems that the  rate of association is of major importance in determining the  affinity and specificity of Raseffector interactions.
  According to the concept of electrostatic steering, two proteins first diffuse randomly in solution until they reach a point  where they feel the electrostatic field of each other.
Then the  proteins come together by directional diffusion until they form  a low affinity encounter complex (811).
The nature of the  interactions stabilizing the encounter complex has been discussed frequently (12, 13).
Most often, the encounter complex is  not observed experimentally, but is assigned from theoretical  considerations.
However, this two-step reaction could be assigned experimentally to the association of Ras and effector  RBDs (6, 7, 14, 15) as presented in Scheme 1,  Ras  RBD |9=  k1  k1  [Ras:RBD] |9=  k2  k2  Ras:RBD,  where Ras and RBD are the free proteins, [Ras:RBD] is the  encounter complex, and Ras:RBD is the final complex.
  The RalGDS-RBDRas interaction is well suited for teaching  researchers about the nature of the encounter complex, because  it can be directly observed by using stopped-flow experiments.
  Here, we used a protein design strategy to optimize the electrostatic complementarity between these two proteins through  the introduction of charged mutations at the vicinity of, but  outside, the binding site (16) to determine the influence of  electrostatic steering on the different steps along the association  pathway while keeping the influence on short-range effects as  low as possible.
The design and implementation of these mutants  and subsequent analysis of their influence on binding is the  subject of this paper.

The alanine mutants were  available from earlier studies (7, 17).
  Protein Expression and Purification.
RalGDS-RBDWT and mutant  proteins were expressed as described earlier (7, 17).
Ha-Ras  (here termed Ras) was cloned in Ptac vector and expressed  by using Escherichia coli CK600K cells.
The expressed Ras  protein was purified, and the bound nucleotide was exchanged  for the nonhydrolyzable nucleotides 5-guanosyl-, -imidotriphosphate (GppNHp) or 2,3-N-methylanthraniloyl-GppNHp  (mGppHHp) as described (18).
The protein concentrations of  Ras and RalGDS-RBD were measured by the Bradford method.
  Calculation of Association Rate Constants.
kon values of the mutant  RalGDS-RBDRas complexes were calculated relative to the  experimental value of the WT complex by using the computer  program PARE as described (16).
For calculations, it is assumed  that the association is directly related to the magnitude of  electrostatic forces between the two proteins, which is calculated  in terms of electrostatic energy of interaction as presented in  refs.
11 and 16.
Calculations were done under the same ionic  strength as the relevant measurements.
Coordinates for calculations of the RalGDS-RBDRas complex and for the individual  proteins were taken from its x-ray structure (19).
All mutations  were modeled by using SWISS PDB VIEWER (20).
  Stopped-Flow Measurements.
Measurements of association rate  constants were done by using an SM17 apparatus (Applied  Photophysics, Surrey, U.K.) by rapid mixing of 0.5 M Ras  bound to mGppNHp and 5200 M RalGDS-RBD.
Nmethylanthraniloyl nucleotides were excited at 360 nm, and the  fluorescence was recorded through a 408-nm cutoff filter.
Binding of RalGDS-RBD to Ras was detected by a change in the  fluorescence of the N-methylanthraniloyl nucleotide as described earlier (6, 7).
Because RalGDS-RBD was in 10-fold  molar excess, an exponential equation was fitted to the fluorescence traces according to pseudofirst-order kinetics.
The resulting inverse time constant corresponds to the observed rate  constant kobs within an experimental error of 1020%.
Unless  indicated otherwise, all measurements were done in buffer  containing 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 5 mM MgCl2 at 25C.
  Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC).
The thermodynamic parameters of Raseffector interactions were determined by using an  ITC (MCS-ITC, MicroCal, Amherst, MA) as described (21).
In  all experiments, the effector RBDs were placed into the cell  at concentrations varying between 10 and 80 M, depending on  the expected association constant.
The concentration of  RasGppNHp in the syringe was 10-fold higher compared with  the effector concentration in the cell.
Data evaluation was done  as described in ref.
5, yielding G and H values with 0.2  kcalmol error bars each.
For the n value, defined as the  stoichiometry of the Raseffector complex, an experimental  error of 0.1 was obtained.
All ITC experiments were carried out  at 25C in 15 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.45 mM MgCl2.
  Results  The association rate constant between a pair of proteins has been  shown to depend on electrostatic steering, which is related to the  electrostatic complementarity of the two binding proteins.
Although Ras is mainly negatively charged in its effector binding  region, RalGDS-RBD has a mixed charge surface as presented  in Fig. 1.
Some weak positive charge is calculated at the center  of the Ras binding site, whereas a strong negatively charged  patch is observed at the periphery.
In contrast, Raf-RBD (Fig.  1e) has a strong positive potential in and around the Ras binding  site.
The charge distribution of RalGDS-RBD indicates that the  introduction of additional positive charges within RalGDS-RBD  has the potential to increase the electrostatic interaction energy  between RalGDS and Ras (Fig. 1d) and thereby increasing the  rate of their association.
  Design and Production of Faster Binding RalGDS-RBD Mutants.
In the  first step of calculation, a positive or negative charge was  assigned to all side-chains along the Ras or RalGDS-RBD  sequences, and the increase in association rate was calculated by  using PARE (Fig. 2).
The calculations show that the potential to  increase the rate of association by mutation of Ras is limited,  whereas mutations on RalGDS-RBD have a major potential to  increase kon.
This finding reflects the charge distribution of the  respective binding sites, which is negatively charged on Ras and  neutral on RalGDS-RBD; it also explains why only mutations to  a positive charge on RalGDS-RBD have the potential to increase  association significantly.
Two hot-spot regions for association  on RalGDS-RBD were identified: One is between residues  2529, and the second is between residues 4752 (Figs. 1a and  2).
The latter regions are not located within the interface and are  therefore good candidates for mutagenesis if changes in the  binding site are to be avoided.
The most promising residues for  faster binding were mutated in silico to Lys and minimized; the  contribution of multiple mutant rotomers to association was  calculated.
To keep dissociation rates constant, only residues  Fig. 1.

The final calculated kon values are given in Table 2, which  is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site.
  Mutations to Lys of uncharged single amino acid residues located  at the vicinity of the Ras binding site (S18K, L19K, M26K, L51K,  N88K, and Y89K) are calculated to lead to accelerations between 1.7- and 4.5-fold, whereas mutations of negatively charged  residues to Lys (E54K and D90K) are predicted to result in a 3-  to 5.5-fold increase of the association rate constants.
The largest  effect on the rate of association was predicted for the RalGDSRBD mutant D47K (10-fold).
  Based on our predictions, mutations were introduced into  RalGDS-RBD by using site-directed mutagenesis, and the corresponding proteins were produced.
The mutant proteins were  purified by using standard methodology, yielding soluble proteins in comparable amounts to those of WT.
Because mutations  may cause a destabilization of the protein structure, some of the  mutant proteins were evaluated for their thermal stability by  differential scanning calorimetry (data not shown).
No significant changes in the shape of the melting curve or in the melting  temperature were measured, indicating that these mutations do  not cause large structural changes.
  Kinetic Investigation of Mutant Complexes.
The interaction of  RalGDS-RBD with Ras was measured by using a stopped-flow  as described earlier (6, 7).
To keep Ras in an active conformation, the GTP in Ras was exchanged for the nonhydrolyzable  nucleotide analogue GppNHp attached to the N-methylanthraniloyl group as a fluorescence label (RasmGppNHp).
Under  pseudofirst-order conditions (with the concentration of RalGDS-RBD being at least 10-fold higher than the RasmGppNHp  concentration), the observed time-dependent fluorescence  changes can be fitted to a single exponential equation.
For a  single-step reaction, the values of the observed rate constants  (kobs) increase linearly with increasing RBD concentration, as  observed at low RBD concentrations (Fig. 3a).
However, at  higher RBD concentrations, the increase in kobs lags behind  the increase in concentration until saturation is reached at  very high concentrations (Fig. 3b).
According to a two-step  mechanism shown in Scheme 1, the observed rate constant can  be described as  Fig. 2.
Calculating the effect of a charge mutation along the protein  sequence.
To produce this figure, the program PARE was modified to simulate  single point charge mutations.
Each residue was introduced with a positive or  negative charge.
Then the relative rate of association was recalculated.
The  process was repeated for all residues along the polypeptide chain of
both  proteins.
The location of the binding site is marked.
The calculations were  done at an ionic strength of 0.018 M.  Fig. 3.

These  measurements were performed at 10C, and the curves were fitted according  to Eq. 1.
  Kiel et al. PNAS  June 22, 2004  vol. 101  no. 25  9225  BIOPHYSICSkobs  k2   k2  1  K1RBD  . [1]  From Eq. 1, the equilibrium dissociation constant of the encounter complex K1  k1k1 is obtained.
For RalGDS-RBDWT  binding to RasmGppNHp, K1 was measured to be 134 M, and  the maximal rate (k2) was 459 s1 at 10C.
Accordingly, the rate  constant of association kon  k2K1 is 3.4 M1s1.
At low RBD  concentrations ([RBD]    K1), Eq. 1 can be linearly approximated as kobs  koff  kon   [RBD].
For the binding of  RalGDS-RBDWT to RasmGppNHp, the slope of the linear fit  between kobs and the concentration (at a range up to 40 M)  yields a kon value of 2.5 M1s1.
Thus, the association rate  constants determined from saturation kinetics and from the  linear approximation are similar.
At higher temperatures, saturating protein concentrations lead to kobs values that are too  large to be measured by stopped-flow.
Therefore, the association  rate constants for all mutant proteins were determined from the  linear regression at low RalGDS-RBD concentrations at 25C, as  in Fig. 3a.
The dissociation rate constant was determined from  a displacement experiment in which the RasmGppNHpRalGDS-RBD complex was mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with nonlabeled RasGppNHp at high molar excess.
A  summary of all of the measured association and dissociation rate  constants is given in Fig. 4a (and Table 2), where mutant  RalGDS-RBD proteins are ordered according to their relative  values of kon, showing also the relative values for koff and KD.
In  addition to the thus far designed mutants, we measured and  calculated values of kon for a number of interface mutants that  were produced previously (17).
Fig. 4b shows a plot of logkon  (experimental) versus logkon (calculated) for all investigated  RalGDS-RBD mutants.
The slope of the linear fit between the  calculated and experimental data are 0.65, with a correlation  coefficient of 0.97.
For low kon values the calculations underestimate the association rate constants, and for high kon values the  calculations overestimate the association rate constants.
The  same relationship between calculated and experimental data  holds for the four interface mutants investigated, as well as for  faster and slower binding complexes.
Thus, kon seems to be  affected only by the electrostatic contribution of the specific  residue.
The triple mutant RalGDS-RBDD47K,E52K,E53K is a clear  exception, with the calculated increase in kon being 4,000-fold,  but the actual measured value of kon is only 5.6-fold faster  relative to WT.
However, the calculations did hold for the three  individual single mutants making up this triple mutant protein,  suggesting some structural perturbation of this triple mutant,  which was not analyzed further.
  The picture for the rate of dissociation is somewhat more  complex.
Most koff values of noninterface mutants vary around  the WT value ( 2-fold difference).
All four interface mutants  (R16A, K28A, K48A, and N23K on RalGDS-RBD) cause an  increase in koff by 2- to 3-fold (Fig. 4a), as may be expected.
Still,  a number of mutations of noninterface residues seem to change  the values of koff as well. RalGDS-RBDY89K causes an increase  in koff, whereas in several cases koff is decreased (between 1.4-  and 3.5-fold).
For these mutants, both kon and koff contribute  toward the overall higher affinity obtained.
This result is especially pronounced for the N50K mutation.
Replacing Asn with  Lys can bring the side chain of this residue to a distance of 34   from a number of residues on Ras.
The short-range interactions formed may contribute to the observed decrease in values  of koff.
In this sense, analyzing mutations to Ala is much simpler  because side-chains are deleted, whereas, for mutations to Lys a  long side-chain is added, which may contribute to the formation  of new interactions.
  The association of Ras with RalGDS-RBD is a two-step  process, which can be analyzed from the nonlinear concentration  dependence of the observed rate constant (Fig. 3b).
Producing  faster binding RalGDS variants gave us the unique opportunity  to investigate whether increasing electrostatic steering between  two proteins affects the formation of the encounter complex or  the rate of final complex formation.
The association of the triple  mutant RalGDS-RBDM26K,D47K,E54K to RasmGppNHp has been  followed up to high concentration and compared to the WT  complex.
The observed rate constants were plotted against the  RalGDS-RBD concentration (Fig. 3b).
Based on the two stepmodel (Eq. 1), the affinity of the encounter complex (K1) was  measured to be 5.3 M and k2  347 s1 for RalGDSRBDM26K,D47K,E54K compared with K1  134 M and k2  459  s1 for the WT.
Thus, the affinity of the encounter complex is  increased roughly 25-fold, whereas k2 (which is the rate of  formation of the final complex out of the encounter complex) is  almost unchanged.
This experiment confirms that the engineered increase in electrostatic attraction between RalGDSRBD and Ras specifically affects the affinity of the encounter  complex.
One should keep in mind that all of the mutations are  located outside the actual binding site.
  Activation Energy of the Interaction Between Ras and RalGDS-RBD  Mutants.

The dashed straight line has a slope of 1.  9226  www.pnas.orgcgidoi10.1073pnas.0401160101 Kiel et al.mutation and the difference in free energy between the unbound  proteins and the transition state is given by the following equation:  G#   RTln kon_wt  kon_mutant, [2]  where G# is the change in activation energy upon mutation.
  Although absolute values of G# of second order reactions are  difficult to interpret, changes in G# are easier to discuss  because they probe only the difference between a mutant and the  WT in respect to the transition state (13, 21, 22).
The activation  energy for the fastest associating RalGDS-RBD mutant is  decreased by 1.5 kcalmol, which corresponds approximately to  the change in the free energy of binding.
Fig. 5a is a plot of  changes in activation energy between WT and mutant complexes  [G# (WT-Mut)] and changes in free energy as determined  from ITC [G (WT-Mut)].
The slope of a linear fit was 1.3,  with a correlation coefficient of 0.88.
The ratio between G#  and G, also termed the Bronsted () value, indicates the  extent of bond making and breaking in the transition state.
In the  case presented here, it is clear that for charged mutations located  outside the binding site the interaction is made at the transition  state, implying their long-range nature.
Moreover, these results  show that the increase in binding affinity stemming from the  faster rate of association is mainly the result of decreasing the  energy barrier for association, whereas the energy barrier for  dissociation is about constant.
A similar observation was made  for the interactions between barnase and barstar and the TEM  BLIP complex (11, 13).
  Thermodynamic Analysis of Mutant Complexes.
To confirm the  binding affinities obtained from the kinetic data, all RalGDSRBD mutant complexes were investigated independently by  using ITC, which provides direct measurements of G and H  from which S is calculated (23).
The results obtained for the  mutant proteins are summarized in Table 2.
In all cases, a 1:1  RasRalGDS complex formation was observed with n values at  1.0, showing that the predetermined RasGppNHp and RalGDS-RBD protein concentrations reflected the concentration  of active protein throughout the experiments.
The free energy  values (G) obtained from the analysis of the kinetic stoppedflow data and those measured directly by using ITC experiments  are in good agreement.
The association process of RalGDSRBDWT to RasGppNHp was earlier reported to be driven by a  favorable enthalpy change (5).
This negative enthalpy change is  observed also for the complex formation of all mutants.
Values  of H (WT-Mut) for all complexes are between 2 and 4  kcalmol.
No good correlation was found between G and  either H or TS, although a clear enthalpyentropy compensation was observed (Fig. 5b).
This enthalpyentropy compensation has been often found in mutational studies (24, 25).
  Discussion  The affinity of a protein complex can be described as the ratio  between koff and kon.
The rate of dissociation is influenced  mainly by the magnitude of short-range interactions (ionic  interactions, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions),  which are difficult to optimize through rational design.
In  contrast, the association reaction can be described more easily  based on the classical rules of diffusion and electrostatics (26).
  It has been shown that the association rate correlates with the  electrostatic energy of interaction between two molecules, which  is calculated by using the algorithm PARE (16).
By implementing  our design strategy on the RasRalGDS-RBD complex, it was  possible to increase the rate of association of 7.7 M1  s1 for the  WT complex to 100 M1s1 for the RalGDSM26K,D47K,E54K  mutant.
The kinetic parameters for RalGDSW T,  RalGDSM26K,D47K,E54K, and Raf (which is the preferred effector  of Ras) binding Ras are shown in Table 1.
The kinetics of  RalGDSM26K,D47K,E54K (but not RalGDSWT) binding Ras are  similar to those measured for Raf, despite the lack of sequence  similarity between RalGDS and Raf (both bind Ras at the same  location).
Ras is originally optimized to bind Raf fast.
By  electrostatic design of RalGDS, we succeeded to imitate the  electrostatic picture of Raf on RalGDS (Fig. 1), achieving a  similar kinetic profile.
It should be emphasized that RalGDS was  designed just from electrostatic principle without using Raf as a  model.
These results raise the possibility of kinetic control of  cellular signal transduction in this case. Because we avoided  mutating residues in the interface, the dissociation rate constant  was less affected.
As a consequence, a significant tightening of  the RasRalGDS complex was achieved, from a KD value of 1.9  M for WT to 0.071 M (27-fold) for RalGDSM26K,D47K,E54K.
  A good correlation was found between the experimental  versus calculated association rate constants.
However, the absolute values differ, as reflected by the slope of 0.65 between the  two (Fig. 4b).
Interestingly, the correlation extends to both faster  and slower binding mutants, associating with rates varying over  a range of 55-fold (between RalGDSM26K,D47K,E54K and  RalGDSK48A).
Moreover, the same trend was observed independently on whether the mutations were located within or  outside the binding site.
Therefore, one has to conclude that the  difference between the calculated versus measured values is  Fig. 5.

PARE calculates the  electrostatic contribution toward the rate of association.
These  calculations yielded the exact values for diverse systems, such as  antibody-antigen, RNaseinhibitor, AchEinhibitor, and others  (16, 27).
The observation that for RasRalGSD, PARE successfully predicted the trend of changes in the rate of association but  fails in giving the exact values may show that a different  electrostatic model has to be applied in this case or that this  reaction is not purely diffusion limited but is partially reaction  limited.
For the RalGDS-RBDRas interaction, the latter explanation seems to be valid, because a dynamic equilibrium  between two conformational states during binding is clearly  resolved, with only one of them being present in the final  complex (15).
Thus, the RalGDS-RBDRas interaction can  serve as a classic example for binding of a partially reaction  limited proteinprotein interaction.
A hallmark of a partially  reaction-limited reaction is the nonlinearity of the relation  between the rate of association and the reactants concentrations,  which is indeed the case for the RalGDS-RBDRas interaction  investigated here.
Therefore, in addition to the value of kon, the  data provide direct information about the stability of the encounter complex along the association pathway.
Based on kinetic  measurements at high RalGDS-RBD concentration, we were  able to determine the affinity of the encounter complex with  RasmGppNHp, which is 134 M for the WT and 5.3 M for  RalGDSM26K,D47K,E54K.
In contrast to the increased stability of  the encounter complex with increasing electrostatic energy of  interaction, the rate of formation of the final complex, k2, was  hardly affected (459 s1 versus 347 s1 for the WT versus  mutant proteins).
A similar value of 480 s1 was measured for  Raf interacting with Ras (Table 1 and Fig. 6, which is published  as supporting information on the PNAS web site), again  suggesting that k2 is related to the rearrangement of Ras during  association.
These results can be analyzed by using  value  analysis (28), where e  GeGcomplex and F#  DDG#  Gcomplex (e stands for the encounter complex).
By using the  experimental data for WT and the RalGDSM26K,D47K,E54KRas  complex (with Ge, G#, and Gcomplex calculated from  K1, kon, and Go, respectively), e  1.91.8  1.05 and e   1.571.8  0.87.
These two  values demonstrate that increasing electrostatic steering by mutating residues located outside  the binding site stabilizes the encounter complex and the  transition state to a similar extent as they stabilized the final  complex.
Thus, the charge mutants have a long-range effect,  which is not increased during binding.
  Why did k2 and k2 remain constant despite the increasing  electrostatic attraction between the two proteins?
In other  words, why didnt we observe a gain in electrostatic energy upon  moving from the encounter complex toward the final complex  and vice versa? A possible explanation would be that the penalty  paid for the desolvation of charges is apparently similar to the  gain in Coulombic energy upon bringing them together (29, 30).
  The two-step pathway for association observed for the RalGDSRBDRas interaction does not seem to be a unique case.
  Indirect evidence supports the notion that this mechanism is  actually the common pathway for association, but in most cases  the encounter complex is less pronounced and not easy to be  measured directly (26).
  The observations presented in this paper demonstrate that not  only the contact area of proteins but also their periphery may be  important for specific and efficient complex formation.
By  designing RalGDS mutants, we reached a tighter encounter  complex and final Raseffector complex, which has an almost  identical dissociation constant as observed for the RasRaf  system, in which high charge complementarity was demonstrated  between the interfaces (Table 1).
This finding is relevant for drug  design, for which not only the contact site may be targeted but  also neighboring protein surface patches.
Finally, creating protein variants with a wide range of kinetic constants opens the  possibility of investigating the biological impact of the dynamics  of proteinprotein interaction in general and for signal transduction mediated by cascades of proteinprotein interactions in  particular.
