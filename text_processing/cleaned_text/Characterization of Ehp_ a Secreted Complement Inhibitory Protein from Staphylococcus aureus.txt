Geisbrecht3  From the   School of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri 64110, the   Department of  Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19105, the   Department of Medicine,  The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21224, the   Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, University of  Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, and the **Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory,  Argonne, Illinois 60439  We report here the discovery and characterization of Ehp, a new  secreted Staphylococcus aureus protein that potently inhibits the  alternative complement activation pathway.
Ehp was identified  through a genomic scan as an uncharacterized secreted protein  from S. aureus, and immunoblotting of conditioned S. aureus culture medium revealed that the Ehp protein was secreted at the  highest levels during log-phase bacterial growth.
The mature Ehp  polypeptide is composed of 80 residues and is 44% identical to the  complement inhibitory domain of S. aureus Efb (extracellular  fibrinogen-binding protein).
We observed preferential binding by  Ehp to native and hydrolyzed C3 relative to fully active C3b and  found that Ehp formed a subnanomolar affinity complex with these  various forms of C3 by binding to its thioester-containing C3d  domain.
Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Arg75 and  Asn82 are important in forming the EhpC3d complex, but loss of  these side chains did not completely disrupt Ehp/C3d binding.
This  suggested the presence of a second C3d-binding site in Ehp, which  wasmapped to the proximity of Ehp Asn63.
Furthermolecularlevel  details of the Ehp/C3d interaction were revealed by solving the  2.7-A crystal structure of an EhpC3d complex in which the low  affinity site had been mutationally inactivated.
Ehp potently inhibited C3b deposition onto sensitized surfaces by the alternative  complement activation pathway.
This inhibition was directly  related to Ehp/C3d binding and wasmore potent than that seen for  Efb-C. An altered conformation in Ehp-bound C3 was detected by  monoclonal antibody C3-9, which is specific for a neoantigen  exposedinactivated forms ofC3.Our results suggest thatincreased  inhibitory potency of Ehp relative to Efb-C is derived from the second C3-binding site in this new protein.
  Staphylococcus aureus is a widely disseminated and persistent human pathogen that has a long-standing and increasingly  negative impact on human health.
It is the primary cause of  numerous disorders that range from the seemingly mild (such  as skin and soft-tissue infections) to several potentially fatal conditions (such as bacteremia, necrotizing pneumonia, and endocarditis) as well as infections associated with implanted medical devices  (such as intravascular catheters, pacemakers, and delivery pumps)  (1).
One of the most striking features of S. aureus biology is its  ability to survive and colonize distinct microenvironments within  the host organism, and this propensity clearly contributes to its  ability to form long-lasting and repetitive infections (1).
To facilitate host colonization, S. aureus expresses a diverse array of virulence-determining factors, including exoenzymes, toxins, and  numerous protein adhesins.
These adhesins (termed receptins (2,  3) or MSCRAMM proteins (3)) are believed to contribute to the  initiation and propagation of infections by precluding bacterial  clearance by physical forces.
  Over the last several years, it has also become clear that S.  aureus produces a series of immunomodulators that promote  virulence by affecting both arms of the host immune system (4,  5).
Components of the innate immune system represent the  first line of defense against infection, and S. aureus has consequently evolved modulators of this system (5).
In regard to cellmediated innate immunity, a secreted chemotaxis inhibitory  protein from S. aureus (CHIPS) that blocks function of the C5a  and formylated peptide receptors required for chemotaxis or  neutrophils was recently described (6).
In terms of humoral  innate immunity, the circulating complement system is a primary target of virulence factors produced by many pathogens,  including bacteria, viruses, and fungi (79), and because the  complement component C3 serves a central role in the amplification of all three complement pathways, it is an attractive  target for inhibition or modulation of this essential immune  response (5, 10).
Indeed, SCIN, a secreted complement inhibitory protein from S. aureus that effects the function of C3 convertases, was identified late in 2005 (11), and a C3-binding and  complement inhibitory activity was recently described for the  secreted S. aureus extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein Efb  (5, 12).
Together, these examples illustrate that inhibiting the  normal function of the innate immune system is fundamentally  important to the success of S. aureus as a human pathogen.
  Three lines of current evidence suggest that S. aureus may  * This work was supported by the School of Biological Sciences, University of  Missouri, Kansas City; Grant 2509 from the University of Missouri Research  Board (to B.

41, pp. 3005130061, October 12, 2007  Printed in the U.S.A.  OCTOBER 12, 2007VOLUME 282NUMBER 41 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 30051   at SUNY at Stony Brook on March 13, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from express additional complement inhibitory proteins, the functions of which are not yet appreciated.
First, S. aureus has been  shown to activate all three complement pathways (1317), and  mice that have been complement-depleted by treatment with  cobra venom factor succumb quickly to staphylococcal bacteremia (18).
This underscores the importance of complement  inhibition in S. aureus virulence.
Second, complement proteins  are among the most abundant components in human plasma  (19, 20).
This makes it unlikely that any single complement  inhibitory protein could be expressed by the pathogen at levels  sufficient to provide a completely effective mode of protection  from complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis.
Finally, the  numerous functions of C3, along with their accompanying regulatory mechanisms, provide many different locations at which  inhibitory strategies could be executed (10).
Indeed, although  SCIN and Efb both block complement activation, their mechanisms of action appear to be completely distinct (11, 21).
  To explore the possibility that S. aureus may express additional proteins that act on the human immune response, we  recently conducted an in silico screen to identify uncharacterized secreted proteins of S. aureus.
  4 Using this approach, we  identified the protein SAV1155, the further characterization of  which we report here.
SAV1155 was expressed at the highest  levels during log-phase culture growth, displayed a high level of  sequence identity to Efb, and formed a subnanomolar affinity  complex with human complement component C3.
Functional  analysis of SAV1155 demonstrated that it potently inhibited the  alternative pathway of complement activation by perturbing  the solution conformation of C3.
On the basis of these properties, we have tentatively assigned the name Ehp (for Efb homologous protein) to SAV1155.
Our results support previous work  that identified induced conformational change in C3 as a novel  basis for complement inhibition and elaborate upon both the  structure and function of a growing family of small secreted  complement inhibitory proteins from S. aureus (22).
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Protein Expression and PurificationA designer gene fragment encoding residues 30109 of Ehp was amplified from S.  aureus genomic DNA by PCR using oligonucleotides 5-aaagtcgacccaaactaaaaacgttgaagctgctaaaaaatatgatcag-3 and 5-tttgcggccgcttattttaaagtattatattttaaaactagatcgatttgtct-3 as sense  and antisense primers, respectively.
These oligonucleotides  appended SalI and NotI restriction endonuclease sites at the  5- and 3-ends of the amplified Ehp-encoding sequence, and  the amplified DNA was digested and cloned into the corresponding sites of the prokaryotic expression vector pT7HMT  (23).
Following verification of the Ehp-encoding region, this  expression vector was transformed into Escherichia coli strain  BL21(DE3) for recombinant protein expression.
Expression,  refolding, and purification of Ehp were carried out according to  the general protocol reported previously (23).
Ehp purified in  this fashion was 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, migrated as a monomeric 11,000-Da species as judged by analytical gel filtration chromatography, and  had an experimental molecular mass of 9809.09 Da (predicted  molecular mass of 9803.37 Da) according to matrix-assisted laser  desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
The  increased molecular mass of recombinant Ehp over that of the  predicted mature form of the protein was due to the presence of  three additional residues (-GST-) at its N terminus that resulted  from the subcloning procedure.
  Site-directed mutagenesis of Ehp was carried out according  to the two-step megaprimer PCR method (24).
Following  expression and purification, the structural integrity of all  mutants was confirmed by analytical gel filtration chromatography and comparative circular dichroism spectropolarimetry  with wild-type Ehp as described previously (23).
  A DNA fragment encoding residues 9961287 of human C3  was amplified via PCR to encode the C1010A mutation and  subcloned into a modified form of pET28a lacking all tags.
This  vector encodes the additional residues MGSRST- at its N terminus, and the C1010A mutation is necessary to avoid the formation of the reactive thioester bond found in native C3 (10,  25).
Protein expression and purification of this recombinant  C3d were carried out according to the general protocol  described by Nagar et al. (25), with the exception that microfluidization was used to lyse the induced cells (23).
Recombinant  C3dg was expressed in E. coli based on a method described  previously (26); here, the pET30 vector containing an S-tag was  used instead of a pET11b vector with a T7 epitope tag, and no  biotinylation signal peptide was included.
C3, C3(H2O) (hydrolyzed), C3b, and C3c were all prepared according to established  protocols (21, 27).
Recombinant Efb, Efb-C, and Efb-C(R131E/  N138E) were expressed and purified as described previously  (21, 23).
  Bacterial Culture and Analysis of Conditioned MediumS.  aureus strain Mu50 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in LB broth in a 37 C shaking  incubator.
To analyze the proteins present in the conditioned  culture medium at various time points, a 5-ml preculture was  diluted into 50 ml of sterile LB broth to achieve an initial  A600 nm of 0.1.
Samples equivalent to 1.0A600 nm unit were withdrawn and sterile-filtered at 2, 4, 6, 10, 18, 24, and 48 h postdilution.
Following normalization of the volume for the density  of the culture, each sample was concentrated to 0.2 ml in an  Amicon centrifugal concentrator (5000 nominal Mr cutoff).
20  l of each sample was separated by 420% SDS-PAGE and  processed for immunoblotting as described (21, 28).
  Antibodies and ImmunoblottingPurified recombinant Ehp  was used to elicit the production of anti-Ehp polyclonal antibodies in guinea pigs.
Guinea pigs were purchased from and  maintained and immunized according to the standard protocols of Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc. (Woodbine, MD).
For  affinity purification, 100 l of post-immune serum was diluted  1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)5 and 0.1% (v/v) Tween  20 (PBST) and applied by gravity flow to a 1-ml column containing 1 mg of Ehp immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose fast flow  (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturers suggestions.

  Identification of S. aureus Ehp  30052 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282NUMBER 41OCTOBER 12, 2007   at SUNY at Stony Brook on March 13, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from After washing with 10 ml of PBST, bound antibodies were  eluted by applying 2 ml of 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.0), followed by  immediate neutralization with 0.2 ml of 1 M Tris base.
The  affinity-purified antibodies were dialyzed into PBS and used at a  final concentration of 1:100 as the primary probe for immunoblotting according to a previously published procedure (28).
  Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig secondary antibody was purchased from Sigma.
  Pulldown Assays and ProteomicsEhp, Efb, Efb-C, and EfbC(R131E/N138E) were immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose fast  flow according to the manufacturers suggestions.
The coupling  density was 2 mg/ml of resin for all proteins except Efb, which  was coupled at 3 mg/ml to account for its larger molecular mass  relative to the others.
Following quenching of excess reactive  groups with 0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 2 h at 25 C, the affinity  resins were washed and stored as 50% slurries in PBST.
To test  for binding to plasma proteins, aliquots of EDTA-stabilized  human plasma were diluted 1:100 in PBST and mixed individually with 20 l of each affinity resin in a total volume of 1 ml.
  Following a 10-min incubation at 25 C, the resins were isolated  by centrifugation at 3500  g for 2 min, and washed five times  with 1 ml of PBST.
After the last wash, each resin was resuspended in 20 l of 2 Laemmli sample buffer, mixed briefly,  and heated at 95 C for 5 min.
Following sample preparation,  the proteins contained in each sample were separated by  420% gradient SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue  staining.
For protein identification, the bands of interest were  excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel proteolysis by trypsin as described by Kinter and Sherman (29).
The resulting  tryptic fragments were extracted, separated by capillary liquid  chromatography (LC), and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (29).
Proteins were identified by comparing  the observed fragmentation ion patterns against a data base of  human proteins using the MASCOT software package (29).
  Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)All SPR experiments  were performed on a Biacore 2000 biosensor at 25 C using  running buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mM  NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20) as described previously (21).
To  examine Ehp binding to C3 and its various fragments, 200 600  response units of Ehp were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip  at a flow rate of 10 l/min using amine coupling (5-min activation and deactivation).
All C3 fragments were screened at a  concentration of 200 nM and at a flow rate of 20 l/min with  injection and dissociation phases of 3 min each.
The Ehp surface was regenerated with two 30-s injections of 0.1% SDS and  reconstituted in running buffer for 10 min.
An empty flow cell,  which was only activated and deactivated, was used as a reference surface.
Three buffer blanks were included in each analysis, and their average signals were subtracted from the processed sample responses (double referencing) (30).
Data  processing and analysis were performed using Scrubber (Version 2.0a, BioLogic Software Pty. Ltd.).
The SPR experiments  were repeated three times using different immobilization densities and protein batches, essentially leading to the same ranking result.
Native C3 was freshly reconstituted from MES-precipitated samples and kept on ice until immediately prior to  analysis on the same day.
Under these conditions, contamination with C3(H2O) was found to be 2% (21).
  Isothermal Titration CalorimetryIsothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed at 25 C using a VP-ITC  calorimeter (MicroCal) as described previously (21).
Briefly, all  proteins were dissolved in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 200 mM  NaCl to a final concentration of either 150 M for S. aureus  proteins or 12 M for recombinant C3d or C3dg.
A preliminary  1-l injection of the S. aureus protein into a solution of C3d was  followed by multiple injections of 5l at 240-s intervals, and the  evolved heat was measured.
After correcting the observed heat  values for the effects of dilution and background buffer titration, all processed data were fit using Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab) to either a single- or two-site binding model to give the  final experimental values for enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and  the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd).
  Complement Inhibition AssaysThe abilities of Ehp and its  various mutants to inhibit the classical and alternative pathways of complement activation were evaluated using previously  described enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods (31, 32).
For both assays, detection of C3b bound to the  wells was achieved using a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human C3 antibody (MP Biomedicals).
Following extensive washing with PBS containing 0.005%  Tween 20, color was developed by addition of the peroxidase  substrate 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid),  and absorbance was measured at 405 nm.
Percent inhibition  was plotted against the protein concentration, and the resulting  data set was fit to a logistic dose-response function using Origin  7.0 software.
IC50 values were obtained from the fit parameters  that achieved the lowest 2 value.
  C3 Capture ELISAEDTA-stabilized plasma diluted 1:10 in  PBS was incubated with or without 25 M Ehp, the various  site-directed mutants of Ehp, or controls at 37 C for 1 h and  centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min.
The supernatant was added  to an ELISA plate coated with monoclonal antibody C3-9 (2  g/ml), which recognizes a neoantigen that is exposed in  C3(H2O), C3b, and C3c, but not in native C3 (33, 34).
The wells  were washed twice with PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20 and  incubated with rabbit anti-C3a polyclonal antibody (2 g/ml)  that had been affinity-purified on a CNBr-Sepharose column  derivatized with an N-terminal C3a peptide (H-SVQLTEKRMDKVGKYPKELRK-NH2) (33, 34).
Detection of bound anti-C3a  antibody was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000) and the peroxidase  substrate 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)  by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm.
Values were plotted  against the protein concentration, and the resulting data set  was fit to a logistic dose-response function using Origin 7.0  software.
  Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Solution, Refinement, and AnalysisThe Ehp(N63E)C3d complex was reconstituted from purified monomers and isolated by gel filtration  chromatography on a Superdex 75 (26/60) column (GE Healthcare).
Following purification, the complex was dialyzed against  double-distilled H2O and concentrated to 13 mg/ml complex  by centrifugal ultrafiltration.
Twinned needle cluster crystals of  the complex were obtained by vapor diffusion of hanging drops  consisting of equal volumes of 13 mg/ml Ehp(N63E)C3d and a  mother liquid of 0.2 M Li2SO4, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350,  Identification of S. aureus Ehp  OCTOBER 12, 2007VOLUME 282NUMBER 41 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 30053   at SUNY at Stony Brook on March 13, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from and 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.2).
Although the original crystals did  not diffract x-rays, inclusion of 0.2 M CaCl2 as an additive in the  mother liquid occasionally resulted in clusters with blades of  sufficient thickness to allow their manipulation and a more  thorough diffraction analysis.
The Ehp(N63E)C3d crystals  appeared within 7 days and belonged to the space group P21,  with cell dimensions of a  67.89, b  91.03, and c  122.60   and   89.93 and four complete complexes in the asymmetric  unit, which corresponded to a solvent content of 44.5%.
The  structure of Ehp(N63E)C3d was solved by molecular replacement using x-ray diffraction data to 2.7- limiting resolution  collected from a single frozen crystal at Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team beamline 22-ID of the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory.
Following data  processing using the HKL2000 software package, molecular  replacement was carried out with the refined structure of EfbCC3d as a search model (Protein Data Bank Code 2GOX) (21)  using the program MOLREP (35).
Initial phase improvement  was carried out using solvent flattening by the program DM  (35), and stepwise model building, water addition, and refinement were carried out using the programs O (36) and CNS (37).
  The final model was attained following TLS refinement in REFMAC5 (38, 39) and consists of residues 9751265 of human C3  (chain A in the Protein Data Bank file), residues 52109 of Ehp  (chain B in the Protein Data Bank file), and 71 ordered water  molecules.
No interpretable density was visible for the vectorencoded residues MGSRST in C3d or for residues 3051 in any  Ehp molecules in the refined structure.
Additional details on  weak density and residues/atoms that could not be modeled can  be found in the Protein Data Bank file.
Intramolecular distances  for protein chains were calculated using the CCP4 suite (35).
  Structural superpositions of proteins were carried out by the  local global alignment method using default parameters  (as2ts.llnl.gov/) (40).
Representations of protein structures  were prepared using PyMOL (pymol.sourceforge.net).
The  refined coordinates and structure factors (code 2NOJ) for the  Ehp(N63E)C3d complex have been deposited in the Protein  Data Bank.  MiscellaneousThe numbering schemes for Ehp (GenBankTM accession number NP_371679), Efb (accession number P68799), and human C3 (accession number P01024) presented here reflect sequence positions in the respective  preproteins.
Multiple sequence alignments of proteins were produced by ClustalW and rendered using ESPript (espript.ibcp.fr).
  Purified human fibrinogen was obtained from Sigma (catalog no. F-3879).
The compstatin analog used in this study  was 4(1MeW)7W and has been described previously by  Katragadda et al. (41).
  RESULTS  Identification of SAV1155/Ehp as an Uncharacterized  C3-binding Protein from S. aureusThe orphan protein  SAV1155 was identified during a genome-wide screen for all  proteins in S. aureus that were predicted to contain a type 1  signal peptide at their N terminus.4The SAV1155 open reading frame encodes a 109-residue polypeptide with a high  probability signal peptidase site between residues 29 and 30  (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) and was predicted to yield  an 80-residue mature protein with a deduced molecular mass of  9558 Da.
The theoretical isoelectric point of SAV1155 is also  notably basic (pI  10.78) and reflects the preponderance of  lysine residues in the sequence (15/80 positions).
To determine  whether SAV1155 is in fact secreted from S. aureus cells, we  raised polyclonal antisera in guinea pigs against a recombinant  form of SAV1155 corresponding to the entire predicted mature  protein; then, following affinity purification, we used these antibodies to test for the presence of SAV1155 in the growth  medium of an S. aureus culture at various time points (Fig. 1).
  We observed that SAV1155 was efficiently secreted in the  medium.
Although the highest levels of Ehp were present during log-phase growth (618 h), secreted Ehp was still detectable  at times immediately proceeding (4 h) and following (24 h) this  period.
This result demonstrates that SAV1155 is expressed  and secreted from actively growing S. aureus cells and suggests  that this protein may have an important but yet unappreciated  function.
  Because no functional data were available on SAV1155, we  examined the relationship of this protein to previously characterized molecules on the basis of sequence similarity.
BLAST  searches of the non-redundant protein data base revealed a surprising homology between SAV1155 and the 16-kDa Efb protein from S. aureus (42, 43).
Subsequent ClustalW sequence  alignment of Ehp and Efb indicated that the region of homology  between these proteins is confined to the C-terminal C3 inhibFIGURE 1.
Ehp (SAV1155) is secreted at the highest levels during logphase growth.
S. aureus cells were grown in liquid culture at 37 C, and samples of the conditioned medium were withdrawn at the various times points  shown (upper panel).
After normalizing each sample for culture density, the  conditioned medium was concentrated by ultrafiltration, separated by SDSPAGE, and processed for immunoblotting with affinity-purified anti-Ehp antibodies (lower panel).
The molecular mass of Ehp is indicated, along with polyhistidine-tagged Ehp (positive control; ) and sterile culture medium  (negative control;  ).
The higher apparent mass of the positive control () is  due to the presence of the fusion tag that is not found on natively expressed  Ehp.
  Identification of S. aureus Ehp  30054 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282NUMBER 41OCTOBER 12, 2007   at SUNY at Stony Brook on March 13, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from itory domain of Efb (hereafter denoted Efb-C) (Fig. 2) (5, 12, 21,  44).
Ehp shares 44% identity with the 61 residues contained  within Efb-C (Fig. 2a); however, the most notable feature of this  alignment is that Arg75 and Asn82 in SAV1155 were found to  correspond to two Efb residues, Arg131 and Asn138, which we  recently demonstrated to be essential for C3 binding (21).
This  suggests that SAV1155 is an as yet uncharacterized C3-binding  protein from S. aureus.
  To test this possibility directly, we coupled purified recombinant forms of SAV1155, Efb, and Efb-C and a site-directed  Efb-C double mutant lacking C3-binding ability (Efb-C(R131E/  N138E)) (21) to Sepharose resin and incubated the derivatized  resins with a 100-fold dilution of EDTA-stabilized human  plasma in a physiological buffer.
Following several brief washes,  the specifically bound proteins were separated by nonreducing  SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2b).
  Efb, Efb-C, and SAV1155 each bound a relatively large protein,  which was positively identified as C3 following LC-MS/MS of  the peptides derived from an in-gel trypsin digest of the band  (29).
The identity of this protein as C3 could also be inferred  because its binding was not detected in the lane that corresponded to the Efb-C(R131E/N138E) mutant.
Although fulllength Efb bound specifically to a slower migrating fibrinogen  species (LC-MS/MS), no fibrinogen binding was seen for Efb-C,  the double mutant, or SAV1155; this most likely reflects the fact  that the N-terminal region of Efb contains the fibrinogen-binding site (12).
As a result of its homology to and conserved  C3-binding properties with Efb, we tentatively designated  SAV1155 as Ehp (for Efb homologous protein).
  Ehp Binds the C3d Domain of C3Efb-C binds to C3 and  blocks its activation to C3b by forming a nanomolar affinity  complex with the helical barrel thioester-containing C3d  domain of native C3 (5, 12, 21, 25).
The homology between Ehp  and Efb-C, along with conservation of the critical arginine and  asparagine residues, therefore suggested that Ehp might also  recognize C3 in a similar manner.
To examine this possibility in  more detail, we immobilized recombinant Ehp on a plasmon  resonance surface and used this biosensor to profile the interactions of Ehp with various C3-derived fragments corresponding to different intermediates along the C3 activation cascade  (10).
We found that Ehp bound specifically to all C3 fragments  that included the thioester-containing C3d domain, including  native C3, C3(H2O), C3b, and C3dg (Fig. 3).
In contrast, we did  not detect binding to C3c, which lacks the proteolytically  excised C3dg fragment.
Because the magnitudes of SPR  responses are directly proportional to the analyte molecular  mass, we normalized the experimental data to derive the relative affinities of Ehp for the various C3 fragments.
This revealed  that Ehp bound both hydrolyzed and native C3 with greater  relative affinity compared with C3b.
In short, the results of  these experiments were similar in all aspects to those observed  for Efb-C (21).
  We further investigated the Ehp/C3 interaction by using isothermal titration calorimetry to study the thermodynamic  FIGURE 2.
Ehp is a C3-binding protein related to Efb.
a, the amino acid  sequence of mature Ehp was aligned with the C3-binding domain of S. aureus  Efb (Efb-C), SCIN, SCIN-B, and SCIN-D by the ClustalW method.
Equivalent  positions from the PAM250 substitution matrix are shown by blue letters,  whereas identical positions are depicted by boldface blue letters.
Secondary  structure assignments derived from the Efb-C crystal structure are presented  above the alignment.
The 7-mer peptide repeat sequence unique to Ehp and  Efb is shown in the red boxes, whereas arginine and asparagine residues that  form the basis for binding to C3d are shown with red stars.

As shown in Fig.  4a and Table 1, titration of Ehp into a fixed quantity of C3d  resulted in a peculiar two-site ligand in the cell binding isotherm that exhibited transition points at Ehp/C3d molar ratios  of 0.5 and 1.0.
The first site was exothermic (H   8.75 kcal  mol 1  ) and fit to an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of  0.18 nM (Table 1).
Although the second isotherm was also substantially exothermic (H   14.7 kcal mol 1  ), this site fit to a  lower affinity Kd value of 125 nM as a result of a significant  entropic penalty relative to the first site.
We ruled out the likelihood that this observation might have arisen from an experimental artifact by performing an analogous study in which  C3dg was titrated into a solution of Ehp.
Again, we observed an  entropically favored higher affinity site, along with an entropically opposed weaker site (Table 1).
Furthermore, the observation that the Ehp/C3d interaction saturated at a 1:1 molar ratio  when C3d was limiting but at a 2:1 molar ratio when Ehp was  limiting strongly suggests that both C3d-binding sites in Ehp  recognize the same region within C3d.
  The crystal structure of Efb-C bound to C3d identified  Arg131 and Asn138 as the two residues critical to formation of  this complex (21), and because Ehp Arg75 and Asn82 aligned  with these positions in Efb-C, we examined their contributions  to formation of the EhpC3d complex using site-directed  mutagenesis (Fig. 4b and Table 1).
Mutation of both Arg75 and  Asn82 to alanine or glutamate resulted in single-site binding  curves with enthalpic and entropic terms comparable with  those of the second, lower affinity binding site in Ehp described  above.
Although this indicated that loss of these residues abolished one binding site in Ehp that shared many of the characteristics observed previously for Efb-C (21), it was notable that  the C3d binding by both Ehp double mutants was still significant even though the corresponding Efb-C double mutants did  not bind C3d.
This raised questions regarding the nature of the  residual affinity of Ehp for C3d and of the molecular basis for  the second C3d-binding site in Ehp.
  We subsequently examined the Ehp sequence and noticed  two tandem repeats of the heptamer peptide -AQ(K/R)AVNLbetween residues 58 and 64 and residues 77 and 83 (Fig. 2a).
  Although both repeats contain an asparagine residue that corresponds to Asn138 in Efb-C, the first heptapeptide sequence  lacks the corresponding arginine residue that is found at the  Efb-CC3d complex interface and that we have shown by  mutagenesis to be important to Ehp/C3d binding (Fig. 4b and  Table 1).
Nevertheless, we hypothesized that this additional  repeat sequence may still be important in forming the EhpC3d  complex.
To test this directly, we generated an N63E mutant, as  FIGURE 4.
Asn63, Arg75, and Asn82 of Ehp are important in forming the  EhpC3d complex.

Conversely to the previous sets of mutations, change  of Asn63 alone to glutamate resulted an entropically favored,  single-site binding curve (H   9.46 kcal mol 1  ) that instead  resembled that of Efb-C alone (21).
The N63E/R75A/N82A triple mutant evolved only  2.14 kcal mol 1 of enthalpy upon  binding to C3d.
This particular mutant also had an unexpectedly low Kd value of 46 nM, which probably resulted from slight  inaccuracy in the fit caused by such a comparatively small signal  in the calorimetric assay.
Finally, when all three positions were  mutated to glutamate simultaneously, no binding to C3d was  detected.
Together, these results suggest that two distinct sites  on the Ehp protein are important determinants in C3d  recognition.
  Ehp Inhibits Complement Activation by Binding to C3d and  Inducing Conformational Change in C3To gain a better  understanding of Ehp function, we measured the effects of  Ehp/C3 binding on a series of functional assays that measured  generation and deposition of C3b through either the classical or  alternative pathway (Fig. 5a).
We observed potent, dose-dependent inhibition of the alternative complement activation  pathway by Ehp (IC50  120 nM Ehp).
Interestingly, the inhibitory properties of Ehp were 23-fold greater than those of  Efb or compstatin, a complement inhibitory cyclic 13-mer peptide that has undergone several rounds of combinatorial optimization (21, 45 47).
Furthermore, alternative pathway inhibition by Ehp correlated directly with C3d binding because the  Ehp mutants described above had reduced inhibitory properties that reflected their individual affinities for C3d (Fig. 5a and  Table 1).
This indicated that the effect of Ehp on the alternative  pathway was a direct result of its ability to bind to C3.
On the  other hand, inhibition of classical pathway activation was seen  only at unphysiologically high concentrations of Ehp (data not  shown).
Amplification of the alternative pathway has been  shown recently to contribute 80% of the classical pathwayinduced activation of downstream complement components  (48).
Thus, our observation most likely reflects the inhibitory  effects of Ehp on alternative pathway self-amplification.
  The results from the experiments described above  revealed that Ehp blocked the alternative complement activation pathway by forming a subnanomolar affinity complex  with C3.
To further define the effects of Ehp binding to C3  and its inhibition of the alternative pathway, we incubated  C3 in human plasma with Ehp, the site-directed Ehp mutants  described in Table 1, or buffer alone and examined the reactivity of each sample over a 1000-fold dilution series in a  capture ELISA method against a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for the particular compositions and conformations of C3 and/or the various intermediates of its activation and degradation pathways (33).
Incubation of plasma C3  with Ehp resulted in a marked increase in the reactivity of  bound C3 with monoclonal antibody C3-9 (Fig. 5b), which  detects a neoantigen that becomes exposed during C3 activation to C3(H2O) and C3b (49).
This effect was not  observed for the site-directed Ehp mutants that were  impaired in their ability to bind C3, as these samples reacted  with monoclonal antibody C3-9 to essentially the same  extent as did C3 treated with buffer alone.
Furthermore, the  fact that Ehp-bound C3 captured in this manner was recognized  by both C3a- and C3b-specific antibodies (Fig. 5b) (data not  shown) throughout the entire dilution series indicated that this C3  was not being processed into C3b, but instead suggested that Ehp  binding altered the conformation of C3 and increased exposure of  the C3-9-specific epitope.
Indeed, the reactivity of EhpC3 against  monoclonal antibody C3-9 was nearly indistinguishable from that  of EfbC3 (Fig. 5b), and there is strong evidence for induction of C3  conformational changes following Efb binding (21).
  FIGURE 5.Ehpinhibits the alternative pathway of complement activation by  altering the solution conformation of C3.
a, the effect of Ehp and its various  site-directed mutants on the alternative pathway of complement activation was  examined by ELISA.
Experimental data were fit to a dose-response model for  each protein.
b, the Ehp-induced conformational changes in plasma C3 were  examined by capture ELISA.
Diluted EDTA-stabilized plasma was incubated for  1 h at 37 C with the proteins described for a or with buffer alone, followed by  capture on ELISA plates coated with monoclonal antibody C3-9.
Bound C3 was  detected by incubation with affinity-purified anti-C3a antibodies, followed by  horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (GaR-HRP).
The  increased reactivity of EhpC3 with monoclonal antibody C3-9 is indicative of an  active-like conformation in C3, even though the C3a domain has not been proteolytically removed to generate C3b.
  Identification of S. aureus Ehp  OCTOBER 12, 2007VOLUME 282NUMBER 41 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 30057   at SUNY at Stony Brook on March 13, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from The 2.7- Crystal Structure of the  Ehp  C3d Complex Shares Many  Features with that of Efb-CC3d  During the course of this study,  we obtained co-crystals of the  Ehp(N63E)  C3d complex that diffracted to 2.7- limiting resolution.
  We chose to study the N63E mutant  of Ehp because this mutation eliminated the second, lower affinity  binding site (Table 1) and resulted  in a homogenous preparation of  protein complexes as judged by gel  filtration chromatography (data not  shown).
The structure of this complex was solved by molecular  replacement and refined to 2.7-  limiting resolution, with  Rcryst and  Rfree values of 29.0 and 28.4%,  respectively (Fig. 6 and Table 2).
  Our observation that Ehp(N63E)  still bound C3d with a  Kd value near  those of wild-type Ehp and Efb-C  (Tables 1 and 2) suggests that this  structure reflects many of the  important binding properties of  Ehp, with the obvious exception  being the second, lower affinity  binding site of Ehp described above  (Fig. 4 and Table 1).
Even though  Ehp shares a moderate level sequence identity of 44% with Efb-C,  this complex displays a large  amount of structural identity to  Efb-C bound to C3d (21).
Comparison of these two individual complexes revealed that 344 of the 355  C-   positions in Ehp(N63E)  C3d  superimpose within a 2.5- distance onto the 362 residues in Efb- CC3d with a root mean square  deviation of 0.72 . Although  numerous ancillary interactions  between the Ehp and C3d polypeptides were seen, we observed  extensive intermolecular contacts  between Ehp  C3d that were established by Ehp Arg75 and Asn82 (Fig. 6b).
Here, Arg75 appears to serve as  the cornerstone for a network of  polar interactions composed of  three different residues, whereas the  side chain amide of Asn82 is well  positioned to bind the backbone  atoms of Val1090, Ile1093, and Ile1095  of C3d.
It is noteworthy that Arg79  appears to serve a role in orienting  the interactions of Arg75.
This inter  -  Identification of S. aureus Ehp  30058 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282NUMBER 41OCTOBER 12, 2007   at SUNY at Stony Brook on March 13, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from action is not observed in the Efb-CC3d complex because the  equivalent position in Efb-C is a lysine and lacks the essential  N- atom.
Thus, this structure accounts well for the site-directed mutagenesis data shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1 and also  reflects the conserved contributions of the arginine and asparagine residues within the high affinity C3d-binding site shared  between Ehp and Efb-C.  DISCUSSION  To further our understanding of the interactions between S.  aureus and the human immune system, we undertook a  genome-based approach to identify secreted proteins of  unknown function that may function in immunosuppressive or  anti-inflammatory capacities.
Using this approach, we identified Ehp and demonstrated that it is a potent inhibitor of the  alternative pathway of complement activation.
Because activation of the alternative pathway is stimulated by a variety of  viruses, fungi, protozoans, and bacteria, it was reasonable to  expect that S. aureus would have evolved or achieved sophisticated mechanisms to inhibit this essential component of the  host immune system.
It is interesting that this organism  appears to have arrived at a complement inhibitory strategy  distinct from most pathogens that relies on secreted molecules  acting at long-range instead of membrane-tethered inhibitors  (50, 51).
Structure-based multiple sequence alignment indicated that each of these secreted complement inhibitory proteins (including SCIN (11), Efb (5, 12, 21), and Ehp) is characterized by an 65-residue three-helix bundle motif (Fig. 2a).
  Yet despite this architectural similarity, the mechanisms used  by these respective S. aureus proteins are distinct.
SCIN mediates innate immune evasion by binding and stabilizing the alternative pathway C3 convertase complex C3bBbP in a surfacespecific manner, thereby blocking further C3b opsonization of  the bacterial cell surface (11); however, SCIN itself is incapable  of binding directly to C3, the central component of the alternative pathway.
In contrast, Efb blocks C3b opsonization of the  bacterial cell (5) by binding to native unactivated C3, altering its  solution conformation, and preventing its maturation into C3b  (21).
Our data presented here reveal that Ehp shares a similar  mechanism with Efb in that it binds native C3 (Figs. 2 and 3 and  Table 1), alters the solution conformation of bound C3 (Fig. 5),  and blocks C3b deposition onto complement-sensitized surfaces (Fig. 5).
The fact that both SCIN (52) and Ehp (Fig. 1) are  expressed at early time points in the bacterial growth cycle suggests that these complement inhibitors may act in concert to  provide a physiologically useful level of innate immune evasion  for S. aureus cells (52).
  In this study, we have provided independent lines of evidence  which strongly suggest that Ehp binding blocks complement  activation by altering the solution conformation of native C3 to  one that is incompetent to participate in the generation of C3b.
  On one hand, we observed enhanced reactivity of Ehp-bound  C3 with monoclonal antibody C3-9 (33, 49).
This enhancement  was seen over a wide range of concentrations and was not  detected for C3 treated with Ehp mutants that have diminished  C3d binding ability (Fig. 5); this indicates that Ehp binding is  directly responsible for increased exposure of the C3-9 epitope.
  Nishida et al. (49) recently demonstrated that monoclonal antibody C3-9 binds to macroglobulin domains 7 and 8 of the C3  -chain, and the recent crystal structures of C3 and C3b have  shown that these domains comprise a portion of the keyringlike core structure of C3 and become exposed during C3 activation to C3b (53, 54).
The fact that Ehp-bound C3 was recognized by anti-C3a antibodies (Fig. 5) suggests further that Ehp  binding results in an active-like C3 conformation, but one  that is not a substrate for processing by the C3bBbP convertase.
  Separately, it has been known for quite some time that the  changing conformations of C3 correlate with changes in affinity  for its many ligands (5557).
Along these lines, although the  primary Ehp recognition site of C3d remains largely unperturbed in the crystal structures of C3, C3b, and C3d (25, 53, 54),  the observed differences in Ehp relative binding affinity shown  in Fig. 3 are consistent and reproducible.
It is also worth noting  that we observed a similar series of binding preferences for  Efb-C as well as Efb-C-induced conformational change in activated C3b (21).
Together, these results suggest that alteration of  both C3 and C3b solution conformations by small binding proteins such as Ehp and Efb represents an important mode of  FIGURE 6.

  Identification of S. aureus Ehp  OCTOBER 12, 2007VOLUME 282NUMBER 41 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 30059   at SUNY at Stony Brook on March 13, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from innate immune evasion that has been manifested in the form of  multiple unique proteins expressed and secreted by a pathogenic organism.
  The results we have presented here suggest that a great deal  of insight into bacterial complement evasion may be gained by  not only understanding the similarities of Ehp and Efb, but by  also by appreciating their differences.
For example, although  Ehp and Efb share a common inhibitory mechanism, there  seem to be several important distinctions between these two  proteins.
First, we observed a substantially different binding  isotherm for formation of EhpC3d compared with either  EfbC3d or Efb-CC3d by isothermal titration calorimetry.
In  particular, Ehp displayed an usual two-site binding curve (Fig. 4  and Table 1).
This association of Ehp and C3d is driven by two  distinct sites that have distinct thermodynamic properties and  that lie on opposing helical faces of the Ehp protein.
Our results  presented here
strongly suggest that although Ehp and Efb-C  share a common binding site, the second site unique to Ehp  imparts bivalency to this protein when C3d is in molar excess.
  Second, we found that Ehp was a more potent inhibitor of the  alternative pathway than Efb (Fig. 5a).
The IC50 of Ehp for alternative pathway activation was determined to be 3-fold lower  than the corresponding value reported for Efb(-C) (21).
Moreover, the observed IC50 values for Ehp and its mutants correlated directly with their affinities for C3d (Fig. 5a and Table 2).
  The fact that both Efb and Ehp exert their effects by altering the  conformation of C3 in a similar manner (this work and Ref.
21)  but that Ehp can bind two molecules of C3 suggests that the  increased potency of Ehp is likely derived from the ability of this  protein to block the function of twice the native C3 molecules  as Efb.
In this respect, the concentration of native C3 in human  plasma (1.2 mg/ml or 6.5 M) (10) suggests that the bivalent  Ehp(C3)2 complex is likely to be the most prevalent complex  physiologically.
  The crystal structure of the Ehp(N63E)C3d complex presented in Fig. 6 demonstrates a high degree of identity to that of  Efb-CC3d (21), and both structures indicate that the residues  responsible for binding to C3d are concentrated in helix 2 of  Efb-C and Ehp.
In particular, the importance of two critical  residues in each protein (Arg75 and Asn82 in Ehp and Arg131  and Asn138 in Efb) has now been established (21).
In addition,  we have characterized a second C3d-binding site in Ehp that  includes Asn63 on helix 1 and that has now provided further  detail on the molecular basis of C3 recognition by these small  secreted proteins.
The fact that all of these residues are located  in such close proximity to one another in both the primary and  tertiary structures raises the exciting possibility of developing  or screening for molecular mimics of Ehp and/or Efb-C as anticomplement therapeutic candidates.
Although it is difficult to  predict what sort of molecules would best mimic the interface  of these protein/protein interactions a priori, the discrete  nature of the EhpC3d and Efb-CC3d complex interfaces suggests that such molecules need not be limited to proteins or  peptides and may in fact be accessible to the realm of small  organic molecules as well.
Alternatively, the small size of these  proteins, along with the ability to isolate large quantities of  them from recombinant strains of E. coli, suggests that it may  not be unrealistic to develop them into protein-based therapeutics.
Although there are obvious challenges to this approach, we  have found that the complement inhibitory domains of both  Efb-C and Ehp are stable even in the presence of broad-specificity  proteases (e.g. subtilisin) (data not shown).
These results suggest  that proteolytic susceptibility to these molecules is not likely to be  an impediment to their use as therapeutic lead substances.
