Biochemical Studies of the Mechanism of Action of the  Cdc42-GTPase-activating Protein*  (Received for publication, January 16, 1998, and in revised form, March 25, 1998)  David A. Leonard, Rui Lin, Richard A. Cerione, and Danny Manor  From the Department of Pharmacology, Veterinary Medical Center, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853  The small GTP-binding proteins Rac, Rho, and Cdc42  were shown to mediate a variety of signaling pathways  including cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell-cycle progression, and transformation.
Key to the proper function of these GTP-binding proteins is an efficient shutoff mechanism that ensures the decay of the signal.
  Regulatory proteins termed GAPs (GTPase-activating  proteins) enhance the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of the  GTP-binding proteins, thereby ensuring signal termination.
We have used site-specific mutagenesis to elucidate  the limit domain for GAP activity in Cdc42-GAP, and  show that in addition to the known GAP-homology domain (three conserved boxes), a C-terminal region outside that domain is also essential for GAP activity.
In  addition, we have replaced the conserved arginine  (Arg305), which was suggested by structural studies to be  a key catalytic residue, with an alanine and found that  the R305A Cdc42-GAP mutant has a greatly diminished  catalytic capacity but is still able to bind Cdc42 with  high affinity.
Thus, a key catalytic role for this residue is  confirmed.
However, we also present evidence for the  involvement of an additional residue(s), since the R305A  Cdc42-GAP mutant still exhibits measurable activity.
  Some of this residual activity might result from a neighboring arginine, since a double mutant R305A/R306A  shows a further decrease in catalytic activity.
  A variety of cell signaling pathways were shown to involve  GTP-binding proteins as key regulators, which relay signals  from cell-surface receptors to down-stream targets.
The efficiency of utilizing G proteins as transducers is evident from  their evolutionary conservation as well as the vast array of  sensory pathways that they regulate.
Thus, sensory inputs as  diverse as light, taste, pressure, olfaction, and hormone-binding, all employ GTP-binding proteins as critical mediators of  signal transduction pathways (1, 2).
Similar types of regulatory  roles have been assigned in the past decade to a subfamily of  small GTP-binding proteins, which includes the Rac, Rho, and  Cdc42 proteins.
Extracellular ligands such as growth factors  (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor) (3), hormones (e.g. bradikynin) (4), and cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1) (5) were shown to  result in the activation of Rho subfamily proteins and enable  them to interact with an array of down-stream targets such as  soluble kinases (e.g. p21-activated kinase) (6, 7), tyrosine kinases (e.g. activated Cdc42 kinase) (8, 9), and cytoskeletalassociated proteins (e.g. IQ-GAP) (1012).
  The key feature of GTP-binding proteins that enables them  to function as efficient signal transducers is their ability to  switch between two distinct conformations (GTP-bound and  GDP-bound), each of which possesses different biochemical  activities.
At any given time, the level of activated G protein is  determined by the rates of two primary reactions, the guanine  nucleotide (GTP-GDP) exchange reaction, which results in GTP  binding and G protein activation, and the GTP hydrolytic reaction, which results in the deactivation of the G protein.
  The G protein activation event is achieved by acceleration of  GDP dissociation from the nucleotide-binding pocket, a reaction that is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors  (GEFs).1 In the case of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins,  the membrane-bound serpentine receptors play the roles of  GEFs (e.g. rhodopsin or the b-adrenergic receptor), while in the  superfamily of small GTPases, the GEFs are typically soluble  proteins.
GEFs for the Rho-like GTPases share similar domain  structure, namely a tandem arrangement of Dbl homology and  pleckstrin homology domains, and often exhibit high oncogenic  capacity (13).
The mechanism by which a stimulus causes complex formation between GEFs and GTPases is still largely unknown, except for the case of Ras, where growth factor receptor  signaling results in recruitment of the GEF to the plasma membrane, thus ensuring its proximity to the Ras protein (1417).
  Just as critical to proper signaling is an efficient mechanism  to limit the lifetime of the signal such that persistent (possibly  detrimental) activation will not occur.
Virtually all GTP-binding proteins have an inherent capability to hydrolyze GTP.
  However, in the case of Ras-related small G proteins, the rate  of this reaction is significantly accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins, or GAPs.
GAPs for the Rho subfamily of GTPbinding proteins belong to a family whose members share significant sequence homology in a conserved GAP domain, and,  to some extent, overlapping function.
Examples for Rho GAPs  are the Cdc42-GAP (also termed Rho-GAP) (18, 19), the breakpoint cluster region gene product (BCR) (20), chimerin (21), and  the SH3 domain-binding protein 3BP1 (22).
At present, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of action of Rho  protein GAPs.
However, during the past year, structural determinations of Cdc42-GAP in complex with Cdc42HszGppNHp  and with RhozGDPzAlF4  2 clearly showed a conserved arginine  residue protruding into the GTPase active site, where it makes  contact with the nucleotide b-g oxygens and the catalytic glutamine residue of the GTP-binding protein (Gln61 in Cdc42 and  Gln63 in RhoA) (23, 24).
This raises the possibility of a catalytic  mechanism in which the positively charged arginine directly  stabilizes the negative charges that develop during the nucleophilic attack.
In the present study, we undertook a mutagenesis approach to directly quantitate the contributions of Arg305  and other residues in the Cdc42-GAP to catalysis of the GTP  hydrolytic reaction in Cdc42HszGTP.

  THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY Vol. 273, No. 26, Issue of June 26, pp. 1621016215, 1998   1998 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Printed in U.S.A.  16210 This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org   by guest on March 6, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from MATERIALS AND METHODS  MutagenesisAll GAP mutants were derived from the original clone  of the human enzyme (18).
Truncations of Cdc42-GAP were done using  naturally occurring restriction sites within the gene.
The site-specific  mutants were generated with standard polymerase chain reaction techniques and sequenced in the final expression vector (pET15b).
  ProteinsCdc42Hs and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia  coli as hexa-histidine fusion proteins and purified as described earlier  (25).
Cdc42-GAP proteins (wild-type, DYLQ, R305A, and R305A/R306A)  were expressed as hexa-histidine fusion proteins and purified as follows.
pET15-derived vectors harboring the GAP constructs were used to  transform E. coli BL21(DE3), and the bacteria were grown and induced  with standard protocols.
Bacterial pellets were lysed as described previously (25), and the lysate was loaded onto a 1.5 3 2.5-cm iminodiacetic  acid-Ni21 column (Sigma), which was developed with a linear imidazole  gradient (5200 mM).
Eluted GAP proteins were pooled according to  SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, brought to 55% saturation  with ammonium sulfate, and incubated overnight at 4 C.
The suspension was centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 C), the pellet resuspended  in 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2,1mM NaN3, treated with 0.3  mg of thrombin for 1 h, and applied onto a Q-Sepharose column (2.5 3  20 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer.
Purified GAP proteins were  eluted as a single peak during a 0300 mM NaCl gradient in the same  buffer, concentrated, and stored at 220 C in the presence of 40%  glycerol.
All fluorescence measurements were done on a T-format SLM  8000C Spectrofluorimeter, as described before (2527) in 20 mM HEPES  (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM NaCl.
  Measurements of binding of the different GAPs to Cdc42Hs were  done using the N-methylanthraniloyl (Mant) nucleotide assays described earlier (25, 27).
GTPase reaction rates were measured by monitoring the nucleotide-sensitive fluorescence from Trp97 of Cdc42Hs  (26).
Initial velocities of intrinsic GTPase activity were obtained by  linear fitting of the first 20 s after Mg21 addition.
Initial velocities of  GAP-stimulated GTPase activity were obtained by linear fitting of the  first 10 s after addition of Cdc42-GAP.
In both cases, the amount of GTP  hydrolyzed during this initial period did not exceed 7.5% of the total  GTP in the reaction mixture.
For comparisons between different GAP  constructs (Fig. 4), intrinsic GAP activity was subtracted from the  GAP-stimulated activity.
Fluorescence data were taken every 0.81.0 s,  with a dwell time of 1 s. The initial intensity as well as the end points  for the observed changes in tryptophan fluorescence were identical for  all active GAP constructs, indicating these molecules differ only in their  catalytic capacity.
  Complexes of Cdc42HszMant-GppNHp and Cdc42HszMant-GDP  were prepared, and excess probe was removed as described earlier (25).
  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Determination of the Limit Functional Domain of Cdc42-  GAPTo delineate a limit functional domain for the Cdc42-  GAP, the gene encoding this GAP was mutated to introduce  deletions at the amino and carboxyl termini.
The carboxylterminal region of the full-length protein, containing 234 amino  acids, was used as a starting point since it had already been  shown that this fragment possessed full GAP activity toward  Cdc42Hs (18).
The deletion mutants were then expressed in E.  coli, purified, and tested for GAP activity.
As shown in Fig. 1,  removal of the carboxyl-terminal 35 or 25 amino acids (59 StyI  and AseI sites, respectively) resulted in a complete loss of GAP  activity.
Interestingly, neither of these deletions removes regions that are conserved in other members of the Rho-GAP  family (GAP homology boxes, see below).
It was possible, however, to remove the 12 carboxyl-terminal residues and retain  full catalysis of GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42Hs.
The carboxylterminal border of the limit functional domain therefore lies  between the AseI and StyI sites of the GAP gene.
The amino  terminus could be significantly deleted without a functional  consequence; specifically, deletions of both 268 and 280 residues (PstI and NlaIV sites, respectively) had no effect on GAP  activity.
Both of these deletions remove the only recognizable  motif in the GAP protein, the proline-rich region that is known  to bind to SH3 domains.
Clearly, this domain is not necessary  for GAP activity and may fold to an independent domain.
Thus,  the limit catalytic domain of Cdc42-GAP that we have defined  was 190 amino acids, compared with 462 residues found in the  full-length protein.
  Residues on Cdc42Hs That Are Important to GAP Function  Two regions on Ras, termed switch I (effector domain, residues 2940) and switch II (residues 5870) were shown to shift  conformationally between the GTP- and GDP-bound states of  the protein.
Both regions reside on the same face of the folded  Ras molecule, and presumably control most of the interactions  with effectors and regulators (28).
Residues on the effector  domain show remarkable conservation within the small G protein superfamily.
For example, Tyr32, Pro34, Asp38, and Tyr40  are identical in Cdc42, Rac, Rho, Ras, and Rap proteins.
We  have tested the ability of Cdc42-GAP to interact with two  effector mutants of Cdc42Hs, Y32K and D38E.
The corresponding mutations in Ras prevent its interactions with Ras-GAP.
  Table I shows the specific activity of GAP234 on these two  mutants, as well as the dissociation constant for their binding  with Cdc42-GAPR305A. It is clear that the conservative mutation D38E in Cdc42Hs has only a minor effect on the interactions between Cdc42Hs and its GAP.
On the other hand, replacing Tyr32 with a lysine results in a complete loss of  interaction between the two proteins.
It is interesting to note  that essentially identical results were obtained when examining the interactions of these Cdc42Hs mutants with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Dbl (29), which has the opposite physiological function of the GAP, i.e. to activate the GTPbinding protein.

Activity is defined as the ability  to stimulate the GTPase activity of  Cdc42Hs as assayed in the tryptophan  fluorescence assay (see Materials and  Methods).
  Cdc42-GAP Mechanism 16211   by guest on March 6, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from mately 150 residues (GAP homology domain) that can be further dissected into three homology boxes (Fig. 1) (3032).
The  recently described crystal structures of the GAP domains from  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (a subunit) and Cdc42-GAP demonstrated that these three regions of homology all reside on one  face of the GAP protein, where they fold into a structurally  conserved cleft (33, 34).
Additionally, in a recently determined  structure of the complex between Cdc42Hs and its GAP, the  three homology boxes were shown to compose the majority of  the binding interface, forming extensive hydrogen bonding contacts with the switch regions I and II and the P-loop of the  GTPase (23).
  Two possible mechanistic scenarios have been invoked to  explain the accelerated GTP hydrolytic rate observed in the  presence of GAPs.
In one case, the GAP protein is suggested to  directly contribute catalytic residues to the GTPase active site,  while in the other, the GAP only rearranges existing residues.
  Interestingly, structural studies suggest that both of these  mechanisms may be utilized.
For the case of Ras and its  p120Ras-GAP, the Ras-GAP appears to contribute an arginine  residue (Arg789) which is inserted into the active site, where it  serves to stabilize the transition state for GTP hydrolysis by  neutralizing charges that develop during the nucleophilic attack (35).
In the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins such as  Gia1, the catalytic arginine is built-in to the GTPase itself (e.g.  Arg178 in Gia1), and is not supplied by its GAP, RGS4 (36).
In  these cases, the catalytic function of the GAP is mainly to  reorganize existing residues within the active site and prime  them for the subsequent hydrolytic events.
  A conserved arginine residue is found in the first homology  box of the GAP domains in all members of the Rho-GAP family  (see Fig. 2).
In the tertiary structure of the complex between  Cdc42HszGppNHp and Cdc42-GAP (also termed RhoGAP),  Arg305 adopts a conformation very similar to that observed for  Arg789 in Ras-GAP and Arg178 in Gia1, protruding into the  GTPase active site and binding to both switch regions and the  P-loop of Cdc42Hs (23).2 Lending support to the catalytic role of  this residue, a mutagenesis study of the related protein nchimerin (which functions as a GAP for the Rac1 GTPase)  showed that deletion of the three residues 143YRV145 (homologous to 304FRR306 in Cdc42-GAP), resulted in a GAP molecule  which binds to Rac1zGTP, but does not catalyze GTP hydrolysis  (32).
  Similar functional effects accompanied the deletion of amino  acids 131EIE133, of n-chimerin, which are located upstream of  the critical arginine Arg144 (homologous to 292YLQ294 in Cdc42-  GAP).
This deletion mutant exhibited no GTPase catalytic activity toward Rac1zGTP, although some binding was observed  (32).
Interestingly, these amino acids are not highly conserved  in the RhoGAPs.
  To directly address the role of Arg305 and the YLQ stretch in  the catalytic function of the Cdc42-GAP, we changed arginine  305 to alanine, and separately, deleted the YLQ stretch (residues 292294).
The mutant GAP proteins were expressed as  hexa-his-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli and were then purified to homogeneity (25).
  When introducing mutations for functional analysis, it is  important to determine whether the alterations affect the overall folding pattern of the protein.
This is particularly the case  when a loss of function mutant is being examined, i.e. it is  important to show that the loss of activity is not simply the  result of a global, nonspecific structural perturbation.
Toward  this end, we compared the stability of both Cdc42-GAP mutants with the wild-type Cdc42-GAP.
All three proteins were  expressed equally well in bacteria, and showed little difference  in solubility suggesting that proper folding was occurring.
We  then more directly examined their structural integrity by monitoring denaturant-induced unfolding.
As proteins unfold and  tryptophan residues go from buried to exposed environments,  their fluorescence emission maxima shift toward longer wavelengths (37).
We have measured the peak position of the protein tryptophan fluorescence emission (excitation 5 295 nm) at  increasing urea concentrations, and the resulting isotherm is  shown in Fig. 3.
It is clear that all three proteins show halfmaximal denaturation at ;4.5 M urea, indicating equivalent  stability and native folding patterns.
  Cdc42Hs has a single tryptophan (W97), and its fluorescence  was shown to be a convenient and accurate read-out for the  nucleotide state of the protein (26).
Furthermore, the time-de2 Residues are numbered here according to the original GenBank  entry for Cdc42-GAP (accession number U02540; Ref. 18).
Other  authors have referred to the same residue as Arg85 (23, 24).

  16212 Cdc42-GAP Mechanism   by guest on March 6, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from pendent changes in the fluorescence from this tryptophan were  shown to accurately report the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis by  Cdc42Hs and its catalysis by Cdc42-GAP.
Using this real-time  spectrofluorimetric assay, we have set out to quantitate the  catalytic activity of the mutated GAP proteins.
To determine  specific activities of the different mutants and the wild-type  Cdc42-GAP proteins, we measured the initial rates of GAPinduced GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42Hs in the presence of increasing amounts of GAP proteins.
In Fig. 4, the initial rates of  hydrolysis are plotted versus GAP concentration, and fitted to  a linear function, the slope of which represents the specific  activity for each GAP protein.
Clearly, the wild-type protein  shows the highest specific activity, while both the R305A and  DYLQ GAPs are severely impaired in their ability to catalyze  GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42Hs.
Specifically, the R305A mutant  exhibits a 45-fold decrease in its specific activity.
While this is  consistent with the idea that Arg305 plays a key role in GAP  activity, it apparently is not entirely responsible for the catalysis of GTP hydrolysis.
The Cdc42-GAPDYLQ mutant, on the  other hand, appears to be completely incapable of stimulating  GTP hydrolytic activity of Cdc42Hs.
  While the loss of activity for both mutant Cdc42-GAP proteins suggest that the affected residues are necessary for the  proper functioning of the GAP, two alternative possibilities  could be invoked for the basis of their involvement in GAPmediated catalysis.
First, the mutated residues might be directly or indirectly involved in catalysis, as has been suggested  for Arg305, such that their replacement or deletion directly  perturbs the catalytic event.
Alternatively, these residues may  be part of the binding interface between the GAP and the  Cdc42.
To distinguish between these possibilities, we have  directly monitored and quantitated the binding affinities of  Cdc42Hs to the different GAP proteins.
  Complex Formation between Cdc42Hs and Various Wild-type  and Mutant GAPsNucleotides covalently modified at the ribose 29 and 39 positions with Mant derivatives have been extremely useful fluorimetric probes for the interactions between  GTP-binding proteins and guanine nucleotides.
Two basic spectroscopic approaches involving Mant-guanine nucleotides have  been used; one involves environmental sensitivity, where protein-protein interactions that perturb the microenvironment of  the Mant-moiety were shown to influence the fluorescence intensity of Mant-nucleotides bound to Ras, Cdc42Hs and Rac  (25, 3841).
A second approach involves taking advantage of  the correlation between the polarized emission of a fluorophore  and molecular size, to directly monitor complex formation between a fluorescently labeled protein and its binding partner  (27, 42).
We have exchanged the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog,  Mant-GppNHp into the active site of Cdc42Hs, and monitored  Mant fluorescence intensity as a function of added wild-type or  mutant Cdc42-GAP proteins.
As shown in Fig. 5A, the wildtype Cdc42-GAP had no effect on Mant fluorescence, indicating  that this fluorescent nucleotide is insensitive to the interaction  of GAP proteins with the GTP-binding protein.
This observaFIG. 4.
Specific activities of wild-type and mutant Cdc42-GAP  proteins.
Rates of GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42Hs were measured using  the tryptophan fluorescence assay (26).
Initial rates of the fluorescence  changes were quantitated as described under Materials and Methods.  The rates of GAP-induced GTP hydrolysis were corrected for intrinsic  GTPase activity and plotted versus the amount of GAP234 (E; slope 5  15.2), R305A (f; slope 5 0.36), DYLQ (; slope 5 0.00), or R305A/R306A  (; slope 5 0.08) added.
Concentration of Cdc42Hs was 5 mM. Data  shown are representative of two to three independent experiments.

The data were fit to  a simple binding model (solid lines) described in Leonard et al. (25).

  The anisotropy of Mant-GDP or Mant-GppNHp bound to Cdc42Hs was  measured in a T-format fluorimeter as described previously (27).
Excitation was at 360 nm, polarized emission was at 440 nm and spectral  resolution was 16 nm.
The anisotropy was measured and plotted versus  the total amount of GAP234, DYLQ, or R305A added.
The data shown  represent the average of two independent experiments and were fit as  described in Leonard et al. (25).
  Cdc42-GAP Mechanism 16213   by guest on March 6, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from tion points at a difference in the interaction of Cdc42 and its  GAP from other, related systems (e.g. RaszMant-GppNHp and  NF1) (38), where strong enahancement of Mant fluorescence  was observed upon complex formation.
  Interestingly, the GAPR305A mutant produced a large  (.60%), saturable enhancement of Mant fluorescence (Fig. 5A,  squares).
Fitting this titration to a bi-molecular association  model yielded an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.0 mM  for the Cdc42Hs 7 GAP binding interaction.
  The strong binding of GAPR305A to activated Cdc42Hs suggests that the 45-fold decrease in specific activity observed with  this mutant GAP protein is due to a key catalytic role of Arg305  in mediating an enhancement of the GTP hydrolysis rate by  Cdc42Hs.
However, bearing in mind that the mutation is not a  conserved one (Arg 3 Ala), the fact that this mutant exhibits a  small yet measurable activity suggests that other mechanisms  of rate enhancement still exist (see below).
  It is interesting that the wild-type GAP and the R305A  mutant have such drastically different effects on Mant fluorescence.
The binding of GAPR305A to Cdc42HszMant-GppNHp  apparently causes a specific conformational change at the active site of the GTP-binding protein.
This may suggest the  existence of a less active conformation for Cdc42 when complexed to the GAPR305A mutant, such that the catalytic residues are not aligned properly for optimal catalysis.
When activated, Cdc42Hs is bound to the wild-type Cdc42-GAP, the  presence of Arg305 may orient the active site into the appropriate conformation, which apparently does not induce a fluorescence change for the Mant moiety.
The alternative hypothesis  is based on the potential for the arginine to stabilize a pentacovalent transition state of the g-phosphate, as has been suggested for other GAP mechanisms.
With the loss of this stabilization function (in the case of GAPR305A), the GTP-binding  protein may be unable to proceed from the initial conformation to the transition state.
The differences between these two  conformations would be responsible for the differential effects  on Mant fluorescence.
In either case, the data substantiate that  the binding of the wild-type and mutant GAPs results in a  different local environment sensed by the Mant moiety.
  Fig. 5A also shows that addition of the GAPDYLQ mutant to  the Cdc42HszMant-GppNHp complex has no effect on Mant  fluorescence.
There are two possible explanations for this observation.
First, it may be that this deletion mutant retains its  ability to bind Cdc42Hs, but unlike the GAPR305A mutant, it  does not alter the microenvironment within the nucleotide  binding site of the GTPase (i.e. similar to the wild-type GAP).
  Alternatively, the deletion of the YLQ region could disrupt the  binding interface between the two proteins, such that no complex is formed.
To further examine this possibility, we used the  anisotropy of Cdc42HszMant-GppNHp to detect complex formation.
In this assay, when a fluorescent probe becomes part of a  large complex (such as the binding of Cdc42HszMant-GppNHp  to the GAP), the lower rotational mobility that results decreases the depolarizing effect that the probe has on polarized  excitation light.
Fig. 5B shows that the anisotropy of the  Cdc42HszMant-GppNHp complex increased in a saturable  manner as the wild-type Cdc42-GAP was titrated into the  cuvette, indicating the formation of a larger complex with an  apparent Kd value of 1.3 mM. Note that only a negligible increase in Mant anisotropy was observed when Cdc42HszMantGDP was titrated with the Cdc42-GAP (Fig. 5B, open triangles).
The interaction of the GAPDYLQ mutant with the  Cdc42HszMant-GppNHp resulted in a similar (but smaller)  anisotropy change, indicating that this mutant was capable of  binding to the GTP-binding protein (apparent Kd 5 3.7 mM).
  Taken together, these data indicated that both the GAPR305A  and GAPDYLQ mutants retained Cdc42Hs-binding capability.
  Unexpectedly, the GAPR305A mutant showed little effect on  the anisotropy of the Cdc42HszMant-GppNHp complex.
The  lack of anisotropy change cannot be due to impaired binding,  since we know that it influences the micro-environment of the  Mant moiety (see Fig. 5A).
The most logical explanation is that  the altered conformation that results in the change in fluorescence upon binding of GAPR305A also increases the local mobility of the Mant fluorophore group.
This increased mobility  results in a decrease in anisotropy that apparently counteracts  any increase due to the lower overall rotational mobility of a  large GAP-Cdc42Hs complex.
These findings further argue  that different conformations are induced in the presence and  absence of the critical Arg305 residue.
  Arg305 is located in a kink of a flexible loop that connects  helices A and A1 of the Cdc42-GAP molecule.
It seems reasonable to assume that the Arg 3 Ala substitution at this residue  will not result in gross structural perturbations.
The ;45-fold  reduction in specific activity, therefore, is probably due to the  loss of a direct contribution by this residue to catalysis, as  previously suggested (23, 24).
The YLQ region, on the other  hand, is located in the middle of helix A in Cdc42-GAP, where  it makes a full helical turn.
Thus, removal of the YLQ stretch  is likely to result in a shorter version of helix A which is still  structurally stable.
This deletion is therefore likely to not influence overall protein folding, but results in a positional shift  of Arg305 such that it is no longer in a catalytically competent  conformation.
It is interesting to note that the R305A replacement still possesses measurable catalytic capacity on  Cdc42zGTP (Fig. 4).
Thus, the GAP molecule may provide another residue that helps stabilize the transition state for GTP  hydrolysis.
A possible candidate is Arg306, due to its proximity  to the GAP active site, and its identical side-chain.
Thus, in a  Cdc42-GAP mutant lacking Arg305, it is possible to envision  that the neighboring arginine provides some level of compensation.
To test this possibility, we have constructed a double  mutant in which both Arg305 and Arg306 are mutated to alanine  residues (the R305A/R306A mutant), and tested its specific  activity toward Cdc42HszGTP (Fig. 4, filled triangles).
Clearly,  the specific activity demonstrated by the R305A/R306A mutant  is some 4-fold weaker then that exhibited by the GAP protein  harboring only the R305A mutation, consistent with the idea  that Arg306 may partially compensate for a loss of Arg305.
  Whether this is of any mechanistic importance in the wild-type  Cdc42-GAP protein awaits further structural studies.
