Biochemistry 1995, 34, 10383-10392 10383   Analysis of the Factor VIIa Binding Site on Human Tissue Factor: Effects of   Tissue Factor Mutations on the Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Binding   Robert F. Kelley,* Kimberly E. Costas, Mark P. O'Connell, and Robert A. Lazarus   Department of Protein Engineering, Genentech, Inc., 460 Point San Bruno Boulevard, South San Francisco, California 94080   Received March 8, 1995; Revised Manuscript Received May 17, 1995@   ABSTRACT: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements on a BIAcore instrument have been used to   measure the effects of mutations in human tissue factor (TF), the initiator of blood coagulation, on the   kinetics and affinity of binding to human FVIIa.
TF mutant proteins were produced in soluble form by   expression of the extracellular domain (sTF) in Escherichia coli followed by immunoaffinity purification.
  Mutants were designed and analyzed on the basis of the structure of sTF recently determined by X-ray   crystallography [Muller et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 10864- 108701. Wild-type sTF binding to   immobilized FVIIa has k,, = 3.4 f 0.8 x lo5 M-' s-' a nd koff = 2.1 dz 0.1 x s-l with a calculated   KD of 6.3 f 1.2 nM and AG of - 1 1.2 f 0.1 kcal mol-'.
Calorimetric measurements indicate that binding   occurs with a favorable AH of -32 kcal mol-', an unfavorable AS of -70 cal K-I mol-', and a ACp of   -730 cal K mol-'.
The value of ACp is consistent with burial of a large nonpolar surface area upon   binding.
Five residues on TF, Lys20, Trp45, Asp58, Tyr94, and Phel40, make a large contribution (AAG   = 1-2.5 kcal mol-') to FVIIa binding, a set of 17 mutations result in modest decreases in affinity (AAG   = 0.3-1 kcal mol-'), and 40 mutations have AAG smaller than the experimental uncertainty (f0.3 kcal   mol-').
Mutations at four sites result in small (0.3-0.5 kcal mol-') increases in affinity.
Decreases in   affinity result primarily from increased rates of dissociation.
These data define a putative FVIIa binding   site on one face of the TF structure with most of the contacts contributed by the N-terminal fibronectin   type I11 domain.
The critical binding residues are found on @-strands.
An additional set of residues   located on the surface of the C-terminal fibronectin type I11 domain opposite the FVIIa binding site have   a role in the procoagulant activity of sTF but are not involved in FVIIa binding.
  Tissue factor has a principle role in vertebrate hemostasis   by serving as the initiator of the extrinsic pathway of blood   coagulation (Davie et al., 1991; Ruf & Edgington, 1994).
  TF' is an integral membrane glycoprotein (263 residues)   normally expressed in the adventitial cell layer surrounding   blood vessels and on the surface of a variety of tissues (Drake   et al., 1989; Wilcox et al., 1989).
TF consists of an   extracellular part (residues 1 -219), a single membranespanning region (220-242) and a small cytoplasmic domain   (243-263) (Monissey et al., 1987; Scarpati et al., 1987;   Spicer et al., 1987).
Vascular damage exposes blood to TF,   which forms a calcium-dependent, high-affinity complex with   plasma coagulation factor VI1 (FVII).
TF binding stimulates   proteolytic activation of zymogen FVII to the serine protease   FVIIa (Nemerson & Repke, 1985).
TF also dramatically   enhances the catalytic efficiency of FVIIa for both peptide   (Lawson et al., 1992) and protein substrates (Bom & Bertina,   1990).
The TF-FVIIa complex proteolytically activates   factors IX and X, ultimately resulting in thrombin generation   * Corresponding author [telephone (415) 225-2321, Fax (415) 225-   @ Abstract published in Advance ACS Abstracts, July 15, 1995.

Structure-function studies   on TF and FVIIa are required to understand the mechanism   of cofactor action.
  Overexpression and/or aberrant utilization of TF have been   linked to the pathophysiology of both thrombosis and sepsis.
  TF is expressed on cells found in atherosclerotic plaque   (Wilcox et al., 1989) and can be induced on endothelial cells   and monocytes by exposure to inflammatory cytokines or   bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Gregory et al., 1989).
Neutralizing anti-TF antibodies prevent death in a primate model   of Escherichia coli-induced septic shock (Taylor et al., 1991),   attenuate endotoxin-induced DIC in rabbits (Warr et al.,   1990), and inhibit thrombus formation in a rabbit model of   arterial thrombosis (Pawashe et al., 1994).
Drugs that   modulate the cofactor function of TF could have important   therapeutic applications in the treatment of thrombosis and   sepsis.
Given that binding to TF is essential for the activation   and catalytic function of FVIIa, one approach to develop   inhibitors of the extrinsic pathway would be to target the   interface between TF and FVIIa.
Results of the structurefunction analysis of TF-FVIIa should aid in the design of   extrinsic pathway anticoagulants.
  We describe here results of thermodynamic and kinetics   measurements on the interaction between human FVIIa and   the extracellular domain of human TF (sTF).

Previous   work (Ruf et al., 1994; Schullek et al., 1994; Gibbs et al.,   1994) has used the TF-stimulated enzymatic activity of FVIIa   to assay effects of TF mutations on the affinity for FVIIa.
  These data were interpreted on the basis of the proposed   structural homology of TF to the cytokine receptor family   (Bazan, 1990) to elucidate a putative binding site for FVIIa.
  Recently, the structure of the extracellular domain of TF has   been determined by X-ray crystallography (Harlos et al.,   1994; Muller et al., 1994).
The structure shows sTF to be   composed of two fibronectin type I11 domains2 as observed   for the human growth hormone receptor (DeVos et al., 1992).
  This structure allows us to make a more detailed analysis of   the functional effects of TF mutations using the thermodynamic and kinetic data presented here.
  Kelley et al.   Circular Dichroic Spectroscopy.
Far-UV CD spectra were   recorded on a Cary/AVIV 60 DS spectropolarimeter.
Quartz,   cylindrical cuvettes having a path length of 0.1 cm were used,   and 10 spectra were collected and averaged.
Spectra were   collected at 25 "C using 4 pM protein solutions containing   10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0.
  BlAcore Measurement of sTF Binding to Immobilized   FVZla.
The effects of mutations in sTF upon FVIIa binding   were determined by surface plasmon resonance measurements on a Pharmacia BIAcore instrument (Karlsson et al.,   1991).
FVIIa was immobilized by first reacting with a   biotinylated inhibitor (BEGR-ck) followed by capture of the   covalently modified protein (BEGR-FVIIa) on a sensor chip   surface derivatized with streptavidin.
BEGR-FVIIa was   prepared by adding BEGR-ck (final concentration of 100   pM) to a solution containing 19 pM FVIIa, 300 pM sTF,   20 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaC1, and 5 mM CaC12.
  After incubation at ambient temperature for 2 h, the solution   was desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated with buffer   containing 50 mM EDTA.
Streptavidin was immobilized   on the sensor chip surface by coupling through free amino   groups.
The carboxylated dextran matrix was first activated   with a mixture of NHS and EDC using a protocol supplied   by the manufacturer.
An aliquot of a 1 mg/mL solution of   streptavidin in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, was injected   at a flow rate of 2 pL min-'.
Injections were repeated until   the SPR signal was increased by 5000-10 000 resonance   units above the original baseline.
Unreacted NHS was   blocked by injection of an aliquot of 1 M ethanolamine.
An   aliquot of a solution of BEGR-FVIIa was then injected to   obtain an additional increase in SPR signal of 2000-3000   resonance units.
Any residual sTF bound to BEGR-FVIIa   was eluted by injection of an aliquot of 50 mM EDTA.
  The affinity of sTF variants for FVIIa was calculated from   the kinetics of binding to immobilized FVIIa.
For a 1:l   binding interaction   EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES   Materials.
Human FVIIa and BEGR-ck were purchased   from Haematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT).
  The human FVIIa used in the calorimetry experiments was   the kind gift of Dr. W. Kisiel (University of New Mexico).
  Streptavidin was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene,   OR).
  Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis.
A phagemid vector designed for secretion of 1-219 human TF from E. coli   under control of the alkaline phosphatase promoter and stI1   bacterial signal sequence was used as the template for   oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis.
The procedure of   Kunkel et al. (1987) was used to increase the efficiency of   mutagenesis.
Mutants selected by using this protocol were   confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the singlestrand form of the phagemid.
The DNA sequence was   determined at the site of the mutation and for 30-50 bp on   each side of this site.
  Expression and PuriJication of sTF Mutants.
E. coli strain   27C7 transformed with the expression plasmid was grown   overnight at 30 "C in 250 mL of low phosphate containing   media.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen at -20   "C for 1 h, and then subjected to osmotic shock to release   periplasmic contents by resuspension in 20 mL of 10 mM   Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM   benzamidine.
After incubation on ice for 1 h, the suspension   was centrifuged at 1OOOOg for 20 min, and then the sTF in   the supernate was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography.
Briefly, the osmotic shock supernate was loaded onto   a column (1 x 20 cm) having the D3 monoclonal antibody   (Paborsky et al., 1989) immobilized onto controlled pore   glass and previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH   8, and 0.5 M NaCl.
Proteins bound nonspecifically were   removed by washing with 3 column volumes of 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8, 1.0 M NaC1, and 0.5 M tetramethylammonium   chloride, and then the sTF was eluted with 0.1 M sodium   acetate, pH 3, and 0.2 M NaC1.
Peak fractions were pooled   and neutralized.
Concentrations of purified sTF were   determined by absorbance measurements using an 6280 of 29.4   mM-' cm-' calculated from quantitative amino acid analysis   data.
An 280 of 24 mM-' cm-' was used for the Trp to   Phe mutants of sTF.
  * The extracellular portion of TF consists of two domains, residues   1-103 and 104-219, with topology of a fibronectin type 111 unit.
  ,&Strands are labeled A, B, C, C', E, F, and G according to the   fibronectin type I11 nomenclature.
  We determined k,, by analyzing the response curve observed   upon return to buffer flow after saturation with a high   concentration (usually 21 pM) of sTF.
Association rate   constants (k,) were calculated by using a series of six sTF   concentrations ranging from 31.25 nM to 1 pM in 2-fold   increments, and k,, was determined from the concentration   dependence of k,.
Kinetics measurements commonly employed a flow rate of 10 pL min-', and the sensor chip   surface was regenerated by elution of bound sTF with an   injection of 50 mM EDTA.
Kinetic constants were determined by nonlinear regression analysis as described by   O'Shannessy et al. (1993) using software supplied by the   manufacturer.
  Isothermal Titration Calorimetry.
Measurements of the   enthalpy change (AH) for wild-type sTF binding to factor   VIIa were performed on a Microcal, Inc., OMEGA titration   calorimeter as previously described (Kelley & O'Connell,   1993).
Protein solutions were prepared by exhaustive   dialysis versus a buffer solution of 20 mM Tris-HC1, pH   7.5, 100 mM NaC1, and 5 mM CaC12.
FVIIa at a concentration of 5.8 pM was loaded into the 1.4 mL calorimeter cell Factor VIIa Binding Site on Tissue Factor   and titrated by injection of aliquots of a solution of 480 pM   sTF.
Heats of binding were calculated by subtracting heats   of sTF dilution measured in separate experiments.
These   data were analyzed by using software supplied by the   manufacturer.
Enthalpy measurements were made at 25 and   37 "C to obtain an estimate of ACp from the relationship   Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 33, 1995 10385   Coagulation Measurements.
The procoagulant function   of wild-type and mutant sTF was measured on an ACL300   coagulometer operated in the research mode.
sTF was added   to pooled, platelet-depleted human plasma that had been   anticoagulated by addition of citrate.
A sTF concentration   of 500 nM was used.
Coagulation was initiated by mixing   equal volumes of this solution and a solution of 25 mM   calcium chloride, and the clotting time was measured.
  RESULTS   SPR Measurements of sTF Binding to Immobilized FVIIa.
  Initial experiments indicated that amine coupling of FVIIa   to the sensor chip yielded a surface with weakened and   poorly reproducible affinity for sTF (Kelley, 1994).
Since   modification of the active site of FVIIa has been shown to   have little impact on binding to TF (Bach et al., 1986), we   chose to immobilize FVIIa through the protease active site.
  FVIIa was modified with a biotinylated peptide chloromethyl   ketone (Williams et al., 1989) followed by capture of the   biotinylated FVIIa (BEGR-FVIIa) on a sensor chip having   amine-coupled streptavidin.
The rate constant for dissociation of BEGR-FVIIa from streptavidin was less than 1 x   s-I (data not shown).
As shown in Figure 1, sensorgrams observed for injection of sTF onto this surface gave   a good signal to noise ratio with the rate and extent of binding   increasing with sTF concentration.
No binding was detected   for a sensor chip derivatized with streptavidin alone (data   not shown).
As expected since the TFFVIIa interaction is   calcium dependent, bound sTF could be eluted by injection   of an aliquot of 50 mM EDTA.
The BEGR-FVIIastreptavidin surface showed good stability toward this   regeneration procedure and only slowly lost sTF binding   capacity after repeated experiments.
  An apparent kon of 3.4 f 0.8 x lo5 M-' s-l w as calculated   from the concentration dependence of association shown in   Figure 1B.
Analysis of the sensorgram observed upon return   to buffer flow after injection of 3 pM sTF (Figure IC)   yielded an apparent k,ff of 2.1 f 0.1 x s-l.
The ratio   of the kinetic constants gives a KD of 6.3 f 1.2 nM and a   calculated AG of -11.2 f 0.1 kcal mol-'.
These values   represent the mean of triplicate measurements made on the   same sensor chip over a period of a few days.
A comparison   between sensor chips and preparations of BEGR-FVIIa gives   similar mean values but a 3-fold larger standard deviation.
  The affinity determined by SPR measurements is within the   range of KD values (0.6-20 nM) reported for sTF binding   to FVIIa from a variety of experimental methods (Ruf et   al., 1991; Waxman et al., 1992; Neuenschwander & Morrissey, 1994; Schullek et al., 1994).
  Dissociation of bound sTF was more precisely described   by two exponentials rather than a single kinetic phase.

The solutions also contained 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CaC12, and the temperature   was 25 "C.

No evidence for heterogeneity   is observed in the association kinetics, suggesting that the   FVIIa is homogeneous.
Two alternative binding schemes   are   (4)   (5) 10386 Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 33, 1995   0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0   Molar Raclo   FIGURE 2: Heats of binding measured by isothermal calorimetry   for titration of 5.8 pM FVIIa by addition of 4 pL aliquots of a   solution of 480 pM wild-type sTF at 25.5 "C. The solid line is the   result of nonlinear regression analysis yielding an n of 0.9 and AH   of -32 kcal mol-'.
  Mechanism 4 predicts a hyperbolic dependence of k, on free   ligand concentration which is inconsistent with the linear   dependence observed (Figure 1B).
Mechanism 5 is also   inconsistent with the data because the slow isomerization of   A limits the rate of binding, and thus k, should be fairly   independent of free ligand concentration.
The fit to a single   exponential was not significantly improved by changes in   flow rate in the range of 10-50 pL min-', by increasing   the sTF concentration to 300 pM, or by decreasing the   amount of immobilized BEGR-FVIIa.
Although these results   suggest that the deviation from single-exponential behavior   does not originate from rebinding of sTF during the dissociation experiment, the relatively large k,,, could make it   difficult to prevent rebinding.
We conclude that mechanism   1 is most consistent with the data.
This conclusion is   supported by the agreement in the KD value calculated from   the SPR data by using mechanism 1 with the results of other   measurements.
  Calorimetric Measurement of sTF Binding to FVIIa.
  Heats of sTF binding to FVIIa determined by using   isothermal titration calorimetry are shown in Figure 2.
  Analysis of these data using a single class of binding sites   model yields an n of 0.90 f 0.01, consistent with the 1:l   stoichiometry observed by other methods (Waxman et al.,   1992), and a AH of 32.0 f 0.5 kcal mol-'.
The affinity of   the interaction is too high to determine the binding constant   by ~alorimetry.~ Since the binding constant determined by   SPR indicates a AG of -1 1.2 kcal mol-', the entropy change   upon binding is large and unfavorable (AS = -70 cal mol-'   K-').
Although the limited availability of purified FVIIa   precluded extensive calorimetric experiments, the AH was   also determined at 37 "C (AH = -40.8 kcal mol-') to give   an estimated ACp of -730 cal mol-' K-l.
The sign and   magnitude of ACp are consistent with burial of a large   For accurate determination of the binding constant K, the c value   for the measurements (c = K[M], where [MI is the concentration of   the titrant) needs to be between 1 and 1000 (Wiseman et al., 1989).
If   the KD for sTF*FVIIa is 5 nM, then the concentration required to give a c value of 1000 is 5 pM. At this concentration, however, the total   heat change would be small, resulting in an imprecise binding isotherm.

  sTF Mutant Production.
sTF residues were initially   selected for mutagenesis by choosing segments of the TF   extracellular domain proposed (Bazan, 1990) to be structurally homologous to the loops of the growth hormone receptor   that are involved in hormone binding (Bass et al., 1991;   DeVos et al., 1992; Clackson & Wells, 1995).
Double (e.g.,   K65A:D66A) and triple (e.g., R136A:N137A:N138A) mutants of clustered charged or polar residues were constructed   in order to speed identification of the binding site for FVIIa.
  The four tryptophans of sTF were individually mutated to   phenylalanine since there is a change in Trp fluorescence   upon sTF binding to FVIIa (R. Kelley, unpublished results).
  In addition, Ruf et al. (1994) had identified Lys20, Asp58,   and Phel40 as important residues for binding to FVIIa.
Once   the crystal structure of the TF extracellular domain became   available (Harlos et al., 1994; Muller et al., 1994), the   mutagenesis strategy was altered to emphasize solventaccessible residues that are spatially close to these sites.
For   example, an inspection of the structure for residues close to   Lys20 identifies Leu133.
Similarly, Gln37 is observed to   pack against Trp45, and Lys48 is detected as a close neighbor   to Asp58.
  As indicated by SDS-PAGE (not shown), sTF mutants   could be obtained in high purity by secretion from E. coli   and immunoaffinity purification.
Most mutant proteins could   be obtained in 0.2-0.5 mg quantities from a 250 mL culture.
  Electrospray-ionization mass spectroscopy (Bourell et al.,   1994) confirmed the molecular weights expected for these   mutants.
Wild-type sTF isolated in this fashion stimulated   the activity of FVIIa on peptide and macromolecular   substrates as previously described (Neuenschwander &   Morrissey, 1994).
A few sTF mutants, Le., I152A, N199A:   R200A, failed to bind to the antibody column and were   purified by a combination of anion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography.
Alanine substitutions of   residues Serl6, Phel9, Thr60, Arg74, Tyrl03, Ser142,   Phe147, and Asp178:Asp180 resulted in very poor expression, and the mutant proteins could not be purified.
  The global conformation of a few of the mutant proteins   was compared to wild-type sTF by using CD spectroscopy.
  sTF displays an unusual far-UV CD spectrum that is only   weakly dichroic as shown in Figure 3.
A small and positive   peak of ellipticity at 230 nm, probably arising from the   aromatic chromophores, is detected.
The broad peak of   negative ellipticity centered at 217 nm commonly observed Factor VIIa Binding Site on Tissue Factor   in /?-sheet proteins (Doi & Jirgensens, 1970) is absent in   sTF.
The negative ellipticity below 200 nm is more typical   of random coil conformation than a folded protein.
Since   sTF purified from E. coli was used to determine the X-ray   structure (Harlos et al., 1994; Muller et al., 1994), we must   conclude that sTF is properly folded but the information   content of the CD spectrum is low.
The mutant sTF proteins,   as represented by the spectrum of W45F shown in Figure 3,   gave spectra similar to those of the wild-type protein,   suggesting that the mutations do not perturb the overall   conformation of the molecule.
A more detailed analysis of   the conformation by using NMR is precluded because sTF   gives broad resonances (W. Fairbrother, unpublished results)   presumably due to oligomerization at high concentration (2   mM) .
Effect of sTF Mutations on FVIIa Binding.
KD values for   binding of sTF mutants to BEGR-FVIIa were determined   as described above for the wild-type protein.
Wild-type and   mutant values were compared using data collected on the   same sensor chip because this gives less error than a   comparison of KD values measured on different sensor chips.
  Given the errors in measuring the kinetic constants for the   wild-type protein, changes in kinetic constants with mutation   must be greater than 2-fold to be considered significant.
  Affinities were compared relative to the wild-type protein   by calculating the effect of the mutation on the change in   free energy of binding   Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 33, 1995 10387   K20 1 A: D204A N199A:RZOOA T197AV198A   S195A S195AR196A Y185A El 83AN184A K181  N173A:k1% T172A   K169A T7  K165A:K166A G164R   S163A   K159A W158F  Y156L   1152A K149A:DlWA D145A   R144A   F140A   T139A R136A:N137AN138A R135A   L133A E130A:R131F D129A   K122A El8A   Q114A:E117A   N107A:QllOA   L104A:ElOSA E99A   Y94A   K68A K68A:O69A   K65A:D86A   D61A:E62A   D58E   D58A D54A:E56A   T52A F0  K48A   S47A   K46A K46A:KMA W45F   D44A S2  K41A K41 A:D44A Q37A   K28A   EP6A   W25F   E24A   122A   T21A   K20R   K20A Nl8  T17A   K15A   W14F   The estimated standard error in AAG values calculated from   data collected on one sensor chip is 0.3 kcal mol-'.

Five of the single-site mutants,   K20A, W45F, D58A, Y94A, and F140A, gave AAG values   of > 1 kcal mol-'.
Double mutants D54A:E56A and D61A:   E62A in the N-terminal domain and N107A:Q110A, S195A:   R196A, and N199A:R200A in the C-terminal domain also   gave small decreases in affinity.
Except for the S195A:   R196A mutant, these effects have not been further defined   with single-site substitutions; the S 195A mutant has no effect   on binding.
Mutants K15A, K65A:D66A, L104A:E105A,   and Y185A bind BEGR-FVIIa with an affinity 1.5-2-fold   higher than that of wild-type sTF.
  Effect of Mutations on Kinetics of sTF.FVIIa Interaction.
  Alanine substitution at only one solvent-accessible site,   K20A, resulted in a significant decrease (12.5-fold) in the   apparent association rate constant (ken) (Figure 5).
Other   substitutions effecting decreased on-rates involved mutation   of buried residues (e.g., W14F, W25F).
None of the mutants   studied here resulted in increased rates of association.
The   association curves for K20A were only poorly described by   a single kinetic component, and a much better fit was   obtained by using two phases.
Biphasic association kinetics   were not observed for any other sTF mutants.

  binding, with mechanism 5 a likely candidate.
In contrast,   the association kinetics measured for the K20R mutant could   be adequately described by a single exponential with no   change in the on-rate compared with the wild-type protein.
  These results suggest that a positively charged side chain at   residue 20 is important for orienting FVIIa as it approaches   the binding site or for maintenance of a binding competent   state of sTF.
  Substitutions of solvent-accessible residues Lys20, Ile22,   Glu24, Gln37, Asp44, Trp45, Asp58, Tyr94, Asnl07:GlnllO,   and Phel40 resulted in significant increases in the off-rate   for dissociation of sTF from immobilized FVIIa (Figure 5).
  Increases in off-rate tend to be larger than on-rate effects.
  Indeed, since the accuracy of the off-rate determinations on   the BIAcore is reduced when koff > M-', and because   some of the mutants (e.g., K41A:D44A, W45F, D58A) have   koR > M-l, the relative effects (Figure 5) on the apparent   off-rate may only represent a lower limit on the increase in   dissociation rate.
Thus, for mutants with k,dmut)/k,fr(wt)   =- 10, the AAG value may be underestimated.
  The double mutant K46A:IC48A also had an increased offrate although no effect was observed for the single mutants   K46A or K48A.
Similarly, the K41A mutant had no effect   by itself, but the double mutant K41A:D44A had a faster   off-rate than measured for the single substitution, D44A.
For   this set of mutations, the AAG of the double mutant is greater   than the sum of the AAG values measured for the single   mutants.
This result suggests that the residues cooperate in 10388 Biochemistry, Vol. 34, No. 33, 1995 Kelley et al.   0.1   l=-+-=- i   1   1 10   k(rnut)/k(wt)   FIGURE 5: Effects of sTF mutations on the kinetics of sTFWIIa   interaction reported relative to the value measured for the wildtype protein.

  binding ligand, or the double mutant has an altered conformation (Wells, 1990).
Two mutants, K65A:D66A and   W25F, had decreased off-rates.
Lys65 and Asp66 are   solvent-accessible residues, and thus the effect of alanine   substitutions for these residues may indicate that the charged   side chains make unfavorable interactions with FVIIa.
Trp25   is >90% buried, and the W25F mutation could perturb the   conformation of sTF, resulting in increased nonspecific   binding.
  EfSect of sTF Mutations on Coagulation.
The effect of   mutations on the procoagulant function of sTF was examined   by using a one-stage clotting assay.
Wild-type sTF diluted   to 500 nM in plasma gave a clotting time of 112 f 11 s   upon mixing with an equal volume of 25 mM calcium   chloride.
Addition of calcium alone gave a clotting time of   303 f 50 s. As reported by Neuenschwander and Momssey   (1992), sTF gives a longer clotting time than membranebound TF, probably as a result of the slower autoactivation   of FVII in the presence of sTF.
Increasing the concentration   of wild-type sTF above 500 nM did not result in a shorter   clotting time, suggesting that this concentration is sufficient   to rapidly saturate the FVII present in plasma.
Since the   mutations that have an effect on FVIIa binding usually   increase the dissociation rate, the time to reach equilibrium   should be shorter with the mutants than for wild-type sTF.
  For the weaker binding mutants, however, 500 nM sTF may   be insufficient to saturate the FVII present, and a prolonged   M!Am   R1361   0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5   Clotting time (mut)/Clottlng time (wt)   FIGURE 6: Relative effects of mutations on the procoagulant activity   of sTF measured with human plasma.

  clotting time will result.
Limited amounts of some of the   mutants prevented the use of higher sTF concentrations in   the coagulation assay.
In addition, this assay displayed some   batch-to-batch variation and is presumably sensitive to   differences in the salt, pH, or contaminant level of the sTF   preparation.
Therefore, only clotting times increased by at   least 1.5-fold from wild type are considered to be significant.
  Given the clotting time measured for addition of calcium   alone (2.7-fold longer than wild-type sTF), the range of the   assay for measuring defects in cofactor function is quite   limited.
  The clotting times measured for 500 nM sTF mutants in   plasma are shown relative to wild-type sTF in Figure 6.
As   was expected, mutants having large reductions in affinity   for FVIIa-K20A, K20R, D44A, W45F, D58A, D58E,
  Y94A-gave prolonged clotting times.
An additional set of   mutations, E99A, L104A:E105A, W158F, K159A, S163A,   G164R, K165A:K166A, and Y185A, did not weaken FVIIa   binding but are observed to have prolonged clotting times.
  Addition of 10 nM FVIIa to the citrated plasma reduced the   clotting times measured for this set of mutants and also for   wild-type sTF by about 3-fold (data not shown).
Since these   mutants gave longer clotting times than wild-type sTF even   in the presence of activated enzyme, these mutants cannot   be solely defective in FVII autoactivation but must also be   impaired for FXa generation.
A few sTF mutants appear to   have shorter clotting times than the wild-type protein, but it   is unclear whether this reflects improved cofactor function   or the purity level of the mutant.

  DISCUSSION   We have described here a detailed study of the FVIIa   binding site on human sTF.
A majority of the solventaccessible residues, and almost all of the residues neighboring sites with AAG > 1 kcal mol-I, have been mutated.
Our   results using direct binding methods confirm those of others   (Ruf et al., 1994; Schullek et al., 1994; Gibbs et al., 1994)   showing that Lys20, Trp45, Asp58, and Phel40 make   important contributions to FVIIa binding.
In addition, we   identify Tyr94 as an important residue for FVIIa binding.
  In contrast to Gibbs et al. (1994), we find that the V207A   mutation has no effect on FVIIa binding or cofactor function.
  These other studies measured changes in TF-FVIIa affinity   by assay of the TF stimulation of FVIIa enzymatic activity.
  It is difficult to compare our results with those of Ruf et al.   (1994) because these authors produced TF mutants in fulllength form and assayed FVIIa affkty by measurements of   factor X activation using detergent-solubilized TF.
The AAG   values we measure tend to be smaller than those calculated   from the data of Schullek et al. (1994) and Gibbs et al. (1994)   for sTF binding to FVIIa.
This difference could reflect the   presence of substrate in the amidolytic assays.
Indeed, the   data of Butenas et al. (1994) suggest that the KD determined   for TF-FVIIa in an amidolytic assay is somewhat dependent   on the substrate used.
Our data obtained in the absence of   substrate suggest that Ile22 and Arg135 make less important   contributions to binding than described previously.
  Structure of the FVIla Binding Site on sTF.
As shown in   Figure 7, residues implicated in FWa binding form a convex   surface extending from Tyr94 of the N-terminal domain into   the domain-domain interface.
The putative FVIIa binding   site is centered on the B (LyDO), C' (Asp58). and E (Trp45)   strands of the N-terminal domain, but FVIIa also contacts   residues from the C-terminal domain (AsnlO7 or GlnllO,   Arg135, Phel40) at the domain-domain interface.
Both the   ACp value and mutagenesis results are consistent with a large   contact surface on sTF for binding FVIIa.
Given that the   molecular weight of FVIIa is about twice that of sTF, an   extended binding site is not unreasonable.
The total accessible surface of TF residues with IAAGl > 0.3 kcal mol-l   is large (>2000 A*).
Although it is unlikely that all of the   accessible surface of these residues will become buried upon   binding to FVIIa, other residues may become buried without   actively contributing to the AG of binding.
For example,   Leu133 lies between Lys20 and Phel40 and is likely to   become buried on binding FVIIa, and yet the L133A mutant   has negligible AAG.
Some residues that contact ligand may   make favorable contributions to AH but not to AG because   of a compensating unfavorable AS (Novotny et al., 1989;   Kelley & OConnell, 1993).
  Solvent-accessibility calculations4 indicate that Trpl4,   Serl6, Phel9, Thr21, Trp25, Thr60, Glu62, Tyr103, Phe147,   Tyr185, and Arg196 are each '90% buried, and thus any   effects from mutation of these residues are likely to result   from changes in the protein conformation.
Mutation of   Thr21 and Glu62 was tolerated with little impact on ligand   binding whereas the sTF mutants W14F, S16A, F19A,   W25F, T60A.
Y103A. and F147A were expressed very   poorly in E. coli.
Trp25 is conserved in all tibronectin type   Solvent accessibilities were calculated from the 1.1 8, structure of   sTF (Muller et al., unpublished results) by using the method of Lee   and Richards (1971) with a 1.4 8, radius probe.
The fraction buried was calculated using a reference tripeptide and includes side-chain and   main-chain contributions.

  I11 domains (Bazan, 1990) and is presumed to play an   important structural role.
Arg196 is buried in the interface   between the two domains and the side chain is hydrogen   bonded to backbone atoms of residues 103, 104, 106, and   199.
The side chains of Phel9, Tyrl03, and Phe147 pack   together to form an aromatic cluster at the interface between   the two domains.
Asnl8, Leul04, Glu105, Asnl07, and   Asn199, although less than 90% buried, contribute to the   accessible surface area buried in the interface between the   two domains.
Effects on FVIIa binding or cofactor function   from mutations of these residues could reflect a change in   the relative orientation of the two domains.
  Adding together all of the AAG values determined for   residues that are <90% buried yields slightly more free   energy (14.5 kcal mol-!) than determined for wild-type sTF   binding to FVIIa (AG = -11.3 kcal mol-).5 Most of this   binding free energy is provided by contacts with residues   from the N-terminal domain.
With the exception of Asp44,   all of the key residues for FVIIa binding reside on B-strands   (Muller et al., 1994; Figure 8).
Lys20 and Asp58 are   contained on adjacent antiparallel @rands formed from   discontiguous polypeptide segments.
The critical importance   of Lys20 and Asp58 for binding to FVIIa is supported by   the observation of decreased binding for the conservative   Arg and Glu replacements at these sites, respectively.
Thr   60 appears to play an important role in maintenance of this   conformation.
The Oy of TM0 makes hydrogen bonds to   the side chain of Asp58 and also to the backbone of the E   strand (Figure 8).
Substitution with alanine would be   expected to disrupt the conformation of this region, consistent   with the failure of the T60A mutant to express in E. coli.

md an) Lunmbution from the backbone   ur S carbon IS ignored   A comparison with members of the cytokine receptor   family suggests that Trp45 of sTF is not a contact residue   for FVIIa binding.
Trp45 has a fraction buried of 0.71 and   the side chain packs against the side chains of Gln37 and   Arg74 and also against the backbone of the C and F strands.
  A Trp is found at the same sequence position in the INF-a,   INl-y, and IL-2 receptors (Bazan, 1990) and at a structurally   equivalent position in the hGH receptor (DeVos et al., 1992).
  Trp45 is probably important for maintaining the fibronectin   type III fold, and the W45F mutation could influence the   contribution to binding from nearby residues Gln37, Asp44,   Lys46, and Lys48.
  Thennodynamics of the sTF-FVIIa Interaction.
The large   and negative ACp value associated with binding suggests that   burial of nonpolar surface provides a large driving force for   the interaction; however, the unfavorable AS is inconsistent   with the hydrophobic effect (Kauzmanu, 1959; Tanford,   1980).
As noted by Sturtevant (1977), this discrepancy could   be accounted for by a stiffening of vibrational modes upon   binding which will contribute negative values to AH, AS,   and ACp By using this model, the hydrophobic portion of   AC, is calculated to be -540 cal mol-l K-, which suggests   that about 1600 A2 of nonpolar surface area becomes buried   upon binding (Livingstone et al., 1991).
Fixing vibrational   modes would provide a favorable AH of -30 kcal mol-l   but a negative AS that opposes the positive AS from the   hydrophobic effect.
Alternatively, the unfavorable AS could   be the result of conformational change concomitant with   binding as previously proposed on the basis of results of   hydrodynamic measurements (Waxman et al., 1993).
  In contrast to the expectation based on the AC, value,   many of the mutations that have an impact on FVIIa binding   involve changes in charged or polar residues.
For most of   the residues mutated, however, we do not know whether the   polar or nonpolar parts of the side chain are important for   binding.
We conclude that the driving force for sTF-FVIIa   binding is burial of a large amount of nonpolar surface area.
  Single-site alanine substitutions probably result in only small   changes in the amount of nonpolar surface available for   binding.
Within this desolvated binding interface, charged   01 polar groups on sTF are necessary to complement residues   on FVIIa through hydrogen-bonding or ionic interactions.
  A positively charged residue at position 20 seems to be   important in determining the on-rate for FVIIa binding.
The   C strand appears to supply a positive charge for binding,   either from Lys46 or Lys48, since the AAG effect of single   mutants K46A or K48A is small but the double mutant   K46AK48A has a AAG of 1.2 kcal mol-I. Mutations of   some charged residues, i.e., K15A, K65A:D66A, E105A,   may improve binding because the polar interactions at these   sites are not as well satisfied in the complex as in the   unbound state.
Individually, polar interactions contribute   little to AG because the bonding can be satisfied by water   in the free components.
Collectively, the polar interactions   may determine specificity by preventing binding to the   incorrect hydrophobic surface.
  Comparison to Other Studies of Protein-Protein Interaction.
On the basis of a homology-modeled structure of sTF,   Gibbs et al. (1994) concluded that sTF conserved the mode   of ligand binding observed for the hGH receptor (DeVos et   al., 1992).
The crystal structure of sTF, however, shows   that the FVIIa binding site is located on the opposite side of   the cytokine receptor fold relative to the hGH binding site Factor VIIa Binding Site on Tissue Factor   on the hGH receptor (Muller et al., 1994).
Most of the   residues important for binding hGH in both the hGH receptor   (DeVos et al., 1992) and the prolactin receptor (Somers et   al., 1994) are provided by loop regions whereas P-strand   residues in sTF are used to bind FVIIa.
Residues of the AB   loop in the N-terminal domain of both the hGH and prolactin   receptors are important for hormone binding; in sTF these   residues (17-19) are buried in the domain-domain interface.
  As with similar studies of antibody-antigen (Jin et al.,   1992; Kelley & OConnell, 1993) and hormone-receptor   (Cunningham & Wells, 1993; Clackson & Wells, 1995)   interaction, a few residues make a dominant contribution to   the free energy of binding.
Lys20, Trp45, Asp58, Tyr94,   and Phel40 together account for 70% of the AG of binding.
  Similarly, most of the changes in affinity result from   increases in the rate of dissociation.
Protein-protein association has been proposed to involve a diffusive-entrapment   mechanism (Northrup & Erickson, 1992), and single point   mutations may not have a large effect on the association step   of this mechanism.
Stabilization of the protein-protein   complex requires precise docking of the two surfaces, and   thus defects in this process could be manifested as increased   dissociation rates.
  The magnitude of the AAG values observed for the key   residues of the FVIIa binding site on sTF are smaller than   the changes measured for mutants of the growth hormone   receptor (Clackson & Wells, 1995) or the anti-~l85~~~~   antibody (Kelley & OConnell, 1993).
In these systems key   residues for ligand binding are contributed by loop regions   of the protein.
Substitutions in loop regions may result in   larger local conformational changes than replacements of   residues presented on a more rigid, hydrogen-bonded scaffold.
In addition, the FVIIa binding site on sTF is more   extended than the ligand binding sites in these other systems.
  Within this extended binding site, the energetic importance   of individual contacts is smaller than in the more compact   binding sites.
In both the hGH receptor and the anti-~l85~~~~   antibody the largest AAG effects are for replacement of   hydrophobic residues.
In contrast, mutation of two charged   residues in sTF, Lys20 and Asp58, have the greatest impact   on FVIIa binding.
  Effects of Mutations on the Procoagulant Function of sTF.
  A set of residues that are less than 90% buried, and do not   contribute to the interface between the two domains (Glu99,   Trp158, Lys159, Ser163, Gly164, Lys165, Lys166), have a   role in the coagulant function of sTF but are not involved in   FVIIa binding.
These residues, excluding Glu99, are contained in the C-terminal domain and are found on the   opposite surface of the molecule from the putative FVIIa   binding site.
Residues from the 157-174 segment of TF   had previously been shown to be important for factor X   activation by the TF-FVIIa complex (Ruf et al., 1992b).
  Lys165 and Lys166 have been implicated in macromolecular   substrate recognition (Roy et al., 1991) and have been   proposed to have a role in substrate (FX) binding (Ruf et   al., 1992a).
Alanine substitution of Tyr185, a buried residue,   also results in a large decrease in the procoagulant function   of sTF.
The side chain of Tyr185 contacts both Lys159 and   Lys166 and thus is probably important for supporting the   conformation of this region.
Further work is required to   determine whether the C-terminal domain provides a secondary substrate binding site or functions indirectly to maintain   FVIIa in a catalytically active conformation.
