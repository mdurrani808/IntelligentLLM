Identification of an Anchor Residue for CheA-CheY Interactions  in the Chemotaxis System of Escherichia coli  Hemang Thakor, Sarah Nicholas, Ian M. Porter, Nicole Hand, and Richard C. Stewart*  Department of Cell Biology & Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742  Received 29 March 2011/Accepted 26 May 2011  Transfer of a phosphoryl group from autophosphorylated CheA (P-CheA) to CheY is an important step in  the bacterial chemotaxis signal transduction pathway.
This reaction involves CheY (i) binding to the P2  domain of P-CheA and then (ii) acquiring the phosphoryl group from the P1 domain.
Crystal structures  indicated numerous side chain interactions at the CheY-P2 binding interface.
To investigate the individual  contributions of the P2 side chains involved in these contacts, we analyzed the effects of eight alanine  substitution mutations on CheA-CheY binding interactions.
An F214A substitution in P2 caused 1,000-fold  reduction in CheA-CheY binding affinity, while Ala substitutions at other P2 positions had small effects  (E171A, E178A, and I216A) or no detectable effects (H181A, D202A, D207A, and C213A) on binding affinity.
  These results are discussed in relation to previous in silico predictions of hot-spot and anchor positions at the  CheA-CheY interface.
We also investigated the consequences of these mutations for chemotaxis signal transduction in living cells.
CheA(F214A) was defective in mediating localization of CheY-YFP to the large clusters  of signaling proteins that form at the poles of Escherichia coli cells, while the other CheA variants did not differ  from wild-type (wt) CheA (CheAwt) in this regard.
In our set of mutants, only CheA(F214A) exhibited a  markedly diminished ability to support chemotaxis in motility agar assays.
Surprisingly, however, in FRET  assays that monitored receptor-regulated production of phospho-CheY, CheA(F214A) (and each of the other  Ala substitution mutants) performed just as well as CheAwt.
Overall, our findings indicate that F214 serves as  an anchor residue at the CheA-CheY interface and makes an important contribution to the binding energy in  vitro and in vivo; however, loss of this contribution does not have a large negative effect on the overall ability  of the signaling pathway to modulate P-CheY levels in response to chemoattractants.
  Chemotaxis in Escherichia coli and numerous other bacterial  species involves regulation of the level of phosphorylated  CheY (P-CheY) in response to spatial gradients of beneficial  and harmful chemicals.
P-CheY plays a crucial role in chemotaxis by enabling cells to control how frequently they change  directions as they swim (2, 48, 58, 63).
The level of P-CheY in  a cell reflects the relative rates of phosphorylation (mediated  by CheA) and dephosphorylation (mediated by CheZ) (15,  46).
CheA functions as an autokinase, and this activity is regulated by membrane-spanning receptor proteins responsible  for binding chemical ligands that serve as attractants or repellents (7, 16).
Autophosphorylated CheA (P-CheA) serves as a  phosphodonor for CheY, and the P-CheY generated by this  interaction can bind to the switch component of the flagellar  motor, inducing changes in cell swimming direction by promoting changes in the direction of flagellar rotation (41, 65, 66).
  This sequence of events provides a signal transduction pathway  that allows the chemotaxis receptor proteins to regulate cell  swimming pattern in response to the concentrations of attractants and repellents.
This regulation takes place rapidly, as  indicated by the ability of cells to respond to chemostimuli  within 50 to 200 milliseconds (5, 22, 51).
  CheA autophosphorylation results in covalent attachment of  a phosphoryl group (OPO32), donated by ATP, to imidazole  N of the CheA H48 side chain (72).
During the CheA 3  CheY phosphotransfer reaction, CheY catalyzes the transfer  of this phosphoryl group to its D57 side chain (42).
This reaction is rapid (kcat, 800 s1 at 25C) and involves CheY interacting with two distinct domains of CheA, P1 and P2 (Fig. 1)  (53, 54).
P2 provides a docking site for rapid binding and  dissociation of CheY (55).
P2 is connected to P1 by a flexible  linker, and so binding of CheY to P2 is thought to enhance the  rate of phosphotransfer by tethering CheY in close proximity  to the P1 phospho-histidine (73).
In previous work, we demonstrated that genetic excision of the P2 domain from CheA  dramatically slows the kinetics of CheA 3 CheY phosphotransfer in vitro and that this has a detrimental effect on the  chemotaxis ability of cells (54).
In addition, we demonstrated  that binding of CheY to P2 of CheA is very rapid, reflecting, in  part, favorable electrostatic interactions (55).
  Here we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to identify P2  residues that make important contributions to its binding interface with CheY and to assess whether loss of these contributions affects phosphotransfer kinetics and the overall abilities of the chemotaxis signaling pathway.
We chose mutation  sites based on the crystal structures of the E. coli CheY-P2  complex (33, 64) and targeted residues that appeared to mediate protein-protein contacts.
The locations of these sites are  shown in the three-dimensional structure of the P2-CheY  complex (Fig. 1B).

  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains and plasmids.
E. coli strain NH1 was constructed by introducing an in-frame deletion of cheYZ coding sequences into cheA strain  RP9535 (30) in accordance with the procedure of Datsenko and Wanner (12).
  Selection for plasmids was accomplished using ampicillin (100 g ml1  ), chloramphenicol (40 g ml1  ), or kanamycin (50 g ml1  ).
Translational fusions  cheY-eyfp and cheZ-ecfp were constructed as described previously (50), except  that the eyfp and ecfp coding sequences each carried an A206K mutation to  minimize direct interaction of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) via dimerization (70).
Each fusion included a four-glycine  flexible linker connecting the Che protein and the fluorescent protein.
cheY-eyfp  and cheZ-ecfp were ligated into plasmid pKG116 (9) downstream of the nahG  promoter using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, generating pHK5.
The parental plasmid provided the Shine-Dalgarno sequence for cheY-eyfp, and the cheYcheZ intergenic sequence provided the ribosome binding site for cheZ-ecfp.
This  plasmid also included coding sequences for the positive regulator NahR, and so  expression of the cheY-eyfp and cheZ-ecfp fusions was induced by adding sodium  salicylate to the growth medium (1, 69).
Expression of cheA alleles carried on  pAH1-derived plasmids (17) was accomplished using IPTG (isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside; 5 M for chemotaxis assays and 1 mM for overexpression to  generate cell extracts for protein purification).
Site-directed mutations were  introduced into cheA by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the  GeneTailor kit from Invitrogen and oligonucleotides synthesized by Invitrogen.
  Mutant cheA alleles were moved into expression plasmid pAH1 using convenient  restriction sites (NdeI and EcoRI for most mutations).
This plasmid provided  coding sequences for an N-terminal His6 affinity tag that was used for CheA  purification.
For expression of the P2 domain of wild-type (wt) CheA (CheAwt)  and mutant CheA proteins, the coding sequences for residues 159 to 227 were  PCR amplified and ligated into T7-expression system pET28a and the His6-P2  domains were expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 host cells (55).
  Protein expression and purification.
CheY, CheA, and the P2 domain of  CheA were purified from overproducing E. coli cells in accordance with published procedures (26, 55).
His6-CheY-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein  (EYFP)-FLAG was purified by tandem affinity purification (Ni-nitrilotriacetic  acid [NTA] followed by a FLAG antibody column).
Protein concentrations were  determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as  the standard.
CheY(M17C) was labeled with Badan as reported previously (56).
  Expression levels of CheY-EYFP directed by plasmid pHK5 were determined  for cells grown in tryptone broth containing a range of salicylate concentrations.
  This involved recording fluorescence emission spectra from cell lysates and  comparing the emission intensities to that of a solution of His6-CheY-EYFPFLAG (at a known concentration) as described previously (21).
  Motility agar assays.
Aliquots (2 l) of freshly grown saturated overnight  cultures were used to inoculate motility agar plates (0.3% Bacto agar, 1%  tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, 100 g ml1 ampicillin, and 40 g ml1 chloramphenicol  [for some experiments]).
Plates were then incubated at 32C, and swarm colony  diameters were measured to allow calculation of the colony expansion rate (67).
  Each plate included a wild-type control (RP9535/pAH1cheAwt), and this allowed  us to express the rates supported by each mutant CheA protein, normalized to  that observed with CheAwt under identical conditions (47).
  FRET assays.
The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) procedure  was based on that described by Sourjik and Berg (51).
Cells carrying two compatible plasmids (pAH1cheA and pHK5) were grown in tryptone broth (1%  tryptone, 0.5% NaCl) containing ampicillin, chloramphenicol, salicylate (1 to 5  M), and IPTG (5 M) until they reached mid-log phase.
These cells were then  harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 5,000 rpm), washed twice, and resuspended in motility buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 M  L-methionine, and 100 mM sodium lactate, pH 7) at a final A600 of 0.4 and stored  at 4C until used (within 4 h).
To initiate an assay, 3 ml of cell suspension was  added to a standard 1-cm by 1-cm fluorescence cuvette equipped with a stir bar.

193, 2011 MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CheA-CheY BINDING INTERFACE 3895   on April 28, 2015 by NYU MEDICAL CENTER LIBRARY http://jb.asm.org/ Downloaded from This was then placed in a standard spectrofluorometer (PTI QuantaMaster) with  the following settings: excitation wavelength (excitation), 425 nm (slits, 2 nm);  emission wavelength (emission), 526 nm (slits, 2 nm); temperature (T), 25C  (maintained in a Peltier temperature-regulated cuvette holder); integration time,  1 s. The emission signal was then monitored for 2,000 s before the cells were  subjected to any chemotaxis stimuli.
During this long interval, the emission signal  climbed asymptotically, eventually reaching a plateau that was stable for 2 h.  The signal increase during the initial 2,000-s interval could reflect folding/maturation of the EYFP/enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) fluorophores  (44) as well as response of the cells to the excitation light (68).
Attempts to  reduce the duration of this interval were unsuccessful and included vigorously  aerating the cell suspensions prior to observation, adding inhibitors to block  transcription and translation, and stirring the cell suspensions in the dark.
Once  the EYFP emission signal had reached a plateau, we monitored its response to  successive additions of a chemoattractant (additions made using 2- to 10-l  additions of concentrated stock solutions using a P10 micropipetter).
The cell  samples were stirred continuously during these experiments; control experiments  with fluorescent dyes indicated that the time required to achieve uniform mixing  following an addition was less than 5 s. Attempts to detect FRET responses to  repellent stimuli using this protocol gave inconsistent results: small FRET signal  increases were observed often but not always.
Attempts to uncover the underlying cause of this variability were unsuccessful.
  Fluorescence microscopy.
The images shown in Fig. 5 were recorded by a  DS-QiMc charge-coupled device (CCD) camera mounted on a Nikon 80i microscope and using a 100 oil immersion objective, a C-FL YFP HC HISN filter  cube (excitation, 490 to 510 nm; dichroic mirror [Dm] 515LP; emission, 520 to 550  nm), an ET CFP filter cube (excitation, 426 to 446 nm; Dm, 455LP; emission, 460  to 500 nm), and NIS Elements software.
Cells were grown and washed as  described above for FRET assays and then placed on a thin bed of 1% agarose  and observed at room temperature.
  Binding assays.
Fluorescence-monitored binding titrations were used to define  the binding affinities of wild-type and mutant CheA proteins for BadanCheY(M17C) and the affinities of P2 (wild type and mutant) for CheY as  described previously (55, 56).
Protein samples were in TNKGDG buffer (50 mM  Tris, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 25 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol [DTT],  10% glycerol, adjusted to pH 7.0 using HCl).
CheY samples were placed in a 10-  by 10-mm or 10- by 4-mm cuvettes equipped with a magnetic stir bar and  maintained at 8C.
To these samples, small volumes (1 to 10 l) of concentrated  CheA solutions were added, and emission spectra were recorded after each  addition.
Integrated emission signals (13) were analyzed using the least-squares  fitting algorithm in DynaFit (25) (assuming a simple one-site binding model).
  Prior to analysis, results were corrected for the effects of dilution and for a small  background fluorescence arising from the CheA/P2 samples.
  Rapid-reaction experiments and analysis.
Kinetics of phosphotransfer from  P-CheA to CheY were monitored by following the decrease in intrinsic fluorescence of CheY resulting from its phosphorylation as detailed in previous work  (38).
CheY was mixed with P-CheA in a KinTek SF2004 stopped-flow spectrofluorometer (dead time, 2.5 milliseconds, using the Massey test reaction [8] at  8C in buffer containing 10% glycerol to match our experimental conditions).
  excitation was set at 290 nm using a monochromator (4-nm band pass filter), and  emission intensity was detected by a photomultiplier tube after passage through  a 320-nm long-pass filter (WG320).
Results for time courses from 10 consecutive  shots (1,000 data points each) were averaged and then analyzed using the instrument software program.
These experiments were performed under pseudofirst-order conditions ([CheY] at 8 [P-CheA] to simplify analysis) and at low  temperature (8C, maintained using a circulating water bath) to minimize the  fraction of the reaction time course taking place in the instrument dead time.
  Computer simulations.
We used two approaches for modeling the effects of  the F214A mutation on the chemotaxis signaling network of E. coli.
Some  simulations were carried out using KinTek Global Kinetic Explorer (20).
This  program assigned a set of differential equations to represent the following simple  reaction scheme:  CheA Oh  kA  P-CheA Oh  kphos   CheA  CheY P-CheY Oh  kZ  CheY  We input rate constants tabulated by Vladimirov et al. (61, 62) [modified kphos  for CheA(F214A) simulations], and we input the Che protein concentrations  determined by Li and Hazelbauer (28).
These represent average intracellular  concentrations of the Che proteins in E. coli strain RP437.
For example, the  estimated average intracellular concentration of CheY is 10 M. However, it is  worth noting that there is significant cell-to-cell variability within a population of  genetically identical cells, such that it may be more realistic to consider a typical  cell to harbor anywhere from 3 to 17 M CheY (23).
With the use of the kphos  value estimated above for CheAwt, these CheY levels would enable CheA 3  CheY phosphotransfer to proceed with an observed rate constant of 200 to 500  s  1  .
For cells utilizing CheA(F214A), the kinetics of this step would be slower:  30 to 70 s1  .
These KinTek Global Kinetic Explorer simulations calculated the  steady-state levels of P-CheY and the kinetics for adjusting these levels in  response to attractant stimuli.
  Additional simulations used RapidCell (62), obtained from Nikita Vladimirovs website (http://www.rapidcell.vladimirov.de/).
We used the default settings  to calculate the P-CheY levels in wild-type cells exposed to a stepwise addition  of 30 M methyl-aspartate (attractant stimulus) and then removal of this attractant.
Then, we modified the program to reflect the reduced phosphotransfer  kinetics of CheA(F214A) and repeated the time course simulation to generate  the output of Fig. 8.
  RESULTS  Effects of Ala substitutions on CheA-CheY binding affinity.
  We engineered alanine substitutions at each of the P2 residues  that had been identified in previous work as CheY contact  points in the P2-CheY crystal structures generated by McEvoy  et al. (33) and Welch et al. (64).
We then purified each mutant  version of CheA and measured the affinity of its binding interaction with Badan-labeled CheY [CheYbd is CheY(M17C) to  which the fluorescent reporter molecule Badan had been covalently attached (56)].
This modification of CheY allowed us  to monitor binding by following the enhanced emission signal  of the environmentally sensitive Badan fluorophore (dimethylaminonapthlalene).
For titrations of CheYbd with CheAwt, an  increase of 40% in the integrated emission signal was observed at saturating CheA concentrations.
The eight Ala substitution versions of CheA exhibited similar abilities to enhance the fluorescence emission signal of CheYbd, and analysis  of binding titrations (Fig. 2 and results not shown) allowed us  to define the dissociation constant (Kd) for each version of  CheA (Table 1).
This analysis indicated that the F214A substitution caused a large decrease in binding affinity (400-fold  increase in Kd), three mutations (E171A, E178A, and I216A)  had small effects (2- to 3-fold increases in Kd), and the remaining four mutations (H181A, D202A, D207A, and C213A) had  no significant effect on the affinity of CheA for CheY.  The low affinity of the CheA(F214A)-CheY binding interaction made it impossible to approach saturation in titration  experiments, and this limited the accuracy of the estimated  binding affinity.
In the experiment summarized in Fig. 2A (inset), for example, the highest CheA concentration that we  could generate without excessive dilution of the Badan-CheY  was only 25% of the Kd.
To extend the binding curve to  higher CheA concentrations, we utilized the isolated P2 domain of CheA, which can be concentrated more extensively  than full-length CheA. We analyzed binding of P2(F214A) and  P2wt (Fig. 2B) by following the decrease in CheY intrinsic  fluorescence, as described previously (45, 57).
This analysis  indicated a Kd of 120   20 M for P2(F214A), compared to a  Kd of 0.09   0.01 M for P2wt.
These experiments with the  isolated P2 domain confirmed our conclusion that F214 makes  an important contribution to the binding energy of the CheACheY complex and indicated a value for G (the binding  energy observed with the mutant protein minus the binding  energy observed with the wild-type protein) (14) of 4 kcal/  mole for the F214A substitution.

  Effect of F214A on CheA-CheY phosphotransfer kinetics.
  Because CheA(F214A) binds CheY so weakly, we anticipated  that phosphotransfer from P-CheA(F214A) to CheY would be  considerably slower than CheY phosphorylation by P-CheAwt.
  To test this prediction, we used stopped-flow fluorescence experiments as described in previous work (32): the rapid decrease in fluorescence following mixing of P-CheA with CheY  reflects decreased emission signal from CheY residue W58 as  the protein becomes phosphorylated (on D57).
Our results  (Fig. 4) indicated that the CheA-CheY phosphotransfer kinetics are indeed markedly slower with CheA(F214A) than with  CheAwt (15-fold slower at 8C and 10-fold slower at 25C  [results not shown]).
However, the observed 10-fold difference  is somewhat less than one would predict, considering the 1,000-  fold weaker binding affinity of CheA(F214A).
Under these  conditions, the minimal reaction describing the phosphotransfer reaction is P-CheA   CheY  P-CheA-CheY h CheA    P-CheY, with rate constants k1 (10 M1 s  1  ) and k1 (20  s  1  ) for the forward and reverse steps of the binding reaction,  and k2 (250 s1  ) is the rate constant for phosphotransfer within  the P-CheA-CheY complex (rate constants given here are for  CheAwt at 8C and are based on previous work [55, 56]).
With  CheAwt, these rate constants predict a Km of 27 M for the  phosphotransfer reaction.
For a reaction involving 5 M  CheY, one would predict phosphotransfer to take place with a  kobserved value of 46 s1  , which matches the CheAwt results  shown in Fig. 4.
For CheA(F214A), the diminished binding  affinity could indicate a 1,000-fold decrease in k1 or a 1,000-  fold increase in k1, either of which would cause a significant  increase in Km, resulting in a value of 25,000 M or 2,000 M,  respectively.
For the experiment represented in Fig. 4, these  values lead to a predicted kobserved of 0.05 s1 or 0.625 s1  ,  respectively, which are significantly lower than the experimentally observed value (3 s1  ).
This difference may provide some  insight into the mechanisms of the CheA(F214A) 3 CheY  phosphotransfer reaction (considered in Discussion).
  Effects of F214A on polar localization of CheY-YFP in E.  coli.
The chemotaxis signaling proteins of E. coli form large  clusters in which tens of thousands of receptor proteins gather  in assemblies that also include most of the cells CheA, CheY,  CheZ, CheW, CheR, and CheB (31, 48, 50).
These large  (200-nm), multiprotein assemblies are usually located at one  or both poles of the cell (49, 71).
Each cluster functions as a  complex, highly cooperative signal processing unit, generating  P-CheY that then dissociates from the cluster and diffuses to  the flagellar motors, which are distributed at various locations  TABLE 1.

193, 2011 MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CheA-CheY BINDING INTERFACE 3897   on April 28, 2015 by NYU MEDICAL CENTER LIBRARY http://jb.asm.org/ Downloaded from around the circumference of the cell (11, 48).
These signal  clusters are readily observed by fluorescence microscopy when  GFP-tagged versions of the Che proteins are expressed in cells  (50).
We used CheY-EYFP and CheZ-ECFP to examine  whether our CheA alanine substitutions affected formation of  signal clusters or recruitment of CheY/CheZ into the clusters.
  Our results (Fig. 5 and additional results not shown) indicated  that CheA(F214A) is defective in recruiting CheY-EYFP into  the signal clusters, but the other CheA variants are not.
We  also observed that localization of CheZ-ECFP is not affected  by F214A or any of the other mutations in P2.
These results  suggest that, in these experiments, the primary docking site for  CheY in signal clusters is the P2 module of CheA. Previous  work (60) had indicated that both CheZ and CheA can recruit  CheY to the signal clusters but that CheZ-CheY interaction is  primarily responsible for CheY recruitment in wild-type cells,  while CheA-CheY interaction is responsible for CheY recruitment in the absence of CheZ. In view of those observations, it  seems unlikely that F214A could cause defects in CheY-EYFP  localization in a CheZ-replete cell.
Therefore, it seems likely  that our expression plasmid for CheY-EYFP and CheZ-ECFP  generated CheZ-ECFP levels that were lower than the CheZ  level in wild-type cells and that this created a situation that  made it possible to visualize the effect of the F214A mutation.
  Effects of Ala substitutions on chemotaxis ability of cells.
  We investigated the ability of all eight mutant versions of  CheA (expressed using plasmid pAH1cheA) to support chemotaxis when expressed in cheA cells growing in motility  agar.
We included in this analysis an additional mutant protein  (CheAP2) that lacked the entire P2 domain (19).
These results (Table 2) indicate that CheA(F214A) is less effective than  CheAwt, but the severity of this phenotype is not as extreme as  that observed for CheAP2.
The remaining Ala substitution  mutants support chemotaxis ability comparable to that observed with CheAwt.
  We also used motility agar assays to investigate the effect of  the F214A substitution when cells expressed cheY and cheZ at  suboptimal levels.
The underlying rationale here was that we  could decrease CheY levels to a point where CheA 3 CheY  phosphotransfer became rate limiting for the overall signaling  pathway and that this would allow us to visualize more effectively the effects of a mutation affecting CheA-CheY interactions.
For these experiments, two compatible plasmids were  introduced into cheA cheYZ E. coli host cells: plasmid  pAH1cheA expressed wt cheA or cheA(F214A) under the control of the lac promoter/operator, and plasmid pHK5 expressed cheY-eyfp and cheZ-ecfp under the control of a salicylate-inducible promoter (using CheY-YFP and CheZ-CFP in  FIG.

For these experiments, cheA  expression was held constant (using 5 M IPTG), and expression of cheY-eyfp and cheZ-ecfp was varied using a range of  salicylate concentrations that resulted in CheY-EYFP protein  levels ranging from 10 to 500% of the levels of CheY found in  wild type E. coli (quantitation explained in Materials and  Methods).
The results of these experiments (Fig. 6) indicated  that CheA(F214A) has a more severe defect when the levels of  CheY (and CheZ) are lower than their wild-type levels.
To  illustrate this point, it is useful to compare the CheA-dependent swarm rate (the observed expansion rate for the swarm  edge minus the background colony expansion rate in the  absence of any CheA [1.1 mm/h]).
At 10 M CheY (the approximate CheY concentration in wild-type E. coli), the CheAdependent swarm rate with CheAwt is approximately 3-times  that observed with CheA(F214A).
At 5 M CheY, this comparison indicates a 6-fold difference between CheAwt and  CheA(F214A).
  Graphical analysis of the relationship between chemotaxis  (swarm plate) ability and cheYZ expression level revealed a  sigmoidal dependence (Fig. 6) in which the CheY level required for half-maximal activity was almost 2-fold higher for  the CheA(F214A) mutant than for CheAwt.
This result supports the overall conclusion that the decreased chemotaxis  ability observed for CheA(F214A) cells in swarm plates involves diminished CheY-CheA interactions and that this deFIG. 5.

193, 2011 MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CheA-CheY BINDING INTERFACE 3899   on April 28, 2015 by NYU MEDICAL CENTER LIBRARY http://jb.asm.org/ Downloaded from fect causes a more extreme phenotype when intracellular  CheY levels are lower than normal.
It is unlikely that the  decreased chemotaxis ability of CheA(F214A) results from any  effect on CheA autokinase activity, as we observed normal  autophosphorylation kinetics with purified CheA(F214A) (results not shown), and previous work demonstrated that completely eliminating the P2 domain does not have an adverse  effect on CheA autophosphorylation (22).
  Effects of Ala substitutions on in vivo signaling monitored  using FRET assays.
We adapted the FRET assay developed by  Sourjik and Berg (51, 52) to monitor regulation of CheY phosphorylation levels in living E. coli cells.
This assay utilizes  CheY fused to EYFP and CheZ fused to ECFP.
When phosphorylated, CheY-EYFP binds tightly to CheZ-ECFP, and this  interaction generates a FRET signal.
When CheY-YFP is dephosphorylated, the CheY-EYFPCheZ-ECFP complex dissociates (because the affinity of CheZ for CheY is diminished),  and the FRET signal disappears.
This signal can be used to  monitor changes in CheY phosphorylation levels taking place  in cells when they are exposed to chemoattractants and repellents.
Although this assay was initially developed using cells  attached to microscope slides, we adapted it to monitor the  FRET signal generated by cell suspensions maintained in standard fluorescence cuvettes and monitored using a standard  steady-state spectrofluorometer (Fig. 7).
In the absence of  CheA, there is no observable modulation of CheY phosphorylation (FRET signal) when cells are exposed to chemotaxis  stimuli, as expected.
When expressed at wild-type levels using  a regulated expression plasmid, CheAwt restored signaling ability to a cheA strain.
Using this assay, we examined the abilities of CheAwt and our Ala substitution versions of CheA to  mediate regulation of CheY phosphorylation in response to  successive additions of chemoattractant ranging from 0.1 to 10  M; our results were similar to those reported by Sourjik and  coworkers (51, 52): the FRET signal fell rapidly after cells  were exposed to a chemoattractant and then gradually returned to the prestimulus level as a result of sensory adaptation  (mediated by adjustments of receptor methylation levels by  CheR and CheB).
The extent of decrease of the FRET signal  (P-CheY level) following attractant addition and the time required for adaptation were sensitive to the concentration of the  attractant (Fig. 7).
In these assays, each of the CheA variants  supported normal excitation and adaptation time courses and  exhibited sensitivities comparable to that observed with cells  expressing CheAwt.
Surprisingly, this normal signaling ability  was even observed with CheA(F214A) (Fig. 7).
This robust  signaling and adaptation were observed for CheA(F214A) cells  responding to a variety of attractant stimuli (L-aspartate,   -methylaspartate, glucose, and -aminobutyric acid; results  not shown) in addition to the serine experiment represented in  Fig. 7, and it was observed over a range of CheY and CheZ  expression levels (salicylate [inducer] concentrations ranging  from 2 to 10 M).
We attempted to monitor the FRET signal  for cells grown at lower inducer concentrations (e.g., 1 or 1.5  M) for which the largest differences in swarm plate abilities  were observed (Fig. 6); however, under these low-expression  conditions, we could not observe any regulation of the small  EYFP signal in either CheAwt cells or CheA(F214A) cells.
  DISCUSSION  F214 in the P2 domain of CheA is a hot-spot and anchor  residue.
Protein-protein binding interfaces can be represented  as discrete clusters of closely interacting residues (40).
Highaffinity complexes (Kds in the nM or pM range) appear to  utilize multiple clusters that are highly developed (have  numerous interconnected contact points).
In contrast, the P2-  CheY complex utilizes only one medium-sized developed cluster and therefore has comparatively weak affinity.
As depicted  in Fig. 1C (and Fig. 4 in reference 40), F214 is a central hub in  this cluster, and so it is not surprising that the F214A mutation  has a major effect on binding affinity: there are no additional  cluster modules to promote binding when the F214 cluster  loses its central hub.
  Amino acid side residues that participate in key contacts  between the binding partners are often referred to as hot  spot residues (6, 10, 18), and they can be identified by scanning mutagenesis experiments such as those reported here: a  substitution of alanine for a hot spot residue has a large negative impact on the affinity of the binding interaction, and the  magnitude of this effect can be expressed as G (14, 43).
  Often, a G value of 2 kcal/mole is used as the cutoff for  hot-spot designation (34, 59), although sometimes a distinction  is made between warm-spot positions (1 kcal/mole  G   4 kcal/mole) and hot-spot positions (G  4 kcal/mole) (35,  36).
The severely weakened binding affinity of CheA(F214A)  indicates that F214 is an important contributor to the CheACheY binding interaction and identifies F214 as a hot-spot  residue (or a very warm spot).
This observation confirms predictions (Fig. 3) made by several computer programs designed  FIG.

   on April 28, 2015 by NYU MEDICAL CENTER LIBRARY http://jb.asm.org/ Downloaded from to analyze protein-protein interfaces and identify hot spots:  these programs predict that F214 contributes 1.3 to 3.8 kcal/  mol to the binding energy, roughly matching our experimental  observations (G, 3.7 to 4.1 kcal mole1  ).
The in silico  alanine-scanning predictions made by some of these programs  also identified several other P2 positions as potential hot spots  (E178, H181, and D207); however, our results do not support  these predictions.
  A different method for in silico analysis of protein-protein  binding interfaces was devised by Rajamani et al. (37).
When  applied to a CheY-P2 crystal structure, this method identified  F214 as the key anchor residue in the binding interface.
Such  an anchor residue can be found in many protein-protein interfaces; each anchor serves as a key organizing center around  which other latch interactions are assembled via induced-fit  conformational changes, presumably after the anchor has been  situated properly.
From this perspective, one can think of P2  residue F214 being maintained in a ready-to-bind conformation that fits into an accommodating recognition surface on  CheY, and this promotes several latch interactions (involving  CheY lysine side chains interacting with P2 glutamate side  chains).
Among the predicted P2 latch sites are the side chains  of E171 and E217 in P2 (37).
Our results indicate that one of  the latches (E171) makes a small contribution to the binding  energy, as does E178, a possible alternative latch residue (we  did not examine E217 in this study).
  The relatively small contributions of the P2-CheY latch sites  to the overall binding energy suggest that unlatching would  be relatively easy, such that a complex anchored via F214 could  sample several alternative conformations (utilizing different  latches).
The possibility of conformational plasticity has been  raised previously to account for the observation of several  alternative interface structures in CheY-P2 crystals (33) and  for the rapid kinetics of complex assembly (55).
  Consequences of F214A for the CheA 3 CheY phosphotransfer mechanism.
Our results demonstrate that the CheA 3  CheY phosphotransfer reaction is markedly slower with  CheA(F214A) than with CheAwt.
However, at first glance, the  magnitude of this effect (10-fold) is not as large as the 70- to  900-fold effect one would predict for a CheA protein with  1,000-fold-lower affinity for CheY. This discrepancy might result from CheY bypassing P2 binding and interacting directly  with the phosphorylated P1 domain of P-CheA(F214A).
Indeed, in previous work we observed that CheY can acquire a  phosphoryl group from a mutant version of CheA that completely lacks the P2 domain, albeit with reduced catalytic efficiency (54).
Therefore, it seems likely that CheY adopts such a  mechanism with CheA(F214A) and that this allows  CheA(F214A) 3 CheY phosphotransfer to take place at a rate  of 10% of that observed with CheAwt, which would indicate  an effective second-order rate constant of 10 M1 s  1  .
This  value indicates that P-CheA(F214A) is somewhat more effective than P-CheAP2 (kphos, 1.5 M1 s  1  ) (54) and considerably more effective than small-molecule phosphodonors  such as phorphoramidate and acetyl phosphate, for which kphos  is 105 to 104 M1 s  1 (32).
The latter comparison supports  the idea that P1 must make important contributions to the  kinetics of phosphotransfer, although the nature of these contributions have yet to be defined (54).
  Consequences of F214A for chemotaxis signal transduction  in cells.
Here, we consider (i) the predicted effects of decreased phosphotransfer kinetics of CheA(F214A) on the  overall ability of the chemotaxis system to regulate CheY phosphorylation and (ii) why these predictions do not match our  experimental observations.
One simple way of making semiquantitative predictions of the effect of F214A is to consider  the rate of the phosphotransfer step relative to other key steps  that affect P-CheY levels.
In wild-type cells, the CheA 3 CheY  phosphotransfer step (200 to 500 s1  ) is considerably faster  than the CheA autophosphorylation reaction (20 to 50 s1  )  and faster than the CheY dephosphorylation reaction (50 to  100 s1 for the CheZ-catalyzed reaction), but the situation is  somewhat different for CheA(F214A): with this mutant protein, autophosphorylation, phosphotransfer, and dephosphorylation would take place at roughly equivalent rates.
The relative magnitudes of these steps dictate the steady-state level of  P-CheY, and their absolute magnitudes define how rapidly  P-CheY levels can be adjusted when changes in CheA autokinase activity are orchestrated by the chemotaxis receptor proteins.
For CheAwt, simple modeling (see Materials and Methods) using current best estimates of rate constants and protein  concentrations predicts that, in an average E. coli cell, there is  a steady-state P-CheY concentration of 3.1 M (30% of  the total CheY pool) and that this can be quickly adjusted  downward in response to an attractant stimulus (half-life [t1/2],  0.03 s).
For CheA(F214A), our results predict that the  steady-state level of CheY-P would be 1.9 M and the t1/2  0.045 s for an attractant response.
Thus, we expected that our  FRET experiments would show a decreased range of responsiveness (less P-CheY to deplete) for the CheA(F214A) cells  exposed to a saturating attractant stimulus.
Our FRET assay  results (Fig. 7) did not match this prediction.
  We considered the possibility that our basic model  (above) was too simple to accurately represent signaling in a  cell.
A much more sophisticated approach for predicting the  effects of the CheA(F214A) mutation is to utilize the RapidCell model developed by Vladimirov et al. (61, 62).
This model  takes into account essentially all of the known features of the  E. coli chemotaxis system and can use this information to  simulate expected time courses of intracellular P-CheY levels  when cells are subjected to stepwise increases and decreases of  attractant stimuli.
Using the default (wild-type) settings for  rate constants and protein concentrations, we generated the  simulated time course shown in Fig. 8 for cells exposed to  addition of a chemoattractant and then to removal of this  attractant.
Repeating this simulation using progressively lower  values of kphos predicts progressively lower steady-state levels  (prestimulus) of P-CheY and corresponding decreases in the  magnitudes of responses (change in P-CheY levels after attractant addition or removal).
Based on these simulations, we  expected that we would have been able to detect a 4-fold  change in kphos and that a 10-fold decrease in this rate constant  would result in a very noticeable decrease in response magnitude.
However, our experimental observations did not match  these predictions.
  This disagreement raises the possibility that some aspect of  the in vivo signaling system compensates for the slow phosphotransfer kinetics of CheA(F214A).
For example, there could be  changes in the methylation status of the chemotaxis receptor  VOL.

Alternatively, in the context of the  full chemotaxis system, the F214A mutation might give rise to  a compensatory decrease of the steady-state phosphatase activity of CheZ such that the intracellular P-CheY concentration is poised at an effective level.

Binding of the chemotaxis  FIG.
8. Computer simulations of chemotaxis responses.
RapidCell  version 1.2.3 (61, 62) simulated the P-CheY levels in cells exposed to  an instantaneous stepwise addition of attractant (from 0 to 30 M) at  50 s and then to stepwise removal of this attractant at 350 s. The Kd of  the chemoreceptor for the attractant was set at 40 M. The top (solid)  line shows the simulation results obtained using the default values for  rate constants and protein concentrations.
The bottom (dashed) line  shows the results obtained when the effective second-order rate constant for CheA 3 CheY phosphotransfer was decreased 10-fold.
The  first segments of these time courses (0 to 200 s) correspond to the  stepwise responses we monitored in Fig. 7.
