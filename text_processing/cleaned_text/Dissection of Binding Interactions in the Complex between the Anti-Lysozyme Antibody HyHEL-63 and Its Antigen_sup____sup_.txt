Box B,  Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201  ReceiVed September 18, 2002  ABSTRACT: Alanine-scanning mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, and double mutant cycles were used to  characterize the interface between the anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) antibody HyHEL-63 and HEL.
  Eleven HEL residues in contact with HyHEL-63 in the crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex,  and 10 HyHEL-63 residues in contact with HEL, were individually truncated to alanine in order to determine  their relative contributions to complex stabilization.
The residues of HEL (Tyr20, Lys96, and Lys97)  most important for binding HyHEL-63 (Gmutant - Gwild type > 3.0 kcal/mol) form a contiguous patch  at the center of the surface contacted by the antibody.
Hot spot residues of the antibody (G > 2.0  kcal/mol) are organized in two clusters that juxtapose hot spot residues of HEL, resulting in energetic  complementarity across the interface.
All energetically critical residues are centrally located, shielded  from solvent by peripheral residues that contribute significantly less to the binding free energy.
Although  HEL hot spot residues Lys96 and Lys97 make similar interactions with antibody in the HyHEL-63/HEL  complex, alanine substitution of Lys96 results in a nearly 100-fold greater reduction in affinity than the  corresponding mutation in Lys97.
To understand the basis for this marked difference, we determined the  crystal structures of the HyHEL-63/HEL Lys96Ala and HyHEL-63/HEL Lys97Ala complexes to 1.80  and 1.85  resolution, respectively.
Whereas conformational changes in the proteins and differences in  the solvent networks at the mutation sites appear too small to explain the observed affinity difference,  superposition of free HEL in different crystal forms onto bound HEL in the wild type and mutant HyHEL63/HEL complexes reveals that the side-chain conformation of Lys96 is very similar in the various  structures, but that the Lys97 side chain displays considerable flexibility.
Accordingly, a greater entropic  penalty may be associated with quenching the mobility of the Lys97 than the Lys96 side chain upon  complex formation, reducing binding.
To further dissect the energetics of specific interactions in the  HyHEL-63/HEL interface, double mutant cycles were constructed to measure the coupling of 13 amino  acid pairs, 11 of which are in direct contact in the crystal structure.
A large coupling energy, 3.0 kcal/  mol, was found between HEL residue Lys97 and HyHEL-63 residue VHAsp32, which form a buried salt  bridge surrounded by polar residues of the antigen.
Thus, in contrast to protein folding where buried salt  bridges are generally destabilizing, salt bridges in protein-protein interfaces, whose residual composition  is more hydrophilic than that of protein interiors, may contribute significantly to complex stabilization.
  The ability of proteins to form specific, stable complexes  with other proteins is fundamental to most cellular processes,  including signal transduction, vesicle transport, and cytoskeletal remodeling.
X-ray crystallographic studies of diverse  protein-protein complexes (e.g., protease-protease inhibitor,  antigen-antibody, hormone-hormone receptor, G-protein  complexes) have revealed that most share a relatively large  (>900 2  ) and planar buried surface area composed of  closely packed atoms, similar to protein cores (1-7).
This  shape complementarity is usually accompanied by a high  degree of chemical complementarity.
Hydrophobic patches  on the surface of one protein pack against hydrophobic  patches on the surface of the other protein, atoms of polar  character interact with atoms of opposite charge across the  interface, and proton donors and acceptors form hydrogen  bonds.
Protruding side chains of one surface fit into depressions of the other, and numerous van der Waals interactions are interspersed with hydrogen bonds and an oc-   This work was supported by NIH Grant GM5280.

Overall, protein-protein interfaces are  quite polar and tend to reflect the residual composition of  protein surfaces, rather than protein cores, although they are  somewhat enriched in hydrophobic residues (1, 2).
Small,  but significant, conformational changes are generally observed between free and bound proteins, and this flexibility  appears to increase with the amount of buried surface area  in the protein complex (2).
  In contrast to the wealth of structural information on  protein-protein interfaces, the available data on the thermodynamics of the association reactions are far more limited  and are largely based on detailed mutagenesis and binding  studies of relatively few complexes (1).
These studies have  shown that functional epitopes assigned by mutagenesis are  usually, though not always (7-10), much more restricted  than structural epitopes defined by X-ray crystallography (1,  5, 6, 11).
That is, replacement of only a small subset of  contact residues (hot spots) often destabilizes proteinprotein complexes dramatically, while substitutions of most  other interface residues, including many which appear to  form highly favorable interactions, result in little or no loss  of affinity.
In other cases, however, the binding free energy  arises from the accumulation of many productive interactions  distributed over substantial portions of the interface (7-10,  12).
Indeed, a predictive understanding of protein-protein  interactions has not been achieved and there is currently no  method to reliably identify hot spot residues in complex  structures based on patterns of shape, hydrophobicity or  charge (5, 6).
A major difficulty is that interaction energies  vary considerably, even for the same type of interaction,  resulting in often poor correlations between structural data  and energies deduced from mutagenesis.
In addition, the relative contributions of surface complementarity, hydrophobicity, and hydrogen bonding to complex stabilization remain  to be established. It is therefore evident that additional structure-function studies are required to progress from purely  anatomical descriptions of protein-protein interfaces (identity of contact residues, amount of buried surface areas, number of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, etc.)  to a detailed understanding of how these structural features  translate to the affinity and specificity of binding reactions.
  Antigen-antibody complexes provide useful models for  analyzing the thermodynamics of protein-protein association  reactions (1, 2, 7).
We recently determined the crystal  structure of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of the antihen egg white lysozyme (HEL) antibody HyHEL-63 complexed with HEL to 2.0  resolution, as well as structure of  the unbound antibody in two crystal forms, to 1.8 and 2.1   resolution (13).
The Fab HyHEL-63/HEL complex is highly  suited for detailed structure-function studies of proteinprotein recognition by mutational analysis: not only are the  structures of both free and bound HyHEL-63 and HEL  known to high resolution, but mutants of the antibody and  antigen can be readily produced in bacteria and yeast,  respectively.
Furthermore, the affinities of mutant complexes  can be accurately measured under equilibrium binding  conditions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) methods  (13).
Therefore, it should be possible to interpret the results  of site-directed mutagenesis experiments in the HyHEL-63/  HEL system in terms of the three-dimensional structures of  the corresponding mutant complexes.
  To assess the apparent contribution of individual residues  to complex formation, we systematically truncated the side  chains of contact residues on both HyHEL-63 and HEL to  alanine and compared the affinities of the wild type and  mutant complexes.
We find that nearly all the contact  residues tested (18 of 21) contribute at least 1.0 kcal/mol to  the binding free energy.
In common with most proteinprotein complexes (1-7), energetically critical residues of  HyHEL-63 and HEL are located at the center of the interface,  surrounded by peripheral residues that contribute significantly  less to complex stabilization.
The two most energetically  dominant HEL residues, Lys96 (G ) 6.1 kcal/mol) and  Lys97 (3.5 kcal/mol), form buried hydrogen bonds (Lys96)  or a salt bridge (Lys97) in the wild-type complex.
To explain  the greater apparent contribution to binding of Lys96 than  Lys97, we determined the crystal structures of the corresponding alanine-substituted complexes to high resolution.
  To further map the HyHEL-63/HEL interface, coupling  energies between specific residue pairs were measured using  double mutant cycles.
Although the results were broadly  consistent with expectations from structural analysis, we also  encountered significant exceptions.
Possible reasons for  differences between actual and expected coupling energies  for certain residue pairs are discussed in terms of the threedimensional structure of the HyHEL-63/HEL complex.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Cloning and Mutagenesis of the HyHEL-63 Fab.
The  isolation of cDNAs for the L and H chains of anti-HEL  antibody HyHEL-63 has been described (13).
DNA fragments encoding the VL and CL domains of the L chain and  the VH and CH1 domains of the H chain were generated by  PCR and cloned downstream of the pelB leader sequence of  expression vector pET-26b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI).
The  vector was restricted with MscI-SalI and MscI-HindIII for  independent insertion of the VLCL and VHCH1 chains,  respectively.
The pET-26b(+)-VHCH1 construct was digested  with XbaI, treated with Klenow large fragment (New England  Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to generate blunt ends, and then  restricted with NotI. The resulting fragment, containing the  pelB leader and VHCH1, was cloned into pET-26b(+)-VLCL,  which had been previously digested with SalI, treated with  Klenow large fragment, and restricted with NotI. In the final  pET-26b(+)-VLCL/VHCH1 construct, the L and H chain genes  are each fused to a pelB leader and controlled by the same  T7 promoter.
The VHCH1 gene also includes a sequence from  the pET-26b(+) vector encoding a C-terminal His6 tag for  affinity purification.
Site-directed mutagenesis of Fab HyHEL-63 was carried out by overlap PCR.
  Production of Fab HyHEL-63 and Mutants by Secretion  or in Vitro Folding.
For protein expression, the pET-26b-  (+)-VLCL/VHCH1 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia  coli strain BL21(D3) (Novagen).
Precultures (3 mL) were  grown at 37 C overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium  containing 50 g/mL kanamycin.
These precultures were then  1 Abbreviations: HEL, hen egg white lysozyme; PBS, phosphatebuffered saline; LB, Luria-Bertani medium; SPR, surface plasmon  resonance; RU, resonance units; Fab, antigen-binding fragment; L chain,  light chain; H chain, heavy chain; V region, variable region; C region,  constant region; VL, light chain variable region; VH, heavy chain  variable region; CDR, complementarity-determining region; FR, framework region.
  12 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 1, 2003 Li et al.used to inoculate 500 mL LB with the same antibiotic  concentration.
The bacteria were grown at 25 C to an  absorbance of 0.6-0.8 at 600 nm, and isopropyl -Dthiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mM.  After overnight incubation at 25 C, the supernatant was  separated from cells by centrifigation, concentrated using an  Amicon RA2000 concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and  buffer exchanged into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.
The  supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA affinity column  (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) preequilibrated with the same  buffer.
The column was washed with 20 mM imidazole, 50  mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with 50 mM imidazole,  50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.
Fractions containing recombinant  Fab HyHEL-63 were pooled, concentrated, and further  purified by gel filtration on a Superdex S-200 FPLC column  (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) to eliminate aggregates before  surface plasmon resonance analysis (see below).
Mutants of  Fab HyHEL-63 were prepared similarly.
  Wild-type Fab HyHEL-63 used for cocrystallization with  HEL mutants Lys96gAla (HEL K96A) and Lys97gAla (HEL  K97A) was produced by in vitro folding of the VLCL and  VHCH1 chains, produced in E. coli as inclusion bodies, as  described previously (12).
Correctly folded protein was  purified using an HEL affinity column, followed by anion  exchange chromatography with a MonoQ FPLC column  (Pharmacia).
  Production of HEL Mutants.
Mutants of HEL were  produced as secreted proteins using an Invitrogen Pichia  Expression Kit (San Diego, CA).
A cDNA sequence encoding the wild-type protein fused to the leader sequence of  R-mating factor was cloned into plasmid pPic9 as a XhoI/  NotI fragment (14).
Mutagenesis was carried out by overlap  PCR.
For protein production, yeast from a single colony  transformed with this plasmid was grown in 25 mL BMGY  medium at 28-30 C.
After the culture reached an absorbance of 1.0-6.0 at 600 nm, the cells were harvested by  centrifugation at 1500g; the pellets were suspended in  BMMY medium to an absorbance of 1.0 prior to induction.
  Methanol was added to the culture every 24 h to a final  concentration of 0.5% (v/v) to maintain induction.
After 96  h, the culture was harvested by centrifugation.
The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 0.1 M ammonium  acetate, pH 9.0, and loaded on a 3 mL CM-Sepharose Fast  Flow column (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with the  same buffer.
The column was washed with 10 volumes of  buffer and eluted with 0.5 M ammonium acetate, pH 9.0.
  Further purification was carried out on a Mono S cation exchange FPLC column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mM  MES, pH 6.5, and developed with a linear NaCl gradient;  all HEL mutants eluted between 0.2 and 0.4 M NaCl.
  Affinity Measurements.
The interaction of soluble Fab  HyHEL-63 with immobilized HEL was measured by SPR  using a BIAcore 1000 biosensor (BIACORE, Piscataway,  NJ) as described (8, 15, 16).
The data were analyzed using  the BIAevaluation 2.1 software package (BIACORE).
Association constants (KAs) were determined from Scatchard  analysis, after correction for nonspecific binding, by measuring the concentration of free reactants and complex at  equilibrium.
Standard deviations for two or more independent  KA determinations were typically <20%.
  Crystallography.
The Fab HyHEL-63/HEL K96A and Fab  HyHEL-63/HEL K97A complexes were crystallized at room  temperature in hanging drops from mixtures containing  equimolar amounts of antibody and antigen at 10 mg/mL  concentrations.
The crystallization conditions were similar  to those for the wild-type Fab HyHEL-63/HEL complex  (13): 15% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M ammonium acetate, and  0.05 M sodium acetate, pH 4.6.
The mutant complexes  crystallized isomorphously with the wild-type in space group  P42212 with one complex molecule per asymmetric unit  (Table 1).
X-ray diffraction data were measured at 100 K  on beamline 19-ID ( ) 0.978 ) of the Advanced Photon  Source (Argonne National Laboratory) using an ADSC  Quantum-4 CCD detector.
The crystals were transferred to  a cryoprotectant solution (mother liquor containing 25%  glycerol), prior to flash-cooling in a nitrogen stream.
The  data were processed and scaled using DENZO/SCALEPACK  (17), followed by data reduction using programs from the  CCP4 suite (18).
Data collection statistics are shown in  Table 1.
  The structures of the Fab HyHEL-63/HEL K96A and Fab  HyHEL-63/HEL K97A complexes were solved by molecular  replacement methods using the program AMoRe (19), with  the wild-type complex (PDB accession code 1DQM) (12)  as a search model.
Crystallographic refinement was carried  out using X-PLOR3.1 (20) and CNS0.4 (21), including rigidbody refinement, iterative cycles of simulated annealing,  positional refinement, torsion angle refinement, and individual temperature factor (B) refinement interspersed with  manual model fitting into A-weighted Fo-Fc and 2Fo-Fc  electron density maps using TURBO-FRODO (22).
Water  molecules were added at positions where the Fo-Fc electron  density was greater than 2.5 and where reasonable hydrogen  bonds to protein atoms or other water molecules were  Table 1: Data Collection and Refinement Statistics for HyHEL-63/  HEL Complexes  HyHEL-63/HEL K96A HyHEL-63/HEL K97A  Data Collection  space group P42212 P42212  cell dimensions() a ) b ) 90.9,  c ) 151.9  a ) b) 90.9,  c ) 151.2  temperature (K) 100 100  resolution limit () 1.80 1.85  mosaicity () 0.3 0.4  Rmerge (%)b 5.9 (42.2)a 5.4 (36.6)a  unique reflections 114 251 53 340  total observations 430 270 472 861  completeness (%) 99.9 (100)a 97.3 (93.2)a  Refinement  Rfreec 24.2 24.5  Rcryst 20.1 18.5  protein  residues 553 553  average B (2  ) 21.4 21.7  water  molecules 743 608  average B (2  ) 36.1 35.7  rms deviations  bonds () 0.017 0.006  angles (deg) 0.024 0.022  a Values in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell:  HyHEL-63/HEL K96A (1.86-1.80 ); HyHEL-63/HEL K97A (1.92-  1.85 ).

  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Production of Recombinant Fab HyHEL-63.
Because of  its nonreducing environment, the periplasmic space of E. coli  has been used for the expression of heterologous proteins,  such as antibodies (8, 23, 24) and T-cell receptors (25, 26),  that contain disulfide bonds.
To direct secretion of Fab  HyHEL-63 into the periplasmic space, the natural signal  sequences of its L and H chains were replaced with that of  pectate lyase from Erwinia carotoVora (23, 24).
Six histidineencoding triplets were grafted onto the 3 terminus of the  VHCH1 gene to permit purification of the recombinant protein  using a nickel chelate adsorbent.
This was done to avoid  HEL affinity chromatography, since certain HyHEL-63  mutants were expected to bind the antigen too weakly for  purification by this method.
Surprisingly, most of the  antibody was found in the culture supernatant, rather than  the periplasmic space, indicating leakage from the periplasmic compartment due to membrane damage or cell lysis, as  occasionally observed for secreted antibodies (8, 16, 23, 24).
  In our previous crystallographic study of the Fab HyHEL63/HEL complex, we had expressed the wild-type Fab by  in vitro folding of the VLCL and VHCH1 chains, produced as  bacterial inclusion bodies (12).
Since secreted Fab HyHEL63 did not crystallize with HEL under wild-type conditions,  perhaps due to the presence of a flexible His6 tag, the Fab  used for crystallizing complexes with HEL mutants was  produced by in vitro folding.
Importantly, the affinities of  the secreted and in vitro folded forms of HyHEL-63 for HEL  were indistinguishable (data not shown).
  Measurement of Association Constants for the Binding of  HyHEL-63 to HEL.

The HyHEL-63 mutant was injected at 10 different  concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 7.1 M over a surface to which 1200 RU of wild-type HEL had been coupled.
Buffer flow rates were  5 L/min, and report points were taken 1 min after each injection.

The apparent KA is 3.6  105 M-1.
The predicted maximum  binding capacity (4100 RU) indicates that about 59% of the immobilized wild-type HEL molecules are available for binding.
(C) Binding  of Fab HyHEL-63 VHD32A to immobilized HEL K97A.
The HyHEL-63 mutant was injected at eight different concentrations ranging from  42 to 540 nM over a surface to which 1400 RU of the HEL mutant had been coupled.
Report points were taken 3.5 min after each injection.
  (D) Scatchard plot derived from the data in panel C after correction for nonspecific binding.
The plot is linear with a correlation coefficient  of 0.98 and the apparent KA is 5.4  106 M-1.
Approximately 56% of the immobilized HEL K97A is available for binding, as calculated  from the predicted maximum binding capacity (4800 RU).
  14 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 1, 2003 Li et al.HyHEL-63 Fab fragments for wild-type HEL or HEL  mutants were determined under equilibrium binding conditions with a BIAcore biosensor.
Typically, analyte concentrations ranging from 1/10 the dissociation constant (KD) to  10KD were used; higher concentrations were required to  approach saturation for the lower affinity interactions.
Surface  plasmon resonance profiles for equilibrium binding of  HyHEL-63 mutant VLN32A mutant to immobilized wildtype HEL, and of HyHEL-63 mutant VHD32A to HEL  mutant K97A, are shown in Figure 1 (panels A and C,  respectively).
The corresponding Scatchard plots, after correcting for nonspecific binding, are shown in Figure 1 (panels  B and D).
The plots were linear, and apparent KAs were  calculated as the slopes of the straight lines: KA ) 3.6   105 M-1 and 5.4  106 M-1 for the HyHEL-63 VLN32A/  HEL and HyHEL-63 VHD32A/HEL K97A interactions,  respectively.
The predicted maximum specific binding,  calculated from the x-intercept assuming a linear relationship  between the mass of bound protein and the measured  resonance units (RU) (26), indicated that approximately 60%  of the immobilized HEL molecules were available for  binding in both cases.
The affinities measured by equilibrium  binding were very reproducible, and deviations between  different runs on the same chip were generally smaller than  those between different chips.
The errors on KA were  consistently less than 20%, which translates into errors on  G (Gmutant - Gwild type) and Gint (the interaction  energy between residue pairs from double mutant cycle  analysis) of less than (0.4 and (0.7 kcal/mol, respectively.
  Thus, the binding of closely related mutant proteins may be  compared with a relatively high degree of precision using  this BIAcore method.
  Mapping the Energetics of the HyHEL-63/HEL Interface.
  Residues in the interface between HyHEL-63 and HEL were  subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis in order to  determine their relative contributions to the free energy of  association.
In the crystal structure of the Fab HyHEL-63/  HEL complex (13), 19 HyHEL-63 residues from all six  complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the antibody, and 1 H chain framework region residue, contact 20  HEL residues from three discontinuous polypeptide segments  of the antigen.
We individually mutated to alanine 11 HEL  residues in contact with HyHEL-63, excluding 2 glycine  residues (16 and 102) and residues contacting the antibody  only through backbone atoms (14, 15, 18, 19, and 98).
The  binding affinities of these HEL mutants for wild-type  HyHEL-63 were measured by BIAcore and Gs calculated  (Table 2, section A).
The most destabilizing mutation was  at position Lys96 (G ) 6.1 kcal/mol).
In the wild-type  structure, this residue makes two hydrogen bonds to VLAsn31  and VLAsn32 (Lys96HEL N-O1 VLAsn31 and Lys96HEL  N-O1 VLAsn32).
Alanine substitutions at HEL positions  Tyr20 and Lys97 also greatly reduced binding (G > 3.0  kcal/mol).
Smaller, but significant, effects were observed for  substitutions at positions Arg21, Trp63, Leu75, and Asp101  (1.0-2.0 kcal/mol), while those at positions Trp62, Thr89,  Asn93, and Ser100 had very little effect (<1.0 kcal/mol).
  These results are broadly consistent with those from a  mutational study of the anti-HEL antibody HyHEL-10 (28),  which recognizes a similar epitope on HEL as HyHEL-63  (13, 29).
  On the antibody side of the interface, 10 HyHEL-63  residues (5 from VL and 5 from VH) in contact with HEL  were mutated to alanine.
The affinities of these mutants for  wild-type HEL are shown in Table 2, section B. Overall,  mutations in the H chain disrupt binding more than those in  the L chain.
Three H chain mutations, at position VHTyr33,  VHTyr50 and VHTrp98, are associated with G values  exceeding 4.0 kcal/mol.
The corresponding residues of  HyHEL-10 are also hot spots for HEL binding (30).
Two L  chain mutations, at positions VLAsn32 and VLTyr50, also  significantly reduced binding, with Gs of 4.1 and 2.7 kcal/  mol, respectively.
Substitutions at the other five antibody  positions tested (VLAsn31, VLSer91, VLTyr96, VHAsp32, and  VHTyr53) had less effect (1.1-2.0 kcal/mol).
In the HyHEL10/HEL complex, mutation of the conserved VLAsn31  residue results in a much greater affinity loss (G ) 5.2  kcal/mol), possibly reflecting the longer distance of the  conserved hydrogen bond to Lys96HEL in the HyHEL-63/  HEL complex and the fewer number of van der Waals  contacts made with the antigen (13).

  Mutational Analysis of an Antigen-Antibody Complex Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 1, 2003 15Figure 2 shows the residues of HyHEL-63 and HEL  important in complex stabilization mapped onto the threedimensional structure of each protein.
The residues of HEL  most important for binding HyHEL-63 (Tyr20, Lys96 and  Lys97) form a contiguous patch located at the center of the  surface contacted by the antibody.
The three hot spot residues  (G > 2.0 kcal/mol) of the HyHEL-63 H chain (VHTyr33,  VHTyr50 and VHTrp98) cluster together, as do the two hot  spot residues of the L chain (VLAsn32 and VLTyr50),  forming two energetically important patches on the antibody  surface.
A comparison of the interacting surfaces in Figure  2 reveals that hot spot residues on the HEL side of the  interface generally correspond to hot spots on the HyHEL63 side.
For example, in the crystal structure of the complex  (13), hot spot residue Lys97HEL (G ) 3.5 kcal/mol) makes  contact with hot spot residues VHTyr33 (5.5 kcal/mol) and  VHTrp98 (4.9 kcal/mol).
Similarly, hot spot residues Tyr20HEL  (3.3 kcal/mol) and Lys96HEL (6.1 kcal/mol) contact hot spot  residues VLAsn32 (4.1 kcal/mol) and VLTyr50 (2.7 kcal/  mol).
In addition, functionally less important residues of  HyHEL-63 and HEL tend to be juxtaposed in the antigenantibody interface: VHTyr53 (G ) 1.2 kcal/mol) interacts  with HEL residues Trp63, Leu75 and Asp101 (1.0-2.0 kcal/  mol), while VLTyr96 (1.1 kcal/mol) contacts HEL residues  Arg21 (1.3 kcal/mol) and Ser100 (0.8 kcal/mol).
A significant  exception to this energetic complementarity is VHTyr50,  whose replacement by alanine results in a decrease in binding  free energy of 6.9 kcal/mol, the largest for any residue tested,  but which interacts with functionally far less important HEL  residues Arg21 and Ser100 (Table 2).
One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the VHTyr50 side chain  contacts Ser100 only through main-chain atoms, such that  the relative contribution of the HEL residue cannot be  assessed by simple alanine substitution.
In addition, the side  chain of VHTyr50 is mostly buried in the antibody combining  site: the solvent-accessible surface area of this residue is  only 24 2  , compared to 77 2 for VHTyr33, 153 2 for  VHTyr53, and 100 2 for VHTyr58.
Thus, the large decrease  in affinity upon replacement of VHTyr50 by alanine may be  an indirect effect due to structural perturbations in the antibody combining site propagating from the mutation to neighboring residues, in particular VHTyr58, VHTrp98, VLTrp94,  and VLTyr96, which make numerous contacts with HEL.
If  so, VHTyr50 may not represent a true hot spot for HEL  binding; similar considerations may apply to certain hot spots  in other protein-protein interfaces identified by alaninescanning mutagenesis (6).
Overall, however, these results  are in agreement with findings from other antigen-antibody  systems (1, 7), and the growth hormone-growth hormone  receptor complex (11, 31-33), that energetically critical  residues tend to be self-complementary across interfaces.
  As noted for several other protein-protein complexes (1,  8, 11, 34), the change in solvent-accessible surface area of  individual HyHEL-63 or HEL residues upon complex  formation does not correlate well with their relative importance to binding.
For example, VHTyr53 and Arg21HEL  contribute the most to the buried surface in the HyHEL63-HEL interface (111 2 and 116 2  , respectively), yet  are not hot spot residues (Table 2).
A far more important  parameter in determining a particular residues contribution  to complex stabilization appears to be its location in the  interface (central versus peripheral), although the reasons for  this marked positional dependence are incompletely understood (see Conclusions) (1, 6).
Thus, hot spot residues such  as VHTyr33 and VHTrp98 of HyHEL-63, or Tyr20 and Lys96  of HEL, are located near the center of the interface, where  they are mostly shielded from bulk solvent (>70% burial)  by peripheral residues that contribute significantly less to  the binding free energy (Figure 2).
  Structures of HEL Mutants K96A and K97A Complexed  with HyHEL-63.
In the wild-type HyHEL-63/HEL complex,  the interacting surface of HyHEL-63 is mainly hydrophobic,  whereas hydrophilic residues predominate on the HEL side  of the interface (13).
Of the three hot spot HEL residues we  identified, two (Lys96 and Lys97) are charged.
In the crystal  structure, the aliphatic portion of the Lys96HEL side chain  FIGURE 2: Space-filling model of the surface of HyHEL-63 (left) in contact with HEL and of the surface of HEL (right) in contact with  HyHEL-63.

Similarly, the side chain of Lys97HEL intercalates between  aromatic residues VHTyr33 and VHTrp98, with the N group  neutralized by a salt bridge to VHAsp32 (Figure 3C).
The  affinity of HEL K96A for HyHEL-63 (KA ) 1.1  104 M-1  )  is approximately 33 000-fold lower than that of wild-type  HEL (3.6  108 M-1  ), while the affinity of HEL K97A (9.4   105 M-1  ) is only 380-fold lower (Table 2).
  To understand how replacement of these two charged  residues by alanine disrupts binding and why mutation of  Lys96HEL results in a nearly 100-fold greater reduction in  affinity than mutation of Lys97HEL, we determined the crystal  structures of the HyHEL-63/HEL K96A and HyHEL-63/  HEL K97A complexes to 1.80 and 1.85  resolution,  respectively.
Omit maps in the region of the mutations are  shown in Figure 4A,C. The root-mean-square (rms) deviations in R-carbon positions between mutant and wild-type  structures are only 0.27  for HyHEL-63/HEL K96A and  0.34  for HyHEL-63/HEL K97A, indicating that the  mutations do not significantly alter the overall structure of  the complexes.
Conformational changes in the proteins at  the mutation sites are also small (Figure 4B,D).
  The principal difference in the structure of the mutant  complexes is a rearrangement of solvent such that additional  water molecules are stably incorporated in the interface at  the site of the mutations.
In the HyHEL-63/HEL K96A  complex, the cavity created by the alanine substitution is  partially filled by a water molecule (WatB) that forms  hydrogen bonds which mimic ones made by Lys96HEL  (Figure 3B).
In the wild-type structure, WatA, which is also  present in the mutant complex, forms hydrogen bonds with  His15HEL O, Lys96HEL N, and VLAsn31 N2 (Figure 3A).
  In the mutant, WatB fulfills the role of Lys96HEL by hydrogen  bonding to VLAsn31, VLAsn32, and WatA. However, nearly  all direct interactions between the Lys96HEL side chain and  HyHEL-63 are lost when this residue is mutated to alanine,  including nine van der Waals contacts and two hydrogen  bonds, which are not replaced by newly formed watermediated interactions.
A similar situation exists for the  HyHEL-63/HEL K97A complex, where a water molecule  occupies only part of the cavity created by the side-chain  truncation, hydrogen bonding to VHAsp32 O2 (Figure 3D).
  Nine van der Waals contacts and one salt bridge (Lys97HEL  N-O2 VHAsp32) are lost in the mutant complex, none  of which are restored by the sole additional water molecule  at the mutation site.
For both complexes, the observed solvent  rearrangements are clearly insufficient to compensate for the  loss of direct protein-protein interactions at the mutation  sites, thereby contributing to the large reductions in binding  affinity relative to the wild-type complex.
Moreover, differFIGURE 3: (A) Schematic representation of the wild-type Fab HyHEL-63/HEL complex in the vicinity of HEL residue Lys96.

  Mutational Analysis of an Antigen-Antibody Complex Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 1, 2003 17ences in the nature or extent of the solvent networks formed  in the mutant complexes (Figure 3B,D) appear too limited  to explain the much greater effect on binding of alanine  substitution of Lys96HEL than Lys97HEL (Table 2).
  We had previously observed solvent rearrangements,  including the incorporation of additional interface waters,  in X-ray crystallographic studies of complexes between sitedirected mutants of the anti-HEL antibody D1.3 and HEL  (16, 35, 36).
In certain cases, the mutations were associated  with only small reductions in affinity (<10-fold), even  though they resulted in the loss of a similar number of van  der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions as in the HyHEL63/HEL K96A and HyHEL-63/HEL K97A complexes (16,  35).
In other cases, up to 1000-fold reductions in affinity  were observed (35, 36).
Even more drastic is the 33 000-  fold loss of affinity measured in the present study for the  HyHEL-63/HEL K96A interaction.
Thus, there appears to  be a very wide range in the extent to which solvent  rearrangements in a protein-protein interface can accommodate mutations, which probably depends on the position  of the mutation in the interface and on the nature of the local  environment.
On the basis of the available crystal structures  (16, 35-38), we conclude that sites at the periphery of  protein-protein interfaces, because of their accessibility, are  particularly suited to the incorporation of new waters to  occupy cavities or channels created by side-chain truncations,  provided that the local environment is sufficiently polar to  permit the formation of a stable water network to compensate  the loss of complementarity at the mutation site.
For example,  alanine substitution of D1.3 residue VHTpr52 has little effect  on HEL binding, whereas VHTrp92 is a hot spot, even though  both tryptophans are near the periphery of the D1.3-HEL  interface and make similar contributions to the buried surface  in the complex (8).
However, examination of the atomic  interactions made by these residues reveals that VHTrp92  packs against a more hydrophobic surface than VHTrp52,  precluding the formation of compensating water-mediated  interactions with HEL (36).
We also fail to observe such  interactions for residues at the center of interfaces, such as  Lys96HEL and Lys97HEL in the HyHEL-63/HEL complex  (Figure 3B,D), which are buried in predominantly hydrophobic environments.
  A possible explanation for the much greater apparent  contribution to binding of Lys96HEL (G ) 6.1 kcal/mol)  than Lys97HEL (3.5 kcal/mol) may be found by comparing  the conformations of these residues in different crystal  packing environments.
Superposition of free HEL in three  crystal forms (39-41) onto bound HEL in the HyHEL-63/  HEL complex (13) shows that the side chain conformations  of Lys96HEL are very similar in the four structures, whereas  the Lys97HEL side chain displays considerable conformational  variability (Figure 5A).
Thus, a significant entropic penalty  FIGURE 4: (A) Simulated annealing omit electron density map in the vicinity of HEL residue Ala96 in the HyHEL-63/HEL K96A mutant  complex.

  18 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 1, 2003 Li et al.may be associated with quenching the mobility of the flexible  Lys97HEL side chain upon complex formation, which would  be unfavorable for binding.
This penalty should be less for  the Lys96HEL side chain, whose conformation in the bound  state is nearly identical to those found in different crystal  forms of the free antigen (39-41).
Another factor contributing to the greater decrease in affinity upon mutation of  Lys96HEL could be that this residue is more deeply buried in  the HEL structure than Lys97HEL: the solvent-accessible  surface area of Lys96HEL is only 35 2 compared to 102 2  for Lys97HEL.
Alanine substitution of Lys96HEL may therefore  result in rearrangements of neighboring HEL residues,  reducing interface complementarity at the mutation site.
  Indeed, a comparison of the wild-type and mutant HyHEL63/HEL structures reveals a small, but significant, displacement (up to 0.4 ) in the position of the peptide backbone  of HEL residues 15-20 in the HEL K96A mutant complex,  relative to wild-type, that is not observed in the HEL K97A  complex (Figure 5B).
  Analysis of the HyHEL-63/HEL Interface Using Double  Mutant Cycles.
Comparing the binding of a wild-type protein  with that of a mutant in which a side chain has been truncated  gives an apparent binding energy which is generally greater  than the incremental binding energy attributable to that side  chain (42), since interactions other than the interactions of  interest are often disrupted, each of which may contribute  to the energetics of association (43-45).
These secondary  effects include possible conformational changes in the  proteins ranging from repositioning of side chains to movements in the backbone, as well as reorganizations in solvent  structure in the vicinity of the mutation.
Such effects are  evident in the crystal structures of the HyHEL-63/HEL K96A  and HyHEL-63/HEL K97A complexes described above,  although they are of relatively moderate magnitude for both  mutants.
  The method of double mutant cycles circumvents many  of the limitations of single mutant experiments and makes  it possible to estimate the effective interaction energy  between specific residues in a protein-protein complex  independently of interactions other than those between the  residues mutated in the cycle (43-45).
We have applied this  method of dissecting the energetics of pairwise interactions  in protein-protein interfaces to the HyHEL-63/HEL complex.
Thus, HyHEL-63 residue A and HEL residue B were  mutated (i.e., A f A, B f B) separately and together to  construct the cycle:  The coupling, or interaction, energy between residues A  and B (Gint) is then given by  If Gint equals zero, the effects of the two mutations are  independent of each other and the two residues are not  coupled.
A Gint other than zero indicates that residues A  and B are coupled, either directly or indirectly, since the  change in free energy for the association of the double mutant  complex is different from the sum of those for the two single  mutant complexes.
  Double mutant cycles were constructed for 13 amino acid  pairs in the HyHEL-63/HEL interface in order to map the  interaction energies at the contact surfaces between the  proteins (Table 2, Section C).
Of the 13 pairs tested, 11 have  interacting side chains as judged from the crystal structure,  1 does not form direct contacts but is in proximity (4.6 ),  and 1 is far apart (8.3 ).
Coupling energies were calculated  according to eq 1 and are given in Table 3.
The interaction  between HyHEL-63 VLAsn32 and Lys96HEL has the largest  Gint (4.4 kcal/mol), in agreement with results from single  mutant experiments identifying these residues as hot spots  (Figure 2).
The residues form a buried hydrogen bond  (VLAsn32 O-N Lys96HEL) with good geometry in the  crystal structure (Figure 3A).
Our Gint value for this  residue pair is consistent with studies showing that deletion  of hydrogen bonds involving charged-neutral pairs in the  interiors of proteins decreases their stability by 3-5 kcal/  mol (46).
It also agrees remarkably well with a coupling  energy of 4.3 kcal/mol for a buried hydrogen bond formed  by a charged-neutral pair in the D1.3/E5.2 idiotopeantiidiotope complex (15).
  Buried salt bridges are generally believed to destabilize  folded proteins due to the high desolvation cost associated  with transferring charged side chains from the solvent to the  protein core (4, 47-49).
In contrast to protein folding, it  has been postulated that salt bridges across a binding interface  can, in some cases, significantly stabilize protein-protein  FIGURE 5: (A) Conformational differences in HEL residues Lys96  and Lys97.

  Gint ) - GABfAB + GABfAB + GABfAB  (1)  Mutational Analysis of an Antigen-Antibody Complex Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 1, 2003 19complexes since, after binding, the charged groups may be  buried in an environment whose residual composition may  be much more hydrophilic than the one after folding (4, 50).
  Indeed, the interaction between HyHEL-63 VHAsp32 and  Lys97HEL, which form the only salt bridge in the complex,  has a Gint of 3.0 kcal/mol, consistent with the identification of Lys97HEL as a hot spot residue by single mutant  analysis (Table 2, section A).
Although this salt bridge is  buried in the interface, it is surrounded by several hydrophilic  HEL residues (Asn77, Asn93, Lys96, Ser100, Asp101),  which may effectively solvate the charged groups forming  the salt bridge, thereby increasing its net contribution to  complex stabilization.
In agreement with this result, Gint  values of similar magnitude have been measured for buried  salt bridges in other protein-protein, including antigenantibody, complexes (30, 34, 51).
In each case, the salt bridge  appears to be stabilized by a network of ionic or hydrogen  bonding interactions involving adjacent interfacial polar  residues.
By contrast, a similar analysis of buried salt bridges  in the complex between TEM-1 -lactamase and its protein  inhibitor, BLIP, yielded interaction energies of only 1-1.5  kcal/mol (52).
These differences underscore the apparent  influence of local environment on the magnitude of coupling  energies for even the same type of interaction.
Recently,  protein-protein interfaces have been described that are  dominated by bridging salt links (53, 54).
The energetic  contribution of salt bridges in such highly charged interfaces,  which are strikingly different from those of other proteinprotein complexes of known structure, remains to be evaluated.
  No correlation is observed between number of van der  Waals contacts and coupling energies for the residue pairs  tested.
For example, Gint for the interaction between  VHTyr53 and Asp101HEL is effectively zero (-0.2 kcal/mol),  based on the experimental error of our measurement ((0.5  kcal/mol), despite the loss of 12 van der Waals contacts  (Table 3).
Since both residues are located at the periphery  of the interface (Figure 2), the loss of complementarity at  this solvent-accessible site may be compensated by local  rearrangements in solvent structure, including the incorporation of bound waters in place of the truncated side chains.
If  so, this suggests that the strength of van der Waals interactions between protein atoms within the VHTyr53-Asp101HEL  residue pair is comparable to that between the protein atoms  and water, such that the protein-protein contacts make little  or no net contribution to complex stabilization.
At the other  extreme, a Gint value of 3.1 kcal/mol was measured  between VHTrp98 and Tyr20HEL, in which only a single van  der Waals contact is lost in the double mutant (Table 3).
  Most likely, this large coupling energy is dominated by  hydrophobic interactions arising from the burial of two  aromatic residues near the center of the interface, isolated  from bulk solvent.
  Residues VLTrp96 and Arg21HEL display a negative  coupling energy of -1.1 kcal/mol, indicating that the  interaction between them destabilizes the HyHEL-63/HEL  complex.
Superposition of free HEL in three crystal forms  (39-41) onto bound HEL in the HyHEL-63/HEL complex  (13) reveals significant differences in the conformation the  Arg21HEL side chain (not shown).
Thus, the entropic cost of  freezing this flexible side chain in the complex may exceed  the energy gained from formation of a long (3.3 ) hydrogen  bond that is partially exposed to solvent.
  Double mutant cycles were also constructed for two  residue pairs not involved in direct interactions in the crystal  structure: VLSer91-Tyr20HEL and VLSer91-Arg21HEL.
While  Gint for the VLSer91-Arg21HEL pair (-0.5 kcal/mol) is  only slightly greater than experimental error, Gint for the  VLSer91-Tyr20HEL pair (1.1 kcal/mol) equals or exceeds the  coupling energies for 6 of the 11 residue pairs tested that  form direct contacts across the binding interface (Table 3).
  It may result from secondary interactions through adjacent  residues, such as VLAsn32, that contact both VLSer91 and  Tyr20HEL in the complex.
  CONCLUSIONS  The HyHEL-63/HEL complex may be viewed in the  context of other protein-protein complexes that have been  similarly analyzed in order to draw some general conclusions  concerning the nature of hot spots and the interpretation of  mutagenesis data.
Bogan and Thorn (1) noted that hot spot  residues identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis tend to  cluster at the center of interfaces, as in the HyHEL-63/HEL  complex, although a number of exceptions have been  documented (7-10, 16).
This observation led to the proposal  (the O-ring hypothesis) that occlusion of bulk solvent is, in  most cases, a necessary condition for residues to be in hot  spots (1).
According to this hypothesis, the O-ring formed  by peripheral residues generates suitable dielectric and  solvation conditions for hot spots of interaction energy.
  Indeed, a lower effective dielectric, which may exist at the  center of protein-protein interfaces compared to the periphery, is believed to increase the strength of hydrogen bonds,  while the effective hydrophobicity of central residues may  be significantly greater than that of peripheral ones (55, 56).
  However, the possibility also exists that the functional  distinction between central and peripheral residues observed  in mutagenesis studies simply indicates that side-chain atoms  Table 3: Coupling Energies between the Indicated Amino Acid  Pairs in the HyHEL-63/HEL Complex as Measured by Double  Mutant Cyclesa  HyHEL-63 HEL  Gint  (kcal/mol)  number and type of side  chain-side chain interactions  lost in double mutant  VLN32 K96 4.4 1 buried hydrogen bond and 3 van  der Waals contacts  VLS91 R21 -0.5 no direct contacts, 8.3  apart  VLS91 Y20 1.1 no direct contacts, 4.6  apart  VLY96 R21 -1.1 1 hydrogen bond, partially buried  VLY96 S100 1.0 1 van der Waals contact  VHD32 K97 3.0 1 salt bridge and 2 van der Waals  contacts  VHY53 W62 0.7 1 van der Waals contact  VHY53 W63 0.3 3 van der Waals contacts  VHY53 L75 1.5 2 van der Waals contacts  VHY53 D101 -0.2 12 van der Waals contacts  VHW98 S100 0.4 2 van der Waals contacts  VHW98 K97 1.8 8 van der Waals contacts  VHW98 Y20 3.1 1 van der Waals contact  a Coupling energies are defined as Gint ) GABfAB +  GABfAB - GABfAB, where A and B represent wild-type residues  and A and B represent the mutated residues.

  20 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 1, 2003 Li et al.on the periphery are more easily replaced by water in a  nondisruptive manner than atoms at the center of binding  interfaces (6, 38).
Consistent with this idea, X-ray crystallographic analysis of HEL mutants in complex with antibody  D1.3, and of D1.3 mutants bound to HEL, have clearly  shown that extensive water-mediated interactions at solventaccessible sites on the periphery may replace direct hydrogen  bonds with little or no loss of binding affinity (16, 35).
  Moreover, we fail to observe such compensating interactions  at the center of the HyHEL-63/HEL interface, where bound  waters only partially occupy cavities created by side chain  truncations, replacing only a few of the direct proteinprotein interactions lost upon mutagenesis (Figure 3).
Double  mutant cycles, where interactions between amino acids are  treated within their native context, represent an improved  method for dissecting binding energetics (43-45).
Importantly, HyHEL-63 and HEL residues identified as hot spots  by single mutant analysis were also found to make critical  interactions in double mutant cycles.
However, it must be  noted that even interaction energies derived from double  mutant cycles may include, in addition to direct interaction  energies, indirect effects arising from neighboring residues,  conformational changes, and solvent rearrangements (52, 57).
  Recently, several more sophisticated approaches have been  described for probing hot spots and measuring interaction  energies in protein-protein interfaces.
Instead of only  analyzing individual interactions, Schreiber and colleagues  (52) examined binding units composed of the interacting  residues and their neighbors to estimate the strength of  hydrogen bonds in the TEM-1 -lactamase/BLIP interface.
  A complex in which all side chains in the binding unit were  replaced by alanine was taken as a reference state to which  combinations of side chains were introduced.
After using  double mutant cycles to determine interaction energies for  residue pairs in the absence of neighbors, the addition of  neighboring residues allowed the evaluation of their cooperative effects on the interactions.
We took advantage of the  relative accommodation of mutations of hot spot residue  VLTrp92 of D1.3 to estimate the magnitude of the hydrophobic effect in the D1.3/HEL interface (36).
By replacing  VLTrp92 with residues bearing increasingly smaller side  chains and determining the crystal structures and thermodynamic binding parameters for each of the resulting mutant  complexes, we demonstrated a correlation between binding  free energy and apolar buried surface area that corresponds  to 21 cal/mol/2  , in excellent agreement with transfer free  energy values for small hydrophobic solutes, but lower than  the hydrophobic stabilization energy for protein folding.
The  thermodynamic map of the HyHEL-63/HEL interface described here provides the necessary framework for the  application of these, and related (58-60), methodologies to  this system to further our understanding of how structural  features contribute to the affinity and specificity of proteinprotein association reactions.
