M009810200  Steven A. Haney, Elizabeth Glasfeld, Cynthia Hale, David Keeney, Zhizhen He,  and Piet de Boer  From the Department of Infectious Disease, Wyeth-Ayerst Research, Pearl River, New York 10965 and the Department  of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Case Western Reserve University Medical School, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4960  The recruitment of ZipA to the septum by FtsZ is an  early, essential step in cell division in Escherichia coli.
  We have used polymerase chain reaction-mediated random mutagenesis in the yeast two-hybrid system to analyze this interaction and have identified residues  within a highly conserved sequence at the C terminus of  FtsZ as the ZipA binding site.
A search for suppressors of  a mutation that causes a loss of interaction (ftsZD373G)  identified eight different changes at two residues within  this sequence.
In vitro, wild type FtsZ interacted with  ZipA with a high affinity in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas FtsZD373G failed to interact.
  Two mutant proteins examined restored this interaction  significantly.
In vivo, the alleles tested are significantly  more toxic than the wild type ftsZ and cannot complement a deletion.
We have shown that a fusion, which  encodes the last 70 residues of FtsZ in the two-hybrid  system, is sufficient for the interaction with FtsA and  ZipA. However, when the wild type sequence is compared with one that encodes FtsZD373G, no interaction  was seen with either protein.
Mutations surrounding  Asp-373 differentially affected the interactions of FtsZ  with ZipA and FtsA, indicating that these proteins bind  the C terminus of FtsZ differently.
  In bacteria, the study of cell division has defined many genes  active in the formation and cleavage of a septum (13).
Currently, the earliest known step in the development of the septum is the formation of the Z-ring, a circular polymeric structure formed by the tubulin-like protein FtsZ (4).
The cell  division machinery assembles on the Z-ring in a sequential  manner.
Two proteins that act early in cell division, and directly on the Z-ring, are FtsA and ZipA (510).
The structure of  FtsA has been solved recently (11), and it supports previous  indications that it is similar to actin (12, 13).
FtsA may function  by linking septum formation to peptidoglycan synthesis (8, 14).
  ZipA is an integral membrane protein that causes FtsZ fibers to  bundle in vitro (15, 16).
ZipA is thought to stabilize the FtsZ  rings, in part because moderate overexpression of zipA can  suppress the ftsZ84 allele, which confers a defect in Z-ring  formation (16).
The structure of the highly conserved C-terminal fragment of ZipA has been solved by x-ray crystallography  and NMR, and it shows conservation to several RNA-binding  proteins (17, 18).
  Genetic analyses of cell division have identified many genes  as conditional alleles, but detailed genetic analysis describing  an individual proteinzprotein interaction is difficult, because  many interacting proteins are involved, often simultaneously  (1921). Because of this, it is advantageous to develop a surrogate system that allows the study of a proteinzprotein interaction through genetic analysis (i.e. the study of a  proteinzprotein interaction through the identification and characterization of mutations).
The two-hybrid system of yeast  (Y2H)1 is one such system, because of the wide range of genetic  techniques that exist for yeast (22, 23) and because the twohybrid system itself is a robust system for characterizing  proteinzprotein interactions in vivo (24).
Thus, it is a relatively  simple extension of yeast genetic analysis to examine a twohybrid interaction genetically.
Previous work has indicated  that the C terminus of FtsZ is important for the interaction  with both ZipA and FtsA (9, 10, 15, 21, 25).
To better define the  interaction between FtsZ and ZipA, we have analyzed this  interaction in yeast genetically.
Using a mutation in ftsZ that  reduces the interaction with zipA in the Y2H system, we have  searched for intragenic suppressors (additional mutations  within ftsZ that reverse the phenotype of the initial loss-offunction mutation).
This search has identified mutations  within a small segment of ftsZ that encodes a conserved sequence at the C terminus.
We have characterized the effect of  these mutations on the interactions with ZipA and FtsA and  determined the effect of the mutations on cell division.

  Construction of PlasmidsAll oligonucleotides used in this study are  listed in Table 2s.
FtsZ and ZipA were cloned by PCR amplification of  genomic DNA from Escherichia coli strain MG1655.
Wild type ftsZ  cloned into pGAD424 was done by PCR amplification of the ftsZ gene  from pDR3 using the oligos FtsZ-59 and FtsZ-39.
The amplified PCR  product was digested with MfeI and SalI and cloned into pGAD424 that  was digested with EcoRI and BamHI.
zipA was amplified by PCR using  oligos ZipA-59 and ZipA-39.
The ZipA-59 oligo results in a PCR product  that deletes the membrane-spanning portion of the ZipA gene product.
  The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated  into pLexA, to generate plasmid pSH47.
This fragment was subsequently excised and cloned into pGAD424, which was digested identically to generate plasmid pSH230.
The plasmid pSH228 was constructed by PCR amplification of plasmid pSH256 with oligos FtsZ59(311) and FtsZ-39.
The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI  and SalI and cloned into pAS2-1.
pSH229 was constructed in an identical manner, except that pSH41 was used as the template for the PCR  reaction.
pSH100 was constructed by PCR amplification of pAS1-ftsA,  which was generously provided by Sandy Silverman, with oligos  FtsA-59 and ADHt.
The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI  and SalI and ligated into pAS2-1.
Plasmid pSH232 was constructed by  subcloning the ftsA gene into pGAD424, which had been digested with  EcoRI and SalI as well.
  Construction of Yeast StrainsStrain SHy9 was generated by growing strain CG 1945 serially for two 10-ml overnight cultures, with about  a 105 cell inoculum each, and plating on SC plates supplemented with  0.1% FOA, and colonies were allowed to grow for 5 days.
Several  colonies that grew were rechecked for all phenotypes, including loss of  GAL1p-lacZ reporter activity.
Strains SHy22 and SHy23 were generated by introducing pHO (kindly provided by Kim Arndt) into strain  SHy9 and growing a transformant in 10 ml of SC-URA overnight.
Cells  were streaked onto a YPD plate and allowed to grow for 3 days.
This  plate was then replica printed onto an SC plate supplemented with  0.1% FOA.
Colonies from this plate were patched onto a new YPD plate,  grown overnight, and replica-printed onto an SPO plate.
This plate was  incubated at room temperature for 24 h and then at 30 C for 5 days.
  Patches producing asci were then incubated with Zymolyase, and  spores were separated by the random spores technique and plated on  YPD (29).
SHy22 and SHy23 are strains from spores of the same patch  and differ only by mating type.
  PCR-mediated Mutagenesis and Selection of MutationsMutations  in FtsZ were generated by PCR amplification of pSH27 (pGAD424-  ftsZD45N,D373G) using Taq DNA polymerase and reaction conditions that  favored the incorporation of mutations.
Oligonucleotides used as primers for amplification were GAL4ad and ADHt.
These primers annealed  to the GAL4 activation domain and the ADH terminator regions, respectively, and produced a PCR product that included about 300 bp of  sequence on either side of the ftsZ gene.
These regions of homology  allowed for homologous recombination of the PCR fragment when cotransformed, with pGADGH vector DNA that had been linearized by  digestion with EcoRI and BamHI, into SHy63 (30).
Recombinants were  selected by leucine prototrophy.
In this work, cotransformation with  100 ng of plasmid DNA and PCR fragment (each) resulted in about 1000  colonies, whereas transformation by either the vector or the PCR fragment alone resulted in zero to four colonies when plated onto LT plates.
  The interactions between the mutagenized ftsZ gene and zipA were  tested by replica printing the transformants onto LHT plates supplemented with 0.5 mM AT.
Colonies that grew after 3 days when incubated at 37 C were scored as hits.
Each colony was grown as a 5-ml  culture and prepared using the Qiagen Qiaprep Turbo 8 miniprep kit as  described by the manufacturer, except that 0.5 mg of Zymolyase was  added per ml of buffer P1, and samples were incubated for 30 min at  30 C in this solution.
These preparations were used to transform E. coli  strain KC8 by electroporation, and colonies were selected by growth on  M9 plates that were supplemented with 50 mg/liter ampicillin, but  lacked leucine, as described by Golemis et al. (31).
Two to four colonies  from each transformation plate were grown and prepared with the  Qiagen miniprep kit again, this time without modification to the manufacturers instructions.
DNA from these preparations were analyzed  by restriction analysis, and reconfirmation of the phenotypes was  achieved by transforming into SHy23 again and rescoring the AT  resistance.
  Site-directed Mutagenesis of Plasmids for Expression in Yeast and  BacteriaMutations identified in the previous section were further  characterized by introducing the identified mutation into a pGAD424-  ftsZ construct.
This was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis  using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit by Stratagene.  Mutagenesis was performed as described by the manufacturer.
Oligonucleotides used in this work were: D373G/T, D373G/B; D373S/T,  D373S/B; D373G, P375L/T, D373G, P375L/B, as listed in Table 2s.
For  the alanine-scanning mutations, site-directed changes were introduced  into pGAD-ftsZD373G (pSH-201).
The mutation that results in a change  from D to G at position 373 also results in a loss of the EcoRV restriction  site.
Each of the oligo pairs encode a change that restores this restriction site, in addition to the change at the codon to be changed to alanine.
  The oligos used were: D370A/T, D370A/B; Y371A/T, Y371A/B; L372A/T,  L372A/B; F377A/T, F377A/B; L378A/, L378A/B; R379A/T, R379A/B;  K380A/T, K380A/B; Q381A/T, Q381A/B. Candidate clones were  screened for the reacquisition of the EcoRV site.
  Purification of FtsZ and ZipA and Assay of the FtsZzZipA Interaction  in VitroThe wild type and mutant FtsZs were expressed with the  N-terminal biotin tag MAGGLNDIFEAQKIEWH (32) to enable detection in an ELISA.
The lysine in this sequence is biotinylated in vivo by  the E. coli enzyme BirA. Plasmids were constructed by inserting the  coding sequence for the biotin tag between the NcoI and NdeI sites of  pET28 (Novagen) using the oligos BIOTAG/T and BIOTAG/B. In addition, birA was amplified from the plasmid pBIOTRX-BirA (26) by PCR  using the oligos BirA 59 and BirA 39, digested with HinD III and XhoI  and ligated into the HindIII and XhoI sites of the same vector as the  biotin tag to give the vector pETbio-birA. The genes ftsZ, ftsZD373G,  ftsZD373S, and ftsZD373G,P375L were subcloned from the vectors pDB312,  pEG028, pSH187, or pSH189, respectively, into the NdeI and HindIII  sites of pETbio-birA to give plasmids pEG045, pEG051, pEG052, and  pEG053.
  Biotin-FtsZ and its mutants were expressed in the E. coli strain  BL21(DE3)pLysS. Expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) once the A600 of the culture was between  0.5 and 1.0.
At the same time, D-biotin was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. Cells were incubated at 37 C for another 23 h, centrifuged, and resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 1  mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol) and stored at 270 C.
The proteins were  then purified according to a previous report (33).
  Protein concentrations of biotin-FtsZ and its mutants were determined by the Bradford method.
The extent of incorporation of biotin  was determined by measuring the displacement of 2-(49-hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid from avidin.
In short, 40 ml of protein sample or  buffer was mixed with 360 ml of 0.5 mg/ml avidin and 0.3 mM 2-(49-  hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid in 100 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM  NaCl, pH 7.2.
The decrease in absorbance at 500 nM was measured, and  the concentration of biotin was determined using De500 3 1023 5 34.
  The biotin-tagged FtsZs were between 50% and 75% biotinylated.
  ZipA-(23328) was overexpressed from the plasmid pDB348 in  BL21(DE3)plysS. Expression was induced as for biotin-FtsZ, above, and  the cells were centrifuged, resuspended, and stored similarly.
At the  time of purification, the cells were thawed, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mM, and the cells were lysed by passage through a  French press.
The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation at  100,000 3 g for 1 h, and ZipA-(23328) was precipitated by adding  ammonium sulfate to 35% saturation.
The ammonium sulfate pellet  was dissolved in buffer A and dialyzed against buffer A overnight.
  ZipA-(23328) was purified to homogeneity by passage over a Mono-Q  column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and elution with a 50230 mM  gradient of KCl in buffer A. The protein concentration of ZipA-(23328)  was determined as described according to Gill and von Hippel (34).
  The interaction between ZipA-(23328) and biotin-FtsZ and its mutants was assayed in an ELISA format.
ZipA-(23328) was immobilized  in the wells of an Immulon 4HBX 96-well plate in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5,  100 mM NaCl at 1 mg/ml overnight at 4 C.
Unbound ZipA-(23328) was  removed, and the wells were blocked with blocking buffer (0.2% bovine  serum albumin in PBS-T (10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.5,  140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.05% Tween 20)).
After two washes with  PBS-T, biotin-FtsZ and its mutants were added at various concentrations in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature.
Unbound FtsZ was  removed, and the wells were washed three times with PBS-T. Next, 0.1  mg/ml streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in blocking buffer  was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were  washed four times after the removal of the conjugate.
The horseradish  peroxidase substrate o-phenylenediamine was then added in sodium  phosphate-citric acid buffer, color development was stopped after a few  minutes with 1.3 N H2SO4, and the absorbance at 490 nm was  measured.
  Cell Biology MethodsE. coli morphology was determined by phase  contrast microscopy of E. coli cells as described previously (5).

  b-Galactosidase AssayCultures to be tested were grown for 36 h in  5 ml of SC-Leu-Trp media.
New cultures were inoculated with 100 ml of  the overnight cultures, and the new cultures were grown for 16 h. Cells  densities were between 0.8 and 1.0 A600 for these strains.
Samples of  these cultures were assayed for LacZ activity in quadruplicate, in a  96-well microtiter plate (100 ml per well).
Samples were mixed with 100  ml of lysis buffer and substrate (40 ml of Promega cell lysis buffer, 40 ml  of 0.125 mg/ml 4-methylumbelliferyl b-D-galactoside (Sigma), and 20 ml  of 103 b-galactosidase assay salts).
Samples were incubated at 30 C  for 48 h with shaking and read on a Victor II fluorescence plate reader  from Wallac.
Fluorescence intensity increased with time, and after 8 h,  negative control wells showed about 400 units, whereas positive control  wells for the ZipAzFtsZ interaction showed about 50,000 units and for  the FtsAzFtsZ interaction showed about 10,000 units.
  RESULTS  A Two-hybrid System That Allows for the Selection of Mutations in ftsZ, which Affect the FtsZzZipA InteractionOur interest in developing a genetic system to characterize the  FtsZzZipA interaction was piqued by the observation that a  mutation in ftsZ resulted in a reduced interaction with zipA,  when studied in the yeast two-hybrid system.
This observation  was made when one of several clones derived by PCR amplification of E. coli genomic DNA was subcloned into the two  standard two-hybrid systems.
When ftsZN45D,D373G was expressed as a fusion to the B42 activation domain, an interaction  was seen with zipA expressed as a fusion to the LexA DNA  binding domain.
This interaction could clearly be scored in  standard analyses, such as on indicator plates containing  5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl b-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal), and  by leucine prototrophy, but was significantly less robust than a  fusion to wild type ftsZ (Fig. 1).
No interaction was seen when  the mutated ftsZ allele was examined in the galactose system  (Fig. 2B, and results not shown).
An examination of the mutations introduced during cloning suggested that one of the mutations could be important for the FtsZzZipA interaction.
The  first change was N45D, which has been characterized by Wang  et al. (35) as one that affects the GTPase activity of FtsZ. This  change was discounted as the cause of the altered interaction  with ZipA by several experiments (Ref. 15, and results not  shown).
This evidence includes the observation that ZipA binding to FtsZ is not affected by guanine nucleotides and that  deletion analysis of FtsZ had already shown that the GTPase  domain of FtsZ was not involved in binding to ZipA. The other  mutation, D373G, resulted in a change in a highly conserved  region of the C terminus of FtsZ (discussed below).
At the time  this project began, the role of this region in cell division had not  been characterized.
This mutation provided us with an opportunity to study how a mutation with diminished function could  be used to characterize this interaction.
  The lack of growth in the galactose system provided a clear  strategy for determining which residues in FtsZ facilitate binding to ZipA, through the selection of intragenic suppressors.
  Selection of suppressors that restored the FtsZzZipA interaction was achieved by PCR mutagenesis of the whole ftsZ gene  as cloned into pGAD424, using primers that annealed to the  GAL4 activation domain fragment and the ADH terminator.
  The primers allowed ;300-bp extensions to both ends of the  ftsZ gene.
These extensions provided regions of homology that  allowed the PCR products to be cloned by recombination (Fig.  2A) (30).
The PCR products were transformed directly into  strain SHy63 (a derivative of the Gal-Y2H strain CG1945 that  had been previously transformed with pAS2-1-zipA), with the  pGADGH vector that had been linearized, and is therefore not  stable in yeast unless it has been repaired.
Repair could be  achieved by homologous recombination with the ends of the  PCR products containing portions of the GAL4 activation domain gene, and the ADHt terminator.
Transformation into  strain SHy63 allowed the selection of recombinant plasmids  expressing ftsZ alleles.
Alleles interacting with the Gal4bd-zipA  fusion were identified through the activation of the GAL1pHIS3 reporter.
73 colonies grew on plates that lacked histidine  and were supplemented with 1 mM aminotriazole, two of which  are shown in Fig. 2B.
Plasmids were recovered and retested in  yeast, and 12 plasmids were purified that could be recovered,  hadnormalrestrictionanalysispatterns,andconferredplasmiddependent phenotypes (histidine prototrophy only when introduced into a strain that carried pAS2-1-zipA).
The ftsZ genes in  these 12 plasmids were sequenced to identify any mutations.
  Eight of the 12 plasmids contain mutations in the conserved C  terminus region.
The remaining four plasmids do not contain  mutations that result in amino acid changes in FtsZ are presumed to contain mutations that affect the copy number of the  plasmid or the expression of the Gal4zFtsZ hybrid protein and  have not been characterized further.
The eight mutations identify five different residue changes from the original plasmid.
  Two mutations are reversions to the wild type aspartate residue at position 373, two mutations change the Asp-373 residue  to serine, and one changes this glycine to cysteine.
The remaining suppressors change the highly conserved proline residue at  position 375 to leucine (twice) and to serine.
These mutations  are indicated in Fig. 3.
The residues that comprise the C terminus of the E. coli FtsZ are shown.
Residues in capital letters  show conservation among FtsZ proteins from prokaryotes and  plants.
The mutations identified in yeast that are critical for  the interaction of FtsZ with ZipA map within this sequence,  and no mutations from other regions of ftsZ were identified,  indicating that these residues may comprise the principal region of interaction with ZipA.  The suggestion that these mutations have significant effects  on the interaction of FtsZ with ZipA was confirmed by introducing some of them into an unmutagenized pGAD424-ftsZ  plasmid, and rechecking the phenotypes.
Wild type ftsZ was  compared with ftsZD373G, ftsZD373S, and ftsZD373G, P375L.
We  checked the interaction with zipA and ftsA in the galactose  Y2H system (Fig. 4).
The latter interaction was examined,  because other work has suggested that FtsA also interacts with  FtsZ at its C terminus, and we were therefore interested in  characterizing this interaction (10, 21, 35).
As can be seen in  Fig. 4, the FtsZzFtsA interaction is also highly sensitive to  mutations in the C terminus of FtsZ. All strains tested show  good growth on plates supplemented with histidine (Fig. 4A).
  The interaction of ZipA with FtsZ is best scored on plates  TABLE I  Complementation of a ftsZ deletion by alleles of ftsZ expressed from a  regulated promoter  Plasmids were transformed to strain PB143/pCX41 [dadR2 trpE2  trpA2 tna2 recA<Tn10 ftsZo  /repAts ftsZl  ], and transformants were  grown overnight at 30 C in LB 1 Ap (50 mg/ml) 1 Cam (50 mg/ml) 1  glucose (0.1%).
Cultures were diluted in LB to A600 5 1 3 1027  , and  0.1-ml aliquots were spread on four plates.
One plate containing LB 1  Ap (50 mg/ml) 1 glucose (0.2%) was incubated at 30 C.
The other plates  were incubated at 42 C.
These plates contained LB 1 Ap (50 mg/ml)  supplemented with no. 5, or 10 mM IPTG.
For each plate, the number of  colony forming units was determined.
Plasmids used in this experiment  were: vector, pMLB1113; wild type ftsZ, pDR3; ftsZD373G, pSH179;  ftsZD373S, pSH181; ftsZD373G,P375L, pSH183.

Expression of the GAL4-zipA fusion confers a higher  background than either the vector control or the GAL4-ftsA  fusion, giving growth on plates without AT, regardless of which  GAL4AD construct is expressed.
In the case of ftsA, the interaction is more sensitive, and its interactions with ftsZ can be  scored on plates lacking histidine and AT (Fig. 4B).
In this case,  ftsA interacts well with wild type ftsZ, and with the ftsZD373S  allele.
It does not interact with either allele that changes the  Asp-373 residue to glycine.
  Further characterization of the interaction between ZipA  and FtsZ was performed in vitro with purified proteins.
ZipA-  (23328), the soluble form of the protein, which lacks the Nterminal membrane-spanning domain, and FtsZ proteins, expressed from the alleles examined in Fig. 3, were purified from  E. coli to homogeneity.
The interactions were tested in an  ELISA, as shown in Fig. 5.
Wild type FtsZ shows a high affinity  for ZipA, having an apparent dissociation constant of 0.19  (60.009) mM. The affinity of the FtsZD373G mutant for ZipA was  too low to be quantified in this assay, despite the protein being  otherwise well behaved, indicating that the mutation has a  significant impact on the interaction of these two proteins.
Two  suppressors were analyzed as well, FtsZD373S and FtsZD373G,  P375L, and were shown to have dissociation constants of 6.2 (6  0.9) mM and 1.3 (6 0.2) mM, respectively.
Both proteins show  greatly improved interactions with ZipA, although neither protein interacts with ZipA as well as wild type FtsZ.  FtsA Also Binds to the Conserved Carboxyl Terminus of FtsZ,  but in a Manner Different from ZipAThe results in Fig. 4, as  well as work by others (9, 10, 15, 21, 35), strongly implicate the  C terminus of FtsZ as playing a critical role in the interaction  of FtsA, in addition to ZipA. We were interested in examining  the role of additional residues in the conserved C terminus of  FtsZ in binding to FtsA as well as ZipA. In Fig. 6, we examined  the role of the C terminus in binding to ZipA and FtsA in the  Y2H system.
In this experiment, we expressed a segment of the  TABLE II  Dominant effects of ftsZ mutations expressed in E. coli  Plasmids were transformed to strain CH3 [dadR2 trpE2 trpA2 tna2 recA<Tn10], and transformants were grown overnight at 37 C in LB 1 Ap  (50 mg/ml) 1 glucose (0.1%).
Cultures were diluted 200-fold in LB 1 Ap (50 mg/ml) supplemented with the indicated concentration of IPTG, and  growth was continued at 37 C for 45 h until A600 5 0.81.0.

The interaction of ftsZ with zipA in the yeast twohybrid system is specific and sensitive to mutations in ftsZ.  Diploid strains were constructed by mating EGY48 containing either  pLexA or pSH47 (pLexA-zipA) with YM4271 containing pB42, pSH256  (pB42-ftsZ, wild type), or pSH48 (pB42-ftsZ D39N,D373G).
Overnight cultures were spotted into a microtiter plate containing 100 ml of media per  well, and 5-ml spots were applied onto plates using a pin arrayer, as  indicated in the figure.
Plates were incubated at 30 C for 4 days.
  FIG. 2.
Isolation of intragenic suppressors of the ftsZD373G mutation.
A, mutations in ftsZ were generated by mutagenic PCR amplification of the ftsZD373G allele as a construct in pGAD424.
Primers for  the amplification were to sequences about 300 bp away from the multiple cloning site of the vector, allowing for cloning by in vivo recombination and expression of clones carrying mutations that restored the  interaction of ftsZ with zipA. B, growth phenotypes of pGADGH-ftsZ  plasmids recovered from the screen.
Plasmids were transformed into  yeast strain CG1945, along with either plasmid pAS2-1 or plasmid  pSH227 (pAS2-1-zipA), as indicated, grown overnight, and spotted onto  the indicated plates.

The ftsZD373G mutation, expressed in a  similar construct, clearly indicates that this residue plays a key  role in the interaction of both fusions assayed.
  Next, we sought to determine whether ZipA and FtsA interact with identical residues in the FtsZ C terminus.
Eight additional residues within this conserved sequence were mutated  individually to alanine.
Strains expressing derivatives of  pGAD424-ftsZ that have specific residues changed to alanine  are indicated in Fig. 7.
The strains were characterized for  histidine prototrophy and for b-galactosidase activity, as  shown in the figure.
In this experiment, strain CG1945 was  used for the bait plasmids.
In these diploids, background  growth of the strains containing pAS2-1-zipA were more comparable to that of the strains containing pAS2-1-ftsA, so only  the SC-LHT plate is shown.
Robust growth on plates containing 0.5 mM AT was only seen with the zipAzftsZ interactions  (data not shown).
  Phenotypic Consequences of Mutations That Change Residues in the FtsZ C TerminusThe mutations described above  were assayed in E. coli to determine whether there were any  biological consequences associated with them.
The mutations  were introduced into pDR3, a plasmid that expresses ftsZ under the control of the lac promoter, and can complement a ftsZ  deletion when induced by IPTG.
Two assays were performed.
  In the first, ftsZ alleles expressed under a regulated promoter  were characterized for their ability to complement an ftsZ  deletion.
The results are presented in Table I. pDR3 efficiently  complements in the presence of IPTG, whereas none of the  mutants can.
Additional effects can be seen in Table II, where  the expression of ftsZ from the same plasmids as those in Table  I are examined for dominant effects.
Expression of extrachromosomal ftsZ is toxic at high levels, as can be seen when a  strain carrying pDR3 is exposed to high concentrations of  IPTG, which expresses the plasmid copy of the FtsZ gene to  high levels.
  Dominant effects can be seen for all of the mutated alleles,  with strong effects seen with the ftsZD373G allele and the  ftsZD373G,P375L allele.
In these cases, an Sep2 phenotype is seen  at substantially lower concentrations of IPTG.
The same is true  for the ftsZD373S allele, which has a more modest phenotype  relative to the other mutations in this assay as well, but is still  substantially more toxic than the wild type gene expressed on  a plasmid.
Thus, a comparison of the ftsZ alleles with the wild  type ftsZ indicates that all of the mutations examined in Tables  I and II show profound cell division defects.
  DISCUSSION  Recently, the bacterial cell division proteins FtsZ, ZipA, and  FtsA have been structurally characterized, as well as the  ZipAzFtsZ interaction (11, 17, 18, 36).
In addition to these  structural characterizations, functional and biological studies,  such as those described in this report, will allow us to underFIG. 3.

  11984 ZipA Binding Site of FtsZ Identified by Intragenic Suppressors   at Georgian Court College on March 11, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from stand how biologically important residues function in these  interactions.
Results presented here show that several residues  within the conserved C terminus of FtsZ play essential roles in  cell division, and minor changes within this sequence can have  lethal consequences.
  The results presented in this study that characterize the role  of individual residues in the biological context of the Y2H  system are in general agreement with the in vitro characterization of Mosyak et al. (17).
One area where differences were  seen is the first group of conserved residues: Asp-370, Tyr-371,  and Leu-372.
All three residues were shown to contribute important binding energy in the BIAcore system, but only the  Y371A change was shown to be important in the Y2H system.
  The L372A change functioned well in the Y2H system, despite  being the most important of the three in vitro.
It is possible that  the FtsZ binding pocket of ZipA can accommodate the D370A  and L372A changes in the Y2H system more effectively than it  can in vitro or that it can accommodate the Y371A change in  the in vitro system better than in the Y2H system.
Two mutations, L372A and R379A, affected the interaction with ftsA to a  greater extent than the interaction with zipA. The severe effect  of the R379A change is especially interesting, because structural data show that the arginine residue is solvent-exposed  when bound by ZipA, which is consistent with the modest effect  with zipA in yeast.
These results clearly indicate that, although  both proteins bind the same C terminus core of FtsZ, they bind  to different residues within this core.
Residues that were identified as playing a major role in the interaction in vitro showed  similarly significant roles in the experiments presented here.
  This work was initiated through an exhaustive search for  suppressors of the loss-of-function allele, ftsZD373G.
We identified only residues in the conserved C terminus, despite the fact  that the entire ftsZ gene was subjected to mutagenic PCR.
As  these results were first obtained, it was surprising that secondsite intragenic suppressors were obtained at only one residue,  Pro-375.
If this conserved segment was the site of the interaction with ZipA, then one might expect that mutations that  increase the affinity of ZipA for the D373G mutant of FtsZ  would be restricted to this region, but the presence of suppressors at a single residue was not anticipated.
Structural studies  have shed some light on our results (17, 18).
Although the  Asp-373 residue plays a critical role in the interaction between  FtsZ and ZipA, it is not directly involved in the interaction with  ZipA per se.
Rather, it plays a critical role in defining the  structure of the residues that contact ZipA significantly.
This is  illustrated in Fig. 8.
This figure shows the FtsZ peptide bound  by the C-terminal domain of ZipA, as determined by x-ray  crystallography, and is depicted using the program RIBBONS  (37).
The Asp-373 side chain contributes a hydrogen bond to the  a-carbon backbone, which helps define the transition from  b-sheet structure to a-helix.
The change to glycine introduces a  significant structural change, including the removal of this  critical hydrogen bond.
The Pro-375 residue also plays a structural role in defining the ZipA binding site.
The residues that  directly interact with ZipA are interspersed through the sequence that includes the Asp-373 and Pro-375 residues, in  particular, residues Ile-374, Phe-377, and Leu-378 (17).
Therefore, the structure of the FtsZ C terminus is critical because of  the number of interactions that occur along the a-carbon chain  of FtsZ (17, 18).
The best explanation that can be offered from  the structural data is that the D373G change perturbs the  orientation of the interacting residues, and this perturbation is  alleviated by the P375L mutation.
In the inset of Fig. 8, the  D373G and P375L mutations are modeled into the structure.
  The inset shows where the hydrogen bond is lost, and where the  leucine side chain would interact with ZipA. Further structural  studies will be required to determine whether the P375L mutation provides an additional hydrophobic interaction with  ZipA or whether it allows hydrophobic capping of the FtsZ  peptide to restore the conformation of the interacting residues.
  Finally, although the number of mutations that can negatively  affect an interaction is fairly large, the number of possible  changes that can increase the strength of the interaction seems  to be small.

  ZipA Binding Site of FtsZ Identified by Intragenic Suppressors 11985   at Georgian Court College on March 11, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Although none of the recent studies can conclude that the  conserved C terminus residues of FtsZ comprise the complete  target sequence for ZipA, it is certainly true that the region  plays a critical role in the interaction with ZipA. The interaction of the FtsZ C terminus with ZipA has been characterized  extensively (5, 9, 17, 18, 21).
Additionally, the results of Fig. 6  indicate the C-terminal tail of FtsZ is sufficient for the interaction of FtsZ with both ZipA and FtsA. The portion of FtsZ  encoded by the Y2H fusion plasmid in this figure consists of the  last 72 residues of FtsZ. The interaction of ZipA with a  MBPzFtsZ-(311383) fusion protein, with the wild type protein,  and the 17-residue peptide are all similar, as measured in a  BIAcore biosensor assay.2 Therefore, it is possible to conclude  that the mutations recovered in this study were limited to the  conserved residues of the FtsZ C terminus, because this region  defines the principal ZipA interaction site.
Thus, we have met  a goal of this study, which was to use a random genetic approach to help define a proteinzprotein interaction.
  The suppressors identified in this study provide information  about the sensitivity of the cell division machinery to changes  in the interactions of its components.
The FtsZD373G allele has  profound effects on cell division and viability, as well as conferring on the mutant protein a greatly reduced affinity for  ZipA and for FtsA. For these proteins, these results are consistent with the importance of their proper interaction with  FtsZ. The suppressors show that these interactions are extremely sensitive.
Neither of the alleles characterized in detail  in this study (FtsZD373G, P375L or FtsZD373S) complement a  deletion.
In the case of the double mutation, this is less informative about the relation between affinity for ZipA and function,  because it shows a dramatically reduced affinity for FtsA,  which complicates our determination of why this mutation fails  to complement.
The other allele, ftsZD373S causes more modest  changes on the interaction with ftsA. No difference from wild  type could be seen between ftsA and ftsZD373S by Y2H assay,  indicating that any change is relatively minor.
The data, including Y2H and the in vitro analysis in Fig. 5, suggests that it  is more likely that this allele fails to complement because of  altered interactions with zipA. Although it is possible that  another protein also interacts with FtsZ at this site, the simplest conclusion to draw at this time is that these proteins  cannot tolerate even moderate changes in their interactions.
  If the interaction characterized in this study represents an  important antibacterial target, it is necessary to show that the  interaction between ZipA and FtsZ is not just essential but is  very sensitive to interference.
Although it is true that many  proteinzprotein interactions are essential, their identification  as promising antibacterial targets depends on the interaction  being sensitive to interference.
In some cases, inhibition of  expression or activity by 50% can be lethal.
For many essential  genes, reducing expression by 95% or more can result in no  observable defect.
Several genes have been characterized that  are functional when they have activity at 1%, or less, of their  wild type levels.
Classic examples include nonsense mutations,  when their phenotypes can be alleviated by suppressor tRNAs  (38, 39).
The strength of a proteinzprotein interaction, or an  activity, as a pharmaceutical target can be evaluated by such  data.
Specifically, if reducing a proteinzprotein interaction moderately (5080%) has phenotypic consequences, then it could  be regarded as a strong pharmaceutical target.
If reducing the  interaction by 100-fold or greater is required to inhibit growth,  it may be problematic to find a drug that can achieve this level  of inhibition through its specific activity and pharmacokinetics,  in a true in vivo situation.
One of the reasons that cell division  is considered an important area of antibacterial research is  that many of its steps are very tightly controlled, and are very  sensitive to changes in expression levels.
Cell division is sensitive to changes of 2- to 4-fold in the expression of ftsZ, zipA,  and other genes (3, 6, 40).
If the FtsZzZipA interaction itself is  as sensitive, then this interaction has potential as a target.
The  results presented here argue that this is the case.
  It is clear that the yeast two-hybrid system is a powerful  system for the study of proteinzprotein interactions (24, 4145).
  In this report, we have taken advantage of commonly used  techniques for classical genetic analysis in yeast (i.e. the characterization of gene function through the identification of mutations) and applied them to a proteinzprotein interaction of E.  coli.
The need for such methods rests on the observation that  most important cellular processes (both eukaryotic and prokaryotic) are as dependent on proteinzprotein interactions as  they are on enzymological functions.
Although inhibition of  enzyme function is well understood as a means of developing  therapeutics, developing compounds that function through the  inhibition of proteinzprotein interactions is much less well understood (46).
Two clear examples of drugs that inhibit a  proteinzprotein interaction are that of FK506, which inhibits  the interaction of type I transforming growth factor-b receptors  with FKBP12 (47), and the peptidomimetic compound BILD  1263, which inhibits the interaction of the herpes simplex virus  ribonucleotide reductase subunits (48).
The polymerization of  tubulin by taxol is another interaction affected by a chemotherapeutic, but in this case taxol functions by stabilizing the  tubulin dimer associations (49, 50).
Proteinzprotein interactions may comprise large surface areas, and those that do  would be much less favorable as drug targets.
Applying the  yeast two-hybrid system as a vehicle for yeast genetic analysis  provides a fairly rapid and general method for determining the  nature of a proteinzprotein interaction.
