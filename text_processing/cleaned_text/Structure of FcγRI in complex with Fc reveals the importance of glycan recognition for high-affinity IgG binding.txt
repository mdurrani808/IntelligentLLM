Ravetch, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, and approved December 12, 2014 (received for review September 30, 2014)  Fc gamma receptor I (FcRI) contributes to protective immunity  against bacterial infections, but exacerbates certain autoimmune  diseases.
The sole high-affinity IgG receptor, FcRI plays a significant role in immunotherapy.
To elucidate the molecular mechanism of its high-affinity IgG binding, we determined the crystal  structure of the extracellular domains of human FcRI in complex  with the Fc domain of human IgG1.
FcRI binds to the Fc in a similar  mode as the low-affinity FcRII and FcRIII receptors.
In addition to  many conserved contacts, FcRI forms additional hydrogen bonds  and salt bridges with the lower hinge region of Fc.
Unique to the  high-affinity receptor-Fc complex, however, is the conformation of  the receptor D2 domain FG loop, which enables a charged KHR  motif to interact with proximal carbohydrate units of the Fc glycans.
Both the length and the charge of the FcRI FG loop are well  conserved among mammalian species.
Ala and Glu mutations of  the FG loop KHR residues showed significant contributions of His174 and Arg-175 to antibody binding, and the loss of the FG loop  glycan interaction resulted in an 20- to 30-fold decrease in FcRI  affinity to all three subclasses of IgGs.
Furthermore, deglycosylation of IgG1 resulted in a 40-fold loss in FcRI binding, demonstrating involvement of the receptor FG loop in glycan recognition.
  These results highlight a unique glycan recognition in FcRI function and open potential therapeutic avenues based on antibody  glycan engineering or small molecular glycan mimics to target  FcRI for certain autoimmune diseases.
  CD64 | FcgRI | IgG recognition | crystal structure | glycan recognition  I  gGs and pentraxins are circulating immune components that  directly recognize pathogens.
On formation of immune complexes or opsonization, they activate cellular response through Fc  receptors (FcRs) (1, 2).
The FcRs for IgGs include FcRI (CD64);  FcRII (CD32) with A, B, and C isoforms; and FcRIII (CD16)  with two isoforms (3).
Most of these are activating receptors either  containing an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif or associated with an FcR common  chain (4).
  FcRIIB is an inhibitory receptor that contains an intracellular  immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif.
FcRIIIB does  not have a cytosolic domain and is anchored to the plasma membrane through glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage.
The binding  affinity to IgG ranges from 108 M for FcRI to 105  107 M  for FcRII and III (3).
  FcRI plays an important role in the protection against bacterial infections, but also exacerbates certain autoimmune diseases (5).
Owing to its high-affinity antibody binding, FcRI is  important in antibody therapy as well (6, 7).
To date, the  structure of the ligand-bound high-affinity receptor has not been  determined, however.
Consequently, the mechanism of its highaffinity antibody recognition remains to be elucidated.
The role  of glycan in antibody function has been a subject of intense study.
  Differential glycosylation of Fc, notably fucosylated Fc, is known  to affect Fc receptor binding (8, 9).
Furthermore, sialylated IgGs  have been shown to be anti-inflammatory components of intravenous immunoglobulin (10, 11), and glycosylation affects  their binding to the low-affinity FcRIIB and FcRIII (1113).
  Structural evidence suggests that the conserved glycosylation at  Asn-297 of the constant region of IgG1 is important to maintain  the conformation of Fc for receptor binding (12, 14).
Whether Fc  receptors make significant glycan contacts for their IgG affinity is  not clear, however.
  Structures of the low-affinity Fc receptors have been determined with bound IgG-Fc (1518).
Unlike the other twodomain FcRs, FcRI contains three extracellular Ig-like domains,  designated D1, D2, and D3.
Earlier mutational analysis suggests  that D2 and D3 domains are important to confer high-affinity  antibody binding (19).
Recently, the structure of human FcRI  showed a close packing of the FcRI D1 and D2 domains resembling that of FceRI, and mutations in the FG loop of the  FcRI D2 domain reduced its IgG binding affinity (20).
The  mechanism of the high-affinity FcRI ligand recognition remains  unresolved.
To provide further insight into the high-affinity antibody recognition by FcRI, and to facilitate the development of  FcRI-mediated immunotherapy, we determined the structure of  the extracellular domains of human FcRIA in complex with the  Fc domain of human IgG1.
Our study identifies a structural  mechanism for high-affinity IgG binding by the receptor.
  Results and Discussions  Overall Structure of the FcRI-Fc Complex.
The nonglycosylated  extracellular region of human FcRI (residues 16289) was  expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously, and then  Significance  Fc gamma receptor I (FcRI) contributes to protective immunity  against bacterial infections, but exacerbates certain autoimmune diseases.
It is the sole high-affinity receptor for IgG and  plays a significant role in immunotherapy.
To date, there is no  structural information available on how the receptor recognizes its antibody ligands, however.
Consequently, the mechanism of its high-affinity IgG binding remains unclear.
We  report the first structure of the high-affinity Fc receptor in  complex with IgG-Fc.
The structural work reveals a direct receptor recognition of Fc glycan as a major factor in receptor  affinity.
This is the first example of Fc receptor making direct  glycan contact through protein residues.
The results have  implications for the use of glycan engineering in immunotherapy.

  Human IgG1-Fc (residues 216446) was expressed in stable  transfected CHO cells (7).
The FcRI and IgG1-Fc complex was  crystallized in a P1 space group and diffracted to 3.5- resolution.
The structure was solved by the molecular replacement  method using Phaser and refined using Phenix to final R factors  of 0.245 for Rcryst and 0.295 for Rfree (Table S1).
  There are two complexes in each crystallographic unit cell.
  Electron densities are well defined for the two N-terminal  domains of the receptor and for both chains of Fc (Fig. S1).
The  densities for the C-terminal D3 domain of FcRI are less well  defined, indicating flexibility in the receptor D3 domain orientation.
The conformation of the Fc-bound FcRI is essentially  identical to that of the ligand-free receptor, resulting a root  mean square difference (rmsd) of 0.7  among all C atoms.
The  human IgG1-Fc (residues 224446) contains the lower hinge  peptide (Cys-229Pro-238), C2 (Ser-239Lys-338) and C3  (Ala-339Gly-446) domains.
Both the C2 and C3 domains of  Fc have well defined electron densities, including the glycosylation associated with Asn-297.
The overall conformation of Fc  resembles that of FcRIII bound Fc with a small but asymmetric  rotation induced by the bound receptor to the C2 domains,  resulting in a loss of the twofold symmetry observed in the  receptor-free Fc structure.
  FcRI bound to the lower hinge region of the Fc with its D1  and D2 domains resembling the conformation of the two-domain  FcRII, FcRIII, and FceRI ligand complexes (1517, 21) (Fig.  1).
Except for a 10 rotation in the C2 domains of each Fc to  accommodate receptors, the entire complexes are superimposable, resulting in an rmsd of 1.0  between FcRI-Fc and FcRII  and an rmsd of 1.3  between FcRI-Fc and FcRIII.
The  FcRI-Fc complex buries a total solvent-accessible surface area  of 2,161 2  , significantly greater than the 1,800 2 buried in the  low-affinity receptor-Fc complexes (15).
Previous work has suggested the importance of FcRI D3 domain in IgG binding (19).
  The D3 domain is not in direct contact with Fc in the current  complex structure; however, the receptor D3 domain packs  against the D2 domain, forming a hydrophobic hinge core, suggesting that the D3 domain is important for maintaining receptor  conformation and stability.
  Interface of FcRI with the Lower Hinge Fc Region Is Conserved.
The  interface between the receptor and the two Fc chains can be  divided into three regions: between the FcRI D2 domain  C-strand (Tyr-133Leu-136), C-strand (Lys-142His-148),  and CE loop (His-148Trp-149) and the lower hinge region  from the Fc A-chain; between the receptor D1-D2 interdomain  hinge (Arg-102Trp-104), D2 domain BC loop (Trp-127Tyr-133),  and lower hinge from the Fc B-chain; and between the FcRI D2  domain FG loop (Met-171Tyr-176) and the Fc glycans.
  At the Fc A-chain lower hinge region, the receptor contacts are  primarily salt bridges and hydrogen bonds.
Specifically, Lys-142  and Lys-145 of FcRI form two pairs of salt bridges with Fc  residues, Glu-294 and Glu-269, respectively (Fig. 2A).
Both lysine  residues are also present in the low-affinity FcRIIA, FcRIIB,  and FcRIII (Fig. 2C).
Two hydrogen bonds are observed, between Asn-134 of the receptor and Asp-265 of Fc and between  His-148 of the receptor and the carbonyl group of Gly-236 of Fc.
  Asn-134 is replaced with a Lys in the low-affinity Fc receptors.
  His-148 is conserved in FcRIIA and FcRIII, but replaced with  Fig. 1.

In addition, Leu-136 and Phe-146 of FcRI  form van der Waals interactions with the lower hinge LLGG  motif of Fc (15).
The majority of FcRI contacts with the A chain  of Fc are preserved in the low-affinity Fc receptors.
Likewise,  Asp-265, Glu-269, and Glu-294 are conserved among subclasses  of IgGs.
  At the Fc B-chain interface, FcRI forms primarily van der  Waals interactions with the Fc (Fig. 2B).
Trp-104 and Trp-127  from FcRI form a hydrophobic cluster with a pair of conserved  leucine and proline residues, Leu-328 and Pro-329, from the C2  domain of the Fc.
This cluster, also referred to as a Trp-Pro-Trp  sandwich, is present in all low- affinity receptor complexes, including that of the IgE-Fc-FceRI complex (15, 16, 21).
Unique to  FcRI is a hydrogen bond between Arg-102 of the receptor and  the carbonyl group of Pro-329 of Fc.
A second hydrophobic  cluster is observed between the side chains of Lys-130, Leu-131,  and Tyr-133 of FcRI and the lower hinge residues Leu-234 and  Leu-235 of the Fc.
This second hydrophobic cluster is smaller in  the low affinity receptor-Fc complexes as both Leu-131 and Tyr133 of FcRI are replaced by smaller Pro, Ala, Val, and His  residues in FcRII and FcRIII.
Tyr-133 also forms a hydrogen  bond with Glu-233 of Fc-B. Glu-233 is conserved in IgG1, IgG3,  and IgG4 but is replaced by a Pro residue in IgG2, suggesting  that the lack of this Glu-233Tyr-133 hydrogen bond in IgG2  contributes to its lower receptor binding affinity.
Interestingly,  this hydrogen bond is absent in FcRIIA because the receptor  contains a Val-133 in place of Tyr, suggesting that FcRIIA is  less discriminative against IgG2 (2224).
As noted previously,  other residues at the lower hinge of IgG2 also differ from those  of IgG1 and may affect its receptor binding affinity (15).
  The FcRI D2 Domain FG Loop Forms Unique Contacts with Fc Glycan.
  The third interface is from the receptor D2 domain FG loop,  171MGKHRY176, to Fc and its associated glycan.
In particular,  Lys-173 of the receptor forms a salt bridge with a conserved Asp265 on the B-chain of Fc (Fig. 3A).
A similar salt bridge is  present between the Asp-265 on the B-chain of Fc and Lys-120  on the C-strand of FcRIII in the low-affinity receptor complex  structure (15); however, Lys-120 of FcRIII is not conserved in  FcRI and is replaced by an asparagine.
Instead, Lys-173 of  FcRI serves as a surrogate salt bridge partner.
  His-174 and Arg-175 of the receptor extend into the Fc  opening toward the glycans, such that their closest contacts are  the carbohydrates attached to Asn-297.
The His-174 side chain is  close to the C4 hydroxyl group on a branched mannose.
Both  Lys-173 and His-174 are close to the glycan attached to the  B-chain of Fc.
The side chain of Arg-175 is located within hydrogen-bonding distance to the O3-hydroxyl of the first N-acetyl  glucosamine (GlcNAc) and to the O6-hydroxyl of the second  Fig. 2.

Thus, the  FG loop links glycans from both chains of Fc.
Interestingly, all  three FG loop residues contact the proximal rather than distal  carbohydrate units of the Fc glycan, suggesting that the receptor  interacts with the conserved and less flexible part of the glycan.
  This is also consistent with the finding that EndoS-treated IgG1,  which leaves the first GlcNac and its associated branched core  fucose, retains better FcRI binding than IgG1 treated with  peptide-N-glycosidase F, which removes all glycan attached to  Asn-297 (23).
  In comparison, the D2 domain FG loops of the low-affinity  FcRs are 810  away from the Fc glycans and make little  contact with Fc, except for a hydrogen bond between the FcRIII  FG loop Lys N and the backbone carbonyl of the lower hinge  Gly-236 on Fc (Fig. 3B) (15, 17, 25).
Whereas the FcRI contacts  to both hinge A and hinge B of Fc are largely conserved in the  low-affinity Fc receptors, the contacts from the FG loop of  FcRI are unique to the high-affinity receptor, because the FG  loop KHR motif is not conserved in other Fc receptors, except  for the presence of a Lys in FcRIII in the His-174 position of  FcRI (Fig. 2C).
  Structural Mechanism for High-Affinity FcRI Binding to Fc.
Although  the overall receptor-ligand docking mode is similar in all Fc  receptors, FcRI is the sole high-affinity receptor for monomeric  IgG. Two of the three FcRI-Fc contact sites involve receptor  residues interacting with the lower hinge regions of the Fc  chains.
Both the hinge A and hinge B contacts are quite conserved in the low-affinity FcRII and FcRIII ligand complexes,  suggesting that they are the critical contacts to define the common FcR receptor and IgG binding mode.
Interestingly, FcRI  forms a more extensive hydrophobic contact at hinge B, thus  favoring its binding to IgG. In contrast, the interface between the  FG loop of FcRI and IgG is unique to the high-affinity receptor.
  The equivalent receptor FG loops in the low-affinity receptorligand complexes do not form significant contacts to Fc.
  The importance of the FG loop to high-affinity receptor-IgG  binding was demonstrated in previous mutational work (26).
  Placement of the FG loop of FcRI into FcRIII resulted in  a 15-fold increase in IgG binding affinity, and the mutant  FcRIII bound to IgG only fivefold weaker than FcRI.
As noted  previously, the FG loop of FcRI is one residue shorter than the  FG loops of other Fc receptors (Fig. 2); however, this affinity  increase is lost when a Val is inserted into the FG loop to match  the length of those in the low-affinity Fc receptors.
Structurally,  this shorter FG loop of FcRI is positioned 5  closer to the  glycan in the center of the horseshoe opening than that of  FcRIII (Fig. 3B).
Interestingly, the D2 domain FG loop of  FcRI is the most positively charged FG loop among all three  Fc receptors, owing to the presence of the KHR motif (Fig. 3C).
  To further address the significance of a shorter but positively  charged FG loop to the high-affinity Fc receptor, we compared  the length and the number of charged residues present in the FG  loop sequences among homologous Fc receptors in mammalian  species with Lys, Arg, and His each as +1 and Asp and Glu each  as 1.
The sequences of majority homologous FcRI receptors  have six amino acid FG loops and carry +2 or +3 charges (Fig.  3D).
In contrast, most of the D2 domain FG loops in all homologous low-affinity receptors are seven residues long.
The FG  loop sequences of FcRIIA and FcRIIB carry +1 or less charge,  whereas those of FcRIII carry 0 to +2 charges, with majority +1.
  Furthermore, the D1 domain FG loop of FcRI is also longer  and carries a 1 net charge, similar to the corresponding loops in  the low-affinity receptors.
Thus, the shorter and positively  charged FG loop is a unique feature of the high-affinity receptor.
  Structurally, the shorter FG loop enables it to move closer toward the Fc glycans and to adopt a glycan binding conformation.
  Mutations in the FG Loop of FcRI Reduce Its IgG Binding Affinity.
To  further investigate the contribution of the FG loop KHR motif to  high-affinity receptor-IgG binding, we generated both single and  triple alanine mutations of the KHR motif and measured the  mutant receptor binding affinities to all three subclasses of IgGs.
  K173A and H174A mutant FcRI exhibited only minor reductions in their binding affinities (twofold to fivefold) to IgG1,  IgG3, and IgG4 (Table 1).
In contrast, R175A mutation, the most  disruptive mutant, resulted in 20 fold reductions to IgG1, IgG3,  and IgG4 binding.
The triple AAA mutant (K173A/H174A/  R175A) bound to all three IgGs with 0.180.3 M affinity, similar to that of R175A.

  4 of 6 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1418812112 Lu et al.To evaluate the effect of charge contribution to FcRI and  IgG binding, we replaced the positively charged KHR each with  a negatively charged Glu in the FG loop.
K173E and R175E  resulted in mild reductions (threefold to 10-fold) in IgG affinity.
  In contrast to the Ala mutants, R175E is the least disruptive  among the three mutations, and H174E is the most disruptive,  with 15- to 30-fold reductions in IgG binding affinities.
The  differential mutational effects on IgG binding, in which Glu is  the most disruptive at residue 174 and Ala is the least favored at  position 175, suggest that charge interaction is more important to  H174, whereas hydrogen bond interaction is more important to  R175.
Both Ala and Glu mutations showed that glycan contact  by the FG loop contributes 20- to 30-fold in receptor-IgG  binding affinity, consistent with the earlier results from the FG  loop swapping (26).
  To further investigate the interaction of glycan with the FG  loop, we measured FcRI binding to IgG1 treated with peptideN-glycosidase F. Removal of the Fc glycan reduced receptor  binding to 0.35 M, a 40-fold decrease in affinity.
The greater  loss in IgG1 binding affinity by FcRI deglycosylation compared  with the R175A, H174E, and AAA mutations is likely related to  an additional conformational destabilization in Fc as the result  of glycan removal (12, 14).
Thus, both the receptor mutations  and glycan removal resulted in a loss of binding affinity, demonstrating the specific glycan binding by the FG loop KHR motif  of FcRI.
Given that deglycosylation reduced the IgG1 binding  affinity of FcRI to a level comparable to that of the loweraffinity Fc receptors, it is conceivable that the receptor can still  recognize aglycosylated IgG in the context of multivalent immune complexes (23).
  Potential Contribution of Fucosylated and Sialylated Fc Glycan to  FcRI Binding.
Even though the electron densities at the current  resolution of the complex contain significant ambiguities, there  are sufficient densities for much of the Fc glycan, although the  proximal carbohydrates are better defined than the distal carbohydrate units.
The N-linked glycans associated with Asn-297  are fucosylated biantennaed complex glycans.
Receptor glycosylation on Asn-162 of FcRIIIA was observed to interact with  nonfucosylated glycan to stabilize the receptor complex, suggesting that a fucosylated glycan may inhibit such interaction (9,  18).
Because Asn-162 is not present in FcRI, the potential role  of the branched fucose associated with the Asn-297 of Fc must  be different for the high-affinity receptor.
On both Fc chains, the  branched fucose units form van der Waals contacts with Tyr-296  of Fc.
On both Fc chains, the glycans extend along the Fc peptide, making multiple hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts with the C2 domain residues, including Phe-241, Phe-243,  Arg-301, and Lys-334 (Fig. 4).
These interactions help reduce  the conformational flexibility of the glycan.
The direction of the  glycan points from Asn-297 toward the C3 domain of its Fc.
The  terminal sialic acid is visible only on one chain (Fig. 4), and is  located close to hydrogen bonding distance to the side chain of  Ser-375 and Asp-376 from the C3 domain of Fc, suggesting that  sialylated glycans may reduce glycan conformational flexibility by  contacting the C3 domain of Fc.
  In summary, the structure of the high-affinity human FcRI  bound to IgG1-Fc illustrates both a conserved receptor recognition to the lower hinge region of Fc that defines the common  Fc receptor-IgG binding mode and a unique FcRI FG loop  interaction with Fc and its glycans that contributes to receptor  high-affinity IgG binding.
The contribution of Fc glycan to FcRI  high-affinity ligand binding opens potential new avenues in immunotherapy to apply glycan engineering in targeting FcRI to  achieve desired antibody efficacy.
It also raises the possibility of  using small-molecular glycan-based compounds or mimics to target FcRI as effective treatment for certain autoimmune diseases.
  Materials and Methods  Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization.
The ectodomain of FcRI  (residues 16289) was engineered with 19 mutations as described previously,  including T20P, T25K, T38S, L46P, T63I, S69T, R71H, V77E, N78D, I100V, F114L,  T160M, N163S, N195T, N206T, L207P, N240D, L283H, and L285Q.
This engineered FcRI ectodomain was synthesized and cloned into a pET26b vector by  gene synthesis (Genscript), solubly expressed in E. coli cells, and purified via  Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by IgG affinity chromatography.
  The purified FcRI from E. coli bound to human IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 with nM  affinities similar to those from recombinant mammalian expressed FcRI  (Table 1).
Human IgG1-Fc protein (216444) was expressed in CHO DXB-11 cells.
  The human tissue plasminogen activator prepro secretion signal sequence  was used to direct secretion of the IgG1-Fc.
  The recombinant Fc was purified by a protein A affinity column, followed by  a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mM sodium  phosphate and 109 mM sodium chloride pH 7.3.
The final product was filtered  through a 0.22-m syringe filter, aliquotted into polypropylene vials, and  stored at below 60 C.
Purified IgG1-Fc was verified by N-terminal sequencing,  was at least 95% pure, and contained <0.27 endotoxin units/mg.
Before  crystallization, FcRI was mixed with Fc dimer at a 1.2:1 molar ratio, and the  FcRI-Fc complex was further purified by gel filtration chromatography in  10 mM Hepes (pH7.4) and 0.15 M NaCl.
The crystals used for data collection  were grown in hanging drops at 22 C using 1 L of protein with a final  OD280nm of 6.7 and 1 L of reservoir solution (10% PEG 8000, 10 mM Hepes  Table 1.

Human plasma IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 were purchased from Athens Research & Technology.  Diffraction Data Collection and Structure Determination.
The crystals were  immersed in cryoprotectant (20% PEG 8000, 10 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 50 mM  Li2SO4, and 15% glycerol) before being flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.
Five  X-ray datasets were collected to 3.5- resolution at SER-CAT beamlines,  processed, and merged with HKL2000 (27) (Table S1).
FcRI-Fc complex  crystals belong to space group P1 with a pseudomerohedral twofold twinning.
The structure of the FcRI-Fc complex was solved by a molecular replacement method with Phaser (28) in the CCP4 package (29) using FcRI  (PDB ID code 3RJD) and Fc (PDB ID code 3AY4), respectively, as the search  model.
Model building and refinement were carried out using Coot (30) and  Phenix (31) with noncrystallography symmetry (NCS) restraints and the twin  law of (h, k, l).
The overall electron density of the complex is of decent  quality (Fig. S1).
  Carbohydrate molecules were added manually using (2Fo-Fc) electron  density maps contoured at 1.0 (SD of the map) and refined.
The residues  are numbered consistent with FCGR1_HUMAN in the Swiss-Prot entry.
The  final model includes two FcRI-Fc complexes (PDB ID code 4X4M).
The  Ramachandran statistics were generated and verified by Procheck of CCP4.
  Hinge angles were calculated using HINGE (32), and the buried surface area  was calculated using the CCP4 package.
The electrostatic charges were  converted from atom coordinates using the PDB2PQR server with the  CHARMM force field and calculated by APBS and displayed between 50 and  50 kT/e (33).
All structure figures were generated with Pymol (34).
  Site-Directed Mutagenesis of FcRI.
FcRI D2 domain FG loop (171MGKHRY176)  mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange  II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturers  instructions.
A total of eight mutants were generated, including three single  Ala mutations (K173A, H174A, and R175A), a triple AAA mutant (K173A/  H174A/R175A), three single Glu mutations (K173E, H174E, and R175E), and  a triple EEE mutant (K173E/H174E/R175E).
All mutations were confirmed by  DNA sequencing (ACGT Inc.).
The mutated FcRI proteins were expressed as  WT as described above and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography.
  Surface Plasmon Resonance Solution Binding Experiments.
Surface plasmon  resonance measurements were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument  and analyzed with BIAevaluation 4.1 software (GE Healthcare).
Different  human IgG subclasses were obtained from Athens Research & Technology.
  For measuring the affinity to WT or mutant FcRI proteins, human IgG1,  IgG3, and IgG4 were immobilized on Biacore carboxylated dextran CM5 chips  (GE Healthcare) to 2001,000 response units using primary amine coupling in  10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0).
The analytes consisted of serial dilutions of  WT or mutant FcRI proteins between 2 M and 63 nM in a buffer containing  10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.15 M NaCl.
The dissociation constants were  obtained by kinetic curve fitting for the binding of FcRI to IgG, and steadystate fitting for the binding of FcRI mutants to IgG, using BIAevaluation 4.1  software.
IgG1 (100 g) was treated with 2,500 U of peptide-N-glycosidase F  (New England Biolabs) in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 37 C for 3 h  to remove the glycan on Fc.
Representative binding sensorgrams are shown  in Fig. S2.
