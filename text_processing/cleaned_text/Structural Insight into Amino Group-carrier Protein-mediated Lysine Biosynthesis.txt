  Results: The crystal structure of the lysine biosynthetic enzyme TtLysZ was determined in a complex with TtLysW.  Conclusion: The two proteins interacted with each other through electrostatic interactions.
  Significance: Elucidating the mechanisms by which TtLysW is recognized by enzymes is crucial for understanding the evolution  of lysine biosynthesis.
  In the biosynthesis of lysine by Thermus thermophilus, the  metabolite -ketoglutarate is converted to the intermediate  -aminoadipate (AAA), which is protected by the 54-amino acid  acidic protein LysW. In this study, we determined the crystal  structure of LysZ from T. thermophilus (TtLysZ), an amino acid  kinase that catalyzes the second step in the AAA to lysine conversion, which was in a complex with LysW at a resolution of  1.85 . A crystal analysis coupled with isothermal titration calorimetry of the TtLysZ mutants for TtLysW revealed tight interactions between LysZ and the globular and C-terminal extension domains of the LysW protein, which were mainly attributed  to electrostatic forces.
These results provided structural evidence for LysW acting as a protecting molecule for the -amino  group of AAA and also as a carrier protein to guarantee better  recognition by biosynthetic enzymes for the efficient biosynthesis of lysine.
  Bacteria and plants generally produce lysine through the  diaminopimelate pathway starting from aspartate (1), whereas  fungi and yeast biosynthesize lysine via -aminoadipate  (AAA)2 (2, 3).
Although Thermus thermophilus is an extremely  thermophilic bacterium, lysine is synthesized using AAA as an  intermediate (4).
The AAA pathway in T. thermophilus resembles several other primary metabolic pathways.
The first half of  the pathway, in which -ketoglutarate is converted to AAA, is  similar to the leucine biosynthetic pathway and also to a part in  the tricarboxylic acid cycle (59).
The second half of the pathway, in which AAA is converted to lysine, resembles the first  half of arginine biosynthesis (10, 11) and differs from the corresponding AAA to lysine conversion in the fungal AAA pathway using saccharopine as an intermediate.
To biosynthesize  arginine, the amino group of glutamate is acetylated to avoid  unfavorable intermolecular cyclization.
In the biosynthesis of  lysine by T. thermophilus, the corresponding part of lysine biosynthesis proceeds in a similar manner, whereas LysW, a small  acidic protein composed of 54 amino acid residues, is used to  protect the amino groups of the biosynthetic intermediates  (12).
LysX catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond  between the -amino group of AAA and -carboxyl group of  the C-terminal Glu-54 residue of LysW in an ATP-dependent  manner.
The LysW--AAA produced is then successively  transferred to each enzyme (LysZ, LysY, and LysJ) to be converted to LysW--Lys, and the last enzyme LysK releases lysine  from LysW--Lys.
Since our discovery of the AAA lysine biosynthetic pathway, many organisms, especially thermophilic  bacteria and archaea, have been considered to biosynthesize  lysine using this pathway.
We also recently revealed that the  hyperthermophilic and acidophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus, utilized the LysW-mediated system not only to biosynthesize  lysine, but also arginine (13).
In Sulfolobus, LysX and its paralog  ArgX catalyze the formation of LysW--AAA and LysW--glutamate, respectively, and the subsequent conversion steps are  conducted by a single set of enzymes functioning in the biosynthesis of both lysine and arginine.
  The findings of our previous study on the biosynthesis of  lysine by T. thermophilus suggested that the catalytic sites of  enzymes involved in the conversion of AAA to lysine were surrounded by positively charged residues (12).
Because LysW is a  highly acidic protein, we expected its function as a carrier protein to be well recognized by a set of enzymes, thereby ensuring  the efficient biosynthesis of lysine.
The crystal structure of the  ArgXLysW complex actually supports the electrostatic interaction between biosynthetic enzymes and LysW in the LysWmediated system.

THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOL. 290, NO. 1, pp. 435447, January 2, 2015   2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Published in the U.S.A.  JANUARY 2, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 1 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 435   at NYU School of Medicine Library on February 11, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from tidyl carrier protein (PCP) have been identified as carrier  proteins in the biosynthesis of fatty acids or polyketides and  peptides, respectively (14, 15).
Both carrier proteins function  through a common mechanism; their specific serine residues  are modified with the phosphopantetheinyl group of holo-ACP  or PCP to form a thioester bond, and they are then elongated on  ACP or PCP.
In the LysW system, the -amino group of AAA is  covalently bound to the -carboxyl group of Glu-54 from LysW  by the formation of an isopeptide bond.
Therefore, LysW is a  novel type of carrier protein involved in primary metabolism.
  The crystal structure of fatty acid synthetase (FAS) revealed  specific electrostatic interactions between ACP and each module in FAS, in which ACP is bound in the central chamber surrounded by modules, and ACP also plays a central role in fatty  acid biosynthesis by changing partner modules in the FAS complex (16, 17).
Although it currently remains unclear whether the  five enzymes necessary for the conversion of AAA to lysine  form a LysW-mediated giant complex similar to FAS, how  these enzymes recognize LysW conjugates is of interest.
  In this study, we determined the crystal structures of  TtLysW--AAA and TtLysZ, an amino acid kinase family protein that catalyzes the second step, in a complex with TtLysW-  -AAA.
The results obtained confirmed that AAA attached to  the C terminus of TtLysW through the formation of an isopeptide bond, and TtLysZ recognized both the globular and C-terminal extension domains of TtLysW by electrostatic interactions.
The results of this study provide a structural basis for a  newly identified lysine biosynthetic system in T. thermophilus  that uses TtLysW as a carrier protein.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Preparation of Expression VectorsWe used the vectors  pET26b-lysW, pET26b-lysX, and pACYCDuet-1-lysZ, which  were constructed in our previous study (12), for the expression  of TtLysW, TtLysX with a C-terminal His6 tag, and TtLysZ with  a C-terminal His6 tag, respectively.
The lysZ gene for the production of the TtLysZ protein without a His tag was amplified  by PCR with appropriate primers.
(The sequences of these  primers are available on request.) The amplified DNA fragment  was cloned into pBluescriptII SK() to verify the sequence.
The  DNA fragment was inserted into the multiple cloning sites of  pET26b() (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI sites to yield  pET26b-lysZ. In the functional analysis of TTC1586, which is  another N-acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK) homolog of T. thermophilus HB27, the pET26b-TTC1586CHis vector was prepared in the same manner as that for the expression vector of  TtLysZ using NdeI and EcoRI.
  Preparation of CrystalsThe recombinant proteins of  TtLysW and TtLysZ without His6 tags were prepared for crystallization by using pET26b-lysW and pET26b-lysZ, respectively, and Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL  (Agilent Technologies) as the expression host.
The transformants were grown in 2 YT broth (18) supplemented with 50  g/ml kanamycin and 30 g/ml chloramphenicol at 37 C.
  After a 3-h incubation, gene expression was induced by adding  final concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was continued for an additional  1214 h at 25 and 37 C for TtLysW and TtLysZ, respectively.
  To produce TtLysW--AAA, which is a substrate of TtLysZ,  His6-tagged TtLysX (TtLysXhis) was also expressed in E. coli  BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL harboring pET26b-lysX in the  same manner as that described for TtLysW.  Cells harboring pET26b-lysW were harvested and washed  with buffer A (20 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.0).
The cells were  suspended again in buffer A and disrupted by sonication.
The  supernatant obtained from centrifugation of the cell lysate was  heated at 80 C for 30 min to remove proteins from E. coli by  centrifugation.
The crude enzymes were applied to the DE52  anion exchange column (Whatman) equilibrated with buffer A.  After washing with buffer A, followed by buffer A with 150 mM  NaCl, TtLysW was eluted with buffer A containing 500 mM  NaCl.
The purification of TtLysXhis was conducted as  described previously (12).
The purified TtLysW and TtLysXhis  proteins were concentrated with VIVASPIN (molecular weight  cutoff 3000) (Sartorius).
We prepared TtLysW--AAA using  the TtLysXhis reaction with 100 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 10  mM AAA, 10 mM ATP, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mg/ml TtLysW, and  0.05 mg/ml TtLysXhis at 70 C overnight.
The reaction mixture  was applied to the DE52 column to purify TtLysW--AAA.  TtLysW--AAA was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare)  with buffer B (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl).
  The purities of TtLysW and TtLysW--AAA were monitored  by 12% Tricine SDS-PAGE.
The concentration of TtLysW was  estimated as follows.
Purified TtLysW, the concentration of  which was estimated by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), was  dialyzed against MilliQ water and weighed after lyophilization.
  The concentration of TtLysW was calibrated using this value.
  To purify TtLysZ without a His tag, cells were harvested and  washed with buffer C (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0).
After  sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was heated at  80 C for 30 min and applied to the CM52 cation exchange  column (Whatman) equilibrated with buffer B. The passing  fraction was concentrated with VIVASPIN (molecular weight  cutoff 10,000), and then applied to HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75  equilibrated with buffer B. TtLysZ and mutant enzymes were  purified with the same elution profile in gel filtration column  chromatography (data not shown), suggesting that the amino  acid replacement did not affect the protein oligomerization  state.
The purity and concentration of TtLysZ were checked  with 15% SDS-PAGE and a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad),  respectively.
  To crystallize TtLysW--AAA and the complex of TtLysZ  with TtLysW--AAA, purified TtLysZ and TtLysW--AAA  were mixed at molar ratios of 1:1.6 to 1:8 in a total of 10 mg/ml  with 10 mM ATP or AMP-PNP and 10 mM MgSO4.
Crystallization was performed at 20 C using the hanging-drop  vapor-diffusion method.
Crystals of TtLysW--AAA and the  TtLysZTtLysW--AAA complex subsequently formed in 2 M  ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.6, and 20% (v/w)  PEG8000, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0, 0.2 M calcium acetate, respectively.
We also crystallized TtLysZ with 10 mM ADP and 10 mM  MgSO4 in the presence of 1.1 M tri-sodium citrate and 0.1 M  imidazole, pH 8.0.
  Data Collection and ProcessingBefore data collection, the  crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution prepared by  Crystal Structure of the LysZLysW Complex  436 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290NUMBER 1JANUARY 2, 2015   at NYU School of Medicine Library on February 11, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from mixing the reservoir solution with 20% (v/v) PEG400 for  TtLysZTtLysW--AAA crystals and in a solution prepared by  mixing the reservoir solution with 20% (v/v) glycerol for  TtLysZADP crystals.
These crystals were then frozen with a  nitrogen gas stream.
We directly froze TtLysW--AAA crystals  with nitrogen gas because they melted in a solution supplemented with the cryoprotectants tested.
Diffraction data were  collected at 1.000  with a CCD camera on the beamline NW12  (for TtLysW--AAA and TtLysZADP crystals) and BL-5A (for  TtLysZTtLysW--AAA crystals) of the Photon Factory, High  Energy Accelerator Research organization (KEK) (Tsukuba,  Japan).
Diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled  using the HKL2000 program suite (19).
Because TtLysW is a  Zn2-binding protein (12), we collected the anomalous diffraction data of Zn2, which came from the host E. coli cells, to  determine the crystal structure of TtLysW--AAA.
  Structural Determination and RefinementThe structure of  TtLysW--AAA was determined using the MAD phasing  method.
TtLysW--AAA crystals contained one monomer per  asymmetric unit and belonged to the space group P3221 with  unit cell parameters of a  b  48.9 , c  38.7 . We used the  program Solve (20) to detect the Zn2 site and for phase determination and Resolve (21) for automated model building.
  Molecular replacement was performed with MOLREP (22) in  the CCP4 program suite (23) for data collected at 1.000  using  the initial structural model as a template.
Subsequent structural  refinement was performed using Refmac5 (24) and Coot (25).
  TtLysZTtLysW--AAA crystals belonged to the space  group P41212 with unit cell parameters of a  b  69.8 , c   148.0 . Structural determination was conducted by molecular  replacement with Phaser (26) in the CCP4 program suite using  the structures of TtLysW--AAA and LysZ from T. thermophilus HB8 (PDB code 3U6U).
The space group of TtLysZADP  was also P41212, and its unit cell parameters were a  b  80.5  , c  152.3 . The structure of these crystals was also determined by the molecular replacement method using LysZ from  T. thermophilus HB8 as a template.
The subsequent structural  refinement step was carried out in the same way as that for  TtLysW--AAA.
The overall geometry of each structural  model was checked by MolProbity (27), and the figures were  prepared using PyMOL (28).
Data collection and the refinement statistics of these crystal structures are summarized in  Table 1.
CAVER (29) in PyMOL was used for the cavity calculation.
The atomic coordinates of the crystal structures for  TtLysW--AAA, TtLysZADP, and the TtLysZLysW--AAA  complex have been deposited in the RCSB PDB with the accession numbers 3WWL, 3WWM, and 3WWN, respectively.
  Analysis of the Structure of the TtLysZ Reaction Product  Because our previous experiment revealed that the phosphate  group of the expected LysZ product, LysW--AAA -phosphate  was unstable and easily converted to LysW--AAA during  the MS analysis, we added hydroxylamine to convert the unstable phosphate group of the product to the hydroxamate group.
  The TtLysZ reaction was conducted with 200 mM HEPESNaOH, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgSO4, 160 mM NH2OH-HCl, 10 mM  ATP, and 0.1 mM (0.6 mg/ml) TtLysW--AAA (neutralized  with 160 mM potassium hydroxide), and the reaction mixture  was incubated with 25 g/ml TtLysZ at 60 C for 1 h. The reaction product was applied to Tricine SDS-PAGE, and the gel  containing the TtLysW derivative was sliced.
The chemical  structure of the reaction product was determined by in-gel  digestion followed by LC-MS/MS and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses as described previously (12).
  Preparation of TtLysZ MutantsThe plasmids for the  expression of the TtLysZ mutants, which were used in the activity assay and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments, were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using  QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits (Agilent Technology) for pET26b-lysZ. The partially purified proteins of these  mutants prepared by the heat treatment (70 C, 30 min) were  used in the activity assay.
These mutants were purified in the  same way as wild-type TtLysZ. Because R111E and R112E variants were not thermostable, site-directed mutagenesis was performed with pACYCDuet-1-lysZ as a template.
The Ni2-nitrilotriacetic acid column was used to purify these two mutant  proteins.
The oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis are available on request.
  ITC Analysis of the Interaction between TtLysZ and TtLysW-  -AAATo elucidate the mechanism underlying the interaction  between TtLysZ and TtLysW--AAA, the caloric change was  monitored during binding by ITC.
This measurement was performed with the iTC200 microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare).
We  prepared 0.1 mM TtLysZ and 0.8 mM TtLysW--AAA in buffer B  for the cell and syringe, respectively.
TtLysW--AAA was injected  through the computer-controlled 40-l microsyringe at an interval of 2 min into the TtLysZ solution (cell volume  200 l) while  stirring at 1000 rpm.
All of the experiment was conducted at 60 C.
  Enthalpy changes (H) and affinities (Ka) upon binding were  measured, and the values obtained were used to calculate Gibbs  free energy (G) and entropy changes (S) according to the equations Ka  eG/RT and G  H  TS. Data were analyzed  using a single binding site model implemented in the ORIGIN  software package provided by GE Healthcare.
  We also calculated the surface charges of TtLysZ, TtLysW--  AAA, and the TtLysZTtLysW--AAA complex using the Delphi  module (30) of Discovery Studio 4.0 (Accelrys, K.K., Japan).
  Activity AssayTtLysZ catalyzes the formation of TtLysW-  -AAA-phosphate.
In the activity assay, unstable TtLysW--  AAA-phosphate was converted to the stable hydroxamate  derivative in the presence of hydroxylamine.
Because the derivative of TtLysW--AAA-phosphate migrated slower than that  of TtLysW--AAA on Tricine SDS-PAGE, we evaluated the  activities of the wild-type and mutant TtLysZ enzymes by analyzing the densities of the band derived from TtLysW--AAA  (substrate) and TtLysW--AAA-hydroxamate (product).
The  reaction was performed in the same way as that to determine  the product structure described above.
The concentrations of  TtLysW--AAA and TtLysZ were changed to 0.05 mM (0.3  mg/ml) and 10 g/ml, respectively, and the reaction time was  set to 15, 30, and 60 min to follow the reaction.
The reaction was  stopped by adding the SDS-PAGE sample buffer (250 mM TrisHCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5% -mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and immediate  boiling.
After the reaction, the samples were applied to Super  Sep Ace (Tricine gel) 1520% (Wako Pure Chemical, Japan).

The reaction mixture was  incubated for 15, 30, and 60 min at 60 C and stopped with 5%  FeCl3.
Absorbance was then measured at 540 nm.
  RESULTS  LysZ Catalyzed the Phosphorylation of LysW--AAA  Although LysZ may phosphorylate the -carboxyl group of the  AAA moiety of LysW--AAA using ATP to yield LysW--AAA  phosphate (Fig. 1A), this activity has not yet been measured  directly.
The conventional enzyme assay used to monitor the  hydroxamate converted by the addition of hydroxylamine from  carboxyl phosphate, which was formed by an enzyme reaction  (31, 32), was not applicable in this study because the substrate,  LysW--AAA, was precipitated by the addition of FeCl3, which  disabled the photometric detection of the hydroxamate  formed.
In our previous study (12), we demonstrated that  TtLysW--AAA phosphate migrated on Tricine SDS-PAGE in  a similar manner to that of TtLysW--AAA, whereas the  hydroxamate derivative that reacted with hydroxylamine  A  OH  O  NH O  OH  LysW  O  OH  O  NH O  O  LysW  O  P OH  O  OH  OH  O  NH O  NHOH  LysW  O  ATP ADP  LysZ  NH2OH-HCl  B 1 2  16.9  14.4  10.6  8.2  6.2  y4 534.22  y5 649.25  y6 778.29  y7 849.33 y8 978.37  y9 1107.41  y10 1204.46  y11 1275.50  y12 1372.55  y13 1501.60 b3 340.19  b4 411.22  b5 508.28  b6 637.32  b7 766.36  b8 837.40  b9 966.44  b10 1081.47  b11 1267.55  b12 1324.57  b13 1453.61  b14 1596.67  b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 b 5 b 6 b 7 b 8 b 10 b 11 b 12  y 11 y 10 y 9 y 8 y 7 y 6 y 5 y 4 y 3 y 2 y 1  b 9  L E P A P E E A E D W G E AAA  b 13 b 14  y 14 y 13 y 12  %Int.

  Crystal Structure of the LysZLysW Complex  438 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290NUMBER 1JANUARY 2, 2015   at NYU School of Medicine Library on February 11, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from migrated slower than TtLysW--AAA (Fig. 1B).
We extracted  these bands from the gel and analyzed the sequences of their  C-terminal tryptic fragments of a TtLysW derivative by  MALDI-TOF-MS and MS/MS analyses.
The MALDI-TOF-MS  analysis revealed that the TtLysW derivative gave anMS peak of  1629.7 (Fig. 1C), which matched the peptide of the C-terminal  13 amino acids with AAA hydroxamate (theoretical mass;  1629.69).
A subsequent MS/MS analysis revealed that AAA  hydroxamate attached to the C terminus of TtLysW (Fig. 1D).
  These results indicated that TtLysZ catalyzed the phosphorylation of the AAA moiety of TtLysW--AAA to produce  TtLysW--AAA-phosphate.
  We also confirmed that TtLysZ could not catalyze the phosphorylation of N-acetylglutamate, caused by the reaction of  NAGK in arginine biosynthesis (Fig. 1E); however, the ortholog  from T. thermophilus HB8 was annotated as NAGK, and its  crystal structure was described as NAGK in a previous study  (33).
Another homolog of LysZ, TTC1586, exhibited distinct  NAGK activity (Fig. 1E), suggesting that TTC1586 functioned  as NAGK in the biosynthesis of arginine by T. thermophilus  HB27.
  Crystal Structure of TtLysW--AAAWe determined the  crystal structure of TtLysW--AAA prior to examining how  TtLysZ recognized its proteinaceous substrate.
The multiple  wavelength anomalous diffraction method using the anomalous dispersion data of zinc, which was bound to LysW--AAA,  was conducted to determine this structure at a resolution of  1.20 . Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.
The structure contained one TtLysW--AAA,  one zinc atom, and 90 water molecules per asymmetric unit.
  The crystal structure of TtLysW--AAA consisted of a globular  domain, which was composed of five -strands, and C-terminal  extension containing 10 residues (Fig. 2A).
In the crystal structure, AAA was bound to the side chain of the C-terminal Glu-54  of TtLysW by an isopeptide bond (Fig. 2B).
The zinc atom was  stabilized by four cysteine residues from loop 1-2 and loop  3-4.
The structure was similar to LysW from Sulfolobus tokodaii (StLysW) with 36% identity in the amino acid sequence.
  Except for the C-terminal extension, the root mean square  deviation between these homologs was 0.79  (1.10  for the  whole molecule). Because we did not discuss the structural features of StLysW in our previous study, we described the LysW  structure in detail.
A DALI search (34) indicated that the globular domain of TtLysW took the form of the zinc ribbon superfamily (35), with the second highest Z score of 2.9 to the zinc  finger domain of ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required  for transport)-II (PDB code 2J9U) after StLysW (36).

Thus, the fold in TtLysW was novel  for a zinc finger protein (Fig. 2, D and E).
  Crystal Structure of the TtLysZ Complex with ADPWe  determined the crystal structure of the TtLysZADP complex at  a resolution of 2.8  (Fig. 3A).
The TtLysZADP complex contained one TtLysZ monomer binding one ADP molecule and 27  water molecules in an asymmetric unit.
TtLysZ had a typical  amino acid kinase family structure, called the -sandwich  fold, similar to NAGK (37).
In this structure, ADP was bound at  the C-lobe (Fig. 3B), similar to other amino acid kinase family  proteins, and the - and -phosphate groups of ADP were stabilized by Lys-5 (Fig. 3C), suggesting that Lys-5 served as a  catalytic residue in TtLysZ. In addition to Lys-5, six amino acid  residues, Gly-8, Gly-37, Ser-38, Tyr-78, Tyr-200, and Arg-230,  interacted with ADP.
The main chain amide atoms of Gly-8 and  Gly-37 bound the - and -phosphate groups of ADP, respectively.
The hydroxyl groups of Ser-38 and Tyr-78 were hydrogen-bonded to the phosphate groups, and the 2-OH group of  ribose was stabilized by Arg-230.
The amino group of the adenine ring was recognized by the hydroxyl group of Tyr-200  through a hydrogen bond.
However, only Gly-8 and Gly-37  were conserved among the ADP-binding residues.
In the amino  acid kinase family proteins, the binding of ATP and substrate  was previously reported to cause domain closure, thereby forming a closed complex (38).
The TtLysZADP complex, the crystal structure of which was determined in this study, took a halfclosed form.

  Crystal Structure of the LysZLysW Complex  440 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290NUMBER 1JANUARY 2, 2015   at NYU School of Medicine Library on February 11, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from Crystal Structure of the TtLysZ Complex with TtLysW--  AAAThe structure of the TtLysZTtLysW--AAA complex  was also determined at a resolution of 1.85 . It contained one  TtLysZ monomer, one TtLysW--AAA, one sulfate ion, one  zinc atom, and 255 water molecules per asymmetric unit (Fig. 4,  A and B).
  The amino acid residues 220225 of TtLysZ were not  assigned due to weak electron densities, although these residues were observed in the TtLysZADP complex.
Furthermore,  the AAA molecule, which was attached to the C terminus of  TtLysW, was not visible in the structure due to low electron  densities.
In contrast to the TtLysZADP structure, the  TtLysZTtLysW--AAA structure was in an open state, and  this may have been due to the lack of ATP.
Accompanied by  domain closure, tighter and new interactions may have been  generated between TtLysZ and TtLysW.  We compared TtLysZ structures between the crystal structures of TtLysZTtLysW--AAA, TtLysZADP, and apo-LysZ  from T. thermophilus HB8 (PDB code 3U6U) (33), and we  detected structural changes in the following two regions: the  -sheet region composed of strands 3, 4, 7, and 8, and  the helical region containing 7 and 8 in TtLysZ of the  TtLysZADP complex (Fig. 4C).
Accompanying these structural changes in two regions, ADP-bound TtLysZ took a more  closed conformation than that of TtLysZ in the apo-form,  whereas no structural change was principally observed between  TtLysZTtLysW--AAA and apo-TtLysZ (root mean square  deviation of 0.822 ) (Fig. 4D).
These results indicated that  conformational changes in the -sheet region and helical  region were induced by ADP binding.
In the TtLysZADP structure, ADP did not interact with the -sheet region but with the  residues from 1, 2, 3, 8, and adjacent turn regions.
The  mechanism underlying the displacement of the -sheet region  by ADP binding currently remains unclear.
  By applying crystal symmetry, TtLysZ could bind TtLysW-  -AAA molecules at two different surfaces (Fig. 4, A and B).
  These potential interaction sites were tentatively named interacting region 1 (IR1) and interacting region 2 (IR2) and were  located close to strand 8 and the N-terminal region of helix  8, respectively.
The C-terminal extension binding AAA via an  isopeptide linkage in both TtLysW molecules at either IR1 or  IR2 did not enter the active site of TtLysZ but was found on the  surface of TtLysZ. Therefore, we could not conclude which  interaction was necessary for the reaction based only on the  crystal structure.
The functional interaction site of TtLysZ was  examined biochemically using mutants coupled with a modeling study as described below.
  Interaction between TtLysZ and TtLysW--AAAWhen the  electrostatic potential was mapped to the surface of TtLysZ,  two surface regions were occupied by positively charged residues (Fig. 5, A and B).
Very negatively charged TtLysW interacted with the oppositely charged surfaces corresponding to  IR1 and IR2 (Fig. 5, A and B).
In the interaction at IR1, Lys-117,  Lys-123, Lys-125, and Arg-128 of TtLysZ formed ionic bonds  with Glu-31, Glu-21, Glu-18, and Glu-33 of TtLysW, whereas  in the interaction at IR2, Glu-26 of TtLysW formed an electrostatic interaction with Lys-227 and Lys-231 of TtLysZ and  Asp-27 of TtLysW electrostatically interacted with Arg-227  and Arg-230 from TtLysZ (Fig. 5, C and D).
The interacting  surface area was slightly larger in IR1 (4729 2  ) than in IR2  (4484 2  ).
  To confirm the electrostatic interaction between TtLysZ and  TtLysW, we examined changes in thermodynamic parameters  upon binding of TtLysW--AAA to TtLysZ by ITC (Fig. 6A).
  The results obtained showed that TtLysZ bound TtLysW--  AAA with a Kd value of 6.62  0.56 M, and the stoichiometry  of the interaction was 0.834  0.015, which corresponded to  the 1:1 complex observed in the crystal structure of the  TtLysZTtLysW--AAA complex.
This binding was mainly stabilized by enthalpic forces (H  6.36  0.16 kcal/mol,  TS  1.34 kcal/mol).
The enthalpic contribution coincided well with TtLysZ binding TtLysW by electrostatic interactions, as observed in the crystal structure.
  Mutation Analysis for the Interaction between TtLysZ and  TtLysW--AAATwo possible interaction sites have been  identified in the crystal structure of the TtLysZTtLysW--  AAA complex as follows: IR1 around strand 8 and IR2 located  on the N-terminal region of helix 8 (Fig. 4, A and B).
To determine which site was responsible for the TtLysZ function in  lysine biosynthesis, we constructed mutants of TtLysZ by  replacing the basic amino acid residues that interacted by ionic  bonds with TtLysW through glutamate, and we measured their  activities to yield TtLysW--AAA phosphate using the Tricine  SDS-PAGE assay system.
We also analyzed their abilities to  interact with LysW--AAA by ITC.

  Crystal Structure of the LysZLysW Complex  JANUARY 2, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 1 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 441   at NYU School of Medicine Library on February 11, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from ITC are shown in Table 2.
Amino acid replacements were introduced at Lys-117, Lys-123, Lys-125, and Arg-128 at IR1, and  Arg-227, Arg-230, and Lys-231 at IR2.
These mutant proteins  were expected to have the same oligomeric state with the wildtype TtLysZ from the elution profile from gel filtration chromatography (data not shown).
The activity assay revealed that  the activities of the mutants at both IR1 and IR2 were reduced  (Fig. 7, A and B).
In ITC analyses, all mutants of IR1 (K117E,  K123E, K125E, and K128E) lost their ability to bind TtLysW.  On the other hand, the mutants of IR2 (R227E, R230E, and  K231E) could still bind TtLysW, although the affinity of R230E  for LysW--AAA was lower than those of wild-type and other  mutants in IR2 (Fig. 6 and Table 2).
The number of significant  figures should more closely reflect the error in the measurements.
We assume that the errors for parameters of R230E are  very large such that the value of TS is much smaller than the  estimated value.
In any case, these results demonstrated that  the IR1 of TtLysZ was the functional site that interacted with  TtLysW.  Although all the variants with amino acid replacements on  IR2 had reduced activities, they still retained the ability to  bind TtLysW--AAA. IR2 was near the ATP-binding site of  TtLysW. These results may explain the changes in activity and  interaction profiles in IR2 mutants.
  Binding Site of the C-terminal Extension of TtLysWIn the  TtLysZTtLysW--AAA structure, the location of the C terminus of TtLysW was distant from the catalytic center of TtLysZ.  As described above, TtLysZ took an open structure when binding to LysW--AAA. Because ADP-bound TtLysZ took a more  closed conformation, ATP binding was necessary to form the  Michaelis complex that bound the AAA moiety of TtLysW--  AAA at the catalytic site as the closed form.
When we examined  the cavity leading the substrate to the catalytic site of TtLysZ,  the cavity opened the entrance to accept the C-terminal extension of LysW--AAA bound at IR1 (Fig. 8, A and B), which also  supported IR1 being the functional binding site of TtLysZ for  TtLysW. To more precisely elucidate the recognition of the  C-terminal extension of TtLysW by TtLysZ, we constructed a  model with the C-terminal extension bound at the catalytic site  of TtLysZ. We recently determined the crystal structure of a  complex of ArgX from S. tokodaii (StArgX) with LysW from S.  tokodaii (StLysW), glutamate, and ADP, which is involved in  arginine biosynthesis using the LysW system (13).
StLysW is a  homolog of TtLysW with a similar structure.
The N-terminal  globular domains in particular were very similar to each other  (root mean square deviation  0.729 ).
When the globular  domains were superimposed between StLysW and TtLysW--  AAA in the TtLysZ complex bound at IR1, the C-terminal  extension region of StLysW was oriented toward the catalytic  center of TtLysZ (Fig. 8A).
We generated a model structure of  the C-terminal extension of TtLysW based on the structure of  StLysW bound to StArgX (Fig. 8B).
In the model structure,  there were several ionic bonds between residues from TtLysZ  and TtLysW as follows: Arg-128Glu-33*, Lys-117Glu-31*,  Lys-117Glu-45*, Arg-128Glu-48*, Lys-113Glu-50*, and  Lys-113Asp-51* (the asterisk means residues from TtLysW).
  Glu-50* and Asp-51* were in the conserved C-terminal  sequence 50EDWGE54 of TtLysW. In addition to these residues,  there were also other basic amino acid residues from TtLysZ,  such as His-57, Arg-111, and Arg-112, in the route to the catalytic center in the cavity of TtLysZ. To examine the validity of  the model, we constructed TtLysZ mutant enzymes carrying an  Ala or Glu residue at each basic site, and we measured their  activities using Tricine SDS-PAGE.
The result obtained  revealed that all the activities of all the mutant TtLysZ proteins  were reduced.
The complete loss of activity was observed in  mutant Lys-113, which was modeled to interact with Glu-50*  and Asp-51* of TtLysW by ionic bonds (Figs. 7C and 8B).
Other  mutants at His-57, Arg-111, and Arg-112 also showed reduced  but apparent activities, suggesting some contribution of these  residues in the catalytic function and/or TtLysW recognition of  TtLysZ; however, they did not have specific interactions with  residues from TtLysW in the modeled structure.
These results  suggested that the constructed model structure was appropriate and indicated that the recognition of both the globular  domain and C-terminal extension of TtLysW--AAA was  important for the function of TtLysZ.  Catalytic Mechanism of TtLysZTtLysZ is a protein member of the amino acid kinase family sharing an overall structure  composed of an N-lobe and C-lobe, which bind a phosphate  FIGURE 5.

The reaction mechanism in  amino acid kinase has been extensively studied for NAGK from  E. coli (EcNAGK) based on the crystal structures mimicking  several stages, including the transition state in the phosphoryl  transfer process (39).
In EcNAGK, Lys-217 interacted with the  -phosphate group to develop the negative charge of the -  bridging oxygen atom of ATP.
The -amino group of Lys-8  interacted with the leaving -phosphate group to stabilize the  transition state.
Furthermore, the carboxyl group of Asp-162  interacted with the -amino groups of Lys-8 and Lys-217.

In addition to these  charged residues, the main chain amides of Gly-11, Gly-44, and  Gly-45 interacted with the - and -phosphate groups of ATP,  in which Gly-11 and Gly-44 were involved in withdrawing electrons from the pentavalent -phosphate in the transition state,  and Gly-45 fixed the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group of  N-acetylglutamate for attacking the phosphorus atom of the  -phosphate group of ATP (39).
Lys-8, Lys-217, Asp-162, Gly11, and Gly-44 in EcNAGK were conserved as Lys-5, Lys-231,  Asp-172, Gly-8, and Gly-37, in TtLysZ, and Gly-45 was  replaced with a similar Ser-38 (Fig. 9A).
All these residues,  except for Lys-231, occupied similar spatial positions even in  TtLysZ. The side chain of Lys-231 was not located close enough  to interact with the -phosphate group of ADP in TtLysZ (Fig.  3C).
We suspected that the dislocation of Lys-231 in the  TtLysZADP complex may be related to the complex taking a  half-closed form.
The indispensable role of Lys-231 in the catalytic mechanism was shown by the complete loss of activity in  the mutant at Lys-231 (Fig. 7, B andC).
Furthermore, the partial  positive charges (helix dipoles) at the N-terminal ends of helices  2 and 5 were positioned close to stabilize the -phosphate  group of ADP in the TtLysZADP complex.
The similar helix  dipole-mediated stabilization of the transition state was proposed in EcNAGK.
These results led us to conclude that similar  catalytic mechanisms function in both EcNAGK and TtLysZ.  DISCUSSION  LysW is a novel family of carrier proteins in that it binds the  amino group of the ligand, which differs from ACP and PCP,  which bind the carboxyl group with the aid of a phosphopantetheinyl group attached to a specific serine residue.
In this  study, we determined the crystal structures of TtLysW--AAA  and the TtLysZTtLysW--AAA complex.
The crystal structure of TtLysW--AAA confirmed that LysX catalyzed the formation of the isopeptide bond between the -amino group of  AAA and the -carboxyl group of Glu-54 from LysW. In addition, the crystal structure of the complex of TtLysZ with  TtLysW--AAA revealed that the globular domain of TtLysW-  -AAA interacted with TtLysZ by electrostatic forces.
The  crystal structure of the homolog of TtLysX, StArgX, binding  StLysW, as determined in our previous study, demonstrated  that StArgX recognized StLysW via electrostatic interactions.
  The results of this study revealed that the subsequent biosynthetic enzyme in the second step also recognized LysW electrostatically.
The biochemical analyses using mutants and the  modeling study suggested that the C-terminal extension of  TtLysW was also recognized by TtLysZ. These results clearly  indicated that LysW functioned not only as a proteinaceous  protecting group of the amino group of the substrate, but also as  a novel carrier protein that interacted with each biosynthetic  enzyme for the efficient biosynthesis of arginine and/or lysine.
  There were two possible LysW-interacting sites (IR1 and IR2)  on TtLysZ in the structure of the TtLysZTtLysW--AAA complex, both of which contained basic residues.

The interacting area of IR1 being slightly larger than that of IR2 may also  support this conclusion.
  In this study, we demonstrated that LysZ recognized LysW-  -AAA but could not utilize N-acetylglutamate or AAA3 as the  substrate for the reaction.
This indicated that the recognition of  both the AAA moiety and globular domain of LysW--AAA  was required for the function of TtLysZ. An IR1-forming  -sheet region composed of strands 3-4 and 7-8 is characteristic of TtLysZ. The structure of TtLysZ was similar to that  of NAGK, which is involved in arginine biosynthesis recognizing N-acetylglutamate as the substrate; however, the -sheet  region, especially strands 7 and 8, differed between TtLysZ  and NAGK.
In TtLysZ, the 7-8 region following the 6-random coil region contained four positively charged residues,  whereas the corresponding region was made of 6- 3 in NAGK  and lacked all positively charged residues (Fig. 9, AC).
In addition, the regions corresponding to the -sheet region in TtLysZ  exhibited structural diversity in the amino acid kinase family  enzymes (Fig. 9, BF) and contained amino acid residues for  substrate recognition (37).
Taken together, these results supported IR1 being a functional LysW-binding region of TtLysZ.  Because the negatively charged surface of LysW was distributed  over the whole molecule, LysW may be able to interact with  each biosynthetic enzyme carrying a positively charged region  surrounding the catalytic site through any surfaces.
This result  reminds us of a metabolon-like super complex in the FAS system with ACP.
We currently do not know whether these  enzymes form such a complex.
Elucidating the interaction  manner between other biosynthetic enzymes and LysW will be  necessary for a better understanding of this metabolic system.
  The interaction between TtLysZ and TtLysW--AAA at IR2  may have been caused by crystal packing.
However, the highly  positively charged surface at IR2 suggests a function of IR2.
IR2  may be involved in LysW binding after (or before) the TtLysZ  reaction or the stabilization of complex formation between  TtLysW derivatives and other lysine biosynthetic enzymes in  the metabolon.
  In the biosynthesis of fatty acids and secondary metabolites,  such as polyketides and peptidyl compounds, substrates are  known to be conjugated with ACP and PCP and used for metabolic enzymes.
On the other hand, there are few examples of  protein-protein interactions being employed in amino acid biosynthetic pathways.
In plants, cysteine synthase forms a protein  complex with serine O-acetyltransferase and O-acetylserine  sulfhydrylase.
This enzymatic complex functions as a regulatory complex by reducing inhibitory effects on serine O-acetyltransferase of cysteine (40, 41).
In Mycobacterium tuberculosis,  a sulfur carrier protein named CysO was shown to be involved  in the biosynthesis of cysteine, interacting with cysteine synthase CysM. This complex did not have a regulatory role but  functioned as a substrate for CysM (42, 43).
This system enables  the rapid transfer of sulfur for biosynthesis by protecting the  unstable aminoacrylate intermediate from solvents.
These  inter-protein interactions in the biosynthesis of cysteine play an  important role in efficient biosynthesis by controlling enzymatic activity and preventing the loss of unstable intermediates.
  The LysW system for the biosynthesis of lysine and arginine is  also considered to enable the efficient synthesis of these amino  acids by using interactions between enzymes and proteinaceous substrates.
Because protein-protein interactions in metabolic pathways are more widespread than expected, biosynthetic mechanisms using LysW need to be elucidated in more  detail to more clearly understand other metabolic pathways.
  Using genomic databases, many organisms, mainly thermophilic bacteria and archaea, were found to possess genes encoding lysine biosynthetic enzyme homologs.
We recently demonstrated that this LysW-mediated biosynthetic system was  also used in arginine biosynthesis by the hyperthermophilic  archaeon Sulfolobus.
Sulfolobus uses a single set of enzymes  (LysW, LysZ, LysY, LysJ, and LysK), except for LysX, which is  involved in the lysine AAA biosynthetic pathway, to biosynthesize arginine.
In this archaeon, LysZ is a bifunctional enzyme  that can catalyze the phosphorylation of both LysW--AAA  and LysW--Glu, which are biosynthetic intermediates produced by ArgX in arginine biosynthesis, as substrates.
A study  to investigate differences in substrate specificity between LysZ  homologs from T. thermophilus and Sulfolobus based on pathway evolution is warranted.
By elucidating the structure of  other enzymes involved in the LysW-mediated system, the evolution of this type of amino acid biosynthetic system using  LysW may be more clearly understood.
