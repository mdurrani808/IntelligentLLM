On the basis on our  crystal structure solved for uPAR in complex with a peptide antagonist,we recently proposedamodel for the corresponding complex  with the growth factor-like domain of uPA (Llinas et al. (2005)  EMBO J. 24, 16551663).
In the present study, we provide experimental evidence that consolidates and further develops this model  using data from a comprehensive alanine scanning mutagenesis of  uPAR combined with low resolution distance constraints defined  within the complex using chemical cross-linkers as molecular rulers.
The kinetic rate constants for theinteraction between pro-uPA  and 244 purified uPARmutants with single-site replacements were  determined by surface plasmon resonance.
This complete alanine  scanning of uPAR highlighted the involvement of 20 surface-exposed side chains in this interaction.
Mutations causing G > 1  kcal/mol for the uPA interaction are all located within or at the rim  of the central cavity uniquely formed by the assembly of all three  domains in uPAR, whereas none are found outside this crevice.
  Identification of specific cross-linking sites in uPAR and pro-uPA  enabled us to build a model of the uPARuPA complexin which the  kringle domain of uPA was positioned by the constraints established by the range of these cross-linkers.
The nature of this interaction is predominantly hydrophobic and highly asymmetric, thus  emphasizing the importance of the shape and size of the central  cavity when designing low molecular mass antagonists of the  uPAR/uPA interaction.
  The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)2  is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane glycoprotein (1) that has a primary role in focalizing plasminogen  activation at the cell surface through its specific high affinity  interaction with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator  (uPA).
Besides facilitating the generation of plasmin activity in  the vicinity of uPAR-expressing cells, which is directly or indirectly involved in remodeling of the extracellular matrix (2, 3),  the uPAR/pro-uPA interaction also assists in regulating other  aspects of cell adhesion and migration.
Among these molecular  processes is the direct interaction with matrix-deposited  vitronectin (4); the modulation of integrin function, in particular M2, 51, and 31 (5 8); and the activation of the chemotactic FPRL1 receptor (9).
As an increased expression level  of uPAR is often found in the invasive areas of various human  cancers and correlates with poor prognosis (10), the uPAR/uPA  interaction and uPA catalytic activity are considered relevant  molecular targets for drug development (1113).
Intervention  strategies developed for targeting the uPAR/uPA interaction  with a view to cancer therapy include recombinant fusion proteins containing the receptor-binding module of uPA (14, 15),  anti-uPAR monoclonal antibodies (16), synthetic peptide  antagonists (1719), down-regulation of uPAR expression by  small interfering RNAs (20, 21), and a modified anthrax toxin  that is specifically activated by the enzymatic activity of receptor-bound uPA (22).
  Although the uPAR/uPA interaction thus plays an active role  in orchestrating these processes at the biochemical level, an  accurate experimental description of the three-dimensional  structure of this complex has yet to be solved by x-ray crystallography.
During the last decade, a number of studies have  reported on the assignment of the uPA-binding site on uPAR  using a plethora of different techniques, including chemical * This work was supported by grants from the John and Birthe Meyer Foundation, the Lundbeck Foundation, the Danish Cancer Society, the Dansk  Krftforskningsfond, the Carlsberg Foundation, the Kong Christian IX og  Dronning Louises Jubilumslegat, the Danish Instrument Biotechnology  Center, and the Copenhagen Hospital Corp.

Printed in the U.S.A.  19260 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 281NUMBER 28JULY 14, 2006protection analysis (23), single site-directed mutagenesis (24,  25), hydrogen-deuterium exchange (26, 27), chemical crosslinking (28), overlapping synthetic peptides (29), and entire  domain swapping analysis (30, 31).
However, it isimpossible to  reconcile these findings in one unifying molecular model of  the uPARuPA complex, demonstrating the need to revisit  the molecular basis of this high affinity interaction.
Some of the  inconsistencies between these previous studies undoubtedly  arise because of the inherent coupling between maintenance of  the three-domain structure of uPAR and its high affinity uPA  binding (32).
With the appearance of our experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of uPAR in complex with a  synthetic peptide antagonist solved by x-ray crystallography  (33), data from single-site mutagenesis of uPAR can now be  interpreted with much more confidence.
In the present study,  we have thus assigned the functional epitope on uPAR for uPA  binding as delineated by a comprehensive alanine scanning  mutagenesis of intact soluble uPAR combined with kinetic  measurements on the uPAR/pro-uPA interaction by surface  plasmon resonance.
These data have been supplemented by low  resolution distance constraints established by various chemical  cross-linkers acting as molecular rulers after identification of  their primary target sites.
Combining these experimental  observations with the proposal of a convergent binding site displayed on both the growth factor-like domain of uPA and a  synthetic peptide antagonist (33) provided the information necessary to enable the first computer modeling of the  uPARATF complex.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Chemicals and ReagentsThe zero-length cross-linker 1-ethyl3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC); N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS); and the homobifunctional amino-reactive chemical cross-linkers disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), disuccinimidyl  glutarate (DSG), and disuccinimidyl tartrate (DST) were from  Pierce.
Modified porcine trypsin was from Promega Corp.  (Madison, WI); N-glycosidase F was from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany); and 18O-labeled H2O (95%  purity) was from Spectra Stable Isotopes (Columbia, MD).
  Anti-uPA (clone 6) and anti-uPAR (R2, R3, S1, S2, and KOR-1)  monoclonal antibodies were made in-house, and the anti-pentahistidine monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen.
  Expression and Purification of Soluble Human Recombinant  uPAR MutantsSoluble forms of human uPAR were expressed  in and secreted by Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 (S2)  cells, which were stably transfected with pMTC/uPAR (residues 1283)3 (34).
These proteins are secreted to the conditioned medium because of a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal  signal sequence that is required for glycolipid anchoring (1, 26).
  Single-site alanine replacements were introduced into pMTC/  uPAR by site-directed mutagenesis using a previously designed  three-gene cassette approach (34), and the corresponding 244  soluble uPAR mutants were expressed in S2 cells.
All constructs  were verified by DNA sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310  genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
The  majority of the secreted uPAR mutants were purified from the  conditioned medium by immunoaffinity chromatography  using an immobilized anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody (R2),  followed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Vydac C4 column  (0.46  25 cm) and a linear gradient (40 min) from 0 to 70%  (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid.
Immunoaffinity purification of uPAR mutants changed at positions 274  277 (covering the epitope for antibody R2) was performing  using anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody R3, the functional  epitope of which resides on uPAR domain I. As judged by SDSPAGE of 5 g of reduced and alkylated sample, the purity of  these uPAR preparations were generally 95% (supplemental  Fig. S1).
The identities of individual purified uPAR mutants  were also verified at the protein level by peptide mass mapping and tandem mass spectrometric sequencing after in-gel  digestion of reduced and carbamidomethylated protein using  an endoproteinase (modified porcine trypsin, chymotrypsin,  Lys-C, or Asp-N) before mass assignment by an Autoflex  IITM MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik  GmbH, Bremen, Germany) (35).
If the mutated residue was  located in a glycopeptide, the corresponding in-gel digest was  also subjected to deglycosylation by N-glycosidase F. Protein  concentrations of the purified uPAR mutants were determined  spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient (E280 nM  1% )  of 9.2 (36), except for those mutants involving Trp32 or Trp129,  for which an estimated E280 nM  1% of 6.8 was used.
  Expression and Purification of Murine uPAR and Murine  ATFSoluble mouse recombinant wild-type uPAR and the  uPARR43K mutant (residues 1275)3 were expressed in S2 cells  transfected with pMTC/smuPAR and purified along the same  lines as described for human uPAR, except for the immunoaffinity chromatography, which was based on an anti-uPAR  monoclonal antibody raised in uPAR-deficient mice (antibody  KOR-1).
The ATF (residues 1143)3 of mouse uPA was also  expressed in S2 cells transfected with pMTC/mATF and subsequently purified from the medium by ligand affinity chromatography using immobilized purified mutant uPAR, followed  by reverse-phase HPLC under same conditions as described for  human uPAR.
  Expression and Purification of Human Recombinant ProuPA, Pro-uPA Mutants, and the Carboxyl-terminally His6-  tagged Growth Factor-like Domain (GFD)Human pro-uPA  (residues 1 411)3 with its active-site Ser356 replaced with alanine was produced by Drosophila S2 cells stably transfected  with the pMTB/uPAS356A vector.
Expression of pro-uPAS356A  was induced by 0.5 mM Cu2SO4 as described previously (34).
  The S2 medium also contained 10 g/ml aprotinin to prevent  proteolytic cleavage at the activation site of pro-uPA.
Pro-uPA  was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using an  immobilized anti-uPA monoclonal antibody (clone 6).
The  purity of this pro-uPA was 95%, and the preparation showed  only negligible conversion to two-chain uPA as judged by SDSPAGE (supplemental Fig. S2).
The identity of the purified prouPAS356A was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, which revealed two components with a mass of either  3 The numbering of amino acid residues in uPA and uPAR refers to the  cDNA-derived sequences, omitting the signal sequences.
The nomenclature for the secondary structure elements in uPAR follows the conventions  established for snake venom -neurotoxins (58) and more explicitly clarified for the modular domains in uPAR (33).
  Mapping the uPAR/uPA Interface  JULY 14, 2006VOLUME 281NUMBER 28 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 1926147,511.6 or 47,365.8 Da, corresponding to the disulfide-bonded  polypeptide chain of pro-uPAS356A with one N-linked glycosylation at Asn302 (1039.0 Da) and, in 60% of the molecules, one  additional O-linked fucose at Thr18 (146.1 Da).
Following the  same protocol, 12 different pro-uPA mutants with single-site  replacement of lysine with alanine within the amino-terminal  region were produced (supplemental Fig. S2).
The protein concentration of a stock solution of pro-uPAS356A was determined  accurately by amino acid composition analysis (37), and the  various lysine mutants were quantified using an E280 nM  1% of 18.5.
  The GFD (residues 1 48) of human uPA was expressed as a  carboxyl-terminally His6-tagged protein in Pichia pastoris  strain X-33 using the yeast expression vector pPICZA/GFDHis according to the protocols of Invitrogen.
The secreted  GFD-His6 was purified from the medium by adsorption onto an  Ni2 chelate column (HiTrapTM chelating HP), followed by  reverse-phase HPLC using a Vydac C4 column (0.46  25 cm)  and a linear gradient (40 min) from 0 to 35% (v/v) acetonitrile in  0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid.
The identity of the purified GFD  was verified by MALDI mass spectrometry (average mass of  6189.6 Da; no fucosylation present at Thr18), and the protein  concentration was determined using an estimated E280 nM  1%  of 11.8.
  Assessing uPAR Binding to Immobilized Pro-uPA by Surface  Plasmon ResonanceAll real-time interaction studies were  carried out on a Biacore 3000TM (Biacore International AB,  Uppsala, Sweden) in running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM  NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4).
  Human pro-uPAS356A (0.2 0.5 g/ml) was immobilized  covalently at pH 5.0 on a carboxymethylated dextran matrix  (CM5 sensor chip) using NHS/EDC as described previously  (24), which yielded coupling levels in three different flow cells  covering the range of 2001000 resonance units, corresponding to 0.21 ng/mm2 pro-uPA.
For comparative evaluation of  the kinetics of the uPAR/pro-uPA interaction, serial 2-fold  dilutions of the various uPAR mutants (0.8100 nM in running  buffer) were analyzed in parallel for uPA binding at a flow rate  of 20 l/min at 20 C.
Association was recorded for 300 s, followed by a dissociation phase of 775 s, and the derived sensorgrams for such an interaction analysis using the wild-type  receptor are shown in supplemental Fig. S3.
After each run, the  sensor chip was regenerated by two consecutive injections of 10  l of 0.1 M acetic acid and 0.5 M NaCl.
Data processing was  accomplished by double referencing, during which each sensorgram was corrected by subtraction of the signal from both a  mock-coupled flow cell and an appropriate buffer run.
The  kinetic rate constants kon and koff were derived by nonlinear  fitting of the association and dissociation phases to a simple  bimolecular interaction model (uPA  uPAR 7 uPARuPA)  using BIAevaluation Version 4.1 software (Biacore International AB).
In brief, koff values were initially derived by fitting  the collected data to dR/dt  koffR, and the corresponding kon  was subsequently fitted to dR/dt  kon[uPAR](Rmax  R)   koffR, assuming pseudo first-order reaction kinetics essentially  as described (38).
The curve fitting to the recorded data for the  wild-type uPAR (uPARwt)/uPA interaction is shown in supplemental Fig. S3 along with the corresponding residual plot.
The  change in free energy (G) caused by each mutation was calculated from G  Gmut  Gwt  RT  ln(Kd(mut)/Kd(wt)),  where Kd values were derived from the ratio of the kinetic constants koff and kon, R  1.99 cal/mol K, and T  293 K.  Because of the limitations enforced by the logistics of this  experiment, it was impossible to analyze freshly prepared  protein samples for each of the large number of mutants.
The  entire library of uPAR alanine mutants was therefore kept  frozen at 80 C, and individual mutants were thawed and  diluted in running buffer immediately before analysis.
At  appropriate time intervals, uPARwt was analyzed in parallel  and served as a reference for calculation of G. A number  of uPAR mutants, including some of those that exhibited  severely impaired kinetics for the pro-uPA interaction, were  subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Superdex  200TM in 10 mM phosphate and 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.4) to separate uPAR monomer from any aggregated protein before  reanalysis of the monomer fraction by surface plasmon resonance without prior freezing.
Generally, the koff values did  not changed significantly in this second analysis, but the kon  values occasionally increased by up to 2-fold after size exclusion chromatography.
  Covalent Conjugation of uPARLigand Complexes by Bifunctional Chemical Cross-linkersCovalent chemical conjugation  via -amines of optimally positioned lysine residues in preformed uPARpro-uPA or uPARATF complexes was introduced by various homobifunctional NHS esters with variable  spacer arm lengths (DSS, 11.4 ; DSG, 7.7 ; and DST,  6.4 ).
Concentrated stock solutions of these chemical crosslinkers were prepared in dry Me2SO and were diluted in Me2SO  to the working solutions (520 mM) immediately prior to use.
  Noncovalent complexes between 4 nM 125I-labeled ATF and  either 20 nM uPARwt or single-site lysine mutant uPAR were  allowed to preform during a 60-min incubation at 4 C in crosslinking buffer (0.1 M Tris, pH 8.1, containing 0.2% (w/v)  CHAPS).
Covalent cross-linking of the preformed complexes  was accomplished by a 1015 min incubation with the respective cross-linker (0.11 mM), after which the reaction was  quenched by addition of 100 mM CH3COONH4.
In other  experiments, 4 nM 125I-labeled uPAR was subjected to chemical  cross-linking to either pro-uPAS356A or one of the 12 different  single-site lysine mutants of pro-uPA.
Cross-linking efficiency  was visualized by SDS-PAGE of the reduced and alkylated samples, followed by autoradiography.
  Zero-length Cross-linking of uPARGFD Complexes Using  CarbodiimideMonomeric uPAR (10 M; prepared by size  exclusion chromatography as describe above) was mixed with  90 M GFD for 1 h at 4 C to allow the formation of noncovalent  uPARGFD complexes.
Zero-length cross-linking between  optimally positioned amino and carboxylate groups was  achieved by additional incubation overnight at 20 C with 5 mM  EDC added from a freshly prepared stock solution in H2O.
  Cross-linking efficiency was assessed by SDS-PAGE of reduced  and carbamidomethylated samples.
The relevant Coomassie  Brilliant Blue-stained bands were excised from the dried gel and  subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion in parallel using either 16Oor 18O-enriched H2O as solvent.
This solvent-induced isotope  coding of tryptic peptides, which causes a specific mass shift of  8 Da for cross-linked peptides with two carboxyl termini (39),  Mapping the uPAR/uPA Interface  19262 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 281NUMBER 28JULY 14, 2006facilitated the identification of these particular peptides by subsequent mass spectrometric analyses by nanoflow reversephase liquid chromatography connected to a quadrupole timeof-flight mass spectrometer (Q-Tof Ultima, Micromass,  Manchester, UK).
The further identification of such crosslinked peptides was enabled by the high mass accuracy and  precision obtained using a 7-Tesla linear quadrupole ion trapFourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer  (LTQ FTTM, Thermo Electron Corp., Bremen) with a modified  nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense,  Denmark).
  Molecular Modeling of uPAR ComplexesMolecular modeling of uPARGFD complexes based on a convergence in the  receptor-binding motif between the -hairpin in the GFD of  uPA and the -helix of a linear peptide antagonist was performed essentially as described (33).
In brief, a high temperature molecular dynamics procedure was applied in which  ambiguous constraints were introduced between the side  chains of (i) Tyr24 in GFD and Val125, Leu168, His251, Leu252,  Ala255, and His166 in uPAR; (ii) Phe25 in GFD and Leu55, Leu123,  Val125, Leu150, Leu168, and His251 in uPAR; (iii) Ile28 in GFD and  Arg53, Leu55, Leu66, and Leu150 in uPAR; and (iv) Trp30 in GFD  and Val29, Leu31, Leu55, Tyr57, and Leu66 in uPAR.
600 structures of complexes were generated, and the 300 with the best  van der Waals interaction energies were selected to perform a  theoretical alanine scanning for residues 2130 in GFD.
For all  these 300 structures, the calculated G values were compared  with those derived from experimental mutagenesis studies  as published previously (33).
To refine these structures, an  additional ambiguous constraint between Asp140 and any  atom of GFD was introduced.
30 structures were refined,  leading to four final structures with a reasonable agreement  between the experimental and calculated G values.
For  these four structures, the average G values are 0.1  0.3,  0.05  0.3, 0.3  0.4, 1.9  0.5, 1.4  0.5, 1.6  0.5, 0.2  0.3,  0.2  0.3, 0.4  0.3, 0.1  0.3, and 1.2  0.3 kcal/mol for  V20A, S21A, N22A, K23A, Y24A, F25A, S26A, N27A, I28A,  H29A, and W30A, respectively.
  To further validate this model, individual G values were  calculated for selected single-site mutants in uPAR and compared with those determined experimentally.
Generally, these  values are mutually concordant and are, as expected, dominated by positions that have relatively small impacts on the uPA  interaction (G   1 kcal/mol).
This pairwise comparison  revealed, for example, only six positions in uPAR domain I (of  62 tested) where the deviations between the calculated and  determined G values actually exceeded the estimated error  of 0.5 kcal/mol.
Furthermore, these six positions represent  charged residues for which the effect of the solvent is improperly weighted by the use of an implicit solvent.
  Binding free energies were calculated using the PoissonBoltzmann equation (40).
All calculations were performed using  CHARMM Version c28a3 (41) with the force field par_all22_  prot_lipid.inp and top_all22_prot_lipid.inp (42).
Finally, based on  these structures, a model of the uPARATF complex was built in  which GFD was superimposed onto that of the corresponding  uPARGFD model.
Distance constraint obtained by chemical  cross-linking between Lys98 from the kringle domain of uPA  and Lys43 from uPAR was introduced in MODELLER Version  6.0 to position the kringle domain in the complex.
The coordinates for the NMR-derived solution structure for human ATF  (residues 6135) and the crystal structure for human uPAR  (residues 1283) were used for these modeling studies (Protein  Data Bank accession codes 1URK (43) and 1YWH (33),  respectively).
  RESULTS  Several laboratories have previously shown that a secreted  form of human uPAR can be produced by various eukaryotic  expression systems, e.g. Chinese hamster ovary cells (24, 44)  and D. melanogaster S2 cells (18, 25, 34), after deletion of the  carboxyl-terminal signal sequence, which is instrumental for  the in vivo tethering of uPAR to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor (1).
This soluble  recombinant uPAR (residues 1283)3 represents a convenient  surrogate for the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored  uPAR, as in a range of biochemical assays, it retains many of the  functional properties inherent to the native protein, including  its high affinity for uPA (24, 32).
In this study, we exploited  Drosophila S2 cells as a host for the stable expression of a large  number of uPAR mutants with defined single-site mutations  covering almost 90% of the fully processed uPAR sequence (residues 1283).
To avoid compromising residues in uPAR that  are of structural importance, we focused our mutagenesis  efforts on residues that are not included in the consensus  sequence defining the Ly-6/uPAR/-neurotoxin protein  domain family (26, 33, 45), i.e. all cysteines and the conserved  Asn residue that immediately follows the last cysteine of each  domain were omitted.
The resultant 244 uPAR mutants were  expressed well by the S2 cells, and the purities and yields of the  mutant proteins were comparable with those of uPARwt (supplemental Fig. S1).
  Impact of Single-site Mutagenesis in uPAR on Pro-uPA Binding KineticsTo address the functional importance of specific  amino acid side chains in human uPAR, we produced a comprehensive uPAR mutant library in which defined side chains of  the soluble receptor were individually deleted beyond the C  atom by alanine substitution.
Native alanine residues in uPAR  were changed to serine, whereas N-linked glycosylation sites  were replaced with glutamine.
The impact of these specific side  chain deletions on the uPA interaction were assessed by measuring the kinetic rate constants for the interaction between  immobilized pro-uPAS356A and the respective purified uPAR  single-site mutants by surface plasmon resonance.
A complete  inventory of these experimentally determined rate constants is  provided in supplemental Table SI.
During the course of this  study, we observed that repeat determinations of the dissociation rate constant for the interaction between uPAR and prouPAS356A were very reproducible over time and insensitive to  cycles of freeze-thawing of the purified protein preparation.
In  contrast, the association rate constant could vary by as much as  2-fold under the same conditions.
Because of the logistics of the  present experimental setup comparing a very large number of  purified uPAR mutants, it was, however, impossible to ensure  Mapping the uPAR/uPA Interface  JULY 14, 2006VOLUME 281NUMBER 28 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 19263exact identical handling of all samples.
In the following data  evaluation, we therefore initially focused on koff values, which  seemed reasonable, as this rate constant furthermore yielded  the largest contribution to the global change in the Gibbs free  energy of binding (G).
The impact of specific side chain deletion primarily on koff rather than on kon is concordant with  reports for other protein/protein interactions probed by alanine scanning mutagenesis (46, 47).
The quality of the data  evaluation for these interactions is illustrated in supplemental  Fig. S3, showing the actual fits to the data of sensorgrams  obtained for the interaction between uPARwt and immobilized  pro-uPAS356A.
The dissociation time recorded for this particular interaction was considered adequate to identify uPAR  mutants with impaired koff values caused by specific alanine  replacements.
  The koff values determined for the 244 different uPARprouPA complexes are illustrated by the histograms shown in Fig. 1  (uPAR domain I), Fig. 2 (uPAR domain II), and Fig. 3 (uPAR  domain III).
Each histogram shows threshold levels for the  effects of the mutations, arbitrarily set to 2.5, 5, and 10 times the  dissociation rate of uPARwt.
As evident from Fig. 1, nine residues in uPAR domain I displayed a 2.5-fold increase in the  dissociation rate constant upon alanine substitution (i.e. Arg25,  Thr27, Leu40, Lys50, Thr51, Arg53, Leu55, Tyr57, and Leu66), and  two residues exhibited a 5-fold increase in koff (Leu55 and  Leu66).
According to the crystal structure solved for uPAR in  complex with a uPA antagonist peptide (33), all nine residues  exhibit a surface accessibility of 15 2 in the unoccupied  receptor after removal of the antagonist.
The involvement of  some of these residues in uPA binding (Thr51, Arg53, Leu55,  Tyr57, and Leu66) has been identified previously by alanine  scanning mutagenesis and chemical protection analysis  (23, 24).
  A similar scanning of uPAR domain II identified 21 different  residues with a 2.5-fold increase in koff upon alanine replacement (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table SI).
However, 10 of these  residues (Ser97, Ser100, Leu113, Asp124, Leu144, Arg145, Gly146,  Gly148, Phe165, and His166) do not pass the minimum threshold  of 15 2  , which we have set for an acceptable surface accessibility.
Of the remaining 11 residues in uPAR domain II that,  according to these criteria, are important for uPA binding  (Asp102, Ser104, Glu106, Val125, Thr127, Asp140, Asp141, His143,  Leu150, Pro151, and Leu168), seven displayed a 5-fold increase  in koff (shown in boldface), and two of these displayed as much  as 23-fold (Asp102) and 36-fold (Leu150) increases in koff.
This  analysis clearly emphasizes the important role of uPAR domain  II in uPA binding.
  In contrast to uPAR domains I and II, very few residues in  uPAR domain III were found to contribute to the stability of the  uPARpro-uPA complexes (i.e. Met219, Gly227, and Phe256).
In  addition, these effects were at the lower end of the arbitrary  threshold (2.5-fold increase in koff) (Fig. 3) and were most  likely due to local perturbations of uPAR domain III because  none of these residues occupies a surface-exposed position in  the structure ( 15 2 of surface accessibility).
A compilation of  these data highlighting residues in uPAR that we have identified  as being important for uPA binding by single-site alanine scanning mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance is shown in  Table 1.
This functional epitope for uPA binding is also highlighted in the surface representation of the uPAR structure  shown in Fig 4.

  Covalent conjugation of human uPAR to radiolabeled prouPA by the amine-specific NHS-based cross-linker DSS has  been used as a sensitive tool for the detection of uPAR in  various biological fluids and detergent lysates from neoplastic cell lines (1, 28, 50, 51).
However, this cross-linking reaction is not observed when using murine proteins, despite an  equivalently high affinity uPAR/uPA interaction (18, 50),  FIGURE 2.

  Mapping the uPAR/uPA Interface  JULY 14, 2006VOLUME 281NUMBER 28 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 19265suggesting the absence of optimally positioned lysine side  chains in the noncovalent complex.
  The observation that mutation of any of the 10 lysine residues in human uPAR did not have a pronounced impact on the  affinity for pro-uPA (supplemental Table SI) enabled us to  identify the lysine residues involved in the cross-linking reaction.
In these experiments, complexes were formed using saturating amounts of the unlabeled mutant component (in this  case, uPAR).
The noncovalent uPARATF complexes were conjugated by a short exposure to various NHS-based cross-linkers  with different spacer arm lengths (DSS, 11.4 ; DSG, 7.7 ;  and DST, 6.4 ).
The short exposure to the active NHS ester  ensured that only optimally positioned lysines were crosslinked.
The autoradiograph in Fig. 5 shows that all mutants  except uPARK43A formed covalent complexes with 125I-labeled  ATF under these conditions with DSG as cross-linker.
Similar  results were also obtained with DSS and DST (data not shown),  illustrating that the -amino group of Lys43 in uPAR domain I  can be positioned within 6.411.4  of its target amine in ATF.
  The difference in susceptibility among the various uPAR lysine  mutants for chemical conjugation to ATF cannot be ascribed to  different levels of noncovalent complexes, as the mutants have  comparable Kd values for pro-uPA (supplemental Table SI),  and preincubation using concentrations well above the Kd  ensured that equal levels of noncovalent complexes were  formed.
  Identification of Lys43 as the specific cross-linking site in  human uPAR provides a rational structural basis for the  observed cross-species barrier in the cross-linking potential of  amine-reactive esters because a non-reactive arginine residue  occupies the equivalent position in murine uPAR.
To confirm  this, we introduced a lysine at this position in murine uPAR and  created a gain-of-function mutant, as the resultant murine  uPARR43K now efficiently formed a covalent complex with  murine ATF using DSS (Fig. 6, eighth lane versus seventh lane).
  The affinity of murine uPARwt and uPARR43K for murine prouPA was comparable as judged by surface plasmon resonance  studies (data not shown).
Albeit very faint, the band in the autoradiograph in Fig. 6 (fourth lane) clearly shows that murine  uPARR43K also gained some cross-linking potential for human  ATF.
It is possible that the chemical conjugation efficacy  between murine uPARR43K and human ATF even resembles the  one obtained in the pure human system, as saturation is by far  reached under these conditions because of a 300-fold reduction in affinity for the noncovalent complex formation in the  mixed-species experiment (18).
This suggests that the corresponding target site in ATF probably is conserved between  these two species and that the species specificity in cross-linking is entirely governed by the lysine-to-arginine substitution at  position 43 in the receptor.
  To identify the corresponding target site(s) in pro-uPA for  these amine-reactive cross-linkers, we expressed and purified  12 pro-uPA single-site mutants, targeting all lysine positions in  the non-catalytic modular part of uPA corresponding to ATF  (supplemental Fig. S2).
All these pro-uPA mutants displayed  unaltered binding kinetics for immobilized uPARwt as assessed  by surface plasmon resonance, with the exception of prouPAK23A, which exhibited a moderately reduced affinity (52)  (data not shown).
Cross-linking experiments were performed  as described above using excess unlabeled mutants (in this case,  pro-uPA).
As shown in Fig. 7, pro-uPAK98A clearly encountered  the more severe impact on its cross-linking competence as evidenced by both reduced complex formation and accumulation  of unreacted 125I-labeled uPAR.
As previously inferred from the  reverse cross-linking experiments described above, the target  site in pro-uPA (Lys98) is indeed conserved between man and  mouse.
  Cross-linking uPARGFD Complexes by EDCTo provide  additional and independent intermolecular distance constraints  within the uPARGFD complex, we also performed zero-length  conjugation of preformed complexes between uPARwt and GFDHis using EDC.
The traditional stabilization with NHS was omitted in this case to avoid stable dead-end modifications of carboxylate groups in either of the proteins.
As evident from the  experiment shown in Fig. 8 (lanes 1), monomeric uPARwt underwent extensive oligomerization during EDC-induced cross-linking.
Occupancy of uPAR by GFD-His completely prevented this  receptor oligomerization, which was replaced with a specific conjugated uPARGFD complex (Fig. 8, lanes 2).
These complexes  contained one molecule of each protein as revealed by MALDI  mass spectrometry (data not shown).
Limited chymotrypsin treatment of the cross-linked complexes, leading to cleavage between  uPAR domains I and II after Tyr87 (28, 44), clearly revealed that  uPAR domain I was by far themajor partner for theintermolecular  cross-linking (Fig. 8, lanes 3).
Specific cross-linking sites were subsequently identified by mass spectrometry of the paired samples  after parallel in-gel hydrolysis by trypsin using solvents enriched in  16O- and 18O-labeled H2O.
As evident from the masses deterTABLE 1  Kinetic rate constants for selected uPAR mutants with an impaired  interaction with immobilized pro-uPAS356A as determined by  surface plasmon resonance  The interactions between immobilized pro-uPA (2001000 resonance units) and  the respective purified uPAR mutants were measured at 20 C for serial 2-fold dilutions ranging from 1 to 100 nM uPAR and analyzed in three flow cells with different  levels of immobilized ligand.

However, additional unidentified intermolecular cross-links must be present in the uPARGFD complexes, as we also found GFD-(123) as the free amino-terminal  tryptic fragment in our purified conjugates (Table 2).
  DISCUSSION  To delineate the functional importance of specific amino  acids in human uPAR on its high affinity interaction with the  cognate protease ligand uPA, we have, in this study, produced  and characterized a comprehensive uPAR mutant library.
As  predicted from homology considerations (26, 45) and later corroborated by the three-dimensional x-ray structure (33), the  extracellular uPAR is organized as a modular receptor composed of three homologous domains belonging to the Ly-6/  uPAR/-neurotoxin protein domain fold.
Biochemical studies  using limited proteolysis to obtain specific cleavages in either of  the two interdomain linker peptides in uPAR revealed that  maintenance of the three-domain structure of uPAR constitutes an indispensable condition for expression of high affinity  uPA binding (32, 53).
In keeping with this observation, the present alanine scanning mutagenesis clearly showed that the high  affinity binding of pro-uPA critically depends on structural elements residing in both uPAR domain I (nine residues) and in  uPAR domain II (21 residues), thus providing a structural basis  for the composite nature of the uPA-binding site in uPAR.
  Although the alanine scanning mutagenesis did not reveal any  important role for uPAR domain III in uPA binding, this  domain nevertheless appears to play an auxiliary role in this  high affinity interaction.
This supposition is based on the observation that neither uPAR domain I (32) nor uPAR domains I  and II (53) can form very stable complexes with GFD as  opposed to either intact uPAR or a mixture containing uPAR  domain I and uPAR domains II and III.
This phenomenon most  likely reflects a stabilizing role of uPAR domain III in the assembly of a functional ligand-binding cavity in the three-domain  uPAR.
  A significant body of biochemical data exists in the literature  to highlight the role of uPAR domain I in uPA binding (23, 24,  28, 32, 44).
This relationship is further substantiated by this  study, which identified new residues involved in uPA binding  (Arg25, Thr27, and Leu40) and which validated the importance  of previously assigned residues (Thr51, Arg53, Leu55, Tyr57, and  Leu66).
Interestingly, the side chains of these residues line a  significant fraction of the right wall of the central ligand-binding cavity of uPAR (Fig. 4) as defined by the crystal structure of  uPAR in complex with a peptide antagonist (33).
  The present alanine-scanning mutagenesis also unexpectedly uncovered that uPA binding is particularly sensitive to  mutagenesis in uPAR domain II (Fig. 2), where 11 surface-exposed residues were considered to be important.
The involvement of this domain in uPA binding was previously inferred  primarily from indirect evidence.
Proteolytic cleavage of the  linker region between uPAR domains I and II thus led to a  1500-fold reduction in affinity for uPA equivalent to G   4 kcal/mol (32).
In a mutagenesis study, Bdeir et al. (25) focused  on uPAR domain II, but only interrogated five residues in this  domain and reported that the double mutation K139A/H143A  caused a 5-fold reduction in koff.
This finding is concordant  with our data that uPARH143A displayed a similar decrease in  koff.
Bdeir et al. also reported that the triple mutation R137A/  R142A/R145A had a severe impact on uPA binding, which was  predominantly enforced by a reduction in kon.
With a view to  our present data, this effect is most likely caused by structural  perturbation because, of the corresponding single mutants,  only R145A had a significant effect on uPA binding (Fig. 2 and  supplemental Table SI) and because Arg145 has a surface accessibility of only 0.5 2 in our x-ray structure (33).

This autoradiogram shows a comparison of the crosslinking capacity of purified pro-uPAS356A and the 12 single-site mutations that  individually target all lysines present in the A-chain of human uPA.
After a  60-min preincubation at 4 C of 4 nM 125I-labeled uPAR (residues 1283) and  20 nM pro-uPA (residues 1 411), the preformed complexes were conjugated  by addition of 400 M DSS (range of 11.4 ), followed by a 10-min incubation  at room temperature before the reaction was quenched.
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after reduction and alkylation, and the cross-linking pattern was visualized by autoradiography.

  The latter was subjected to limited proteolysis by 12 nM chymotrypsin to  generate uPAR domain I (DI) and uPAR domains II and III (DIIIII) (lanes 3).
  After reduction and carbamidomethylation, these samples were analyzed by  SDS-PAGE, and the cross-linking pattern was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant  Blue (BB) staining (A) or by Western blotting using either a monoclonal antiHis antibody (B) or anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody S2 (which recognizes  uPAR domain I)(C) or S1(which recognizes uPAR domains II and III)(D).Arrows  indicate the uPAR domains and their corresponding GFD conjugates, which  are also highlighted in lanes 3 by asterisks.
  Mapping the uPAR/uPA Interface  19268 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 281NUMBER 28JULY 14, 2006The importance of uPAR domain II in coordinating the  assembly of a functional ligand-binding cavity in the intact  uPAR is also highlighted by the observation that several buried  residues in this domain have a severe impact on uPA binding  when mutated individually (Fig. 2).
One -strand in particular  exhibits a very low tolerance to mutagenesis, i.e. IID3 in uPAR  domain II (residues 142149).
We have previously proposed  that this bent -strand plays a key role in the internal dynamics  of this modular receptor by acting as a hinge centered on the  RGC sequence and that this hinge enables movement between  domains I and II; the angle between these domains varies from  107.8 to 112.2, as observed in our crystal structure (33).
  Impairment of this interdomain flexibility through structural  perturbations imposed by mutagenesis in IID is therefore  likely to affect the architecture of the central cavity in uPAR,  with resultant effects on uPA binding to the composite functional epitope comprising residues from both uPAR domains I  and II.
  Examination of the G values presented in Table 1 reveals  that no single side chain has the predominant contribution to  the free energy of uPA binding, i.e. typical hot spots (54) are  absent from the receptor interface with uPA.
This property may  be related in part to the architecture of the uPA-binding site,  where the engagement of the deep central cavity is governed  primarily by a flexible surface comprising hydrophobic and aliphatic residues.
Alanine scanning mutagenesis of uPAR will  therefore not significantly affect the hydrophobic nature of this  ligand interface and will be accompanied by compensatory  effects that may attenuate the impact observed on the G  values.
Nevertheless, the present alanine scanning mutagenesis  clearly demonstrated the important role of several hydrophobic  amino acid residues from uPAR domains I and II, which line the  central cavity (Fig. 4).
As illustrated in Fig. 4B, two tracks of  residues involved in uPA binding seem to irradiate from Leu150  at the floor of the cavity to either Asp102 or Asp140 at the rim of  this gorge.
Notably, no residue causing a shift in G  1 kcal/  mol is found exposed on the opposite side of uPAR, and the only  residue in this region causing an intermediate effect (T51A) is  localized close to the entrance of the binding cavity (Fig. 4C).
  On the basis of these biochemical data, we have now built a  model for human uPAR in complex with the ATF of uPA in  which the kringle domain is positioned by the low resolution  distance constraint established by our cross-linking experiments (Fig. 9).
This model merges the information derived from  the present experiments with our previous proposal of a convergent receptor-binding site displayed by the -hairpin in the  GFD of uPA and a linear peptide antagonist developed by combinatorial chemistry (18, 33).
The long -hairpin of GFD  engages the deep central cavity in uPAR, and the resultant  interface buries 1629 2 of accessible surface area of uPA and  1318 2 of uPAR in the complex.
Remarkably, in this model, the  complementary receptor/ligand interface of the uPARGFD  complex is highly asymmetrical.
In uPAR, 27 residues participate in the formation of this interface, but none of the individual contributions actually exceed 6% of the total buried accessible surface area.
As opposed to this, only four residues in GFD  provide 40% of the buried surface (Lys23, Tyr24, Phe25, and  Trp30).
This distinction in geometry may have a bearing on the  determined G values after mutagenesis, where no real hot  spots are found among the many residues forming the large  hydrophobic cavity in uPAR.
  The intimate engagement of the -hairpin of GFD in the  interaction with the central cavity of uPAR provides a plausible  binding mechanism that amalgamates the majority of the biochemical data reported in the literature for this interaction into  one unifying model.
First, the location of the GFD-binding site  at a composite interface involving several residues in both  uPAR domains I and II lining the central cavity explains why the  maintenance of the three-domain structure of uPAR is required  to yield high affinity uPA binding (32, 53).
This architecture  also provides an explanation for the observation that the isolated GFD module can induce the specific assembly of a stable  trimolecular complex comprising uPAR domain I, GFD, and  uPAR domains II and III, whereas all the corresponding bimolecular complexes are very short-lived.
A similar property has  been reported for ATF (55).
Second, the model buries the  amino acid side chains in both uPAR and uPA that become  protected against chemical modification upon complex formation at the interface of the complex, i.e. Tyr57 in uPAR and Lys23  and Tyr24 in uPA (23, 26).
Third, residues highlighted as being  important for this interaction by single-site mutagenesis are  also confined to the -hairpin of GFD (52) or, in the case of  TABLE 2  Mass spectrometry-based identification of the intermolecular cross-link introduced in uPARGFD complexes by EDC  uPAR  sequence  GFD  sequence  Determined peptide  massa  Calculated peptide  mass m m (  18O-16O)b Cross-link  (uPARGFD)c  Identified  in sampled  Da Da Da Da  813 123e 3294.3990 3294.3869 0.0121 8 Asp11Ser1 1, 2  123e 2591.1290 2591.0919 0.0371 4 None 1, 2  117139 2723.2742 2723.2730 0.0011 4 None 1, 3  3143 1602.7885 1602.7897 0.0012 2 None 14  a Accurate peptide masses were determined by nanoflow liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.

A m of 8 Da indicates a peptide conjugate with two carboxyl termini, and a m of 4 Da indicates a  peptide with a single carboxyl terminus; when only 2 Da is observed, it stems from the fact that this particular peptide is a poor pseudo-substrate for trypsin because of the  presence of a glutamic acid in the P2 position.
c Masses for cross-linked peptides were calculated using GPMAW Version 7.0.
The actual cross-linking site between uPAR-(813) and GFD-(123), i.e. Asp11 and Ser1  , was  unambiguously defined by the respective sequences, as only one pair of residues satisfied the reactivity of the employed cross-linking chemistry.
d Numbers indicate the samples from the gel in Fig. 8 that contained the following specific peptides: 1) uPARGFD-His; 2) uPAR domain IGFD-His; 3) uPAR; and 4) uPAR  domain I. e The tryptic peptides representing GFD-(123) became deamidated during the in-gel procedures before addition of trypsin irrespective of its cross-linking status.
Accordingly,  the m caused by the differential 18O and 16O labeling remained 8 and 4 Da for the cross-linked and non-cross-linked peptides, respectively.
Tandem mass spectrometric  sequencing demonstrated that only Asn15 in GFD becomes deamidated, in accordance with its presence in an Asn-Gly motif (59).
  Mapping the uPAR/uPA Interface  JULY 14, 2006VOLUME 281NUMBER 28 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 19269uPAR, are located within or at the rim of the central ligandbinding cavity (Fig. 4) (24).
Two exceptions to this are Asp102  and Asp140, which are located somewhat distantly from the  docked GFD module at the rim of the central cavity in uPAR  (Fig. 9).
One likely explanation for this apparent inconsistency  relates to the mobility of these residues because both exhibit  B-factors above the average for uPAR, and Asp102 in particular  is located in a flexible region of loop 1 in uPAR domain II that is  relatively less well defined in the structure (33).
  The kringle domain of uPA is positioned on the outside of  uPAR domain I in this model, causing ATF to virtually embrace  this domain in a loose-fitting sandwich (Fig. 9).
This conformation places the -amino groups of uPAR Lys43 and uPA Lys98  within the deduced cross-linking distance.
However, it should  be emphasized that the entire range of spacer arm lengths for  the homobifunctional cross-linkers (6.411.4 ) used in this  study leads to a specific productive conjugation of uPAR to  pro-uPA, which indicates certain flexibility in the position of  the kringle domain of uPA in relation to uPAR.
Such a flexible  and transient nature of the interplay between the kringle  domain and uPAR is compatible with the observation that GFD  and the kringle domain behave as completely independent  modules in the NMR-derived structure of ATF (43) and with  our previous observation that GFD and ATF exhibit comparable kinetic rate constants for the interaction with uPAR (56).
  The proximity of the flexible amino terminus of GFD to Asp11  in uPAR domain I established by zero-length cross-linking is  also compatible with the proposed model of the uPARATF  complex.
Finally, our model of the uPARATF complex provides insight into the molecular basis for the competitive inhibition exerted by anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody R3 on the  uPAR/uPA interaction.
Although the functional epitope for  antibody R3 (i.e. Glu33, Leu61, and Lys62) (24, 26) does not coincide with that determined here for uPA, it is clear from the  model that the corresponding structural epitopes must overlap  to such an extent that steric hindrance would preclude concomitant binding of ATF and antibody R3 (Fig. 9).
  During the revision of this manuscript, the crystal structure  of human uPAR in complex with ATF and a Fab fragment of an  anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody was published (57).
This  structure nicely confirms the overall positioning of uPAR and  ATF in our model, where the -hairpin of GFD engages the  central ligand-binding cavity of uPAR and where the kringle  domain is located close to uPAR domain I. Notably, the distance in the crystal structure between Lys43 in uPAR and Lys98  in the kringle domain of ATF (10.8 ) is indeed within the range  defined by the chemical cross-linkers employed in this study.
  However, one important distinction between the crystal structure of uPAR in complex with ATF (57) compared with the  corresponding complex with a peptide antagonist (33) relates  to the relative orientation between uPAR domains I and II.
The  angle between these two receptor domains is thus reduced by  20 in the uPARATF complex because of a conformational  shift centered on the previously mentioned hinge region  between the corresponding interdomain -strands, i.e. IE and  IID (33, 57).
This rearrangement causes Asp140 in uPAR  domain II to move closer to GFD, where it is engaged in a  hydrogen bond with Ser21 (57), thus providing a possible structural basis for the change in G for uPA binding, which we  observed with the D140A mutation.

Model of a uPARATF complex.
A model of the uPARATF complex based on experimental data from alanine scanning and chemical cross-linking  is shown in A. uPAR is illustrated as a surface representation in wheat, and ATF is shown as a ribbon diagram with green -sheets and red -helixes.
Residues in  uPAR identified as important for uPA binding by the present alanine scanning mutagenesis are shown in red (G  1 kcal/mol) and blue (G  0.51  kcal/mol).
The position of the cross-linking site in the kringle domain of uPA is indicated, whereas the corresponding target site in uPAR (Lys43) is not visible  from this view.
The functional epitope for monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody R3 (Glu33, Leu61, and Lys62), which inhibits uPA binding, is highlighted by a yellow  surface representation (24, 26).
The proposed engagement of the -hairpin of the GFD module of uPA in binding to the central cavity of uPAR is shown at a  higher magnification in B. This illustration was generated using PyMOL.
  Mapping the uPAR/uPA Interface  19270 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 281NUMBER 28JULY 14, 2006Combined with the recently published crystal structure of  the uPARATF complex, the present functional study thus provides some of the structure-function relationships that are  required to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling  the interactions between uPAR and its biological ligands such  as pro-uPA, vitronectin, and certain integrins.
This information may also prove essential for decoding the well established  species barrier of both the uPAR/uPA interaction and the selective inhibition of this interaction by peptide antagonists.
The  pronounced species barrier between man and mouse is a considerable problem that has to be tackled when testing the pharmacological effects of uPAR antagonists in various mouse cancer models (11).
