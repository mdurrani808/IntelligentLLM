Olson  From the   Center for Molecular Biology of Oral Diseases and Department of Periodontics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago,  Illinois 60612 and   Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Ministry of Education of China, Shanghai JiaoTong  University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China  Background: ZPI-protein Z complex is a critical anticoagulant regulator of membrane-associated factor Xa.
  Results: The energetics and multistep kinetics of the ZPI-protein Z interaction were characterized with fluorescently labeled  K239C ZPI.
  Conclusion: Ionic and hydrophobic interactions mediate ZPI-protein Z binding, and conserved ZPI Lys-239 promotes protein  Z dissociation.
  Significance: The studies establish the thermodynamic and kinetic basis for catalytic activation of ZPI by protein Z.  The anticoagulant serpin, protein Z-dependent protease  inhibitor (ZPI), circulates in blood as a tight complex with its  cofactor, protein Z (PZ), enabling it to function as a rapid inhibitor of membrane-associated factor Xa.
Here, we show that  N,N-dimethyl-N-(acetyl)-N-(7-nitrobenz-3-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-  yl)ethylenediamine (NBD)-fluorophore-labeled K239C ZPI is a  sensitive, moderately perturbing reporter of the ZPI-PZ interaction and utilize the labeled ZPI to characterize in-depth the  thermodynamics and kinetics of wild-type and variant ZPI-PZ  interactions.
NBD-labeled K239C ZPI bound PZ with 3 nM KD  and 400% fluorescence enhancement at physiologic pH and  ionic strength.
The NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction was markedly sensitive to ionic strength and pH but minimally affected by temperature, consistent with the importance of charged interactions.
NBD-ZPI-PZ affinity was reduced 5-fold by physiologic  calcium levels to resemble NBD-ZPI affinity for -carboxyglutamic acid/EGF1-domainless PZ.
Competitive binding studies  with ZPI variants revealed that in addition to previously identified Asp-293 and Tyr-240 hot spot residues, Met-71, Asp-74,  and Asp-238 made significant contributions to PZ binding,  whereas Lys-239 antagonized binding.
Rapid kinetic studies indicated a multistep binding mechanism with diffusion-limited  association and slow complex dissociation.
ZPI complexation  with factor Xa or cleavage decreased ZPI-PZ affinity 27-fold by  increasing the rate of PZ dissociation.
A catalytic role for PZ was  supported by the correlation between a decreased rate of PZ  dissociation from the K239A ZPI-PZ complex and an impaired  ability of PZ to catalyze the K239A ZPI-factor Xa reaction.
Together, these results reveal the energetic basis of the ZPI-PZ  interaction and suggest an important role for ZPI Lys-239 in PZ  catalytic action.
  Protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI)2 is an anticoagulant protein of the serpin superfamily that regulates the  activity of membrane-associated blood coagulation factor Xa  in a manner dependent on the cofactor, protein Z (PZ) (1 4).
  ZPI also inhibits factor XIa efficiently independent of protein Z  (3, 4).
The importance of ZPI and PZ as anticoagulant regulators of factor Xa and factor XIa is suggested by the prothrombotic phenotype of PZ knock-out mice and embryonic lethality  of ZPI knock-out mice harboring the factor V Leiden mutation  (5, 6), consistent with the aggravated thromboembolic risk  observed in factor V Leiden patients with PZ deficiency (7).
Clinical studies concerning the relationship between ZPI/PZ levels and  risk of venous thrombosis and thromboembolic diseases are often  conflicting, although generally there are more reports supporting  such association than those that do not (8, 9).
ZPI and PZ may also  play a role in other physiologic and pathologic processes such as  inflammation (10) and cancer (11, 12).
  PZ is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein with a structure  similar to that of factors VII, IX, and X and protein C but with a  non-functional protease domain (13).
The protein cofactor circulates as a tight complex with ZPI (14) with PZ levels limiting  the amount of complex formed (3, 15).
The tight binding of PZ  to ZPI is thought to enable the ZPI-PZ complex to bind to a  procoagulant membrane surface where it can encounter and  rapidly inhibit membrane-bound factor Xa (1, 4, 16).
ZPI-PZ  complex structures have been solved by us and another group  (16, 17).
The structures show that PZ binds ZPI through extensive ionic and hydrophobic interactions centered on helix G,  the C terminus of helix A, and sheet C of ZPI, a novel binding  site for a serpin cofactor interaction.
Our recent mutagenesis  studies of ZPI residues in the contact interface with PZ have  * This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health  Grant R37 HL39888 (to S. T. O.).

15, pp. 9906 9918, April 10, 2015   2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Published in the U.S.A.  9906 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290NUMBER 15APRIL 10, 2015   at Univ of St Andrews on May 23, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from demonstrated that two of six contact residues, Asp-293 on helix  G and Tyr-240 on sheet C, constitute binding hot spots and  contribute the bulk of the binding energy of the protein-protein  interaction (18).
Based on these findings, we hypothesized that  the binding hot spots could be targeted to develop novel drugs  capable of disrupting the ZPI-PZ anticoagulant complex and  restoring hemostasis in hemophilia bleeding disorders.
To test  this idea, we sought to develop a rapid and sensitive assay for  ZPI-PZ complex formation for high throughput screening of  small molecules that disrupt the ZPI-PZ interaction.
We report  here on the development of such an assay that exploits our  previous finding that Lys-239 in the ZPI-PZ interface does not  appear to contribute to binding PZ.
By replacing Lys-239 with a  cysteine and labeling with N,N-dimethyl-N-(acetyl)-N-(7-nitrobenz-3-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (NBD) or dansyl fluorophores, we found that the fluorophore labels on ZPI  underwent large fluorescence changes upon PZ binding and  were only moderately perturbing.
  A problem with past studies of the ZPI-PZ interaction is that  they have depended on kinetic assays to infer the affinity of the  interaction based on the rate-enhancing effect of PZ on ZPI  inhibition of factor Xa in the presence of phospholipids and  calcium because previous spectroscopic probes of the ZPI-PZ  interaction have been insufficiently responsive to study the  interaction under equilibrium conditions (4, 18).
A detailed  thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of the interaction  has thus not been possible, and the true energetic contributions  of individual residues to the binding interaction and the role of  ZPI complex formation with factor Xa in promoting PZ release  and action as a catalyst remain to be validated.
Using the fluorescently labeled K239C ZPIs as probes, we now provide the  first in-depth thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of  the ZPI-PZ interaction, the energetic contributions of amino  acid determinants to the interaction, and the effect of ZPI complexation with factor Xa on the interaction.
Our results reveal  an unexpected role for the highly conserved Lys-239 in promoting PZ catalytic action.
  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  ProteinsPlasma-derived human factor Xa, protein Z, and  factor XIa were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories.
Recombinant wild-type and mutant ZPIs were engineered  on a wild type-like ZPI background in which cysteines 169 and  264 were changed to alanine and serine, respectively (16).
In the  case of wild-type and K239C ZPIs, variants with the natural P1  Tyr as well as with the P1 Tyr changed to Arg were engineered  to facilitate factor Xa cleavage and preparation of an RCLcleaved form as reported previously (18).
ZPI variants with Ala  mutations of PZ binding site residues on a wild-type background that retained cysteines 169 and 264 were from our previous study (18).
DNA mutagenesis was carried out by PCR  using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Recombinant  human ZPIs were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells  and purified as described previously (4).
To avoid oxidation of  cysteine in the expression and purification of single cysteine  ZPI variants, 5 mM cysteine was added to the conditioned  medium of insect cells expressing the variants, and 1 mM DTT  was added to buffers used for purification of the variants.
  Recombinant PZ lacking the -carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) and  EGF1 N-terminal domains (residues 84360) and with a C-terminal His tag (referred to as rPZ) was expressed in baculovirusinfected insect cells using the BD BaculoGold transfection kit  (BD Biosciences).
The expressed rPZ in culture medium was  purified by nickel-Sepharose chromatography (GE Healthcare)  as described (17).
Molar concentrations of wild-type and  mutant ZPIs, plasma PZ, and rPZ were determined from the  absorbance at 280 nm using calculated extinction coefficients  of 31,525, 62,568, and 41,940 M1 cm1  , respectively (19).
Protease concentrations were determined by standard activity  assays that were calibrated based on active site titrations (20).
  Fluorophore LabelingK239C ZPI or cleaved K239C ZPI  (30 M) were dialyzed in 50 mM Tris, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 8.5  buffer containing 50 M DTT, labeled with 400 M iodoacetamido-NBD or 5-[2-(2-iodoacetamido)ethylamino]-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (Molecular Probes) for 4 h at 4 C in the  dark and then purified from unreacted label as described (21).
  The extent of fluorophore labeling was determined from the  ratio of NBD or DANS absorbance to the protein absorbance at  280 nm after correcting the latter for the contribution of the  fluorophore.
Extinction coefficients of 25,000 M1 cm1 at 478  nm for NBD and 5700 M1 cm1 for DANS at 330 nm were used  for these calculations.
  Experimental ConditionsBinding and rapid kinetic experiments were carried out at 25 C in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH  7.1 containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.1% PEG 8000 (I  0.15).
Equilibrium binding titrations were performed in PEG 20,000-  coated acrylic cuvettes.
The enzyme kinetic assays for factor Xa  and factor XIa inhibition were carried out in the same Tris-HCl  buffer but at pH 7.4.
Binding experiments at varying pH values  were performed in 10 mM Mes or Tris buffers containing 0.15 M  NaCl and 0.1% PEG 8000.
Binding experiments were also done  in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.1 over a range of NaCl concentrations of 0.05 0.5 M and at 0.1 M NaCl over a range of calcium  concentrations.
In most experiments, ovalbumin was included  at 0.1 mg/ml to improve protein stability.
Binding experiments  at varying temperatures were done in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1% PEG 8000 buffer, pH 7.1 with pH adjustments made at each temperature to ensure a constant pH.  Fluorescence Emission SpectraFluorescence emission spectra were measured with an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer with  excitation at 480 nm over the emission range of 500 600 nm  for NBD-ZPI and at 292 or 336 nm over the emission range of  400550 nm for DANS-ZPI.
Emission was monitored in 5-nm  steps with 510-s integrations per step.
Spectra were obtained  with 100 nM labeled ZPI with at least three replicate measurements averaged.
Buffer or buffer plus PZ background spectra  were subtracted, and dilution corrections were made for added  PZ (10%).
  Equilibrium Binding of PZ to Labeled ZPIsEquilibrium dissociation constants for fluorescently labeled ZPI-PZ interactions were measured at 25 C by titrating PZ into solutions of  labeled ZPIs (2550 nM) and monitoring the changes in NBD  fluorescence at 545 nm (ex, 480 nm) or DANS fluorescence at  480 nm (ex, 292 nm).
Titrations were computer-fit by nonlinThermodynamics and Kinetics of the ZPI-PZ Interaction  APRIL 10, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 15 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 9907   at Univ of St Andrews on May 23, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from ear least squares analysis using Kaleidagraph 4.1 software (Synergy) by the following quadratic binding equation.

F0, KD, and  Fmax were the fitted parameters.
To obtain a reliable value of  n, this parameter was fitted in experiments with high concentrations of labeled ZPI (50100 nM) in buffer containing 0.05 or  0.1 M NaCl.
Fitted values of n were then assumed in experiments using 25 nM labeled ZPI to best determine KD.
  The effect of ionic strength on ZPI-PZ complex affinity was  analyzed by the Debye-Huckel equation (22).
  G0  bind  G0  nonionic  G0  ionic,0  expC  I  1/ 2 /1  C   I  1/ 2  (Eq. 2)  where G0  bind, G0  nonionic, and G0  ionic,0 are the standard free  energies for overall binding, for the nonionic component of  binding, and for the ionic component of binding at zero ionic  strength, respectively; C is a constant related to the DebyeHuckel screening parameter; and I is the ionic strength.
Measured KD values at different ionic strengths were converted to  binding free energies by the relation G0  bind  RT  ln(1/  KD) where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature.
At 25 C (298 K), this relation becomes G0  bind  1.364  kcal/mol  log KD.
G0  bind values as a function of the square  root of the ionic strength were then fitted by the above equation  with G0  nonionic, G0  ionic,0, and C, the fitted parameters.
The  relative contributions of nonionic and ionic interactions to the  unitary binding energy were obtained by correcting G0  nonionic  for the unfavorable entropic energy of bringing two molecules  together in solution of  2.38 kcal/mol at 25 C (23).
  Calcium EffectsThe dependence of ZPI-PZ complex affinity on calcium concentration was analyzed by Equation 3.
  KD,app  KD,Ca  KCa/KCa  Ca2     KD, Ca  Ca2   /KCa   Ca2     I  Ca2   (Eq. 3)  where KD,app is the apparent dissociation constant measured  for the NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction at a given calcium concentration; KD,Ca and KD, Ca are dissociation constants for NBDZPI binding to free and calcium-saturated PZ, respectively; KCa  is the dissociation constant for calcium binding to PZ (assuming equal and independent sites); and I represents a factor  accounting for the ionic strength effect of calcium ions on affinity.
In computer fitting of data with this equation, I was fixed  based on the observed ionic strength dependence of the interaction, and KD,Ca, KD, Ca, and KCa were the fitted parameters.
  Competitive Binding of Unlabeled and Labeled ZPIs to PZ  Binding of unlabeled wild-type and variant ZPIs to PZ was  measured by competitive binding titrations in which the unlabeled ZPI was titrated into a solution of NBD-labeled ZPI-PZ  complex, and the fluorescence decrease due to displacement of  the labeled ZPI from the ZPI-PZ complex by unlabeled ZPI was  measured.
Small corrections were made for decreases in fluorescence due to scattering (10%) in titrations of weak binding  Y240A and D293A ZPI variants based on control buffer titrations.
Observed relative fluorescence changes were fit by the  cubic equation for competitive binding to obtain the KD for the  unlabeled ZPI-PZ interaction, assuming a stoichiometry of 1  and fixing the KD and stoichiometry for the labeled ZPI interaction at their independently measured values (24).
  Rapid KineticsRapid kinetic studies of labeled ZPI-PZ  interactions were performed with an Applied Photophysics  SX-17MV stopped-flow instrument under pseudo-first order  conditions in which the molar concentration of PZ was maintained at least 5-fold greater than that of NBD-labeled K239C  ZPI or RCL-cleaved K239C ZPI.
Reactions were monitored  from NBD fluorescence changes using an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission filter with a 520-nm cut-on  wavelength.
Data were collected over two 500-point split time  frames of 2 and 50 s. Progress curves were fit by the following  three-exponential equation.
  Fobs  F  F1  expkobs,1t   F2  expkobs,2t   F3   expkobs,3t  (Eq. 4)  where Fobs is the observed fluorescence at time t; F, F1, F2,  and F3 are end point fluorescence and first phase, second  phase, and third phase fluorescence changes, respectively; and  kobs,1, kobs,2, and kobs,3 are the observed rate constants for the  three kinetic phases.
F, F1, F2, F3, kobs,1, kobs,2, and kobs,3  were the fitted parameters.
510 reaction traces were averaged  for each PZ concentration.
Buffer and NBD-ZPI controls were  done to correct observed signals for background and validate  the NBD-ZPI starting fluorescence.
The kinetics of ZPI-PZ  complex dissociation were studied by mixing NBD-ZPI-PZ  complex with buffer and increasing concentrations of unlabeled K239A to induce complex dissociation.
The fluorescence  decrease due to complex dissociation was fit by two instead of  three exponential terms in the above equation.
NBD-ZPI binding to PZ was also analyzed in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ZPI with progress curves fit by the  three-exponential equation.
Data were fit by numerical integration of the differential equations for a three-step binding model  using Kintek Explorer 3.0 software (25).
Because of variability in  fluorescence amplitudes due to background scattering, corrections of observed amplitudes were made (10%) to constrain the  amplitude dependence on PZ concentration to conform to the  independently measured KD in equilibrium binding titrations.
  Stoichiometries of ZPI-Protease ReactionsFixed concentrations of protease (100 nM factor Xa or 20 nM factor XIa)  were incubated with increasing concentrations of ZPI ranging  from a 310-fold molar excess in the presence of PZ equimolar  with the ZPI concentration, 25 M phospholipid vesicles (7:3  phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylserine from Avanti prepared  as described (4)), and 5 mM CaCl2 for reactions with factor Xa or  in the absence of cofactors for reactions with factor XIa in reaction volumes of 25100 l. After allowing sufficient time to  reach maximal inhibition based on measured second order  association rate constants (315 min), the remaining proteoThermodynamics and Kinetics of the ZPI-PZ Interaction  9908 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290NUMBER 15APRIL 10, 2015   at Univ of St Andrews on May 23, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from lytic activity was measured by diluting the reaction mixture  with 1 ml of 100 M Spectrozyme factor Xa (American Diagnostica) for factor Xa reactions or 100 M S2366 (Diapharma)  for factor XIa reactions and monitoring the absorbance change  at 405 nm.
10 mM EDTA was included in the substrate when  Ca2  was present in the reactions.
Initial rates of hydrolysis  were determined from second order polynomial fits of substrate hydrolysis progress curves as described previously (4).
  The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) was determined from the  fitted abscissa intercept of a linear plot of residual protease  activity against molar ratio of inhibitor to protease.
  Kinetics of ZPI-Factor Xa and ZPI-Factor XIa Reactions  The kinetics of protease inactivation by wild-type and variant  ZPIs was measured under pseudo-first order conditions in  which the inhibitor was in large molar excess over the protease  (at least 5 times greater than the concentration of ZPI required  to fully inhibit protease) in the presence of equimolar PZ, 5 mM  Ca2 , and 25 M membrane vesicles for reactions with factor  Xa or in the absence of cofactors for reactions with factor XIa.
  Progress curves for the time-dependent inhibition of protease  were measured in discontinuous assays in which samples (50  100 l) were incubated for different times or withdrawn from  reaction mixtures at varying times and diluted into 1 ml of fluorescence substrate (either 50 M Pefafluor FXa for factor Xa  inhibition or 40 M t-butoxycarbonyl-EAR-aminomethylcoumarin for factor XIa inhibition (both from Centerchem)) (18).
  10 mM EDTA was included in the substrate when Ca2  was  present in the reactions.
Initial velocities of substrate hydrolysis  were measured by fitting progress curves by the second order  polynomial function as described previously (4).
Second order  association rate constants (ka) were obtained from the slopes of  fits of the linear dependence of kobs on the ZPI concentration  ([ZPI]0) according to the following equation.
  kobs  ka  ZPI 0  kd (Eq. 5)  where kd represents the rate constant for ZPI-protease complex  dissociation as reported previously (4).
Corrections of ka for  differing SIs were made by multiplying ka by SI.
  Reactions with catalytic PZ were done with fixed concentrations of 200 nM ZPI and 6 nM factor Xa in the presence of 25 M  lipid, 5 mM CaCl2, and 02.5 nM PZ.
Progress curves were  acquired as above, and kobs was measured from fits with a single  exponential function.
Corrections of kobs for SI were made by  multiplying uncatalyzed and PZ-catalyzed contributions to kobs  by the corresponding SIs for uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions.
The second order association rate constant for PZ catalysis was obtained from the slope of a plot of kobs  SI versus PZ  concentration corrected for the fraction of PZ complexed with  ZPI based on measured KD values.

  Thermodynamics and Kinetics of the ZPI-PZ Interaction  APRIL 10, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 15 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 9909   at Univ of St Andrews on May 23, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from RESULTS  Characterization of Fluorophore-labeled ZPIs as Probes of PZ  BindingTo engineer a fluorescently labeled ZPI that reports  PZ binding in a minimally perturbing manner, we chose to label  Lys-239, a residue located on the periphery of the ZPI-PZ binding interface that appears not to be involved in binding PZ (18).
  Lys-239 was changed to cysteine in a cysteine-free ZPI variant  in which the two wild-type Cys residues were changed to Ser or  Ala. The Ser/Ala substitutions do not affect ZPI functional  properties (Table 1) (16).
K239C ZPI was expressed and purified with a yield similar to that of the cysteine-free parent ZPI,  and the mutant was labeled with iodoacetamido-NBD or  -DANS fluorophores to give final NBD/ZPI or DANS/ZPI  ratios close to 1 (1.1  0.1 for NBD-ZPI and 1.0  0.1 for  DANS-ZPI).
The K239C mutation or the labeling of K239C ZPI  with NBD or DANS fluorophores minimally affected the reactivity of ZPI with factor Xa in the presence of protein Z, phospholipid, and Ca2  cofactors or with factor XIa in the absence  of these cofactors (Table 1).
  Addition of a molar excess of PZ to NBD-labeled ZPI  resulted in a large enhancement and 3-nm blue shift in the NBD  fluorescence emission spectrum (Fig. 1A).
Titration of the fluorescence enhancement showed that it was saturable and well fit by  the equation for tight equilibrium binding (Fig. 2).
Fits of several  titrations indicated a high affinity NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction with  an averageKD of 2.60.6 nM, a binding stoichiometry of 0.90.1,  and a maximum 34-fold fluorescence enhancement.
  Addition of a molar excess of PZ to DANS-labeled ZPI similarly caused a 4-nm blue shift and 23-fold saturable enhancement in the fluorescence emission spectrum when tryptophan  fluorescence was excited at 292 nm (Fig. 1B).
Direct excitation  of the DANS fluorophore at 336 nm resulted in the same blue  shift but a smaller 1.2-fold enhancement in the emission spectrum (not shown).
The larger enhancement observed with  292-nm excitation indicated that PZ binding to DANS-ZPI was  accompanied by significant FRET between PZ tryptophans and  the DANS label on ZPI.
Equilibrium binding titrations indicated an average KD of 4  1 nM and binding stoichiometry of  0.6 0.8 for the PZ-DANS-ZPI interaction, similar to that  measured for the PZ-NBD-ZPI interaction.
  To determine whether the fluorophore labels affected the  binding affinity of PZ for ZPI, competitive binding titrations  were performed in which unlabeled K239C ZPI was titrated  into NBD-labeled ZPI-PZ complex, and the fluorescence  decrease due to competitive displacement of labeled ZPI from  the complex by unlabeled ZPI was monitored (Fig. 3).
Computer fitting of data with the competitive binding equation indicated a KD for the unlabeled K239C ZPI-PZ interaction of 0.1   0.1 nM, representing a 10-fold higher affinity of PZ for the  unlabeled ZPI than for NBD- or DANS-labeled ZPIs.
The fluorophore labels thus significantly weaken the K239C ZPI interaction with protein Z. Surprisingly, competitive binding titrations with wild-type unlabeled ZPI (Fig. 3) indicated a KD of 2   1 nM, which was similar to the value measured for the NBDlabeled ZPI interaction (Table 2).
This suggested that the wildtype Lys-239 residue impaired PZ binding relative to Cys at this  position to an extent similar to that of the NBD-labeled Cys-239  residue and thus that PZ affinity for ZPI is sensitive to the size of  the side chain at position 239.
Competitive binding titrations  with a K239A ZPI mutant confirmed that replacing Lys-239  with a smaller alanine side chain resulted in a subnanomolar KD  (0.1  0.1 nM) indistinguishable from that measured for the  K239C substitution (Table 2).
NBD and DANS labels thus significantly perturb K239C ZPI interactions with PZ to similar  extents, and replacing Cys-239 with the wild-type Lys residue  produces a comparable perturbation.
  Ionic Strength Dependence of the ZPI-PZ InteractionThe  x-ray structure of the ZPI-PZ complex together with previous  mutagenesis studies has suggested that ionic interactions are  important contributors to the ZPI-PZ interaction (1618).
We  therefore investigated the ionic strength dependence of the  binding of PZ to the NBD-labeled ZPI.
Increasing buffer ionic  strength dramatically decreased ZPI-PZ binding affinity (Fig. 2  and Table 3).
The measured KD increased 200-fold when  NaCl was increased from 0.1 to 0.5 M. Debye-Huckel analysis of  the ionic strength dependence of KD according to Equation 2  under Experimental Procedures (Fig. 4) indicated that ionic  interactions contributed 49% (6.9 kcal/mol) to the unitary binding energy at physiologic ionic strength and that nonionic interactions contributed the remaining 51% (7.2 kcal/mol).3  Given the ionic strength sensitivity of the ZPI-PZ interaction, we performed competitive binding titrations of NBD-labeled ZPI-PZ complex with unlabeled wild-type, K239C, and  K239A ZPI variants to confirm their differential affinities for  3 The unitary binding energy represents the apparent standard free energy of  binding of ZPI and PZ (G0  ) corrected for the entropic energy required to  bring two molecules together in solution (2.38 kcal/mol at 25 C) (23).

Fitting of these titrations yielded  KD values of 16  4 nM for wild-type, 1.1  0.3 nM for K239C,  and 0.3  0.2 nM for K239A ZPI interactions with PZ (Table 2)  as compared with the KD of 60  2 nM determined for the  labeled NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction at this ionic strength (Table  3).
The Lys-239 side chain thus weakens affinity  15-fold, and  the NBD label on the Cys-239 side chain weakens affinity  60-  fold compared with Cys and Ala side chains under these higher  ionic strength conditions.
  Calcium and Lipid EffectsBecause ZPI complexation with  PZ enables ZPI to bind to a membrane through the Gla domain  of PZ and this binding depends on calcium ions (16, 26), the  effect of calcium ions and phospholipid membrane vesicles on  the ZPI-PZ interaction was studied.
PZ bound NBD-ZPI  8-fold more weakly in the presence of 5 mM Ca2  than in its  absence.
By contrast, NBD-ZPI-PZ complex affinity decreased  1.5-fold when the NaCl concentration was increased to an  equivalent ionic strength (Fig. 5A).
Titrations of the NBDZPI-PZ complex with calcium ions revealed a specific calcium  ion-dependent decrease in ZPI-PZ complex affinity as eviFIGURE 3.

The sloping end point  reflected the expected weakening of the complex affinity caused  by calcium increases in ionic strength.
The dependence of  ZPI-PZ complex affinity on calcium concentration was analyzed from additional titrations at several fixed calcium concentrations (Fig. 5C).
Fitting of this dependence assuming that a specific calcium ion interaction altered affinity yielded an apparent  calcium concentration for half-maximal binding of 1 mM and a  KD for the calcium-saturated ZPI-PZ complex of 15  4 nM. These  findings suggested that specific calcium ion interactions with  either ZPI or PZ weakened ZPI-PZ complex affinity.
  Titrations of NBD-ZPI with PZ in the presence of phospholipid  membrane vesicles (10 M) and 1.5 mM calcium yielded a KD of  131 nM, similar to the effect of calcium alone, indicating that the  calcium-dependent binding of PZ to a membrane decreases ZPI  affinity 5-fold from that in the absence of calcium and membrane as a result of specific calcium interactions with the complex.
  A control titration with phospholipid alone yielded a KD of 4  1  nM, confirming no significant effect of membrane on the stronger  NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction in the absence of calcium.
  To determine whether the specific calcium ion effects on PZ  binding to ZPI involved interactions with the PZ Gla domain,  we examined the binding to NBD-labeled ZPI of an rPZ lacking  the Gla and EGF1 domains.
The truncated rPZ bound to NBDlabeled ZPI 5-fold more weakly than full-length plasma PZ at  physiologic ionic strength (KD 12  1 nM), indicating that the  Gla/EGF1 domains of PZ did influence the binding interaction.
  However, in contrast to the NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction, the addition of calcium ions had minimal effects on rPZ binding to  NBD-ZPI with the KD increasing only 1.5-fold when the calcium ion concentration was increased to 5 mM (KD 18  1 nM)  in accordance with that expected for the ionic strength increase  caused by calcium addition.
The differential sensitivities of NBDZPI interactions with rPZ and PZ to calcium ions were consistent  with the specific calciumion effects on thelatterinteraction resulting from calcium ion interactions with the PZ Gla domain.
  pH and Temperature EffectsTitrations of NBD-ZPI with  PZ as a function of the buffer pH at I 0.15 at 25 C showed that  binding was significantly weakened below pH 7 with the KD  increasing 7-fold when the pH was lowered from 7.1 to 6.1  (KD 17  3 nM), consistent with a role for charged acidic residues in binding.
TheKD changed insignificantly between pH 7.1  and 8.4 but increased significantly at pH 9.0 by 5-fold (KD  13  2 nM), consistent with the importance of charged basic  residues for binding.
Varying the temperature over the range  5.035.0 C resulted in no significant change in the affinity of  NBD-labeled ZPI for PZ measured at pH 7.1, I 0.22 (KD 1416  nM), implying that binding was largely entropically driven.
  Effects of ZPI CleavageWe previously provided evidence  that factor Xa cleavage of ZPI at the RCL P1 residue weakens  ZPI affinity for PZ and promotes PZ release and recycling as a  catalytic cofactor (4, 18).
To provide direct quantitation of the  effect of RCL cleavage on ZPI binding to PZ under equilibrium  conditions, we compared the ability of unlabeled native and  RCL-cleaved wild-type ZPI to compete with NBD-labeled ZPI  for binding PZ by competitive binding titrations.
RCL-cleaved  ZPI was prepared with a P1 Arg variant of ZPI that is preferentially cleaved by factor Xa.
The KD values measured from competitive binding titrations showed that PZ bound cleaved ZPI  2.5-fold more weakly than native ZPI at physiologic ionic  strength and 2-fold more weakly at twice this ionic strength  (Table 2).
To determine whether the effect of ZPI cleavage on  PZ affinity was similar for both free cleaved ZPI and cleaved ZPI  complexed with factor Xa, we performed competitive binding  titrations in which wild-type ZPI (P1 Tyr), untreated or incubated with 1 eq of factor Xa based on the measured SI, were  titrated into NBD-ZPI-PZ complex (Fig. 6).
Both wild-type and  K239A ZPIs were studied in these experiments.
Comparable  differences in KD between native ZPI and ZPI-factor Xa complexes of 2 4-fold were observed for wild-type and K239A  FIGURE 5.

  In a more direct approach, we prepared an RCL-cleaved  NBD-labeled K239C P1 Arg ZPI variant (NBD-cZPI).
PZ  bound to NBD-cZPI with a fluorescence enhancement comparable with that of NBD-ZPI, a stoichiometry of 0.9  0.1, and a  KD of 18  3 nM. The 7-fold higher KD for the NBD-cZPI-PZ  interaction than the NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction suggested that  PZ affinity for ZPI was reduced by RCL cleavage to a greater  extent with the NBD-labeled proteins than the unlabeled proteins.
Binding studies over a range of ionic strengths showed  that the binding of PZ to NBD-cZPI was strongly dependent on  ionic strength, similar to the NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction, and  remained weaker than the NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction at all ionic  strengths, although the differences in affinity progressively  decreased as ionic strength was increased (Fig. 4 and Table 3).
  Debye-Huckel analysis showed that ionic interactions contributed significantly less unitary binding energy to the cleaved (5.4  kcal/mol) than to the uncleaved ZPI interaction (6.9 kcal/mol),  whereas nonionic binding energy was not significantly different  for the two interactions within experimental error (7.5 versus  7.2 kcal/mol).
NBD-cZPI bound PZ and rPZ with similar affinity at physiologic ionic strength (KD values of 18  3 and 20  3  nM), and addition of 5 mM calcium caused similar 2-fold  decreases in affinity (KD values of 40  3 and 45  2 nM), largely  accountable for by increases in ionic strength due to the added  calcium ions.
These results suggest that calcium-Gla domain  interactions do not affect the NBD-cZPI-PZ interaction as they  do the NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction.
Consequently, PZ affinity for  NBD-ZPI is reduced somewhat less by RCL cleavage in the  presence of 5 mM calcium (2-fold) than in its absence.
  Contributions of ZPI Residues to PZ BindingOur previous  studies evaluated the relative contributions of ZPI residues to  binding PZ by analyzing the effect of single Ala mutations of  ZPI binding interface residues on PZ affinity through indirect  kinetic titrations of the rate-enhancing effect of PZ on ZPI inhibition of membrane-bound factor Xa (18).
To assess the true  contributions of these ZPI residues to the binding energy of the  PZ interaction under equilibrium conditions, we performed  competitive binding titrations of NBD-labeled ZPI-PZ complex  with the unlabeled ZPI mutants.
The mutant ZPIs showed  widely different abilities to displace labeled ZPI from its complex with PZ, reflecting a progressive decrease in binding affinity of the mutant ZPIs that followed the order WT  D238A   M71A  D74A  Y240A  D293A (Fig. 7 and Table 2).
A clear  3-fold lower affinity of D238A ZPI than wild-type ZPI was  measured at a higher ionic strength of 0.3.
From the difference  in standard free energy of binding (G0  ) between mutant and  wild-type ZPIs at physiologic ionic strength, unitary binding  energy contributions of 0.3, 1.5, 2.5, 3.0 and 4.0 kcal/mol were  calculated for Asp-238, Met-71, Asp-74, Tyr-240, and Asp-293  residues, respectively (Table 2).
  Kinetics of ZPI-PZ InteractionsThe kinetics of PZ binding  to NBD-labeled ZPI were studied under pseudo-first order conditions by stopped-flow fluorometry.
Progresscurves of the fluorescence change accompanying PZ binding to NBD-ZPI were  clearly biphasic with a rapid phase accounting for 90% of the  fluorescence change over 2 s and a slower phase accounting for  the remaining 10% over the next 50 s (Fig. 8, A and B).
  Attempts to fit the kinetic data by two exponential changes in  fluorescence revealed reproducible nonrandom deviations of  the data from the fitted curves.
However, fitting of the data with  three exponential fluorescence changes resulted in random  deviations of the data from the fitted curves and substantial  FIGURE 6.

The observed pseudofirst order rate constants obtained from the fits for each of the  three phases showed different dependences on the protein Z  concentration: the dominant fast phase showed a linear  dependence, the subsequent intermediate phase showed a saturable dependence, and the final very slow phase showed minimal dependence (Fig. 8C).
These results suggested that PZ  binding to ZPI was a three-step process with an initial bimolecular binding step causing the bulk of the fluorescence change  followed by two unimolecular conformational changes in the  complex that caused modest further increases in fluorescence.
  The slope of the linear first phase dependence of 1.6  0.1  107  M1 s  1 suggested a bimolecular association rate constant for  FIGURE 8.Rapid kinetics of NBD-ZPI binding to PZ.

The  intercept of this dependence of 1.2 s1 together with the limiting rate constant for the second phase dependence of 23 s1  suggested that initial and intermediate complexes were formed  in a rapid steady-state phase accounting for 90% of the fluorescence change.
An invariant rate constant of 0.06 0.07 s1  for the third phase implied that the intermediate complex  underwent a very slow conformational change to form the final  complex that accounted for the remaining 10% of the fluorescence change.
Numerical fitting of the kinetic data by the differential equations for a three-step binding mechanism using  Kintek Explorer software provided an excellent fit and confirmed the inferior fit of a two-step binding model (Table 4).
  To corroborate this multistep binding mechanism, we  analyzed the kinetics of dissociation of the NBD-ZPI-PZ  complex by mixing preformed complex with a molar excess  of unlabeled K239A ZPI that binds ZPI 50-fold more tightly  than the wild-type serpin.
Complex dissociation was monitored  from decreases in NBD probe fluorescence.
Progress curves in  this case were biexponential with 30% of the fluorescence  decrease occurring in a fast exponential phase and the remainder occurring in a slower phase (Fig. 8D).
K239A ZPI concentrations ranging from a 15-fold molar excess over NBD-ZPI  resulted in a progressive convergence of dissociation progress  curves, indicating that the higher K239A ZPI concentrations  were sufficient to rapidly capture all PZ released from the complex and cause PZ dissociation from the NBD-ZPI-PZ complex  to become rate-limiting.
Limiting kobs values of 0.09 and 0.02  s  1 were measured for the rapid and slow phases for dissociation of the NBD-ZPI-PZ complex, consistent with a rapid dissociation phase reflecting dissociation of PZ from initial and  intermediate complexes and a slow dissociation phase reflecting dissociation of PZ from a final more tightly bound complex.
  Fitting of the data by the three-step model yielded excellent fits  and fair agreement of fitted kinetic parameters with those  determined from association kinetic experiments.
Global fitting of both association and dissociation kinetic data to the  three-step binding model with relative fluorescence amplitudes  constrained based on the measured overall equilibrium KD  yielded excellent fits of all data (Fig. 8, A, B, and D).
Such fits  indicated that an initial complex with KD of 9  1 nM was  formed with an association rate constant of 2.1  0.1  107 M1  s  1 and dissociation rate constant of 0.18  0.02 s1 and then  underwent two successive conformational changes that tightened affinity 3-fold (Table 4).
  Similar kinetic studies were performed for (i) NBD-ZPI binding to PZ in the presence of calcium and phospholipid vesicles,  (ii) NBD-ZPI binding to rPZ, and (iii) NBD-cZPI binding to PZ  and rPZ.
Progress curves resembled those observed for the  NBD-ZPI-PZ reaction in all cases in showing a dominant fast  phase fluorescence increase complete in 2 s followed by a  slower fluorescence increase over 50 s and again required  three exponential terms to provide good fits with nonrandom  residuals.
Kintek fitting of progress curves for each reaction by  the three-step binding model suggested that the affinity differences for each of the binding interactions resulted largely from  effects on the initial binding step with subsequent conformaTABLE 4  Kinetic parameters derived from Kintek fits of progress curves of ZPI/cZPI reactions with PZ and rPZ  Fluorescence progress curves were obtained for reactions of 20 n  M NBD-ZPI or NBD-cZPI with 100600 n  M PZ or rPZ in 50 m  M Tris buffer, pH 7.1, I 0.15 at 25 C such as those in Fig. 8, corrected for buffer background, and  then fitted using Kintek software by a three-step sequential binding model as described under Experimental Procedures.

  To assess whether the kinetics of PZ binding to unlabeled  ZPI resembled those for binding to labeled ZPI, we examined  the kinetics of PZ binding to NBD-ZPI in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled wild-type, RCLcleaved, and K239A ZPIs.
Analysis of kobs for the dominant fast  binding phase showed a linear increase in kobs as the concentration of competitor ZPIs was increased (Fig. 9).
All three unlabeled competitor ZPIs gave indistinguishable linear increases  in kobs with a slope of 1.2  0.1  107 M1 s  1  , which is close to  that for PZ binding to labeled ZPI, suggesting that all competitors bound PZ with similar kinetics of association and thus that  the different PZ affinities of the competitors resulted from differences in the kinetics of complex dissociation.
  Correlation of ZPI-PZ Dissociation Rates with PZ Catalytic  ActionTo determine whether the differing rates of PZ dissociation from wild-type and K239A ZPI-PZ complexes affected  the ability of PZ to act as a catalyst in the ZPI-factor Xa reaction  (4, 18), we compared the kinetics of wild-type and K239A ZPI  inhibition of factor Xa in the presence of catalytic levels of PZ,  calcium, and phospholipid under pseudo-first order conditions.
We also examined the D74A ZPI variant reaction because  the lower affinity of PZ for this variant was expected to correlate  with a faster rate of dissociation from the variant relative to the  wild-type ZPI-PZ complex.
Progress curves for ZPI inhibition  of factor Xa in the absence and presence of PZ were well fit by  single exponential functions (Fig. 10).
Observed pseudo-first  order rate constants increased linearly as the concentration of  PZ was increased in a substoichiometric range (0.52.5 nM)  relative to ZPI and factor Xa.
Notably, the K239A ZPI-factor Xa  reaction showed a 5-fold lower slope than either wild-type or  D74A ZPI reactions.
Correction for differences in SI yielded a  3.23.5-fold lower second order rate constant for PZ catalysis  of 2.1  0.3  106 M1 s  1 compared with values of 7.4  0.5   106 and 6.7  0.4  106 M1 s  1 for wild-type and D74A ZPI  reactions, respectively.
By contrast, similar second order rate  constants were measured for wild-type, D74A, and K239A ZPIfactor Xa reactions in the presence of calcium and phospholipid  at stoichiometric levels of PZ (18).
  DISCUSSION  We have shown that replacing ZPI Lys-239 on the periphery  of the PZ binding site with a Cys and labeling with NBD or  DANS fluorophores yield a ZPI derivative that is a sensitive,  moderately perturbing reporter of PZ binding.
This has allowed  us to characterize in unprecedented detail the thermodynamics  FIGURE 9.
Kinetics of competitive binding of unlabeled and NBD-labeled  ZPIs to PZ.
NBD-ZPI (100 nM) was mixed with 20 nM PZ in the absence and  presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled wild-type intact (F) or  cleaved () ZPI or K239A ZPI ().
Averaged reaction traces were fit by the  three-exponential equation, and kobs for phase 1 was plotted as a function of  unlabeled competitor ZPI concentration.
The solid line is a linear least squares  fit of the wild-type intact ZPI data.

Effect of catalytic PZ on the kinetics of wild-type and variant ZPI-factor Xa reactions.
A, progress curves are shown for reactions of 200 nM  wild-type (closed symbols) or K239A ZPI (open symbols) with 6 nM factor Xa in the absence (circles) and presence of 1 (triangles) and 2. 5 nM (squares) PZ at 25 C  in pH 7.4 Tris buffer, I 0.15 containing 5 mM calcium and 25M phospholipid.
Solid lines are fits by a single exponential function with nonzero end point.
The end  points progressively decrease with increasing PZ concentration because acylation and deacylation rates for formation and dissociation of the ZPI-PZ complex  are comparable in the absence of PZ, whereas acylation is favored in the presence of PZ (4).

kobs was obtained from exponential fits of the reaction progress curves in A and others not shown for the indicated ZPI-factor Xa reactions.

  Thermodynamics and Kinetics of the ZPI-PZ Interaction  9916 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290NUMBER 15APRIL 10, 2015   at Univ of St Andrews on May 23, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from and kinetics of wild-type and variant ZPI interactions with PZ  under equilibrium conditions for the first time.
  A surprising finding was that unlabeled K239C and K239A  ZPIs bound PZ with 12 orders of magnitude greater affinities  than unlabeled wild-type or fluorophore-labeled K239C ZPIs.
  The observation that ZPI affinities for PZ increased in the order  K239A  K239C  wild type  NBD-K239C suggested a  dependence of ZPI affinity on the length of the side chain at  position 239, implying that the wild-type Lys-239 residue is  detrimental to PZ binding.
Lys-239 neighbors Tyr-240, a residue that we previously found to be a hot spot for PZ binding as  a result of its interaction with a hydrophobic cavity in PZ formed  by the juxtaposition of the pseudocatalytic and EGF2 domains of  the cofactor (16, 18).
The wild-type Lys and the fluorophore labels  thus appear to similarly interfere sterically with the Tyr-240 side  chain interaction with the PZ binding pocket.
  Calcium acts as an essential cofactor to promote ZPI-PZ  complex inhibition of factor Xa on a membrane surface by  mediating the binding of PZ and factor Xa to the membrane  through their Gla domains (1, 16).
It was thus unexpected to  find that calcium ions caused a membrane-independent  5-fold reduction in NBD-ZPI-PZ complex affinity.
The differential effects of calcium on NBD-ZPI interactions with intact  and Gla/EGF1-domainless PZ suggested that specific calcium  interactions with the PZ Gla domain were responsible for the  loss of complex affinity.
Similar calcium-Gla domain interactions affect the reactions of factor Xa with its serpin inhibitors,  ZPI and antithrombin, in the presence of the cofactor heparin  (27, 28).
In this case, calcium is thought to displace the Gla  domain from an intramolecular interaction with the heparin  binding site in the protease catalytic domain that blocks heparin bridging of the serpin-protease interactions.
A similar intramolecular interaction of the PZ Gla domain with the pseudocatalytic or EGF2 domain in the absence of calcium could thus  indirectly enhance the affinity of PZ for ZPI.
  The membrane-independent KD of 15 nM measured for the  NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction in the presence of physiologic calcium  levels provides a close approximation of the affinity for the circulating ZPI-PZ complex.
Interestingly, this affinity is about an order  of magnitude weaker than the apparent affinity measured by  kinetic titrations in the presence of calcium and membrane cofactors in past studies (KD1 nM) (18).
The stronger kinetic affinity  suggests that the ZPI-PZ complex is effectively formed irreversibly  in the reaction with factorXa due to themembrane-boundZPI-PZ  complex associating with membrane-bound factor Xa before the  ZPI-PZ complex can dissociate.
  The ability to accurately quantitate the affinity of the ZPI-PZ  interaction under equilibrium conditions prompted us to  reevaluate the effects of mutations in the PZ binding site of ZPI  on PZ binding affinity by competitive binding titrations.
  Although our findings confirm that Asp-293 and Tyr-240 are  binding hot spots for PZ (18), they reveal that Asp-238, Met-71,  and Asp-74 residues make more important contributions to PZ  binding than suggested previously.
The contribution of Asp-74  in particular approaches that of the hot spot residue Tyr-240.
  Assuming additivity of the interactions, Asp-238, Met-71, Asp74, Tyr-240, and Asp-293 together account for 74% of the total  unitary binding energy.
The ionic binding energy represents  44% of the total and appears to derive mostly from two salt  bridge clusters formed by Asp-74 interactions of ZPI with Arg350 of PZ and Asp-293 interactions of ZPI with His-210 and  Arg-298 of PZ.
This is in agreement with our finding of a  marked sensitivity of the binding interaction to ionic strength  and to pH in the acid and alkaline ranges and 49% contribution  of ionic interactions to the unitary binding energy indicated by  Debye-Huckel analysis.
The 51% contribution of nonionic  binding energy is mostly accounted for by hydrophobic interactions of Met-71 and Tyr-240 with binding pockets in PZ.
  Additional nonionic binding energy may derive from the  hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions of other ZPI residues that are buried and contribute to the complementary  binding surface of ZPI with PZ (16, 17).
The observed weak  temperature dependence of the ZPI-PZ interaction is in keeping with the interaction being governed principally by ionic and  hydrophobic interactions in view of the fact that such interactions are largely entropically driven.
  The kinetics of PZ binding to and dissociation from NBDZPI revealed a three-step binding mechanism wherein an initial  high affinity ZPI-PZ complex was formed at a close to diffusion  limited rate of 2  107 M1 s  1 and underwent two subsequent  conformational changes that tightened the complex affinity a  further 3-fold and reduced the limiting rate of complex dissociation to 0.02 s1  .
These findings are consistent with our  previous studies that found that Cys residues or fluorophore  probes at positions distant from the PZ binding site underwent  significant changes in reactivity or fluorescence upon PZ binding, consistent with global structural changes being induced in  ZPI by PZ binding (16).
However, such structural changes were  found to account for at most 2-fold of the 1000-fold PZ rate  enhancement of ZPI inhibition of membrane-associated factor  Xa; the majority of the enhancement resulted from membrane  bridging of the ZPI-PZ complex interaction with factor Xa.
The  structural changes may reflect successive induced fit alterations in  the binding interface that minimize the negative effect of Lys-239  on the interaction and that are transmitted to other parts of the  molecule.
A similar three-step binding mechanism was indicated  for the NBD-ZPI interaction with PZ in the presence of the physiologic cofactors, calcium, and membrane vesicles.
  We reported previously that RCL cleavage of ZPI reduces PZ  affinity and enables PZ to act catalytically in promoting ZPI  inhibition of membrane-associated factor Xa (4, 18).
We now  confirm that cleaved ZPI, either free or in the ZPI-factor Xa  complex, exhibits a 2 4-fold reduced affinity for PZ relative to  native ZPI under equilibrium conditions.
Comparisons of the  ionic strength dependence of NBD-labeled cleaved and intact  ZPI interactions with PZ showed that ionic interactions made a  lesser contribution to PZ binding for cleaved ZPI than intact ZPI,  whereas nonionic interactions were essentially the same.
These  findings are in keeping with the structural changes in cleaved ZPI  reported previously that implicate an altered interaction of ZPI  Asp-74 on helix A with PZ in the cleaved serpin (18).
  The association rate constants for PZ binding to labeled or  unlabeled ZPI, cZPI, and K239A ZPI were all similar, implying  that the differences in PZ affinity for these ZPIs derive entirely  from different rates of complex dissociation.
The rate of PZ  dissociation from ZPI must clearly limit the ability of the cofacThermodynamics and Kinetics of the ZPI-PZ Interaction  APRIL 10, 2015VOLUME 290NUMBER 15 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 9917   at Univ of St Andrews on May 23, 2015 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from tor to act catalytically, and thus the increased rate of PZ dissociation from cleaved ZPI compared with ZPI would appear to  be critical for PZ to function as a catalyst.
Conversely, the lower  rate of PZ dissociation from K239A ZPI than wild type suggests  that PZ catalytic action might be impaired with this ZPI variant.
  This expectation was borne out by our finding that catalytic but  not stoichiometric levels of PZ showed a 4-fold reduced  accelerating effect on K239A ZPI inhibition of membrane-associated factor Xa compared with wild-type or D74A ZPI reactions.
The reduced rate of PZ dissociation from K239A ZPI-PZ  complex thus appears to limit PZ catalytic recycling, whereas  faster PZ dissociation rates from wild-type and D74A ZPI-PZ  complexes no longer limit PZ catalysis.
This may explain why  Lys-239 is highly conserved in ZPIs from lungfish to mammals.
  PZ levels are limiting in vivo (3), and hence the ability to release  PZ from ZPI once the serpin forms inhibitory complexes with  factors Xa and XIa may be important to maintain levels of PZ  sufficient for anticoagulant regulation.
  The importance of hot spot residues in mediating the ZPI-PZ  interaction supports the feasibility of blocking the interaction  with small molecules as a potential means of treating hemophilias.
The sensitivity of our present fluorescence assay for  detecting ZPI-PZ complex formation suggests its usefulness as  a screening assay for small molecule inhibitors of the interaction.
The importance of ZPI-PZ as a natural anticoagulant is  clear from human clinical and animal knock-out studies.
Preliminary data have shown that disrupting the ZPI-PZ complex  in normal and hemophilic plasmas significantly increases  thrombin formation and has the potential to ameliorate the  bleeding of hemophilia by restoring a procoagulant/anticoagulant balance sufficient to achieve normal hemostasis.
Studies  are in progress to validate this potential.
