Axl signalling  plays important roles in cancer, spermatogenesis, immunity, and platelet function.
The crystal structure at 3.3 A  resolution of a minimal human Gas6/Axl complex reveals  an assembly of 2:2 stoichiometry, in which the two  immunoglobulin-like domains of the Axl ectodomain are  crosslinked by the first laminin G-like domain of Gas6,  with no direct Axl/Axl or Gas6/Gas6 contacts.
There are  two distinct Gas6/Axl contacts of very different size, both  featuring interactions between edge b-strands.
Structurebased mutagenesis, protein binding assays and receptor  activation experiments demonstrate that both the major  and minor Gas6 binding sites are required for productive  transmembrane signalling.
Gas6-mediated Axl dimerisation is likely to occur in two steps, with a high-affinity 1:1  Gas6/Axl complex forming first.
Only the minor Gas6  binding site is highly conserved in the other Axl family  receptors, Sky/Tyro3 and Mer.
Specificity at the major  contact is suggested to result from the segregation of  charged and apolar residues to opposite faces of the  newly formed b-sheet.

doi:10.1038/  sj.emboj.7600912; Published online 15 December 2005  Subject Categories: signal transduction; structural biology  Keywords: immunoglobulin-like domain; laminin G-like  domain; receptor tyrosine kinase; site-directed mutagenesis;  X-ray crystallography  Introduction  Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play critical roles in the  control of many cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, cell  metabolism and survival, proliferation and differentiation,  and cell migration (reviewed in Schlessinger, 2000; Gschwind  et al, 2004).
The prototypical RTKs are activated by growth  factors, which promote receptor dimerisation and, in turn,  autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytosolic  domain.
Binding of signalling proteins to these phosphorylated tyrosine residues then leads to downstream signalling.
  Axl and its homologues, Sky/Tyro3 and Mer, constitute  an RTK subfamily characterised by an extracellular domain  resembling cell adhesion molecules, consisting of two immunoglobulin-like (IG) domains followed by two fibronectin  type 3-like domains (Janssen et al, 1991; OBryan et al, 1991;  Rescigno et al, 1991).
Axl family RTKs are unique in that they  are activated by Gas6, a member of the vitamin K-dependent  protein family that resembles blood coagulation factors rather  than typical growth factors (Ohashi et al, 1995; Stitt et al,  1995; Varnum et al, 1995; Mark et al, 1996).
Gas6 consists of  a g-carboxyglutamate (Gla)-rich domain that mediates binding to phospholipid membranes, four epidermal growth  factor-like domains, and two laminin G-like (LG) domains  (Manfioletti et al, 1993).
Gas6 is B40% identical to protein S,  a negative regulator of blood coagulation that can also  activate Axl RTKs under certain nonphysiological conditions  (Godowski et al, 1995).
  The biological consequences of Axl activation are complex.
Axl was initially identified as a transforming gene  product (Janssen et al, 1991; OBryan et al, 1991), and Axl  expression is indeed upregulated in human tumours (Nakano  et al, 2003; Sun et al, 2004).
Many studies have shown that  Gas6Axl signalling promotes cell survival and growth in  vitro (e.g. Nakano et al, 1995;
Goruppi et al, 1996; Li et al,  1996; ODonnell et al, 1999; Shankar et al, 2003).
Recent gene  knockout studies have revealed fundamental roles of Axl  RTKs in spermatogenesis (Lu et al, 1999), immunity (Lu  and Lemke, 2001; Scott et al, 2001), platelet function  (Angelillo-Scherrer et al, 2001, 2005) and kidney pathology  (Yanagita et al, 2002).
The role of Gas6Axl signalling in  platelets is particularly interesting.
Cross-talk between Axl  RTKs and aIIbb3 integrin, via PI3 kinase and Akt, contributes  to platelet activation and thrombus stabilisation.
Importantly,  blocking of Gas6Axl signalling in mice prevents thrombosis  without causing the bleeding side effects that blight other  antithrombotic therapies (Angelillo-Scherrer et al, 2005;  Gould et al, 2005).
A better understanding of the molecular  recognition events leading to Axl activation is thus of considerable interest.
  Previous studies have shown that the Axl binding site of  Gas6 is fully contained within the C-terminal LG domain pair  (Gas6-LG) (Mark et al, 1996; Tanabe et al, 1997).
A structure  determination of Gas6-LG revealed a V-shaped arrangement  of two canonical LG domains, reinforced by an interdomain  calcium binding site (Sasaki et al, 2002).
Like in the related  LG pair of the laminin a2 chain (Tisi et al, 2000), the  N-terminal segment of Gas6-LG is disulfide-bonded to the  second LG domain, LG2.
A hydrophobic patch on LG2 was  tentatively assigned as an Axl binding region, but how Gas6  binds to and activates Axl remained unclear (Sasaki et al,  2002).
A recent structure determination of the IG domains of  Sky also failed to give insight into this critical question  (Heiring et al, 2004).
Here we report the crystal structure  and mutational analysis of a minimal Gas6/Axl complex.

The Gas6/Axl structure provides a framework  for future functional studies and should be useful in developing reagents blocking aberrant Axl signalling in human  diseases.
  Results  Overall structure of the minimal Gas6Axl complex  The soluble Axl ectodomain binds Gas6-LG with nanomolar  affinity (Sasaki et al, 2002) and 1:1 stoichiometry, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (data not shown).
We  found that an Axl fragment spanning the two N-terminal IG  domains and lacking carbohydrate modifications (Axl-IG)  retains full Gas6-LG binding activity.
We crystallised the  human Gas6-LG/Axl-IG complex and have determined its  structure at 3.3 A resolution (Rfree 0.265).
The asymmetric  unit of the crystals contains a symmetric 2:2 Gas6-LG/Axl-IG  assembly, in which the Axl-IG molecules are located on the  outside and are linked by two Gas6-LG molecules (Figure 1).
  There are no direct ligand/ligand or receptor/receptor contacts.
Only LG1 of Gas6 is involved in Axl binding, whereas  both IG1 and IG2 of Axl are involved in Gas6 binding.
The  three predicted glycosylation sites of Axl-IG (Asn36Axl,  Asn150Axl and Asn191Axl) are distant from the Gas6-LG  molecules in the 2:2 complex, consistent with our finding  that Axl glycosylation has no influence on high-affinity Gas6  binding.
  Structure of Gas6-LG and Axl-IG in the complex  The structure of Gas6-LG in the complex is very similar to  that of free Gas6-LG (Sasaki et al, 2002), but there is a  small reorientation by 91 in the interdomain angle, and two  previously disordered segments in LG1Gas6 become ordered  upon complex formation (see below).
The two IG domains of  Axl-IG are arranged in a fully extended fashion that differs  from the bent conformation seen in the IG pair of the  homologous receptor, Sky (Heiring et al, 2004) (Figure 2).
  IG1Axl belongs to the intermediate (I) set of the IG superfamily, with the two b-sheets showing the characteristic  ABED and A0  GFCC0 topology (Chothia and Jones, 1997).
  The putative glycosylation site at Asn36Axl is located in strand  A0  .
IG2Axl also resembles the I set, but strand D is missing,  similar to the situation in ICAM-1 (Casasnovas et al, 1998).
  Putative glycosylation sites are located in strand B  (Asn150Axl) and the E-F loop (Asn191Axl).
A comparison of  the Axl and Sky structures reveals remarkable differences in  their IG1 domains (r.m.s. deviation 2.4 A for 79 Ca atoms;  Figure 2B), whereas their IG2 domains are quite similar  (r.m.s. deviation 0.74 A for 78 Ca atoms).
IG1 of Sky deviates  from IG1Axl and all other I-set members, in that strand G  (rather than strand A) switches between the two b-sheets of  the domain, hydrogen bonding first to strand B and then to  strand F (Heiring et al, 2004).
Another notable difference is  that the IG pair of Sky is dimeric, with the ABED sheet of the  IG1 domain forming the dimer interface (discussed below).
  Two types of Gas6/Axl contacts  There are two distinct ligand/receptor contacts in the 2:2  Gas6-LG/Axl-IG complex described here.
The major contact,  between LG1Gas6 and IG1Axl, buries 2366 A 2 of solvent-accessible surface area and, given its size, is tentatively assigned as  the high-affinity interaction site (confirmed below).
The  minor contact, between LG1Gas6 and IG2Axl, buries 765 A 2  .
  Remarkably, both types of contact feature the juxtaposition of  edge b-strands, so that continuous b-sheets are formed across  both Gas6/Axl contacts (Figure 1C).
Neither contact displays  particularly good shape complementarity: when evaluated  with the program SC (CCP4-Collaborative Computing Project  No. 4, 1994), the major contact scores 0.54, and the minor  contact 0.63 (a score of 1 indicating perfect complementarity  of the interacting surfaces).
In the crystal lattice, Gas6-LG/  Axl-IG complexes are arranged in infinite linear arrays, with  a two-fold noncrystallographic symmetry axis producing an  Figure 1 Overall architecture of the Gas6-LG/Axl-IG complex.

The resulting Axl dimer does not  resemble the much tighter Sky dimer (Heiring et al, 2004) and  is probably nonphysiological, given the paucity of specific  interactions and the presence of Ni2  ions in the interface  (Supplementary Figure S1).
  Major Gas6/Axl contact  The core of the major Gas6/Axl contact is formed by the  antiparallel interaction of strand B of LG1Gas6 and strand D  of IG1Axl (six main-chain hydrogen bonds).
Formation of a  continuous b-sheet across the major Gas6/Axl contact leads  to a striking segregation of charged and apolar residues.
On  one face of the b-sheet, an extensive network of charged  residues is formed, with Arg308Gas6, Arg310Gas6 and  Lys312Gas6 interacting with Glu56Axl and Glu59Axl; the latter  two residues are contributed by the B-C loop located above  strand D of IG1Axl (Figure 3A).
The two N-acetylglucosamine  moieties attached to Asn420Gas6 pack against Arg310Gas6 and  are close to Axl, but appear to make no specific interactions  with the receptor.
The opposite face of the major contact is  devoid of charged residues and is dominated by apolar  interactions, most prominently between Thr75Axl, Thr77Axl,  Val79Axl, Ile90Axl and Val92Axl on the one hand, and  Ile307Gas6, Leu309Gas6, Phe311Gas6, Thr457Gas6, Ile458Gas6,  Thr461Gas6 and Met468Gas6 on the other hand (Figure 3B).
  Gas6 residues 457464 are part of a short a-helix that was not  seen in free Gas6-LG (Sasaki et al, 2002).
This helix therefore  appears to become ordered only upon receptor binding,  although its association with Axl is remarkably loose (there  are only two van der Waals contacts closer than 4 A).
Finally,  the AB loop in LG1Gas6 is also disordered in free Gas6-LG,  but contributes two Axl-binding residues, Arg299Gas6 and  Ser302Gas6, in the complex.
  We previously reported that mutation of Leu620Gas6 and  Tyr660Gas6 in LG2Gas6 has a modest effect on Axl binding and  activation (Sasaki et al, 2002), yet we now see that LG2Gas6 is  not directly involved in receptor binding.
However,  Leu620Gas6 and Tyr660Gas6 are close to the Axl-binding A-B  loop in LG1Gas6 (12 and 3.5 A, respectively), suggesting that  their mutation may have affected the Gas6/Axl interaction at  the major site in an indirect manner.

  Structural basis for Gas6Axl signalling  T Sasaki et al  82 The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 1 | 2006 &2006 European Molecular Biology OrganizationMinor Gas6/Axl contact  The minor Gas6/Axl contact is formed between strands J of  LG1Gas6 and strand G of IG2Axl, with additional contributions  from the domain linker of Axl-IG (Figure 3C).
Apart from three  main-chain hydrogen bonds, there is only one polar interaction  in this region, between Asp398Gas6 and Lys204Axl.
Additionally,  there are several van der Waals contacts that may impart  specificity: most notably, Leu131Axl is inserted into a pocket  delineated by Ala399Gas6 and Lys402Gas6, and the Cb atom of  Ala404Gas6 makes a close contact with Ca of Arg210Axl.
  Both Gas6/Axl contacts are required for receptor activation  As it is often difficult to distinguish crystal lattice contacts  from genuine, physiological ligand/receptor interactions, we  sought to confirm our interpretation of the Gas6-LG/Axl-IG  structure by designing mutations that would disrupt specifically the major or minor contact in the 2:2 Gas6-LG/Axl-IG  complex, or were predicted to have no effect (control mutations).
The choice of mutations was complicated by the fact  that both Gas6/Axl contacts prominently involve b-strand  interactions, which are made by the polypeptide backbone  and therefore not easily disrupted by mutagenesis.
  At the major contact, mutation of Glu59Axl and Thr77Axl  dramatically reduced Gas6 binding both in a solid-phase  assay and when measured by surface plasmon resonance  (Table I).
Likewise, mutation of Arg310Gas6 and Lys312Gas6 all  but abolished Axl binding in both assays.
Thus, the major  contact in the Gas6-LG/Axl-IG complex indeed corresponds  to the high-affinity interaction site.
We were surprised that  Glu56Axl in the B-C loop of IG1Axl does not seem to be  required for a high-affinity interaction, given that this residue  makes a specific electrostatic interaction with Gas6.
However,  Glu56Axl remains partly exposed in the complex, and its role  may be redundant (see below).
  To test whether the major contact is required for Gas6Axl  signalling, we compared wild-type and mutant Gas6-LG  proteins in a receptor activation assay, using a tumour cell  line expressing Axl (Sasaki et al, 2002).
Mutation of  Arg310Gas6 and Lys312Gas6 reduced Axl phosphorylation to  background levels (Figure 4), showing that the major Gas6/  Axl contact is required for productive signalling.
  Unfortunately, the effect of Axl mutations on signalling  could not be studied, since overexpression of Axl in a number  of cell lines resulted in constitutive receptor activation in the  absence of Gas6 (data not shown).
  Mutation of Axl or Gas6 at the minor contact did  not appreciably affected their high-affinity interaction, as  Figure 3 Detailed structure of the Gas6/Axl contact sites.

Crucially, however, mutation of  Ala404Gas6 resulted in a marked reduction of Axl activation  (Figure 4).
Ala404Gas6 is fully exposed in free Gas6, but  becomes partly buried at the minor contact in the complex.
  Thus, the reduced activity of the Gas6-LG A404V mutant  demonstrates that the minor contact is functionally important  and not a crystal lattice artefact.
In support of this conclusion,  a monoclonal antibody that partially blocks the Gas6/Axl  interaction  recognises Gas6 residues 393414, which contain the Axlbinding b-strand J and Ala404Gas6 (Fisher et al, 2005).
The  combined data demonstrate that the 2:2 Gas6/Axl complex  seen in our crystals represents a physiologically relevant  assembly.
  Sequence conservation of Gas6/receptor contacts  All Gas6 regions involved in Axl binding, including the  glycosylation site at Asn420Gas6 in the major contact, are  strictly conserved in vertebrate Gas6 sequences (not shown).
  Comparing Axl with its family members Sky and Mer, we  were surprised to find that only the minor Gas6 binding site  in IG2Axl is highly conserved, whereas the major site in IG1Axl  is not well conserved in Sky and Mer (Figure 2C).
However,  even though individual amino acids are not conserved,  pertinent characteristics of the major Gas6 binding site in  Axl appear to be conserved, at least in Sky (for which  structural information is available; Heiring et al, 2004): the  B-C loop of IG1 contains negatively charged residues, and  strand D is quite long and features an unusually apolar  surface that is contiguous with exposed apolar residues on  strand E. The hydrophobic nature of the D-E surface is  illustrated by the fact that, in the absence of Gas6, the Sky  IG pair forms dimers in which the Gas6-binding D-E surface  in IG1 is occluded in the dimer interface.
This dimer may be  an artefact of bacterial expression, since a putative glycosylation site is buried in the dimer interface (Figure 2C).
  Importantly, it has been shown that the dimer dissociates  upon addition of Gas6-LG, resulting in the formation of a  ligand/receptor complex with 1:1 stoichiometry (Heiring  et al, 2004).
Modelling shows that monomeric Sky is readily  accommodated at the major Axl binding site of Gas6-LG (not  shown).
  With respect to the third Gas6 receptor, Mer, it is difficult  to discern any conservation of Gas6 binding features at the  major contact, and this may be correlated with the reduced  affinity of Mer for Gas6 (Nagata et al, 1996).
We cannot  exclude that Mer (or, indeed, Sky) binds Gas6 in a different  manner than Axl, but we think this is unlikely.
It is also worth  noting that all putative N-linked glycosylation sites in Sky  and Mer (a total of seven sites, only one of which is shared  with Axl) map to solvent-exposed positions in the Gas6-LG/  Axl-IG structure.
Given that all three Axl family receptors  have multiple glycosylation sites within their IG domains  (Figure 2C), the complete absence of such sites from the  predicted Gas6 binding regions supports a conserved ligandbinding mode.
  Discussion  RTK activation is believed to result from ligand-induced  receptor dimerisation, leading to the autophosphorylation  of multiple tyrosine residues in the cytosolic domains, and  to downstream signalling (Schlessinger, 2000).
Indeed, the  close approximation of (at least) two receptors is a feature  of all known structures of ligand/RTK complexes, but the  mechanism by which receptor dimerisation is brought  about is different in each case (Schlessinger, 2000;  Wiesmann et al, 2000; Himanen et al, 2001; Burgess et al,  2003).
Additional complexity is introduced by a variety of  autoinhibitory mechanisms that help maintain RTKs in an  inactive state in the absence of ligand, and the existence of  (obligate) coreceptors.
The architecture of the heterotetrameric Gas6/Axl complex described here most closely resembles that of the ephrin/Eph complex (Himanen et al, 2001),  even though the two systems are completely different in their  domain organisation.
Both complexes are circular 2:2 assemblies with two distinct ligand/receptor interfaces of different  affinity, and no direct ligand/ligand or receptor/receptor  contacts.
Like Eph signalling, Axl signalling is likely to be  initiated by the formation of a high-affinity 1:1 ligand/receptor complex.
Gas6/Axl complex formation may be driven  initially by the combination of charge complementarity and  hydrophobicity at the major contact site, followed by the  receptor-induced freezing of mobile Gas6 regions.
Lateral  diffusion of 1:1 complexes would then lead to the formation  of a minimal 2:2 Gas6/Axl signalling complex.
Further  aggregation of 2:2 complexes has been demonstrated to be  required for Eph signalling (Smith et al, 2004).
Whether  Axl/Axl interactions contribute to signalling remains to be  established.
  The central role of hydrogen pairing between b-strands in  both types of Gas6/Axl contacts is surprising, given that these  interactions are not sequence-specific.
At the major Gas6/Axl  contact, the striking segregation of polar/ionic and apolar  side chain interactions to opposite surfaces of the newly  formed b-sheet appears to ensure the specific recognition of  the cognate ligand.
The precise nature of many of these  interactions may be less critical, as suggested by the modest  shape complementarity at this contact and the lack of  sequence conservation of many Gas6 binding residues in  Figure 4 Axl activation by wild-type and mutant Gas6-LG.
Human  U-118 glioblastoma cells were incubated with 200 ng/ml Gas6-LG  proteins for 15 min, the cells lysed, and the Axl receptor immunoprecipitated.
Blots were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, stripped, and reprobed with anti-Axl antiserum.
The control  experiment was carried out with no Gas6-LG protein added.
The  experiment was carried out three times with similar results.

The minor Gas6/  Axl contact is likely to be very weak and may owe its  existence to the high cooperativity of forming a circular 2:2  complex.
Nevertheless, the minor contact is critical for signal  transduction, as suggested by its striking sequence conservation and experimentally verified by mutagenesis of  Ala404Gas6.
Molecules that are able to inhibit Gas6/Axl  signalling are potentially useful in controlling thrombosis  (Angelillo-Scherrer et al, 2005; Gould et al, 2005), and our  structure provides a framework for the rational design of such  blocking agents.
Targetting the Gas6/Axl contacts seen in our  structure by small molecule antagonists may prove challenging, however: one contact is very large, and the other  involves little more than the interaction of two solventexposed b-strands.
  Several questions remain unanswered by our structure of  a minimal Gas6/Axl complex.
The Gla domain of Gas6 is  dispensable for Axl activation in cultured cells, but its role  in vivo has not been studied.
The Gla domain may help  recruit Gas6 to the cell surface harbouring its receptor.
Model  building shows that this is sterically feasible; the EGF-like  domain preceding LG1Gas6 could interact with the hydrophobic patch in LG2Gas6, previously speculated to be involved  in receptor binding (Sasaki et al, 2002).
Alternatively, Gas6  could be bound to a different cell membrane than its receptor,  similar to the ephrin/Eph situation.
The physiological role, if  any, of receptor dimerisation also remains to be studied.
The  fully glycosylated Axl ectodomain forms dimers with a dissociation constant of B10 mM (our unpublished results), but  whether this association occludes the major Gas6 binding  site, as in the Sky structure (Heiring et al, 2004), is not  known.
To understand Gas6/Axl signalling in a cellular  context, it will be important to determine the oligomeric  state of Axl within the cell membrane and how it is affected  by Gas6 binding.
Our structure and mutational validation of a  minimal Gas6/Axl complex has revealed the unique mechanism by which Axl family RTKs are dimerised by Gas6, and  provides a solid basis to guide future investigations into this  system.
  Materials and methods  Protein production and mutagenesis  Human Gas6-LG was expressed in human embryonic kidney (293-  EBNA) cells and purified as described (Sasaki et al, 2002).
Point  mutations were introduced by fusion PCR and confirmed by  sequencing.
All mutants behaved indistinguishable from wild-type  Gas6-LG during purification.
Soluble Axl-IG was expressed in  Escherichia coli BL21 cells, by secretion into the periplasmic space.
  DNA coding for Axl residues 26220 (sequence numbering includes  the signal peptide as defined in SwissProt entry P30530) was  obtained by PCR from a full-length human Axl cDNA and cloned  into pASK-IBA12 (N-terminal Strept-tag II) or pASK-IBA32 (Cterminal His-tag) (IBA GmbH, Gottingen, Germany).
Point mutations were introduced using a site-directed mutagenesis kit  (Stratagene, CA, USA) and confirmed by sequencing.
Proteins were  purified according to the manufacturers instructions.
The Strept-tag  was removed by thrombin digestion.
The untagged Axl-IG was  purified by gel filtration (Superose 12 HR 16/50) and mixed with  Gas6-LG in a 1:1 molar ratio.
The resulting Gas6-LG/Axl-IG  complex was purified by gel filtration prior to crystallisation.
  Binding and activation assays  
The solid-phase assay and surface plasmon resonance experiments  were carried out as described previously (Sasaki et al, 2002).
  Soluble Axl ectodomain (Sasaki et al, 2002) or Axl IG12 and its  mutants (His-tagged proteins) were immobilised, and Gas6-LG and  its mutants were used as soluble ligands.
Axl activation by wildtype and mutant Gas6-LG in human U-118 glioblastoma cells was  also carried out as described previously (Sasaki et al, 2002).
  Crystal structure determination  For crystallisation, the Gas6-LG/Axl-IG complex was concentrated  to 10 mg/ml in 0.025 M Na-HEPES pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM  calcium acetate.
Needle-shaped crystals were obtained at room  temperature by the hanging drop method, using 0.1 M TrisHCl pH  8.5, 0.60.8 M Li2SO4, 2 mM NiSO4 as precipitant.
The crystals were  flash-frozen in mother liquour supplemented with 30% glycerol.
  X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline ID23-1 at  the ESRF (Grenoble, France) using a Marmosaic 225 CCD detector  (l  0.9794 A).
The crystals diffracted extremely weakly and data  were collected using an unattenuated beam and 20 s exposures per  0.51 frame.
There are two copies of a 1:1 Gas6-LG/Axl-IG complex  in the asymmetric unit of the hexagonal crystals, related by a  noncrystallographic two-fold symmetry axis perpendicular to the  crystallographic six-fold axis.
The solvent content of the crystals is  unusually high at 78%, explaining the weak diffraction.
The  diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM (http://www.  mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/harry/mosflm/) and programs of the CCP4  suite (CCP4-Collaborative Computing Project No. 4, 1994).
The  structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER  (Storoni et al, 2004), using the Gas6-LG (Sasaki et al, 2002) and  Sky-IG (Heiring et al, 2004) structures as search models; the IG  domains of Sky had to be placed individually to obtain a solution.
  The structure was rebuilt with O (Jones et al, 1991) and refined with  CNS (Brunger et al, 1998), using tight noncrystallographic  symmetry restraints.
The final model includes: Gas6 residues  279493, 504541, and 550676, with two N-acetylglucosamine  moieties attached to Asn420Gas6; Axl residues 27217; two calcium  ions, two nickel ions, and one sulfate ion.
Data collection and  refinement statistics are summarised in Table II.
Solvent-accessible  areas were calculated with the CCP4 program AREAIMOL.
The  figures were made with PYMOL (http://www.pymol.org).
