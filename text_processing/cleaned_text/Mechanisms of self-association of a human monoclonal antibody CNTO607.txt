  E-mail: yfeng8@its.jnj.com  Received March 19, 2012; revised July 16, 2012;  accepted July 18, 2012  Edited by Dennis Burton  Some antibodies have a tendency to self-associate leading  to precipitation at relatively low concentrations.
  CNTO607, a monoclonal antibody, precipitates irreversibly in phosphate-buffered saline at concentrations above  13 mg/ml.
Previous mutagenesis work based on the Fab  crystal structure pinpointed a three residue fragment in  the heavy chain CDR-3, 99FHW100a, as an aggregation  epitope that is anchored by two salt bridges.
Biophysical  characterization of variants reveals that F99 and W100a,  but not H100, contribute to the intermolecular interaction.
A K210T/K215T mutant designed to disrupt the  charge interactions in the aggregation model yielded an  antibody that does not precipitate but forms reversible  aggregates.
An isotype change from IgG1 to IgG4 prevents the antibody from precipitating at low concentration yet the solution viscosity is elevated.
To further  understand the nature of the antibody self-association,  studies on the Fab fragment found high solubility but significant self- and cross-interactions remain.
Dynamic light  scattering data provides evidence for higher order Fab  structure at increased concentrations.
Our results provide  direct support for the aggregation model that CNTO607  precipitation results primarily from the specific interaction of the Fab arms of neighboring antibodies followed  by the development of an extensive network of antibodies  inducing large-scale aggregation and precipitation.
  Keywords: aggregation/monoclonal antibody/protein  engineering/solubility/self-association  Introduction  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) comprise a class of therapeutic drugs that has experienced the fastest growth over the  last decade, addressing many unmet medical needs.
With the  increasing number of antibody therapeutics, it has been  found that high-concentration formulations for subcutaneous  delivery are more convenient and economical than conventional intravenous delivery (Shire, 2009).
The most common  and challenging issues encountered in developing high concentration protein biopharmaceutical formulations are protein  aggregation and high viscosity.
The molecular nature of the  interactions is often difficult to delineate.
Although hydrophobic interactions are considered to be a major contributor,  other factors that enhance aggregation have been identified  (Shire et al., 2004).
The self-association of a protein therapeutic can sometimes be circumvented by using proper formulation conditions, but there is no guarantee that these  approaches will succeed.
  The nature of self-association of antibodies has been the  focus of several studies (e.g. (Kanai et al., 2008; Nishi et al.,  2011; Yadav et al., 2011).
Shire and colleagues investigated  the high viscosity of a mAb in a high-concentration formulation (Kanai et al., 2008).
By systematically studying the  intact antibody as well as antibody fragments, they identified  Fab Fab interaction as the primary source of selfassociation, and showed that multiple binding sites exist on  the Fab fragment forming self-association networks that lead  to high viscosity.
Furthermore, they found by swapping  charged residues between two antibodies that exposed  charged residues in the CDR of one antibody were critical  for the self-association and highly viscous behavior of the  antibody at high concentrations (Yadav et al., 2011).
In  another study investigating the self-association of an antibody under low-ionic-strength conditions, Nishi and colleagues found that interactions involving the Fc domains were  responsible for the aggregation (Nishi et al., 2011).
These  studies and others are leading to a better understanding of  the molecular mechanism responsible for self-association  and will help in designing antibodies that are less prone to  aggregation (Philo and Arakawa, 2009).
  CNTO607 is a potent fully human IgG1 mAb against  interleukin (IL)-13.
It has poor solubility at neutral pH and  precipitates in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer at concentrations above 13 mg/ml.
Various protein engineering  strategies based on the 3D structure of the CNTO607 Fab  fragment were applied to CNTO607 and some succeeded in  improving the solubility while retaining activity (Wu et al.,  2010).
The previous efforts pinpointed the aromatic triad  99FHW100a in the heavy chain (HC) CDR-3 as the aggregation epitope (Wu et al., 2010).
Based on the tetrameric interaction of the CNTO607 Fab molecules in the crystal  structure, we proposed a CNTO607 aggregation model in  which the Fab molecules interact with each other through the  aromatic residues at 99FHW100a and a pair of charge interactions involving D50 and D51 in the light chain (LC) and  K210 and K215 in the CH1 domain.
These interactions lead  to mAb precipitation at high protein concentrations due to  the bivalency of the mAb.
In the studies reported here, sitedirected mutagenesis is combined with biophysical characterization tools to test the CNTO607 aggregation model.
The  mutagenesis efforts focused on the aggregation epitope and  the proposed charge interactions that occur in the aggregation  model.
The isotype effect of the antibody was also   D. Bethea and S-J. Wu contributed equally to this manuscript.

Self-interaction chromatography (SIC), crossinteraction chromatography (CIC), dynamic light scattering  (DLS) and viscosity measurements were used to characterize  the resulting variants.
In addition, the CNTO607 Fab was  shown to be highly soluble but has significant self-interaction  propensity.
Our results provide evidence that the selfassociation of CNTO607 is primarily the result of the proposed Fab Fab interactions that lead to the formation of  large mAb networks.
  Materials and methods  Mutagenesis, expression and purification of antibodies  Gene-specific primers were designed and synthesized based  on the HC V-region of CNTO607.
The primers contained  flanking HindIII and EcoR1 restriction enzyme sites for  cloning into the Lonza pEE GS (glutamine synthetase)  vector which contains human IgG1 constant regions.
  CNTO607 HC expression plasmid was designated as p3401.
  The LC V-region of CNTO607 was cloned into the pEE GS  vector which contains human lambda constant regions.
  CNTO607 LC expression plasmid was designated as p3408.
  The plasmids, p3401 and p3408, were used as templates to  generate different variants either on CNTO607 HC or LC.
  Listed in Table I are the various mutations that were introduced using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit  (Stratagene, Cat# 200522).
  CNTO607 used in these studies was produced from an  SP2/0 stable cell line.
The mutant antibodies were transiently  co-expressed by HC and LC plasmids in either HEK293E or  CHO cells.
Antibody variants were expressed transiently in  1 l volume HEK293E or CHO transfections.
Cell-line specific, HEK293E or CHO, differences in antibody solubility  among CNTO607 variants were not observed.
For each transfection, individual tubes containing 150 mg each of LC and  HC DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Cat#  11668027) were diluted with 20 ml OptiMem media.
The  mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 5 min  before combining the contents of both tubes and incubating  for an additional 20 min at room temperature.
The DNA/  Lipofectamine/OptiMem complex was added drop-wise directly into media and the cells were then placed in the incubator for 24 h. The transfection media was replaced with  293SFMII production media (Invitrogen Cat# 11686029)  24 h later.
After 6 days the conditioned media were harvested  for purification.
Antibodies were purified from the harvested  media using MabSelect SuRe resin (GE Healthcare, Cat#  17-5438-03).
The purity of the antibodies was analyzed by  sodium dodecyl sulfate-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (1970).
  Solubility measurements  The solubility of the antibodies and the Fab fragment were  determined as described in (Wu et al., 2010).
Briefly, experiments were carried out using the ultrafiltration method (Haire  and Blow, 2001; van Reis and Zydney, 2001; Moore and  Kery, 2009).
Antibodies were concentrated using VIVAspin6  concentrator with 10 000 MWCO (vs0602) membrane and  centrifuged at speeds of 4000  10 000 r.p.m.
at 238C.
Prior  to concentration, each sample was dialyzed into PBS buffer.
  Samples were intermittently inspected visually for any signs  of precipitation during the concentration process until the  desired concentration was obtained.
After concentration, all  samples were transferred to clean glass tubes and stored overnight at 48C.
The next day, the concentration of the solution  was determined by diluting the sample 50-fold in PBS and  measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using a Nanodrop  Spectrophotometer.
  CIC experiment  Polyclonal human IgG or CNTO607 was coupled to a  Hi-Trap N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester 1 ml chromatography column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) by  adding 3 ml of a 10 mg/ml solution of the antibody in coupling buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3 pH 8.1, 0.5 M NaCl).
The  detailed chromatographic procedure and the determination of  the retention factor k0 for each sample was carried out  according to Jacobs et al. (2010).
All chromatography measurements were performed using a Beckman Coulter System  Gold high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or an  Ettan-LC HPLC system equipped with an autosampler at  room temperature.
  SIC  For each SIC experiment, the antibody was coupled to  Toyopearl AF-tresyl-650M chromatography resin (Tosoh  Biosciences, Montgomeryville, PA, USA) as described in  Jacobs et al. (2010).
Final volume of the column was 1 ml.
  Peaks were visualized by monitoring the absorbance at  215 nm.
Retention times were determined using the HPLC  Ettan LC system UNICORN software.
The chromatographic  retention factor k0 was calculated as previously described  (Payne et al., 2006).

The Tm was then calculated  by dividing this uncoupled column retention time by the retention time of acetone on the uncoupled column and multiplying by the retention time of acetone on the protein  coupled column.
B22 was determined by using the relationships given below as described earlier by Payne et al.  (2006).
  B22 NA  MW2 BHS  k0  phi2rho   1  where NA is Avogadros number, MW is the molecular  weight of the protein, BHS is the calculated exclusion  volume and phi2 and rho are calculated from the properties  of the matrix according to a published method (Payne et al.,  2006).
  Viscosity measurement  The viscosity of protein solutions was measured using an  m-VROC viscometer (RheoSense Inc., San Ramon, CA,  USA).
Samples of varying concentration (0.5  10 mg/ml)  were measured at 258C in either duplicate or triplicate depending on the sample size.
After each measurement the  system was washed with cleaning agent 1% Aquet, followed  by washing with water and subsequently with the buffering  system of the sample.
  DLS experiment  Particle sizes and distributions of all samples were determined on a DynaPro Plate Reader DLS instrument (Wyatt  Technologies Corporation) at 208C.
Measurements were  made using a Corningw 384 well black plate with clear flat  bottom polystyrene (CLS3540) and 40 ml sample in each  well at different protein concentrations.
For each sample, duplicate measurement was made, and for every measurement  20 runs were performed.
The viscosity value for each sample  determined as described above is used in the calculation.
The  refractive index of 1.333 at 589 nm for PBS buffer at 208C  was used (a standard value embedded in the software by the  manufacturer).
The method of cumulants was used to  analyze the data.
When a distribution of size is present, the  effective radius is obtained by averaging the intensityweighed radii.
These parameters were used by the program  to calculate size distributions and hydrodynamic properties  of the protein.
  Isoelectric-focusing gel analysis  The pI values of the antibodies were determined using  Novexw Pre-Cast Vertical pH 3  10 IEF gels according to  the manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen, CA, USA).
Two to  five microgram of each protein was loaded on the gel.
The pI  of each antibody listed is the approximate mid-point of the  multiple bands observed on the gel.
The banding was due to  charge heterogeneity introduced by the variability of the  N-linked glycosylation.
  Binding affinity determination by Biacore analysis  IL-13 was purchased from R&D System (Minneapolis, MN,  USA).
Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed as described in (Wu et al., 2010), with some  modification.
The CNTO607 Fab was captured on the chip  surface using an anti-human Fd antibody.
  Results  Multiple approaches to characterize the antibodies  A battery of biophysical methods was used to understand  how the antibodies behave in solution.
The term solubility is  defined here as the maximum protein concentration that can  be achieved before precipitation is observed by visual inspection.
The extent of the self-interaction between two identical  molecules in solution is described by the second virial coefficient (B22), which has contributions from hydrophobic  effects, van der Waals interactions, hydration forces and electrostatic interactions (Demoruelle et al., 2002).
A positive  B22 value indicates repulsive interactions between molecules  while a negative value represents attractive interactions (Neal  et al., 1999).
In this report, the B22 values were derived using  SIC (George and Wilson, 1994; Tessier et al., 2002b;  Johnson et al., 2009; Gabrielsen et al., 2010).
A related  method, CIC differs from SIC in that it measures the interaction between two different molecules.
The CIC method  used here refers to a newly developed antibody solubility  screening method based on the cross-interaction between the  antibody of question in liquid phase and polyclonal human  antibodies or a related antibody immobilized on the column  matrix (Jacobs et al., 2010).
Extensive retention on a CIC  column, reflected by a large retention factor k0 indicates a  tendency for the antibody to aggregate at high concentrations.
This method, requiring only a few micrograms of proteins, serves as a reliable means to quickly assess whether an  antibody will be soluble at concentrations above 100 mg/ml.
  DLS is another method for investigating the biophysical  properties of a protein.
It measures the size distribution of  proteins in solution based on the diffusion coefficient  of the molecules determined from the intensity fluctuations  of scattered light on particles.
DLS results are highly sensitive to the presence of aggregates due to a strong dependence  of the light-scattering intensity on the hydrodynamic radius  (Demeester et al., 2005).
Finally, determining the viscosity  of protein solutions provides another means to probe intermolecular interaction in solution (Maikokera and  Kwaambwa, 2009; Sharma et al., 2011).
Repulsion of protein  molecules in solution suppresses aggregation resulting in low  viscosity, while attractions favor self-association resulting in  high viscosity.
These different methods complement one  another providing a comprehensive picture of proteins in  solution.
  Solution characterization of CNTO607  CNTO607 was characterized in PBS buffer at pH 7.2 using  the above methods.
As reported by Wu et al. (2010),  CNTO607 can be concentrated to 13 mg/ml before irreversible precipitation occurs (Table I).
The B22 value for  CNTO607 was determined to be 26.9.
In the SIC and CIC  experiments the sample eluted as a broad peak (data not  shown), indicating a degree of self-interaction (Neal et al.,  1998; Ruppert et al., 2001; Tessier et al., 2002a).
The behavior of CNTO607 prior to precipitation was investigated  by DLS and viscosity measurements.
The hydrodynamic  radius of CNTO607 increased progressively from 4.2 nm at  Mechanisms of self-association in a monoclonal antibody  Page 3 of 7   at Kainan University on March 2, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 0.5 mg/ml to 6.0 nm at 10 mg/ml, suggesting the formation  of soluble aggregates at higher concentrations (Fig. 1).
In  addition, the viscosity of the CNTO607 solution increased  sharply upon concentration, making measurement above  4.5 mg/ml very difficult (Fig. 2).
Taken together, these  results indicate that CNTO607 has a strong tendency to selfassociate at moderate concentrations prior to precipitation.
  CNTO607 mutants designed to disrupt the Fab Fab  interactions  
The high-resolution crystal structure of CNTO607 Fab was  solved by Teplyakov et al. (2009).
In the crystal structure,  the CNTO607 Fab forms a nearly symmetrical tetramer,  burying the cluster of aromatic residues 99FHW100a in one of  the crystal packing interfaces.
The Fab Fab association is  anchored by a pair of salt bridges: LC D50 and D51 of one  Fab molecule interact with HC K210 and K215 of a neighboring Fab molecule (Fig. 3).
The interface covers a relatively large surface area of about 500 A 2 in each Fab structure.
It  was hypothesized that because of the bivalency of the mAbs,  the interactions among the Fab arms lead to large clusters of  mAbs at high antibody concentrations (Wu et al., 2010).
  Indeed, a triple alanine mutant of CNTO607 (F99A/H100A/  W100aA) became very soluble, revealing the tripeptide as an  aggregation epitope in CNTO607 (Wu et al., 2010).
  Additional mutants were generated to further test the  CNTO607 aggregation model (Table I).
Single mutations  F99A, H100A and W100aA were designed to further define  the aggregation epitope and its relationship to antigen  binding.
A double mutant K210T/K215T was also designed  to test the strength of the proposed charge interactions involving D50/D51 on the LC and K210/K215 on the HC  which anchor the Fab Fab interface (Fig. 3).
Finally, an  isotype change from IgG1 to IgG4 was made to probe the  effect of changes outside the immediate sphere of the aggregation epitope.
The residues involved in the salt bridges,  K210T/K215T and D50/D51, are still present upon the  isotype change.
  Characterization of the CNTO607 mutants  The mutants were produced and assessed for intermolecular  interaction by CIC (Jacobs et al., 2010) and activity by IL-13  binding (Table I).
The single mutants F99A and W100aA  both showed greatly reduced cross-interaction by CIC, the  IgG4 antibody showed moderately reduced cross-interaction,  while the H100A and K210T/K215T mutants exhibited profiles unchanged or worse than CNTO607 (Fig. 4).
The long  tails in the CIC profiles of the IgG4 antibody and the  K210T/K215T mutant also suggest complex or multidimensional interactions.
All the single point mutants,  similar to the triple mutant F99A/H100A/W100aA, have significantly reduced IL-13 binding affinity.
As expected, both  the K210T/K215T mutant and the IgG4 antibody maintain  affinity to IL-13 similar to that of CNTO607 due to the lack  of change in the variable region.
Based on the CIC results,  W100aA and K210T/K215T mutants and the IgG4 molecule  Fig. 2.

  The B22 values of the W100aA mutant, the F99A/H100A/  W100aA mutant and the IgG4 molecule were found to be  .21.0, confirming significantly diminished self-interaction  and increased solubility compared with CNTO607.
  Mutants W100aA, K210T/K215T and the IgG4 antibody,  together with the previously reported mutant F99A/H100A/  W100aA, were further characterized by DLS and viscosity  measurement at various protein concentrations.
The F99A/  H100A/W100aA mutant, the W100aA mutant and the IgG4  antibody exhibited hydrodynamic radii in the expected  monomeric antibody range by DLS that were virtually unchanged between 0.5 and 10 mg/ml.
The K210T/K215T  mutant, however, exhibited a progressively increasing hydrodynamic radius that was significantly larger than expected at  higher concentrations (Fig. 1), indicating oligomer formation.
  The viscosity measurement of these antibody solutions  showed that at a given concentration the viscosity follows the  order of CNTO607, K210T/K215T, CNTO607 IgG4,  W100aA and F99A/H100A/W100aA, with CNTO607 being  the most viscous (Fig. 2).
  The charge of an antibody can have a profound impact on  its self-association interaction (Tanford, 1961).
While most  of the mutations resulted in only small changes in the pI  (Table I and Supplementary Fig. S1), more pronounced differences in pI were observed for the IgG4 antibody and the  K210T/K215T variant.
IEF gel electrophoresis analysis indicated a 1.4 point difference between CNTO607 and its  IgG4 counterpart, with the IgG4 counterpart being more  acidic.
After the elimination of two positive charges from its  sequence, the K210T/K215T mutant showed a 1 point decrease in pI relative to CNTO607.
  Solution characterization of CNTO607 Fab  The Fab fragment of CNTO607 was studied in order to  assess if its self-association is primarily responsible for  CNTO607 aggregation.
In contrast to the mAb, the Fab fragment of CNTO607 was found to be highly soluble in PBS  buffer, reaching a concentration of 160 mg/ml without any  visible aggregation.
The upper limit of the solubility could  not be determined due to a sample quantity limitation.
The  CIC retention factor of CNTO607 Fab fragment was  improved over that of CNTO607, although a significant  amount of cross-interaction with the polyclonal IgG still  remains.
Consistent with the CIC data, the B22 of CNTO607  Fab determined by SIC is highly negative (217) (Table I),  indicating strong self-interaction among the Fab molecules.
  Furthermore, the hydrodynamic radius of CNTO607 Fab  showed a progressive increase from 2.7 nm at 0.5 mg/ml to  4.7 nm at 10 mg/ml.
  Discussion  We proposed a CNTO607 aggregation model in which the  interactions observed in the CNTO607 Fab crystal structure  lead to CNTO607 precipitation at high protein concentrations  due to the bivalency of the mAb (Wu et al., 2010).
In the  current report, we tested this model by mutagenesis and multiple biophysical characterization methods to identify the important residues involved in the aggregation.
We have shown  that the data support the above model as the major contributor to the aggregation of CNTO607.
  By testing the single point mutants F99A, H100A and  W100aA using CIC, SIC and determining their solubilities,  we demonstrated that removing the large aromatic side  chains of either F99 or W100a disrupts the intermolecular  interaction in CNTO607 while eliminating the H100 side  chain results in a minimal change to the intermolecular interaction.
At the same time, all three single point mutations led  to greatly reduced binding affinity to IL-13.
In addition to  the solubility, the CIC and the SIC measurements, the DLS  and viscosity data shed more light on the intermolecular  interactions of these antibodies.
At 0.5 mg/ml, all the antibodies exhibited hydrodynamic radii in the range of 4 6 nm,  within the range reported for monomeric antibody in solution  (Liu et al., 2010; Driskell et al., 2011; Hawe et al., 2011;  Huo et al., 2011).
The concentration dependence of the  hydrodynamic radii, however, revealed that these antibodies  behave somewhat differently.
CNTO607 exhibited a smaller  than average hydrodynamic radius of slightly above 4 nm at  0.5 mg/ml, which steadily increases to 6 nm at 10 mg/ml,  suggesting the formation of aggregates.
In contrast, the  hydrodynamic radii of the F99A/H100A/W100aA and the  W100aA mutants exhibited average antibody hydrodynamic  radii of 5  6 nm at the low concentrations, and remained essentially unchanged at higher concentrations.
Viscosity measurements provide an independent means to assess  self-association when there is no visible precipitation or a  large increase in the hydrodynamic radii (Liu et al., 2005;  Kanai et al., 2008).
The higher viscosity for mutant W100aA  compared with mutant F99A/H100A/W100aA underscores  the role of F99 and H100 in the self-association of  CNTO607.
  The DLS data of the IgG4 antibody show nearly identical  hydrodynamic radii at all concentrations measured, similar to  the F99A/H100A/W100aA and W100aA mutants.
The viscosity of the IgG4 antibody at high concentrations, however,  is much higher than that of F99A/H100A/W100aA and  W100aA mutants.
This indicates that although the isotype  change enabled the IgG4 molecule to remain in solution at  much higher concentrations than its IgG1 counterpart, a significant number of, and potentially multi-dimensional intermolecular interactions may exist in the IgG4 antibody  presumably involving the aggregation epitope.
This is in  Fig. 4.
CIC profiles of CNTO607 and variants.
  Mechanisms of self-association in a monoclonal antibody  Page 5 of 7   at Kainan University on March 2, 2015 http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from agreement with the CIC data, where the IgG4 antibody  showed a reduced, but still substantial, amount of crossinteraction with either human polyclonal IgG or CNTO607.
  In contrast to CNTO607 which undergoes irreversible  self-association at a relatively low concentration, the selfinteraction in the IgG4 variant is reversible in nature  manifested by a change in viscosity (Kanai et al., 2008).
  Based on the amino acid sequences, there is no difference  between the IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies in the immediate  vicinity of the interaction interface shown in Fig. 3.
It is  noted that the pI of the IgG4 molecule undergoes a significant change from 7.4 to 6.
It is plausible that at neutral pH  the charge repulsion force competes with the intermolecular  interactions involving the aggregation epitope in the IgG4  molecule, enabling the antibody to undergo reversible selfassociation at higher concentrations.
The change in solubility  resulting from the isotype change implies that the selfassociation interaction in CNTO607 is relatively weak and  can be readily compensated by small changes in the molecule.
Indeed, we were unable to detect any significant  binding affinity between the CNTO607 molecules using conventional methods such as Biacore.
A recent publication  reported a significant isotype impact on the solubility of an  anti-LINGO-1 antibody (Pepinsky et al., 2010).
The pIs of  those antibodies were at least one unit above neutral pH regardless of the isotype and were thus ruled out as a contributing factor.
Whether the pI change prevents our IgG4  antibody from precipitation at neutral pH is the subject of a  future investigation.
  The behavior of the K210T/K215T mutant was unexpected.
This mutant was designed to eliminate the charge interactions with D50 and D51 on the LC of a neighboring mAb  which anchor the aromatic triad into the interface.
This  mutant antibody was found to be much more soluble than  CNTO607.
The long retention time on the human polyclonal  IgG CIC column is not surprising because the aggregation  epitope in H-CDR3 and the D50/D51 residues in this mutant  antibody can still interact with the CH1 domains present on  the immobilized antibodies.
Upon further investigation using  the DLS and viscosity methods, this antibody was found to  aggregate in solution at relatively low concentrations.
  Although the mechanism of aggregation remains elusive, the  constant regions of IgG molecules inherently possess several  aggregation hot spots (Chennamsetty et al., 2009) so it is  possible that while the mutations disrupted the original Fab   Fab interaction it enabled new intermolecular interactions  due to the elimination of two positive charges in the  CH1domain.
This may explain the additional retention of  this variant on the CIC column compared with CNTO607.
  The new interactions do not appear to exacerbate via bivalency, thus no precipitation of the mutant was observed.
This  finding points to the importance of using multiple experimental methods for antibody characterization, and highlights  the challenge for mechanistic studies of protein aggregation.
  While there is a dominant interaction, multiple weaker interactions may contribute as well.
  Our aggregation model predicts that CNTO607 Fab should  self-associate but not precipitate.
Evidence that selfassociation occurs within the Fab fragment of CNTO607  comes from the SIC experiment where the B22 value for the  Fab is excessively negative.
The reduced yet still significant  retention of the Fab in the CIC experiment is consistent with  the aggregation epitope in H-CDR3 interacting in a monomeric manner with the CH1 domains of the polyclonal IgG  immobilized on the column matrix.
The Fab oligomerization  is further supported by the DLS data, where the hydrodynamic radius of the Fab increased from 2.7 nm at 0.5 mg/  ml to 4.7 nm at 10 mg/ml.
As the concentration increases,  the equilibrium appears to shift to higher order oligomer(s).
  These observations are in agreement with the tetrameric state  of the Fab in the crystal, where the protein is highly concentrated.
The aggregation model depicted in Fig. 5 illustrates  how the Fab Fab interactions progress to irreversible precipitation of the bivalent antibody.
At a concentration of  .13 mg/ml when CNTO607 precipitates, the molar equivalent Fab concentration is 8  9 mg/ml when a significant  amount of Fab oligomer is present based on the DLS data.
  According to our model, the antibody networks can begin to  form as soon as the Fab arm interactions are abundant and  will quickly proceed to an irreversible precipitation.
  Our results identified F99 and W100a as two important residues contributing significantly to the intermolecular interactions and support the residue-specific mechanism hypothesis  that the Fab interactions serve as the driver for CNTO607 precipitation.
Aromatic residues such as tryptophan and phenylalanine on protein surfaces are known to have the potential to  Fig. 5.

In a systematic study where solubility of  mutants at a single position was compared in RNase Sa, tryptophan and phenylalanine were observed to result in the  lowest solubility (Trevino et al., 2007).
The substitution of  any of the three aromatic residues to alanine in the H-CDR3  of CNTO607 was also found to greatly reduce antigen binding  affinity.
This is not surprising in light of the crystal structure  of the IL-13:CNTO607 Fab complex (Teplyakov et al., 2009).
  The aromatic side chains of F99 and W100a not only interact  with IL-13 directly but also support each others orientation  enabling the interaction with IL-13.
H100, on the other hand,  plays a structural role in maintaining the appropriate conformation.
Thus, the absence of any of these three side chains led  to a reduction in affinity.
  In the case of CNTO607 the antigen-binding epitope completely overlaps with the aggregation epitope, making it difficult to engineer high solubility by mutagenesis while  maintaining binding affinity.
Our results highlight the inherit  difficulty to distinguish and differentiate desirable protein   protein interaction from undesirable protein protein interaction, given that the underlying principles are the same.
This  may be a more common challenge than previously realized, as  suggested by Wang and coworkers who recently reported that  aggregation-prone regions occur frequently within the CDR  sequences based upon a computational analysis of 29 publicly  available high-resolution crystal structures of Fab-antigen  complexes (Wang et al., 2010).
While one may take precaution to avoid the aggregation-prone regions in future library  designs, we have found that screening for high solubility early  followed by orthogonal characterization method(s) is crucial  for the success of therapeutic antibody discoveries.
For the engineering approach, our findings suggest that identifying the  aggregation epitope in the sequence early is the key to developing effective protein engineering strategies for deriving  highly potent and highly soluble antibodies.
