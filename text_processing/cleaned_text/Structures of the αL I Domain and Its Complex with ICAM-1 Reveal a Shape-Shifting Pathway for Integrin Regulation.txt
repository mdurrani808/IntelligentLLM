Propagation of Conformational Change in the I Domain  (AC) The effect of ligand binding (A) and remodeling of the 6-7 loop in absence of ligand binding (B and C) are compared on I domain  structures near the MIDAS (A and B) and the 7-1 interface (C).
Views of (A) and (B) are similar and (C) is approximately orthogonal to (B).
  Key residues in conformational change are shown in ball-and-stick and labeled, except Gly-240 is unlabeled and shown as a large C atom  sphere and MIDAS residues Ser-139 and Ser-141 are shown but not labeled.
Metal ions are shown as large spheres with the same color as  the backbone of the corresponding I domain.
The position of the missing metal ion in the unliganded high-affinity structure is simulated by  superimposing the metal ion from the pseudo-liganded high-affinity structure and is shown smaller than the other metals.
Side chain oxygen  atoms are shown as red; water oxygens are omitted for clarity.
The directions of major shifts from closed to open conformations are shown  with arrows.
A portion of ICAM-1 domain-1 containing the metal-coordinating residue E34 is shown in cyan.
In (C), the side chain bonds in  the designed disulfide bridge (Cys-287-Cys-294) are shown in gray.

The backbone of the 6-7 loop and the  three residues that occupy the same hydrophobic pocket in the three different conformational states are shown in the same color key as in  (A)(C).
The pocket is shown as a GRASP van der Waals surface using the wild-type 1LFA structure with the residues from 287 to the C  terminus deleted.
The upper hydrophobic pocket is also shown, which is occupied only in the closed conformation (by F292 which is shown  in the wild-type structure along with L295).
For the closed conformation, the 6-7 main chain trace is broken between F292 and L295 for  clarity.
The view is about the same as in (C).
