In  the IL-4 system this interaction is predominantly determined  by the extracellular domain (IL4-BP) of the receptor a chain  (Kd ' 150 pM).
Now a high-resolution mutational and kinetic  analysis has revealed that the high-affinity binding of IL-4  originates from a continuous patch of a few mostly polar or  charged amino acid side chains located on helices A and C. The  binding epitope comprises (i) a set of side chains determining  the dissociation rate (koff) and (ii) a partially overlapping set  determining the association rate constant (kon) of the IL4yIL4-BP complex.
The koff epitope is assembled from two  juxtaposed main determinants (Glu-9 and Arg-88) surrounded by five side chains (Ile-5, Thr-13, Arg-53, Asn-89, and  Trp-91) of lower importance.
The cumulative increase in koff  after alanine substitution is 105-fold for the central mixedcharge pair and 3 3 103-fold for the satellites.
The kon epitope  is formed by five positively charged residues on helix C  (Lys-77, Arg-81, Lys-84, Arg-85, and Arg-88) and two neighboring residues on helix A (Glu-9 and Thr-13).
The cumulative  loss in kon of the alanine variants is only about 10-fold.
These  results provide the basis for an understanding of molecular  recognition in cytokine receptor complexes and for an IL-4  antagonist design.
  Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a pleiotropic cytokine which plays a key  regulatory role in the immune system (1).
The most notable  functions of IL-4 include the development of T-helper cells to  a type 2 cytokine-producing phenotype (2) and the class  switching to IgE (3).
A dysregulation of IL-4 function appears  to contribute to type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, such as  allergies and asthma (4).
Accordingly, inhibitors of IL-4 activity have therapeutic potential (5, 6).
  IL-4, as many other cytokines, evokes a cellular response by  promoting the formation of a heterodimeric receptor complex  in the plasma membrane (79).
The high-affinity binding of  human IL-4 to its cellular receptor (10) is mediated nearly  exclusively by the receptor a chain (11).
The affinity is only  marginally increased if both the a chain and gc, the second  functional receptor chain, are present (7).
Antagonistic IL-4  variants retain the high-affinity binding to the a chain but are  deficient in gc binding (12, 13).
  IL-4 is one of the short-chain 4-helix bundle cytokines (14).
Its  three-dimensional structure has been established in solution  (1517) and in crystals (1820).
Residues important for a-chain  binding have been located on the antiparallel helices A and C (11,  21).
The present detailed analysis of this discontinuous epitope  addresses several questions relevant for an understanding of  molecular recognition in cytokine receptor complexes and in  particular for a rational IL-4 antagonist design.
  (i) A large planar interface of '500 2 has been modelled  for the human IL-4yIL4-BP complex (22, 23), similar to and  only slightly smaller than that of the complex of human growth  hormone (hGH) and its binding protein (hGHbp) (24).
We  wanted to know if only a few residues in the IL-4 structural  epitope are critical in binding as established for the hGH  epitope (25).
(ii) Transient proteinprotein interfaces have  been discussed to be dominated by hydrophobic interactions  similar to the interior of a protein (26, 27).
The importance of  charged IL-4 residues for binding (28) might be at variance  with such a postulate.
It was therefore interesting to identify  and analyze the complete set of functional residues and their  binding increments in the IL-4 epitope.
(iii) A conspicuous  feature of human IL-4 is a highly positive net charge and in  particular a cluster of basic residues in helix C. This patch of  positive charges has been surmised to be important for complex formation, since a surplus of negatively charged side  chains is found in the modeled interface of IL4-BP. Electrostatic steering has been invoked to explain the fast association  rate for IL-4yIL4-BP complex formation (29).
  Here we have studied the effects of systematic alanine and  glutamine substitutions (alanine scanning) as well as of  charged residue substitutions (charge scanning) in IL-4 variants on the kinetics of IL4-BP interaction.
The alanine variants  were expected to exhibit a loss in binding energy according to  the contribution of the original side chain atoms beyond the b  carbon.
In hGH (25) the sum of reductions in free energy  caused by alanine substitutions was comparable to the total  free energy of binding between hGH and hGHbp.
For barnaseybarstar association (30), however, side-chain contributions were not always additive due to cooperative interactions.
  Nevertheless, the mutational and kinetic analysis of IL-4y  IL4-BP binding should identify the functional residues, and it  might give a first estimation of their quantitative contributions  to total binding free energy.
The charge variants of IL-4 were  studied, since they might exhibit loss of binding due to an  electrostatic mismatch, and variants altered in their binding  affinity thus could be affected at any of the side chains buried  at the interface.
The charge variants might in addition show a  pronounced alteration in their association rate constant with  IL4-BP, if electrostatic steering augments complex formation.
  The kinetics of IL-4 variant binding were measured by  means of the BIAcore system with a recombinant IL4-BP  immobilized at the biosensor matrix (28).
In addition, equilibrium binding of informative IL-4 variants was determined  The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge for T cells, to learn whether biosensor data give information  payment.

  1657relevant for the binding of the IL-4 variants to the receptor of  whole cells.
Finally, the results of the physical binding and  kinetic measurements were compared with the proliferative  activity of IL-4 variants for activated T cells.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS  The human IL-4 variants were produced in Escherichia coli and  purified to apparent chromatographic homogeneity (11).
The  freeze-dried proteins were dissolved in water at 300600 mM  concentration and stored at 2208C.
The concentration was  measured photospectrometrically (28) using an extinction coefficient 278 5 8860 M21zcm21 for all variants but IL4[W91A], for which 278 5 3360 M21zcm21 was used.
  The IL-4 cDNA was mutated by inserting synthetic doublestranded DNA cassettes between engineered restriction endonuclease cutting sites.
Some cDNAs could not be cloned (e.g.,  K12A).
Some variants could not be refolded and purified (e.g.,  D87A).
  The BIA2000 system (Pharmacia Biosensor) was used to  measure the rate constants for association and dissociation of  the complex between IL-4 variants and IL4-BP as well as the  equilibrium binding, as described (28).
Briefly, a recombinant  IL4-BP[C182A, Q206C] was biotinylated at Cys-206 and immobilized at the streptavidin-coated matrix of biosensor chip  CM5 to a density of 5070 resonance units corresponding to  5070 pg of protein per mm2.
The IL-4 variants were diluted  with HBS running buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4y150 mM  NaCly3.4 mM EDTAy0.005% surfactant P20) to 1 or 10 mM  and applied at concentrations between 2.5 and 1000 nM. Flow  rates were set to 50 mlzmin21 at 258C, flow path was 1-2-3-4,  and data were recorded at 2.5 Hz.
Sensograms were evaluated  on the basis of a 1:1 association model according to fitting  routines 2 or 3 provided by the BIA evaluation 2.1 software  (Pharmacia Biosensor).
The mean standard deviations were  15% for on-rate constants and 25% for the off-rate constants  using the results of 12 to 24 independent measurements at  different analyte concentrations.
  Competitive radioligand binding to activated T-cells was performed as described (12), applying 100300 pM 125I-labeled IL-4  with a specific activity of 2.2 3 106 dpmzpmol21  .
Competing IL-4  variants were applied in serial 3-fold dilutions.
Measurements  were repeated at least twice.
T cell proliferation was measured in  triplicate by the incorporation of [3  H]thymidine in the presence  of serial 2-fold dilutions of the IL-4 variants (11).
  Mouse IL-4 was produced in SF-9 cells and purified to apparent homogeneity (31).
Protein was measured by the BCA protein  assay (Pierce).
  RESULTS  
The high-affinity binding site of human IL-4 for IL4-BP has  been located on helices A and C during previous studies on  binding-deficient IL-4 variants (11, 21) and on IL-4 epitopes  recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (32).
Now,  loss-of-function variants were produced at all surface positions of helices A and C by alanine or glutamine substitutions  (alanine scanning).
In addition, a collection of previously  constructed glutamine variants, covering all conserved  charged residues of IL-4, was reanalyzed.
Finally, a charge  scanning mutational analysis was performed to identify the  complete IL-4BP-binding interface.
All IL-4 proteins were  purified to apparent homogeneity and submitted to biosensorbased binding experiments.
A recombinant IL4-BP biotinylated at Cys-206 and immobilized at the streptavidin-coated  matrix of the biosensor was used as receptor a-chain analogue  (28).
Sensograms recorded at different concentrations of IL-4  variants were evaluated for the kinetic constants of the association (kon and koff) as compiled in Table 1.
  The association rate constants were found to be unaffected  or only slightly altered in all analyzed variants.
A 1.5- to 2-fold  reduction in on-rate occurred in alanine or glutamine variants  E9Q, T13A, K77A, R81A, K84A, R85A, R88AyQ, and W91A  Table 1.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997)(Table 1). With the exception of T13A, only substitutions of  charged, mostly basic, residues produced a significant on-rate  effect.
The on-rate of variant E19A was consistently found to  be faster than that of IL-4.
  Charge variants at the basic positions of helix C exhibited a  larger decrease in on-rate than the corresponding alanine variants.
The replacement of a basic residue by an acidic residue of  opposite charge in variants K77E, R81E, K84D, and R85D was  paralleled by a 3- to 5-fold reduced on-rate.
Charge variants T6D,  K12D, and T13D on helix A showed an about 2-fold lower kon  than IL-4.
  These results indicated that the rate constant of 1.3 3 107  M21zs21 of association between IL-4 and IL4-BP is remarkably  insensitive to amino acid substitutions, even when large alterations in size or charge had been introduced.
The sensitivity  showed a positional effect, with the largest changes found  among the basic side chains on helix C. Substitutions leading  to a loss of one positive charge had in most instances smaller  effects (1.5- to 2-fold) than those leading to a loss of two  positive charges (3- to 5-fold).
This suggested that a loss of  charges, usually positive charges, of certain side chains at  specific positions of the protein surface slows down the rate of  IL-4yIL4-BP association.
  In previous experiments, a 4- to 5-fold decrease in the kon of  IL-4 had been observed when the salt concentration was  increased form 150 mM to 0.7 M NaCl (28).
This negative salt  effect was found to be only 2- to 3-fold for the kon of variants  R81E, K84D, and R85D (data not shown).
In none of the  variants was the off-rate constant altered by salt.
Thus, both  high ionic strength of the medium and the loss of charges in the  IL-4 protein weakened electrostatic steering during IL-4y  IL4-BP association.
It is possible that a kon in the range of 1 to  2 3 106 M21zs21 is a limit value attainable in the absence of  electrostatic attraction (see ref. 33).
  Large changes in dissociation rate constant were observed in  a subset of the alanine or glutamine variants (Table 1).
By far  the most sensitive positions were those of Glu-9 and Arg-88.
  The off-rate constant was 70- to 130-fold faster when the  charges of these side chains had been removed by glutamine  substitution.
The increase in koff was 300-fold when the whole  side chain of Arg-88 had been replaced by that of alanine.
In  two further alanine variants the off-rate constant was increased 14-fold (N89A) and 7-fold (I5A).
A 3-fold higher  off-rate was found in variants T13A, R53Q, and W91A.
A  marginal but significant increase in koff occurred in IL-4  variants R81A, K84A, and R85A.
R53Q was the only variant  with an amino acid substitution located on helix B. An estimate  of the cumulative effect of the substitutions in all these variants  yielded an increase in koff by a factor of about 1 3 109.
  The analyzed charge variants exhibited a pattern of changes  in koff confirming and overlapping with that of the alanine or  glutamine variants.
All positions where alanine substitutions  increased the koff also yielded faster dissociation rate constants  after charged residue substitutions.
The only exception was  position Thr-13.
Remarkably, variant T13D and also F82D  exhibited a 3- to 4-fold reduced koff.
The substituted acidic  residue therefore stabilized the complex with IL4-BP.
At the  position of Thr-6, where alanine substitution had no effect, a  faster off-rate constant was obtained in the charge variant.
  Variant T6D dissociated with an off-rate 8-fold faster than  IL-4.
The increase in off-rate observed with the charge variants  R81E, K84D, R85D, and W91D was 3- to 5-fold and thus more  pronounced than that of the corresponding alanine variants.
  The increased off-rates probably result from an electrostatic  repulsion at the contact site with the receptor rather than from  a loss in binding function of the original residue.
These changes  were generally quite low, however.
From this observation it  might be concluded that also in alanine or glutamine variants  repulsive forces due to uncompensated charged receptor side  chains appear to be negligible.
  A set of further IL-4 variants with glutamine substitutions,  which had been analyzed previously by competitive radioligand  binding (11), showed association and dissociation rate constants with IL4-BP indistinguishable from those of IL-4.
The  only exception, as mentioned above, was variant R53Q.
  Several IL-4 variants (E9K, E9A, R88D, and N89R) bound  unspecifically to the biosensor matrix when applied at concentrations .1
mM. This prevented a measurement of the  kinetic and equilibrium constants.
  The high-resolution mutational analysis of IL-4 indicated  that the side chains of Glu-9 and Arg-88, and especially their  charges, provide the largest contribution to the stabilization of  the complex.
As illustrated for the koff epitope in Fig. 1B (see  also Fig. 2), both side chains are juxtaposed on the surface of  IL-4, where they form a pair of oppositely charged binding  determinants.
This mixed-charge pair is surrounded by five  side chains of lower functional importancei.e., Ile-5, Thr-13,  Arg-53, Asn-89, and Trp-91.
The off-rate determinants are not  the same as the on-rate determinants.
The kon epitope is  shifted toward helix C and comprises most of the basic side  chains in that surface (Fig. 1A).
This positively charged  epitope might be attracted by the negatively charged surface of  the receptor, thereby increasing the association rate constant  by the increment sensitive to ionic strength (5- to 10-fold).
  The total change in binding free energy (dG) for the interaction of IL-4 with IL4-BP is 13.3 kcalymol (1 kcal 5 4.18 kJ) as  calculated from a dissociation constant of 160 pM. The loss of  binding energy in alanine or glutamine variants (ddG) as calculated from the change in the dissociation constant Kd is shown in  FIG.
1. IL-4 epitopes determining association (A) and dissociation (B)  rate constants for the IL-4yIL4-BP complex.
The location of the mutated  residues on helices A and C are indicated by rectangles with sizes  corresponding to their accessible surface areas (17).
The bars represent  the change in kon or koff of IL-4 variants in relation to the kon or koff of  IL-4 due to alanine or glutamine (E9, R53) substitution (see Table 1).
  Biochemistry: Wang et al. Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997) 1659Table 2.
The Kd values obtained either from the kinetic measurements (koffykon) or from the equilibrium binding phase of the  biosensor experiments, were similar to those from competitive  radioligand binding to whole T cells (Fig. 3).
The loss of binding  free energy after alanine or glutamine substitution of seven  residues (Ile-5, Glu-9, Thr-13, Arg-53, Arg-88, Asn-89, and Trp91) amounted together to 12 kcalymol.
This accounted for 90%  of the total binding energy.
Another three residues (Arg-81,  Lys-84, and Arg-85) when replaced by alanine produced a loss of  1.2 kcalymol, which could account for a further 10% of the total  binding energy.
No significant energetic contributions could be  found for other amino acid side chains.
The cumulative loss of  binding free energy established by the analyzed variants is probably too low, since, e.g., the Ala variant of Glu-9 could not be  analyzed and interactions with the main chain cannot be studied  by the present mutational approach.
The high cumulative loss  may indicate that the individual mutations are not completely  independent.
  The location of the binding epitope is indicated in the spacefilling IL-4 model presented in Fig. 2.
The losses in binding  affinity due to alanine substitution of the functional residues are  represented by a color code.
The contiguous binding epitope was  considerably smaller than the total IL-4yIL4-BP interface derived from recent model-building exercises (22, 23).
Furthermore,  the location differed from earlier postulates (see below).
The  important koff epitope (residues colored in red and orange)  extended perpendicular to the axis of the helix bundle and  comprised two helical turns on helix A, one helical turn on helix  C, and one residue on helix B. The small contribution of the kon  epitope to binding is indicated by the yellow basic residues in the  upper half of helix C. The functional residues in IL-4 were all  polar with the exception of Ile-5 and Trp-91.
  The biological activity of the IL-4 variants as determined in  a T cell proliferation assay was indistinguishable from that of  IL-4, with the exception of the variants affected at the key  positions Glu-9 and Arg-88 (Table 2). But even with these  variants the loss in biological activity (EC50) was 10 to 20 times  less than the changes in binding affinity.
The receptor on T  cells and IL4-BP immobilized to the biosensor matrix bound  the IL-4 variants with similar affinities (Fig. 3), and differences  between the measurements in the two systems could not be  responsible for these discrepancies.
The unexpectedly low  deficiencies of the variants in T cell proliferative activity,  therefore, supported the earlier notion (28) that the biological  activity of human IL-4 is not primarily determined by the  equilibrium binding to the IL-4 receptor a chain.
  IL-4 exhibits a marked species specificity with respect to  both biological activity and physical receptor binding (see, e.g.,  ref.
10).
Up to now, mouse IL-4 was considered not to  cross-react with the human a chain to a measurable extent.
  When the functional epitope of human IL-4 was compared  with the probably equivalent surface residues of mouse IL-4,  however, several invariant positions were recognized.
The two  key residues of human IL-4 (Glu-9, Arg-88) are present in  mouse IL-4.
In addition, the minor determinants Arg-53 and  Arg-85 are retained.
Accordingly, it was a distinct possibility  that mouse IL-4 binds to human IL4-BP in the micromolar  range.
A glycosylated mouse IL-4 expressed in Sf-9 cells bound  during biosensor experiments to immobilized human IL4-BP  with a 15 mM Kd at 150 mM NaCl and with a 35 mM Kd in the  presence of 0.5 M NaCl (data not shown).
The measured  binding affinity is about 10 times weaker than estimated.
This  relatively small discrepancy could result from sterical hindrance at the interface between the mouse IL-4 and the human  IL4-BP.
It may be predicted that the interaction of bovine or  porcine IL-4 with human IL4-BP has a still lower Kd, since the  putative binding epitopes are conserved in these species and in  human IL-4 with the exception of Trp-91 (Table 3).
  DISCUSSION  The present study has identified all amino acid side chains in  human IL-4 that are engaged in the high-affinity binding of  FIG. 2.

  1660 Biochemistry: Wang et al. Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997)IL4-BP, the extracellular domain of the receptor a chain.
A  saturating mutational analysis of all surface residues on IL-4  helices A and C yielded all but one of the functional residues.
  Reanalysis of a collection of glutamine variants (11) confirmed  that Arg-53 on helix B provides an additional functional side  chain.
The existence of further binding determinants is unlikely,  but cannot be rigorously excluded at present.
The variant D87A  could not be renatured, probably because the original residue is  structurally important.
In addition, however, it may be involved in  binding.
Contributions of small residuese.g., glycine or alanineor of the backbone are also possible, but would not have  been detected by the approach applied.
Nevertheless, the salient  features of the binding epitope could be clearly established.
It is  interesting to note that the receptor a-chain-binding epitope of  IL-4 coincides with a B cell epitope recognized by IL-4 neutralizing monoclonal antibody 7D7 (32).
  IL-4 residues buried in the postulated large flat interface with  IL4-BP (22, 23) contribute very unequally to binding as assessed  from the loss of binding free energy in alanine or glutamine  variants.
This is especially striking in the case of the four buried  arginines, where the key determinant Arg-88 is located beside the  minor determinant Arg-53 and also beside putative interface  residues Arg-81 and Arg-85, which have very low functional  importance.
The three lysines at positions 12, 74, and 77 can be  replaced by alanine with no or only marginal effect.
Large  hydrophobic side chains as those of Ile-5 or Trp-91 are of some  functional importance, whereas Phe-82 can be replaced by a small  alanine residue with no discernible consequences on binding.
  Thus, the functional epitope of IL-4 is clearly smaller than the  putative structural epitope, similar to the binding in the hGHy  hGHbp complex (25, 26).
This leads to the question how a residue  becomes functionali.e., how it can make a positive contribution  to the binding free energy.
Why, e.g., is Arg-88 critical for binding  but not the other arginines in the interface, although several of  them appear to be engaged in ionic interactions with aspartic  residues in IL4-BP (23)?
Dehydration andyor mobility of side  chains may be important parameters determining the binding  potency of an interface residue.
These questions may be answered  when the orientation and the mobility of interface residues both  in the complex and in the free IL-4 and IL4-BP proteins become  known.
  Charged and polar determinants predominate in the highaffinity binding epitope of human IL-4.
The hydrophobic  functional side chains of Ile-5, Thr-13, and Trp-91 are of minor  importance, and single losses in binding due to alanine or even  aspartate substitutions are less than 10-fold.
The proposed  interface of IL4-BP contains several polar and charged side  chains.
Ion pairs could be formed between Asp-67 in the CD  loop of IL4-BP and IL-4 Arg-88, or between Lys-86 in the  interdomain peptide of IL4-BP and Glu-9 of IL-4 (22).
In the  hGH receptor two tryptophans (Trp-104 and Trp-169) are the  most important binding determinants involved in hydrophobic  bonds to the hormone (35).
The possibly equivalent positions  in IL4-BP are Ala-66 and Tyr-124.
Ala-66 is located in the  polar sequence Ser-Ala-Asp-Asn.
Thus, the functional IL-4y  IL4-BP epitopes are probably not in accordance with the  Table 2.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997) 1661assumption that the large transient interfaces formed by the  association of cytokines and cytokine receptors are mainly  hydrophobic, similar to the interior of proteins (26).
  Electrostatic steering likely contributes to the fast association rate constant of 1.3 3 107 M21zs21 between IL-4 and  IL4-BP (29).
All charged residues in the kon epitope of IL-4 as  depicted in Fig. 1A could help to prealign the proteins by  electrostatic interactions with the complementary IL4-BP  interface.
The association rate constant, but not the dissociation rate constant, is decreased at higher salt concentrations  (28).
For IL-4 the on-rate extrapolated for indefinitely high  ionic strength amounts to about 2 3 106 M21zs21.
This value  is comparable to the on-rate constant predicted by Northrup  and Ericson (33) for a generic proteinprotein association on  the basis of Brownian dynamics simulation and assuming a  two-point encounter complex.
The kon of charge-reversal  variants is 1  2 to 1  5 that of IL-4, whereas the off-rates of these  variants are unaltered (see Table 1).
The salt effect on the  association rate constant, however, is smaller than with IL-4,  suggesting that a similar on-rate would be extrapolated for very  high salt concentration (see also ref. 36).
It is interesting to  note that the kon for the association between mouse IL-4 and  mouse IL4-BP is only 4 3 106 M21zs21 (31).
Mouse IL-4 is less  basic than the human IL-4; in particular, some of the basic  residues on helix C are absent.
Thus, electrostatic steering  probably is of lower importance for the association of the  mouse IL-4 receptor complex.
  Some variants exhibit an up to 3-fold increased binding  affinity compared with IL-4.
This tighter binding is caused  either by an increased on-rate (E19A) or by a decreased  off-rate (T13D, F82D).
Amino acid substitutions which increase the binding affinity have been detected in the hGHy  hGHbp complex as well (25).
  The biosensor experiments yield the energy contributions of  the functional residues either by evaluating the kinetic constants  (Kd 5 koffykon) or by measuring the equilibrium binding at  different IL-4 concentrations.
The values obtained by both procedures are the same within the experimental error.
When the  receptor binding of variants to whole T cells is analyzed by  competitive radioligand binding, the relative energy contributions  of the functional side chains are similar to those obtained by  means of the biosensor measurements.
This indicates that the  results obtained with the immobilized recombinant IL4-BP are  relevant for the receptor binding on whole cells.
Largely dissimilar, however, are the biological activities of the binding-deficient  IL-4 variants.
During a T cell proliferation assay all variants  showed normal IL-4-like specific activities, with the exception of  E9Q, R88Q, and R88A. But also with these variants the 10- to  20-fold loss in biological activity is much less pronounced than the  more than 100-fold loss in receptor binding.
Thus, the receptorbinding affinity of IL-4 variants (Kd) is not clearly correlated with  their biological activity (EC50).
The same holds for the correlation  between koff and EC50.
The koff for the IL-4yIL4-BP complex  means a half-life of 6.5 min.
As discussed previously (28), this is  similar to the half-life of about 10 min for receptor-bound IL-4  internalization in whole cells.
Possibly the biological activity of  IL-4 and IL-4 variants is determined predominantly by the kon as  long as the koff is in the time scale of the receptor internalization  rates.
  Human IL-4 has a three-dimensional structure similar to  other 4-helix bundle cytokines, despite the large differences in  the amino acid sequences (34).
The cytokine receptors, on the  other hand, exhibit related primary structures of their extracellular binding domains (14) which are probably all folded  into two fibronectin type III domains.
Therefore, the functional epitope of human IL-4 has been suggested to be  organized like that in other 4-helical cytokines, in particular  like that of hGH (see, e.g., ref. 17).
The present results  indicate, however, that several fundamental differences exist.
  Most importantly, the high-affinity binding epitope of IL-4 is  located on helices A and C, and not on helix D like the  high-affinity binding site of hGH.
In hGH four main binding  determinants exist on the same helix D (Lys-172, Thr-175,  Phe-176, and Arg-178) contributing binding energies of around  2 kcalymol.
In IL-4 the binding is concentrated in two main  determinants with energy contributions of 34 kcalymol, and  these residues exist on different helices.
Finally, the interactions contributing to the hGHyhGHbp complex binding affinity are largely hydrophobic (35).
In IL-4 the binding energy  appears to be provided largely by charged groups.
The site 2  epitope of hGH is located on helices A and C. It has apparently  a much lower affinity for hGHbp, since it interacts only when  the 1:1 complex with site 1 has already been formed.
The  functional residues in hGH site 2, as far as they have been  analyzed up to now, differ considerably from the type and  position of the residues identified in the high-affinity epitope  of human IL-4.
It will be interesting to learn whether the  high-affinity binding epitopes of other short-chain 4-helical  cytokines are constructed similarly to that of IL-4.
