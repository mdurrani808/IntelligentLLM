Molecular evolution of antibody cross-reactivity for  two subtypes of type A botulinum neurotoxin  Consuelo Garcia-Rodriguez1,3, Raphael Levy1,3, Joseph W Arndt2, Charles M Forsyth1, Ali Razai1,  Jianlong Lou1, Isin Geren1, Raymond C Stevens2 & James D Marks1  Broadening antibody specificity without compromising affinity should facilitate detection and neutralization of toxin and viral  subtypes.
We used yeast display and a co-selection strategy to increase cross-reactivity of a single chain (sc) Fv antibody  to botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A).
Starting with a scFv that binds the BoNT/A1 subtype with high affinity (136 pM) and  the BoNT/A2 subtype with low affinity (109 nM), we increased its affinity for BoNT/A2 1,250-fold, to 87 pM, while maintaining  high-affinity binding to BoNT/A1 (115 pM).
To find the molecular basis for improved cross-reactivity, we determined the X-ray  co-crystal structures of wild-type and cross-reactive antibodies complexed to BoNT/A1 at resolutions up to 2.6 A , and measured  the thermodynamic contribution of BoNT/A1 and A2 amino acids to wild-type and cross-reactive antibody binding.
The results  show how an antibody can be engineered to bind two different antigens despite structural differences in the antigen-antibody  interface and may provide a general strategy for tuning antibody specificity and cross-reactivity.
  Botulism is caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and is characterized by flaccid paralysis, which if not immediately fatal requires  prolonged hospitalization in an intensive care unit.
Naturally occurring botulism results from ingestion of contaminated food, anaerobic  wound infections or gastrointestinal tract colonization by clostridial  bacteria1.
BoNTs are also classified by the Centers for Disease Control  as one of the six highest-risk threat agents for bioterrorism (the  Category A agents), owing to their extreme potency and lethality24.
  Treatment of botulism in adults requires use of antitoxin5 generated  from immunized horses, which is associated with a high incidence of  side effects, including serum sickness and anaphylactic shock6.
As an  alternative, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are under development7,8.
  Development of a mAb-based antitoxin for botulism is complicated by  two factors.
First, single mAbs, regardless of affinity, have not  neutralized toxin with a potency that would allow practical development; however combinations of two to three mAbs neutralize BoNT  with high potency8.
Second, there exist multiple subtypes for each of  the seven toxin serotypes, which differ from each other by up to 35%  at the amino acid level.
These subtype sequence differences affect mAb  binding and neutralization9.
For example, the amino acid sequences of  BoNT subtype A2 (BoNT/A2 (ref. 10)) and BoNT subtype A1 (BoNT/  A1 (ref. 11)) differ by 10% (ref. 9).
As a result, only three of six mAbs  bind both toxin subtypes with high affinity9.
The humanized affinitymatured mAb AR2 binds BoNT/A1 with very high affinity (KD  6.8   1012 M) and exhibits the highest level of in vivo neutralization we  have observed for a single mAb12.
Unfortunately, AR2 IgG binds  BoNT/A2 with more than a 29,000-fold lower affinity than BoNT/A1,  and as a result has minimal neutralizing activity for BoNT/A2 (ref. 9).
  To overcome these challenges, we used yeast display, antibody gene  diversity libraries, and a dual-selection strategy to increase antibody  affinity for BoNT/A2 more than 1,000-fold while maintaining high  affinity binding to BoNT/A1.
Measurement of the thermodynamics  of antibody binding to BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 and solution of the  X-ray co-crystal structure of antibodies complexed to toxin reveal the  basis for increased cross-reactivity and suggest a general route to  broadening antibody specificity.
  RESULTS  Improving the cross-reactivity of AR2 for BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2  A gene diversity library was used to increase the affinity of the  previously created AR2 scFv12 for BoNT/A2 while maintaining highaffinity binding to BoNT/A1.
An AR2 scFvbased yeast display library  was generated by using a spiked oligonucleotide to introduce mutations into the heavy-chain variable region (VH) antigen-binding loop  H1 (Table 1)13,14.
Loop amino acids were selected for mutagenesis  based on solvent accessibility as determined by modeling.
In H1, the  loop residues begin in the framework region (as classified by Kabat13)  and extend into complementarity determining region 1 (CDR1).
  For selection of a cross-reactive scFv, the induced library was initially  flow sorted after staining with BoNT/A1.
The next four rounds of  sorting were done with decreasing concentrations of BoNT/A2.
After  five rounds of sorting, the gene encoding the ScFv was amplified from  individual colonies, revealing the presence of one unique sequence,  CR1 (Table 1).
Compared to AR2, CR1 had three amino acid  substitutions in H1 and a single amino acid substitution in H2  (P61S) (Table 1).

  NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 25 NUMBER 1 JANUARY 2007 107  ARTICLES   2007 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnologyBoNT/A1 was essentially unchanged compared to AR2 (1.36  1010  M versus 1.25  1010 M, respectively), whereas its affinity for BoNT/  A2 increased 272-fold, from 1.09  107 M to 4.0  1010 M  (Table 1).
Mutation of the P61S mutation in the H2 of CR1 back to  P61 resulted in no change in affinity for BoNT/A1 and a less than twofold reduction in affinity for BoNT/A2, indicating that the increase in  cross-reactivity was due almost exclusively to the H1 mutations.
  Evolution of CR1 to increase cross-reactivity for BoNT/A1 and A2  To further improve the affinity of the CR1 scFv for BoNT/A2 while  maintaining high-affinity binding to BoNT/A1, we generated three  additional yeast display libraries based on the sequence of CR1.
These  libraries were generated by using spiked oligonucleotides to introduce  mutations into the H2, H3 or L1 antigen-binding loops (Table 1).
For  selection of cross-reactive scFv, the induced libraries were stained with  BoNT/A1 for the first and fourth rounds of sorting and stained with  BoNT/A2 for the second and third rounds of sorting.
For subsequent  sorting rounds, yeast were simultaneously incubated with BoNT/A2  holotoxin and the receptor binding domain (HC) of BoNT/A1 using a  labeling strategy that provided independent sortable signals for BoNT/  A1 and BoNT/A2 binding (Fig. 1).
To select yeast displaying scFv with  the highest-affinity binding to both BoNT/A subtypes, yeast with the  highest mean fluorescence intensity for binding to BoNT/A1 and  BoNT/A2 were separately gated and only yeast present in both gates  sorted by intersecting the two gates (Fig. 1c).
  After six rounds of sorting, the gene encoding the scFv was  amplified from individual colonies for each of the three libraries.
  Overall, it proved difficult to further increase the affinity of CR1 for  BoNT/A2 while maintaining high-affinity binding to BoNT/A1.
  The only scFv identified with higher affinity for BoNT/A2 and  no reduction in affinity for BoNT/A1 had wild-type CDRs and  mutations in the framework regions, owing to PCR errors.
  CR1.1 had a single mutation located outside of H2, V37I, and an  B50% improvement in affinity for BoNT/A1 and a fourfold  increase in affinity for BoNT/A2 (Table 1).

  The VH V37I mutation of clone CR1.1 was combined with the VH  E6Q mutation of clone CR1.2 to yield the double mutant CR2, which  had a 4.5-fold increase in affinity for BoNT/A2 and no change in  affinity for BoNT/A1 (Table 1).
  Using the co-crystal structure of CR1-BoNT/A1 (see below), nine  mutants of CR1 were also generated to either increase hydrogen  bonding or van der Waals interaction at the periphery of the interface,  increase surface complementarity at the center of the interface or  increase hydrophobic interactions.
None of these mutations increased  cross-reactivity, and most decreased affinity for BoNT/A2 (Supplementary Table 1 online).
These results illustrate the challenge in  increasing antibody cross-reactivity, even with a co-crystal structure,  and highlight the combined power of the diversity library and  selection approaches used here.
  Overall, the evolution of AR2 to CR2 resulted in a scFv that had  the same affinity for BoNT/A1 but whose affinity for BoNT/A2  increased 1,250-fold, from 1.09  107 to 8.7  1011 M. This  narrowed the relative affinities for BoNT/A2:BoNT/A1 from 800-fold  for AR2 to no difference for CR2.
The six mutations in AR2  accounting for this increase in cross-reactivity are all located in the  VH domain, with three mutations in solvent-accessible residues  of the VH H1.
  Affinities of IgG constructed from scFv  To determine whether changes in affinity observed for the scFvs were  recapitulated in the IgGs, we converted CR1 and CR2 scFv to IgG. As  with the scFv, CR1 and CR2 IgG showed substantially increased  affinity for BoNT/A2 compared to the parental AR2 (116-fold and  693-fold, respectively, for IgG compared to 272-fold and 1,252-fold,  respectively, for the scFv), while maintaining  high-affinity binding to BoNT/A1 (Table 1  and Supplementary Fig. 1 online).
As the  KDs of both AR2 and CR2 IgG for BoNT/A1  were 10- to 20-fold higher than the scFv KDs,  but the IgG and scFv KDs for BoNT/A2 were  comparable, the relative IgG affinity for  BoNT/A1 versus BoNT/A2 decreased from  29,000-fold to 29-fold (a 1,000-fold narrowing of relative affinities) compared to 801-  fold to 0.76-fold for the scFv (a 1,054-fold  narrowing of relative affinities).
Thus,  although the absolute differences in relative  KD were different between the IgG and scFv  format, the relative increase in affinity for  BoNT/A2 versus BoNT/A1 was translatable  from the scFv format to the IgG. The differences in absolute KD between scFv and IgG  may reflect differences in scFv stability compared to IgG (usually higher for IgG), the fact  that scFvs were displayed on yeast and the  IgG were in solution, or differences in techniques used to measure the KD.
The difference does not appear to be due to valency, as  the KDs of CR1 Fab and IgG for BoNT/A1  and BoNT/A2 are comparable when measured by the same technique (CR1 Fab KD   5.0  1012 M and 2.0  109 M for  BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2, respectively).
  Structural and functional epitope of AR2 and CR1  To understand the molecular basis of engineered cross-reactivity, we  crystallized BoNT/A1 holotoxin in complex with the CR1 and AR2  Fabs.
Both Fabs bind to identical regions on the BoNT/A1 binding  domain, at the interface between the N-terminal lectin subdomain  (HCN) and the C-terminal trefoil subdomain (HCC) (Fig. 2).
The  BoNT/A1-CR1 structure has a discontinuous epitope that is predominantly composed of the b23-b24, b25-b26, b27-b28 and b35-b36  loops of the lectin subdomain, but also includes the C terminus of the  trefoil (Fig. 2a,b and Table 2).
The buried interface surface area of  CR1 is 1,126 A 2, with nearly an equal contribution being made by the  CR1 heavy (588 A 2) and light (538 A 2) chains.
Compared with the  structure of the uncomplexed BoNT/A1, the trefoil subdomain is  displaced 7.5 A after antibody binding, and several BoNT loops are  repositioned to enable optimal binding to CR1 residues.
  Interactions of the CR1 light chain with BoNT/A1 are found in all  three of the antigen-binding loops (L1L3), but are primarily  restricted to L1 and L3.
L1 binds the b35-b36 loop of BoNT/A1;  key interactions include strong hydrogen bonding between Y32 of  CR1 and the side chains of D1062 and R1065 of BoNT/A1 and pistacking interactions of F36 of CR1 with H1064.
L3 binds via G95 and  N96 also forms a hydrogen bond with H1064 of BoNT/A1, whereas  E97 interacts with S955 in the b27-b28 loop of BoNT/A1.
Only a  single contact is found in L2 with the C terminus of the trefoil domain  via S71 of CR1 with R1294 of BoNT/A1 (Fig. 2b,c and Table 2).
  Interactions of the CR1 heavy chain with BoNT/A1 are also found  in all three loops (H1H3).
The H1 of CR1 has a variety of side-chain  and main-chain interactions, with Y31 and Y33 forming hydrogen  bonds to S902 and N918 of BoNT/A1 (Fig. 2b,c and Table 2).
The  dominant contribution of the CR1 heavy chain in BoNT/A1 binding is  from CDR H2 of CR1.

The H2 also interacts with the b27-b28 loop of BoNT/A1 with  hydrogen bonds between T58 and Y57 of CR1 with K1056, D1058,  G1059 and R1061 of BoNT/A1 (Fig. 2b,c and Table 2).
In addition,  the H3 of CR1 contributes to the binding with a hydrogen  bond between D102 of CR1 with the H1064 of BoNT/A1 and  van der Waals contacts between Y101 of CR1 with F917, L919 and  T1063 of BoNT/A1.
  To determine the functional epitopes of AR2 and CR1, BoNT/A1  HC was displayed on the surface of yeast.
A BoNT/A2 HC was also  displayed on yeast by mutating all seven BoNT/A1 amino acids in the  structural epitope, as well as three nearby residues, K903, Q915 and  K923, to the BoNT/A2 residue.
The affinity of AR2 and CR1 Fab for  yeast-displayed BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 HC was comparable to the  solution KD of their respective IgG for BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 (CR1  Fab KD  43 pM and 2.5 nM for BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 yeast  displayed; 2.5 pM and 1.73 nM for IgG in solution: AR2 Fab KD  73  pM and 100 nM for BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 yeast displayed;  6.8 pM and 201 nM for IgG in solution).
Each amino acid side  chain in the structural epitope of BoNT/A1 or BoNT/A2 was truncated by mutation to alanine, the KD of the yeast-displayed alanine  mutant measured for CR1 and AR2 Fab, and the values used to  determine the DDG.
  The functional epitopes of AR2 and CR1 for BoNT/A1 were  virtually identical (Table 2) and were smaller than the structural  epitope, with only seven toxin side chains having energetically  important interactions with the antibodies (N918, L919, E920, F953,  D1062, T1063 and H1064).
The most energetically important interaction is with H1064; truncation of the H1064 side chain to alanine  Table 2 Direct contacts between CR1 Fab and BoNT/A1 and the energetics of AR2 and CR1 binding to BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2  Van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges Energetics of toxin side chain binding to Fab DDG upon side chain mutation to alanine  BoNT/A1 residue/atom CR1 residue/atom distance (A) AR2 Fab BoNT/A1 CR1 Fab BoNT/A1 AR2 Fab BoNT/A2 CR1 Fab BoNT/A2  Ser 902/Asp OG Y31H OH/3.68 A 0.12 0.23 0.49 0.18  Lys 903/Arg No contact 0.54 0.29 0.02 1.01  Gln 915/Lys No contact 0.10 0.52 0.31 0.32  Phe 917/Ile Y101H 0.05 0.42 0.95 0.49  Asn 918 O Y33H OH/3.25 A 2.16 0.89 0.30 1.4  Leu 919 Y33H, Y101H 2.28 2.59 0.41 0.57  Glu 920 S52H, G54H, S56H, Y57H 2.77 2.84 0.50 1.74  Glu 920 N D53H OD1/3.06 A   D53H OD2/3.05 A   Glu 920 OE1 S52H OG/2.56 A   S56H N/3.41 A   G54H N/3.03 A   Lys 923/Thr No contact 0.30 0.14 0.62 0.29  Phe 953 Y32L 3.34 4.06 1.53 2.64  Asn 954/Ser E97L 0.15 0.10 0.66 0.13  Asn 954 OD1 N96L ND2/3.00 A   Ser 955 OG/Lys E97L OE2/2.77 A 0.08 0 0.5 0.55  E97L OE1/3.09 A   Ile 956 E97L 0.07 0.01 ND ND  Ser 957/Asn No contact   0.008 0.2  Lys 1056 Y57H 0.01 0.03 ND ND  Lys 1056 NZ Y57H OH/3.41 A   Asp 1058 OD1 Y57H OH/2.57 A 0.03 0.01 ND ND  Arg 1061 Y59H 0.29 0.82 0.58 0.70  Arg 1061 NH1 T58H O/3.20 A   Arg 1061 NH2 T58H O/2.87 A   Asp 1062 OD1 Y32L OH/2.56 A 2.34 2.53 0.14 0.10  Thr 1063 /Pro F100L, Y101H 2.37 1.62 0.24 0.93  His 1064 /Arg Y32L, G95L, F36L 7.42 7.32 4.44 4.91  His 1064 ND1 D102H OD1/2.88 A   D102H OD2/2.73 A   His 1064 NE2 N96L O/3.42 A   G95L O/2.68 A   Arg 1065 Y32L ND ND ND ND  Arg 1065 NH1 Y32L OH/2.77 A   Gly 1292 G33L, S71L ND ND ND ND  Arg 1294/ Ser NH2 S35L OG/3.29 A 0.39 0.30 ND ND  BoNT residues in and near the structural epitope of the CR1-BoNT/A1 complex are listed, with the type of contact indicated.

  110 VOLUME 25 NUMBER 1 JANUARY 2007 NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY  ARTICLES   2007 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnologyreduces affinity of AR2 and CR1 for BoNT/A1 by more than 200,000-  fold (Table 2).
  Structural and functional basis of antibody cross-reactivity  The identification of the BoNT/A epitope provides a means to  understand the basis of engineered antibody cross-reactivity.
BoNT/  A1 and BoNT/A2 differ by seven amino acids in the structural epitope  (Fig. 3a,b and Table 2).
Only two of these amino acids, T1063  and H1064 in the b35-b36, have an energetically important role in  antibody binding to BoNT/A1 (Figs. 3, 4 and  Table 2).
In the BoNT/A2 subtype, these  residues are mutated to proline and arginine,  respectively.
A remarkable feature regarding  CR1 cross-reactivity is that residue H1064 is  deeply buried in the interface of the CR1 L3  and H3, forming intimate interactions with  L1, L3 and H3 CDRs of CR1 (Fig. 3b (iii).
  Truncation of the H1064 side chain to alanine  reduces the binding affinity of AR2 and CR1 for BoNT/A1 more than  200,000-fold to 410 mM. Modeling analysis, however, indicates that  the H1064R mutation in BoNT/A2 would not perturb the interactions  seen in the BoNT/A1 CR1 complex, as the arginine could also pi-stack  with F36 and interact with D102 of H3 of CR1 (Fig. 3b (iv).
This is  supported by the fact that inserting the mutation H1064R into the  BoNT/A1 HC reduces its affinity for AR2 and CR1 only 41- and 188-  fold, respectively, whereas inserting the mutation H1064A reduces its  affinity for AR2 and CR1 41,000 and 4200,000 fold, respectively.

  NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 25 NUMBER 1 JANUARY 2007 111  ARTICLES   2007 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnologyThus, although the toxin has an amino acid substitution in the  most energetically important residue in the center of the combining  site, the difference can be accommodated without entirely losing  antibody binding.
  The engineered increase in affinity of CR1 for BoNT/A2 must result  from the amino acid differences between the AR2 and CR1 H1 loops:  S30K, D31Y and H32D (Fig. 3c).
In this region, it must be possible to  change the amino acid side chains of AR2 without losing binding  affinity for BoNT/A1 in a way that picks up new binding energy for  BoNT/A2.
The H1 mutations interact with toxin residues that differ  between BoNT/A1 and A2, S902D and K903R.
A single interaction is  observed in this region between Y31 of the CR1 H1 and S902 of  BoNT/A1.
The structure of AR2-BoNT/A1 reveals that the D31 of AR2  does not form this hydrogen bond with S902 of BoNT/A1.
For either  CR1 or AR2, this interaction does not contribute to the energetics of  binding (Fig. 4 and Table 2).
As a result, it is possible to mutate these  residues in AR2 without losing binding affinity for BoNT/A1.
In  BoNT/A2, the hydrogen bond between CR1 Y31 and D902 of BoNT/  A2 is maintained, although this interaction still does not appear to be  energetically important (Fig. 4 and Table 2).
In the BoNT/A2-AR2  complex, however, D31 of AR2 would likely electrostatically clash with  D902 of BoNT/A2 (Fig. 3c), contributing to a reduction in affinity for  BoNT/A2.
This is supported by the fact that the mutation D902A  increases the affinity of AR2 for BoNT/A2 HC (Table 2, negative DDG  of 0.49).
In addition, in the CR1-BoNT/A2 interaction, an energetically important interaction appears between CR1 H1 and BoNT/A2  R903 that does not exist for AR2-BoNT/A2 (Fig. 4 and Table 2,  DDG  +1.01 for CR1 and R903A versus DDG  0.02 for AR2 and  R903A).
The structural basis for this interaction obtained from our  modeling suggests that R903 of BoNT/A2  could form a salt bridge with D53 of CR1,  as well as forming additional hydrogen bonding interactions with S921 of BoNT/A2  (Fig. 3c).
The D31 of AR2 and D902 of  BoNT/A2, however, would likely prevent this  interaction in the AR2-BoNT/A2 complex as  they are precariously close to the aliphatic end  of R903 of BoNT/A2.
This unfavorable interaction would be expected to result in an  alternate conformation of R903.
To summarize, AR2 H1 residues can be mutated without  loss of affinity for BoNT/A1 as they do not  make energetically important contacts with  BoNT/A1.
In CR1, mutation of these residues  eliminates an electrostatics clash between AR2  and BoNT/A2 and generates a new energetic  interaction with R903.
  DISCUSSION  The affinity of CR2 scFv for BoNT/A2 was  increased 1,250-fold while maintaining high  affinity binding for wild-type BoNT/A1.
The  increase in cross-reactivity of CR2 equals the  largest increases in affinity reported for protein-binding antibodies of a single specificity  using any technique15,16.
The range over  which the increase in affinity for BoNT/A2  occurs (109 nM87 pM) improves the affinity  from a clinically useless value to one that  would be considered high affinity for a therapeutic antibody.
Only mutations in H1 and  in the framework region led to considerable increases in crossreactivity, even though mutations were introduced into four primary  antigen-binding loops (H1, H2, H3 and L1).
Although the increase in  cross-reactivity was achieved without a crystal structure, the combination of functional studies with the co-crystal structure of CR1-BoNT/  A1 and AR2-BoNT/A1 illustrates the basis for increasing crossreactivity.
Antibody amino acids tolerating mutations played no  energetic role in binding to wild-type BoNT/A1; mutating these  antibody amino acids led to no loss of binding to wild-type BoNT/  A1, eliminated energetically unfavorable interactions with BoNT/A2,  and established new energetically favorable interactions with BoNT/  A2.
This can occur only in interface areas where there are differences  in antigen sequence yet no energetically important interactions  between antibody and wild-type antigen.
This situation may be  present only in a focal region of contact between antibody and antigen  and may explain why mutating amino acids in other loops, or using  structure-guided mutagenesis, did not increase cross-reactivity.
The  mechanism for enhanced cross-reactivity described here is also different, and perhaps more specific than polyreactivity owing to conformational diversity of the antibody-combining site17 or multiple  binding modes18.
  Introducing mutations specifically into antigen-binding loops, as  done here, has theoretical advantages over random mutagenesis.
  First, it allows a thorough, controlled and systematic diversification  of the antibody toxin interface and permits more straightforward combination of mutations to achieve additivity15,16.
Second,  mutations are introduced into one of the regions of the antibody  (CDRs) where mutations are naturally introduced19,20.
Whereas  somatic mutation also introduces mutations into the framework  AR2-BoNT/A1 AR2-BoNT/A2  CR1-BoNT/A1 CR1-BoNT/A2  G 5 0 5  Figure 4 Energetics of binding of BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 to AR2 and CR1.
The energetic contribution  to binding of each BoNT/A1 or BoNT/A2 amino acid side chain in or near the structural epitope to AR2  and CR1 was determined as described in the text and as shown in Table 2.
The calculated DDG are  color coded from red to blue as shown.
Amino acids contributing the greatest energy to binding are red,  those with no effect are white and those whose truncation to alanine increases binding affinity are blue.
  112 VOLUME 25 NUMBER 1 JANUARY 2007 NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY  ARTICLES   2007 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnologyregions, the location of mutations is not random21.
Random mutation  may generate substitutions outside of these regions that could  destabilize the antibody or increase immunogenicity22.
Despite these  theoretical advantages, however, CR2 resulted from mutations  randomly introduced into CR1 during the PCR process.
Thus there  is probably a role for using random mutagenesis in a systematic  approach to increasing cross-reactivity.
Modeling the framework mutations of CR2 into the co-crystal structure, however,  provided no insight into the mechanism by which these mutations  increased cross-reactivity.
In other studies, framework mutations  increased affinity indirectly by affecting the equilibrium adopted  among different conformational forms of the antibody23 or by  precisely positioning contact residue side chains for optimal electrostatic, hydrogen bonding or van der Waals interactions24.
  There are reports in which protein engineering approaches have  been used to change the specificity of antibodies to haptens; however,  most of these efforts have sought to narrow rather than broaden  specificity2528.
Where increases in affinity for related antigens have  been reported, there were considerable decreases in affinity for the  cognate antigen29.
Despite this, there is a therapeutic and diagnostic  need for broadening antibody cross-reactivity.
In the case of botulism,  the existence of multiple subtypes requires antibodies with broad  cross-reactivity for diagnosis and treatment9.
In viral diseases, such as  HIV, SARS and hepatitis B, naturally occurring mutants can cause  false negative results in diagnostic immunoassays30.
This work shows  that dramatic increases in cross-reactivity of protein-binding antibodies can be achieved and suggests a general approach to accomplish  this.
In the absence of a co-crystal structure, diversity should be widely  introduced to assure mutagenesis of antibody regions unimportant for  wild-type antigen binding and which interact with residues that differ  between antigens.
Use of a highly discriminative co-selection strategy,  as employed here using yeast display, is essential to assure isolation of  the most cross-reactive antibodies.
  The increase in cross-reactivity obtained in this study results in a  more than 100-fold increase in BoNT/A2 neutralization when CR2 is  combined with the human BoNT/A antibodies RAZ1 and 2G11,  compared to the combination with the parental AR2 mAb (T. Smith  & J.D.M., unpublished data).
As a result, the antibody generated from  this study, CR2, is being manufactured along with RAZ1 and 2G11 for  use as an antibody combination to treat botulism.
Although formal  toxicology studies have not yet been performed on the mAb combination, all three mAbs are human or humanized.
Thus they should have  substantially fewer side effects than equine antitoxin6.
With the  growing number of BoNT subtypes being discovered that have been  primarily created by nature, or could be created through genetic  engineering, it is critical that immune system technologies be adapted  to target multiple subtypes at one time.
The strategy demonstrated  here provides a route for broadening the cross-reactivity of such  mAbs.
This approach will have substantial importance for generation  of detection and therapeutic antibodies to BoNT as well as other  antigens involved in disease processes.

Yeast strain EBY100 (GAL1-  AGA1::URA3 ura3-52 trp1 leu2D1 his3D200 pep4::HIS2 prb1D1.6R can1 GAL)  was maintained in YPD (1% wt/vol yeast extract, 2% wt/vol peptone, 2%  wt/vol dextrose) medium.
EBY100 transfected with pYD2 was selected on  selective growth dextrose casamino acids (SD-CAA) medium (0.1M sodium  phosphate, 0.7% wt/vol yeast nitrogen base, 0.006% wt/vol Leucine, 2% wt/vol  dextrose, 0.5% casamino acids).

Pure BoNT/A1  andBoNT/A2 were purchased from Metabiologics.
Recombinant  purified BoNT/A binding domain (HC) was prepared as previously described31.
  B4 (ref. 9) and SV5 (ref. 12) antibodies were purified from Chinese  hamster ovary (CHO) cells and hybridoma supernatants, respectively, using  Protein G and directly labeled with Alexa-488, using a kit provided  by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes).

  Creation of a library of H1 mutants of AR2 scFv.
A spiked oligonucleotide  (H1Rev) was used to introduce mutations into five amino acids located in the  H1 loop of the AR2 scFv as previously described (Table 1)12.
The oligonucleotide was designed to have a bias for 25% or 50% wild-type amino acid at each  position, depending on codon usage.
Library size was 2.0  105 transformants,  with 27% of the unselected library expressing scFv as determined by staining  with SV5 antibody and 3.65% binding BoNT/A1.
  Construction of pYD vectors for creating H2, H3 or L1 mutant libraries of  CR1.
Primers H2ForSphI, H3ForSphI or L1ForSphI and Gap 3 were designed  NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 25 NUMBER 1 JANUARY 2007 113  ARTICLES   2007 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnologyto clone different segments of the 3 end of AR2 or CR1 scFv32 into pYD2  (ref. 12) by PCR and add a 5 SphI restriction site.
CR1 scFv cloned into pYD2  was used as the template for 30 cycles of PCR with 50 1C annealing temperature  using Pfu polymerase.
The pYD2 vector was digested with Nco1 and NotI.  Vector and one of the three PCR products were gel purified and mixed together  to transform yeast EBY100 by gap repair12.
The presence of the correct insert in  each of the three resulting vectors (pYDH2, pYDH3 or pYDL1) was confirmed  by PCR and DNA sequencing.
Plasmid DNA was extracted from yeast containing each of the three plasmids and was used to transform E. coli.
One Shot  TOP10 chemically competent cells, following the manufacturers instructions  (Invitrogen).
Each of the three plasmids was purified from TOP10 for use in  library construction.
  Creation of libraries of H2, H3 or L1 mutants of CR1.
Libraries of sitedirected mutants were constructed using parsimonious mutagenesis as previously described15,33.
Briefly, partially degenerate primers (H2Rev, H3Rev and  L1Rev) were designed to introduce mutations into five amino acids located in  either the H2, H3 or L1 antigen-binding loops of the scFv (see Table 1)13,34.
  The oligonucleotides were designed to have a bias for 25% or 50% wild-type  amino acid at each position, depending on codon usage.
The degenerate  primers and the primer Gap 5 were used to amplify by PCR the corresponding  5 end of the CR1 scFv gene in pYD2, and the three PCR products were gel  purified.
The remainder of the scFv gene was already cloned into pYD2  (pYD2H, pYD3H and pYD1L), as described above.
Gel purified scFv gene  repertoires (5 mg) were combined with the appropriate vector DNA (pYD2H,  pYD3H or pYD1L, 10 mg digested with Nco1 and Sph1) and the DNA mixtures  used to transform EBY100 using gap repair35.
Library sizes were 3.4, 3.6 and  4.7  108 and expression frequencies and BoNT/A1 binding frequencies were  51%/8.9%, 53%/21.8% and 62%/7% for the unselected H2, H3 and L1  libraries, respectively.
  Selection of mutant scFv libraries.
For library selection, an amount of yeast at  least ten times larger than the library size, or the sort output from the previous  round, was washed and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting  (FACS) buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 1% BSA) to which the desired concentration of  pure BoNT/A was added.
Selections were generally performed after allowing the  reaction mixture to come to equilibrium.
The volume for incubation of yeast  with toxin was chosen to ensure that toxin was in at least a fivefold excess over  the number of scFvs (assuming 5  105 scFv/yeast36).
Incubation times were  chosen to ensure that the reaction had come to at least 90% of equilibrium,  using the formula:  t   ln1  Y  kon  C + koff  where t  time, Y  fraction of equilibrium desired (in this case 0.9), kon   association rate constant, koff  dissociation rate constant and C  antigen  concentration.
For the calculation, the association and dissociation rate  constants for AR2 IgG binding to BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 were used.
For  co-incubations with BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 the result giving the longer  incubation time was used.
  For selection of cross-reactive antibodies binding both BoNT/A1 and BoNT/  A2, BoNT/A concentrations for the five rounds of sorting the AR2 mutant  library were 10 nM BoNT/A1, 20 nM BoNT/A2, 2 nM BoNT/A2, 1 nM BoNT/  A2 and 0.4 nM BoNT/A2.
For selection of CR1 mutant libraries, toxin  concentrations for the six rounds of selection were: 1 nM BoNT/A1, 0.4 nM  BoNT/A2, 0.1 nM BoNT/A2, 0.05 nM BoNT/A2, 0.025 nM BoNT/A1 HC plus  0.025 nM BoNT/A2 and for the final round of sorting 0.0075 nM BoNT/A1 HC  plus 0.01 nM BoNT/A2.
After incubation with toxin, cells were washed with  ice-cold FACS buffer and resuspended in a 1:200 dilution of secondary  antibodies as follows: (i) for BoNT/A1 or BoNT/A2 staining, 3D12-647 was  added to detect toxin binding and SV5-488 was added to quantify scFv  expression; (ii) for BoNT/A2 plus BoNT/A1 HC staining, mAb B4 (binds  BoNT/A1 HC) followed by goat anti-human IgG-PE (R-Phycoerythrin F(ab)2  from Jackson ImmunoReasearch) was used to detect BoNT/A1 binding, mAb  7C1-647 (binds BoNT/A LC, not HC) was added to detect BoNT/A2 binding,  and SV5-488 was added to quantify scFv expression.
Cells were incubated for  30 min with secondary antibodies at 4 1C, washed once with FACS buffer,  resuspended in 0.22 ml of FACS buffer and sorted on a FACSAria (BectonDickinson).
Typically 0.1% to 1% of yeast exhibiting both scFv expression and  toxin binding were gated for collection from the single-toxin stains.
For the  dual-toxin stains, the brightest population for BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 binding  was gated, the gates intersected and only yeast in both gates collected.
Collected  cells were grown in SD-CAA medium and used for the next round of sorting  after induction in SG-CAA medium.
  Measurement of yeast-displayed scFv affinity for BoNT/A. Quantitative  equilibrium binding was determined using yeast-displayed scFv and flow  cytometry as described previously37.
In general, six to eight different concentrations of pure BoNT/A were used spanning a range of concentrations from  ten times above to ten times below the KD.
Incubation volumes and number of  yeast stained were chosen to keep the number of antigen molecules in fivefold  excess above the number of scFv, assuming 5.0  105 scFv/yeast.
Incubation  times were chosen based on anticipated times to equilibrium calculated using  approximations of the anticipated association rate constant (kon) and dissociation rate constant (koff) (see above).
For the higher affinity scFv, this was as  long as 1824 h. Binding of BoNT/A to yeast-displayed scFv was detected using  a 1:200 dilution of 1 mg/ml mAb binding a nonoverlapping BoNT/A epitope  (3D12) labeled with Alexa-647.
To measure the antibody-toxin affinity constant  (KD) within the surface display context, only the scFv displaying yeast (SV5  binding) were included in the analysis by co-staining with SV5-Alexa-488.
Each  KD was determined in triplicate, three separate inductions and measurements.
  Generation of IgG from scFv.
IgGs were generated from the genes encoding  CR1 and CR2 scFv as previously described8  .
Briefly, genes encoding scFv VH  were amplified using PCR from their respective pYD2 vectors with the primer  pairs C25 VH5 and A2B4 VH3 for CR1 and CR2.
The VH genes from CR1 and  CR2 were digested with MluI and NheI and ligated into N5KG1containing the  AR2 light chain variable region gene.
Clones containing the correct VH were  identified by DNA sequencing and vector DNA was used to transfect CHO  DG44 cells by electroporation.
Stable cell lines were established by selection in  G418 and expanded into 1-liter spinner flasks.
Supernatant containing IgG was  collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration and purified on Protein G (Pharmacia).
IgG purity was assessed by native and denaturing SDS-PAGE and  concentration determined by absorbance at 280 nm.
Yields after purification  were B20, 25 and 50 mg/l of culture supernatant at a cell density of 5  105  /ml  for AR2, CR1 and CR2, respectively.
  Measurement of solution phase affinity at equilibrium.
Equilibrium binding  studies were conducted at 23 1C using a KinExA 3000 flow fluorimeter to  quantify the free BoNT/A at equilibrium using varying concentrations of  antibody.
Studies of reaction mixtures were performed in PBS, pH 7.4, with  1 mg/ml BSA and 0.02% sodium azide as a preservative.
Antibody was serially  diluted into a constant concentration of BoNT/A sufficient to produce a  reasonable signal, where the antibody concentration was varied from less than  0.1 to greater than tenfold above the value of the apparent KD.
The BoNT/A  concentrations were no more than fourfold above the KD to ensure a KD  controlled experiment.
Samples were allowed to reach equilibrium for as long  as 2 d, then each of the 12 dilutions were passed over a flow cell with a 4-mm  column of Azlactone beads (Sapidyne Instruments) covalently coated with the  corresponding antibody to capture the free BoNT/A. Passing an Alexa-647  labeled BoNT/A antibody binding a nonoverlapping epitope over the beads  produced a signal relative to the amount of free BoNT/A bound to the beads.
  All data points were run in duplicate and sample volume varied from 4 to 25 ml  depending on antibody affinity.
The equilibrium titration data were fit to a 1:1  reversible binding model using KinExA Pro Software (Version 1.0.2; Sapidyne  Instruments) to determine the KD38.
  Measurement of solution phase kinetics.
The kon of all antibody/antigen  complexes was measured using the following direct method.
Antibody and  BoNT/A were mixed together, then 12 ml of solution was passed over a freshly  packed flow cell with antibody-coated beads39.
Passing an Alexa-647labeled  BoNT/A antibody binding a nonoverlapping epitope over the beads produced a  signal relative to the amount of free BoNT/A bound to the beads.
No fewer  than ten samples were sequentially analyzed, with the time between samples  B500 s. The exponential decrease in the concentration of free BoNT/A as a  114 VOLUME 25 NUMBER 1 JANUARY 2007 NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY  ARTICLES   2007 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnologyfunction of time was fit to a standard bimolecular rate equation using the  KinExA Pro Software to determine the kon.
The koff was calculated from the  product of kon  KD38.
  Protein expression and purification for X-ray crystallography.
Fab fragments  were prepared from purified IgG using immobilized papain (Pierce Biotechnology).
Briefly, IgG was concentrated to B12 mg/ml in 20 mM phosphate, 10  mM EDTA pH 7.0, then added to an equal volume of immobilized papain resin  (washed with 20 mM phosphate, 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM cysteine pH 7.0) and  incubated at 37 1C for 16 h. The immobilized papain was removed by  centrifugation at 2,000g, and the digest supernatant was dialyzed against  10 mM MES pH 5.6.
The Fab fragment was separated from undigested IgG  and FC fragments by cation exchange chromatography (HiTrap High Performance Sulfopropyl column, GE Healthcare) using a salt gradient.
The purified  Fab was then dialyzed against PBS and stored at 4 1C.
  The ammonium sulfateprecipitated BoNT/A1 was collected by centrifugation at 16,000g and dissolved in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and 50 mM NaCl, as  previously described40.
A 1:1.2 molar ratio of BoNT/A1 and CR1 Fab was  mixed to form the BoNT/A1-CR1 complex followed by a final gel-filtration  chromatography step.
The protein complex was then concentrated to 7 mg/ml  by centrifugal ultrafiltration.
  Crystallization and data collection.
The BoNT/A1-CR1 complex was crystallized by the nanodroplet vapor diffusion method at a temperature of 297 K by  mixing 100 nl of 7 mg/ml BoNT/A1-CR1 solution (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50  mM NaCl) with 100 nl of the reservoir solution containing 8% PEG 20000, 8%  PEG 550 MME, 200 mM calcium acetate and 100 mM sodium acetate at pH  5.5.
Plate-shaped crystals were transferred to mother liquor solutions of  increasing concentrations of PEG 550 MME (up to 20%) before harvesting  and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen.
  Diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of 1.000 A at the Stanford  Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) on beam line 11-1 and at the  Advanced Photon Source (APS) on beam line GM-CAT.
The SSRL data set  was collected at 100 K using an ADSC q310 CCD detector, whereas APS data set  used a MARmosaic 300 detector.
Data were integrated, reduced and scaled  using HKL2000 (ref. 41).
The BoNT/A1-CR1 crystal was indexed in the  orthorhombic space group P212121 at a resolution of 2.6 A , whereas  the BoNT/A1-AR2 indexed as P21 at a resolution of 3.8 A ; data statistics are  summarized in Supplementary Table 2 online.
  Structure determination and refinement.
The BoNT/A1-CR1 structure was  determined by molecular replacement using the BoNT/A1 structure (PDB code  3BTA40) and the parent Fab structure HuC25 (S. LaPorte, R. Stroud and J.D.M.,  unpublished data) with 99% identity to CR1 as the search models with the  program MolRep42.
The BoNT/A1-CR1 model was manually built with Coot43.
  Structure refinement was performed using REFMAC544.
The progress of the  model refinement was monitored by cross-validation Rfree, which was computed from a randomly assigned test set comprising 5% of the data.
Refinement  statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 online.
No electron  density was observed for residues 433-452 and 623-626 of BoNT/A1.
  Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the model was accomplished using  Molprobity45 and the AutoDepInputTool (http://deposit.pdb.org/adit/).
  The BoNT/A1-AR2 structure was solved using the BoNT/A1-CR1 structure  as a search model.
Figures were prepared with PYMOL (DeLano Scientific).
  Atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors of BoNT/A1-CR1  BoNT/A1-AR2 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the  accession numbers 2NYY and 2NZ9 respectively.
Residue numbering of  BoNT/A1 and A2 were assigned as found in GenBank under the accession  numbers AF488749 and X73423.
  Sequence alignment and structural analysis.
Amino acid sequences of BoNT/  A subtypes A1 and A2 were aligned using Clustal W46.
A gap opening penalty  of 10 and gap extension penalty of 0.2 were used with the Gonnet matrix.
The  alignment figure was prepared with the Clustal W alignment using ESPript  using DSSP secondary structure assignments47.
Structure superpositions and  root-mean square deviation (r.m.s. deviation) calculations were carried out  using the program TOP48.
Hydrogen bonding, salt bridges and van der Waals  contacts were identified with the program CONTACTS44.
Buried surface areas  were calculated with NOC (http://noc.ibp.ac.cn/index.htm) with a 1.4 A probe  radius and standard van der Waals radii.
The S902E, K903R, T1063P and  H1064R changes found in BoNT/A2 were modeled by PYMOL.
  Construction of yeast-displayed BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 HC domains.
  Primers HCFor and HCRev were designed to amplify a synthetic BoNT/A1  HC gene fragment by PCR49, adding the restriction sites NcoI and NotI to the 5  and 3 ends, respectively.
The PCR product and pYD2 were digested with NcoI  and NotI, ligated and the ligation mixture used to transform EBY100.
Clones  containing the correct insert were confirmed by DNA sequencing to yield  pYD2/BoNT/A1 HC.
A BoNT/A2 HC was constructed by mutating all seven  BoNT/A1 HC amino acids in the structural epitope of CR1-BoNT/A1 (S902D,  F917I, N954S, S955K, S957N, T1063P and H1064R) as well as three nearby  residues, K903R, Q915K and K923T, to their BoNT/A2 counterparts.
This  approach was chosen, rather than changing all 45 amino acids that differ  between BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 HC, to minimize the probability that the  BoNT/A2 HC might not display on yeast well and to simplify construction.
  Construction of the BoNT/A2 HC was accomplished using PCR to introduce  the BoNT/A2 residues into the relevant BoNT/A1 HC gene fragment and a  combination of gap repair and restriction digestion to combine the gene  fragments.
Clones containing the correct insert were confirmed by DNA  sequencing to yield pYD2/BoNT/A2 HC.
  Construction of yeast-displayed BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 HC alanine  mutants.
Genes encoding botulinum neurotoxin HC fragments in pYD2 with  a single alanine substitution were constructed by using PCR and gap repair as  described above for creation of BoNT/A2 HC.
Insertion of the correct alanine  mutation was confirmed by resequencing the entire BoNT/A HC gene.
After  induction, mutant BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 HC had display levels resulting in at  least a 1.5 log shift when stained with SV5-Alexa-488, comparable to the levels  of wild-type BoNT/A HC display.
  Measurement of the affinity of CR1 and AR2 Fab fragments for yeastdisplayed BoNT/A HC mutants.
The dissociation equilibrium constants (KD)  of AR2 and CR1 Fab fragments for wild-type and alanine mutants of yeastdisplayed BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 HC were measured by flow cytometry on a  LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
First, EBY100 yeast cultures harboring  the pYD2/HC wild type or the pYD2/HC alanine mutant plasmids were grown  and induced as described above for yeast-displayed scFv.
Aliquots of B1  105  induced yeast cells (B0.005 OD600 ml1) were washed in FACS buffer and  incubated with dilutions (ranging from 15 mM to 16 pM) of AR2 or CR1 Fab  fragments such that the KD would be spanned by at least fivefold, where  possible.
Incubation volumes were chosen to ensure that a tenfold molar excess  of the antibody (ligand) over the displayed moiety (HC) would be maintained.
  For this purpose, it was assumed that B105 HC copies were displayed on the  yeast surface.
Incubation with AR2 or CR1 Fab was allowed to proceed for 4 h  at 23 1C.
Cells were then washed in FACS buffer and resuspended in  allophycocyanin-conjugated Fab-specific goat-anti-human F(ab)2 at 1:200  dilution in FACS buffer.
To accurately determine the KD of AR2 and CR1  Fab fragments within the surface display context, we included only HC  displaying yeast in the analysis by staining with SV5 (Alexa-488) mAb50.
  Calculation of the change in free energy of binding of BoNT/A1 and BoNT/  A2 alanine mutants.
For each BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 HC alanine mutation,  the change of free energy (DDGmut-wt) between the BoNT/A1 HC alanine (Ala)  mutant relative to that of the wild type or between the BoNT/A2 HC Ala mutant  relative to that of the wild-type (wt) BoNT/A2 HC was calculated using the  following standard formula and using the previously measured KD constants:  DDGmutwt  RT lnKD;Ala=KD;wt  Note: Supplementary information is available on the Nature Biotechnology website.
