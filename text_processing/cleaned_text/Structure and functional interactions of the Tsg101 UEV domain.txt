In performing  these functions, Tsg101 binds both ubiquitin (Ub) and  the PTAP tetrapeptide `late domain' motif located  within the viral Gag protein.
These interactions  are mediated by the N-terminal domain of Tsg101,  which belongs to the catalytically inactive ubiquitin  E2 variant (UEV) family.
We now report the structure of Tsg101 UEV and chemical shift mapping  of the Ub and PTAP binding sites.
Tsg101 UEV  resembles canonical E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes,  but has an additional N-terminal helix, an extended  b-hairpin that links strands 1 and 2, and lacks the two  C-terminal helices normally found in E2 enzymes.
  PTAP-containing peptides bind in a hydrophobic cleft  exposed by the absence of the C-terminal helices,  whereas ubiquitin binds in a novel site surrounding  the b-hairpin.
These studies provide a structural  framework for understanding how Tsg101 mediates  the proteinprotein interactions required for HIV  budding and VPS.
  Keywords: late domain/Tsg101/ubiquitin E2 variant/  vacuolar protein sorting/virus budding  Introduction  Human Tsg101 has recently been identied as the  functional receptor required for budding of the enveloped  human immunodeciency (HIV) and Ebola viruses  (Garrus et al., 2001; Martin-Serrano et al., 2001;  VerPlank et al., 2001; Demirov et al., 2002). Tsg101 is  recruited to the sites of virus budding by binding to a  P(S/T)AP tetrapeptide motif (the `late domain') located  within the p6 region of HIV Gag and the Ebola Vp40  matrix structural proteins.
Once there, Tsg101 appears to  recruit other cellular factors that help to complete the  budding process (Garrus et al., 2001; Martin-Serrano et al.,  2001).
In the absence of Tsg101, the nal membrane  ssion step(s) fails and HIV release is arrested at a very  late stage, in which the assembled viral particles remain  attached to the plasma membrane (and to one another) via  thin membrane stalks (Garrus et al., 2001).
  The direct interaction between Tsg101 and the PTAP  late domain motifs on the viral structural proteins is  mediated by the N-terminal ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV)  domain of Tsg101 (Garrus et al., 2001; Martin-Serrano  et al., 2001; VerPlank et al., 2001), whereas the remaining  C-terminal two-thirds of Tsg101 interacts with other  proteins (Figure 1A).
Like other UEV domains, Tsg101  UEV shows signicant sequence similarity to E2 ubiquitin  ligases but is unable to catalyze ubiquitin transfer as it  lacks the active site cysteine that forms the transient  thioester bond with the C-terminus of ubiquitin (Ub)  (Koonin and Abagyan, 1997; Ponting et al., 1997)  (Figure 1B).
Nevertheless, at least some UEVs have  retained the ability to bind Ub, and appear to act either as  cofactors in ubiquitylation reactions, or as ubiquitin sensors  (Hofmann and Pickart, 1999; Garrus et al., 2001; Katzmann  et al., 2001; VanDemark et al., 2001; VerPlank et al.,  2001).
As discussed below, UEV domains also frequently  contain other protein recognition motifs, and may generally  serve to couple protein and Ub binding functions to  facilitate the formation of multiprotein complexes.
  Tsg101 normally functions in the cellular vacuolar  protein sorting (VPS) pathway, which coordinates the  sorting of membrane-associated proteins through a series  of endosomal compartments for eventual delivery to the  lysosome (vacuole in yeast) (Dupre et al., 2001; Hicke,  2001; Piper and Luzio, 2001).
A key decision-making step  in this pathway occurs when membrane patches containing  proteins destined for destruction bud as small vesicles into  the lumen of the late endosome, creating an organelle  called the `multivesicular body' (MVB).
Subsequent  fusion of the MVB with the lysosome delivers these  vesicles and all associated cargo to the lumen of the  lysosome, where they are degraded by proteolysis.
In  contrast, proteins that remain in the limiting membrane of  MVB are delivered to the limiting membrane of lysosomes  and therefore escape degradation.
  Recent work, particularly in the yeast system, has  revealed that Tgs101 (yeast Vps23p) performs an important role in selecting which proteins enter the MVB lumen  and which remain on the limiting membrane.
In yeast,  proteins destined for the lumen of the vacuole are  covalently modied with monoubiquitin and bound by a  350-kDa protein complex called ESCRT-I, which contains  the proteins Vps23p, Vps28p and Vps37p (Katzmann et al.,  2001).
ESCRT-I appears to function as the receptor and/or  sorting complex that selects ubiquitylated proteins for  incorporation into MVB vesicles.
Consistent with this  model, ESCRT-I can bind ubiquitin in vitro, and proteins  that would otherwise remain on the limiting membrane of  the late endosome are targeted into the lumen by addition  of a ubiquitylation signal (Katzmann et al., 2001).
  Although the human system is less well characterized,  Tsg101 also binds Ub in vitro (Garrus et al., 2001), forms a  Structure and functional interactions of the  Tsg101 UEV domain  The EMBO Journal Vol. 21 No. 10 pp. 23972406, 2002   European Molecular Biology Organization 2397soluble 350-kDa complex that includes Vps28 (Babst et al.,  2000; Bishop and Woodman, 2001), and is required for the  delivery of cathepsin D and endocytosed receptors to  the lysosome (Babst et al., 2000).
Thus, it appears that  ESCRT-I complex function is conserved from yeast to  humans, and that recognition of ubiquitylated proteins is  an important element in this function.
Unlike Tsg101,  however, Vps23p is not known to bind PTAP, and this may  be an important difference between the yeast and mammalian systems.
  Intriguingly, Ub also plays an important role in the  budding of retroviruses and other enveloped viruses (Harty  et al., 2000; Patnaik et al., 2000; Schubert et al., 2000;  Strack et al., 2000; Vogt, 2000; Harty et al., 2001;  Kikonyogo et al., 2001).
Although the precise role of Ub in  virus budding is not yet established, retroviruses contain  high Ub levels and 25% of Gag proteins in the virion are  monoubiquitylated (Putterman et al., 1990; Ott et al.,  1998, 2000).
Moreover, treatment of infected cells with  proteasome inhibitors, which decreases the intracellular  concentration of free Ub, also inhibits virus release at a  late stage (Schubert et al., 2000; Harty et al., 2001).
In  some cases, virus release can be partially rescued either by  overexpressing free Ub or by fusing Ub to the C-terminal  end of the viral Gag protein (Patnaik et al., 2000).
  Taken together, these observations have led us to  hypothesize that Tsg101 may perform similar roles in  facilitating virus particle budding from the plasma membrane and vesicle budding from the surface of MVB  (Patnaik et al., 2000; Garrus et al., 2001).
In this model,  the essential difference between viral budding and MVB  formation is that the PTAP signals on the viral proteins  cause Tsg101 to relocalize to the sites of virus budding on  the plasma membrane (Martin-Serrano et al., 2001).
Once  there, Tsg101 could recognize the viral proteins as `cargo'  to be incorporated into a budding vesicle and recruit the  additional MVB machinery necessary to complete the  budding process.
This model further suggests that HIV  Gag, like cellular proteins destined for the lumen of  the MVB, may undergo a cycle of ubiquitylation and  Fig. 1.

Although this  model remains speculative, it emphasizes the importance  of understanding how Tsg101 interacts with the PTAP  motif and with Ub.
We have therefore used nuclear  magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the  structure of the N-terminal UEV domain of Tsg101 and to  map the sites of Ub and PTAP binding.
  Results  Structure of the Tsg101 N-terminal UEV domain  
The Tsg101 UEV domain was dened as residues 1145  on the basis of preliminary sequence and NMR analyses  (see Materials and methods).
This construct (Tsg101  UEV) was expressed and puried, and its NMR solution  structure calculated from a total of 1861 NOE interproton  restraints, 76 hydrogen bonding restraints derived from  amide proton exchange protection experiments, and 146 f  and y dihedral angle restraints.
A stereo view of the  superposition of the 20 lowest-penalty structures is shown  in Figure 1C.
The structures superimpose over the mean  coordinate positions of all ordered residues of the domain  (4142) with root mean square deviations (r.m.s.ds) of  0.69 and 0.99 A for backbone and non-hydrogen atoms,  respectively (see Table I for structural statistics).
  The Tsg101 UEV fold is generally similar to E2 ligases  and to Mms2, the only other structurally characterized  UEV (Cook et al., 1992, 1993, 1997; Tong et al., 1997;  Worthylake et al., 1998; Huang et al., 1999; Jiang and  Basavappa, 1999; Zheng et al., 2000; Hamilton et al.,  2001; Moraes et al., 2001; VanDemark et al., 2001).
This  `E2 fold' consists of four helices packed against one side  of a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (Figure 2).
The  structural similarity is greatest around the central active  site regions of the proteins (residues 53138), where  Tsg101 UEV superimposes with hMms2 (Figure 2B) and  yUbc13 (a canonical E2; Figure 2C) with r.m.s.ds over  equivalent Ca positions of 2.22 and 1.97 A , respectively  (Figure 2D).
However, there are important differences  between Tsg101 UEV and other E2 and UEV proteins  outside of this region.
  Most signicantly, Tsg101 UEV lacks the two  C-terminal helices found in all structurally characterized  E2 proteins (Figure 2C and D, gray helices and green  arrow, respectively).
Mms2 also lacks these helices, and  sequence analyses suggest that they are missing from other  UEV domains (Koonin and Abagyan, 1997), indicating  that this is a general difference between UEV and  canonical E2 proteins (Figure 1B).
Although both Mms2  and Tsg101 UEV lack C-terminal helices, their structures  differ in this region because the C-terminal residues of  human and yeast Mms2 adopt extended, but ordered  conformations that occupy the same site as the nal E2  helix, whereas the equivalent residues in Tsg101 UEV  project off into solution and are disordered.
We considered  the possibility that these residues might be ordered in  longer Tsg101 constructs, and therefore analyzed proteins  that contained an additional 5 or 12 residues (Tsg1011150  and Tsg1011157, respectively), but could nd no evidence  for additional order in these longer constructs (see  Materials and methods).
Thus, the C-terminal end of  Tsg101 UEV differs from other known proteins with E2  folds and, as discussed below, this difference allows  Tsg101 UEV to bind PTAP-containing peptides.
  Tsg101 UEV differs from Mms2 and canonical E2  proteins in two additional ways: (i) Tsg101 contains two  N-terminal helices (colored red and orange in Figure 2A),  Table I.

  Tsg101 UEV domain structure  2399whereas Ubc13 and Mms2 contain only one (Figure 2D,  red arrow).
The general disposition of Tsg101 UEV helix 2  (orange) is similar to the N-terminal helices of Ubc13 and  Mms2, but is shifted slightly towards the center of the  sheet (Figure 2D).
(ii) The disposition of the rst two  b-strands in Tsg101 UEV is quite different from that of  Mms2 and Ubc13.
In Tsg101, strand 1 is twisted and  displaced toward the N-terminal end of strand 2, and these  two strands form an extended b-hairpin `tongue' that  projects 11 residues beyond the main body of the domain  and terminates in a type I turn (Figure 2D, blue arrow).
  This b-tongue is well dened by strong interstrand Ha-toHa and Ha-to-HN NOEs, as well as interstrand backbone  hydrogen bonds that protect the backbone amide protons  from rapid deuterium exchange (not shown).
As discussed  below, the extended b-tongue appears to be a functionally  important feature because it forms part of the Ub binding  site.
The disposition of the rst two b-strands also allows  extensive packing interactions between the Tsg101 UEV  N-terminal helices and the b-sheet, which are not possible  in Ubc13 or Mms2.
For example, the loop connecting  Tsg101 helices 1 and 2 inserts a tyrosine side-chain  hydroxyl (Tyr15) between strands 2 and 3, bridging the  hydrogen bonding interaction between the amide proton of  Met53 (strand 2) and the carboxyl oxygen of Lys76 (strand  3), thereby terminating the hydrogen bonding network of  the b-sheet.
  In summary, Tsg101 UEV is similar to canonical E2  enzymes in the hydrophobic core and `active site' regions,  but differs signicantly at both its N- and C-termini.
  Although some of these structural differences are shared  by the Tsg101 and Mms2 UEV domains (e.g. the lack of  C-terminal helices), it is apparent that Tsg101 has  diverged even further from the canonical E2 fold than  has Mms2.

  O.Pornillos et al.  2400Tsg101 UEV domain (Figure 3).
Our previous binding  studies showed that the Tsg101 UEV domain binds p6  with moderate afnity under physiological conditions  (Kd = 27 6 5 mM) (Garrus et al., 2001), and the interaction  is even tighter under the low salt and slightly acidic  conditions used in our NMR titration experiments (Kd =  4.3 6 1.6 mM at 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate  pH 6; Table II), suggesting an ionic component to the  interaction.
Heteronuclear single quantum coherence  (HSQC) spectra of 15N-labeled Tsg101 UEV were collected during stepwise addition of unlabeled p6, and sites  of 1H15N chemical shift changes were monitored.
The  majority of Tsg101 UEV amide protons (71/130) changed  chemical shift signicantly, suggesting the possibility that  local conformational changes may accompany binding  (normalized chemical shift, d > 0.5; Cheever et al., 2001).
  A nine-residue peptide spanning the p6 PTAP motif  (5PEPTAPPEE13) produced very similar chemical shift  changes as full-length p6 (Figure 3A), and bound with the  same afnity as full-length p6 (Figure 3B).
Thus, we  conclude that this PTAP peptide contains all of the  relevant residues for Tsg101 binding.
Upon addition of  0.5 molar equivalents of either p6 or PTAP peptide, two  distinct peaks were observed for each shifted amide,  indicating that both complexes were in slow exchange on  the NMR time scale (Figure 3A, lower panels).
As  expected, complex formation proceeded to completion  upon addition of a second 0.5 molar equivalent of peptide,  and additional shifts were not observed when supersaturating levels of p6 (>4-fold) were added (not shown).
  Tsg101 UEV residues exhibiting the greatest chemical  shift changes upon PTAP binding (d > 1.8) were clustered  about a groove dened by residues from three different  structural elements: (i) the loop connecting strands 2 and  3; (ii) the N-terminal third of the vestigial active site loop;  and (iii) the C-terminal residues of the domain (Figure 3C  and D).
Several intermolecular NOEs between the peptide  and the protein have been assigned in preliminary studies,  and are consistent with PTAP peptide binding in this  groove (data not shown).
The groove is opened up by a  ve-residue insertion in the active site loop (Figure 1B),  displacement of the loop connecting strands 2 and 3  (Figure 2D), and irregularities in C-terminal helix geometry created by two glycine residues (Gly126 and  Gly136).
Hydrophobic residues from strands 3 and 4  (Ile70, Val89, Pro91) line the bottom of the groove, while  one end is anked by charged residues (Arg64, Arg144).
  This asymmetric charge distribution may help orient the  bound peptide, possibly by interacting with complementary acidic residues that ank the PTAP motif.
We have  shown previously that single alanine point mutations of  both p6 Glu6 and Glu13 (but not Glu12) residues reduce  the overall binding energy (Garrus et al., 2001).
  Mutational analyses were used to conrm that residues  in the binding groove make energetically signicant  interactions in the Tsg101 UEV/p6 complex (Figures 3D  and 4).
Four Tsg101 UEV residues located around the  putative PTAP binding site were mutated to alanine and  tested for their effect on Tsg101 binding afnity in  BIAcore biosensor experiments (Garrus et al., 2001).
As  expected, alanine substitutions in three residues that  surround the rim of the groove (Tyr63, Met95 and  Val141) all reduced p6 binding signicantly (Figure 4  and Table II).

  Tsg101 UEV domain structure  2401located at the bottom of the pocket, had no effect on p6  binding.
Therefore, although the Val89 amide showed the  greatest chemical shift change upon addition of p6 (Figure  3A), the Val89 methyl groups do not contribute appreciable binding energy, perhaps because the PTAP peptide  does not reach down to the very bottom of the pocket.
  Importantly, the Tyr63Ala and Met95Ala mutations,  which decreased p6 binding afnity by 14- and 52-fold,  respectively, also signicantly impaired the ability of  Tsg101 to support HIV-1 budding, whereas the Val89  Ala mutation had no effect on budding (J.Garrus, personal  communication).
The excellent correspondence between  the viral budding phenotypes and in vitro binding activities  of both PTAP and Tsg101 UEV mutants strongly supports  the idea that PTAP-mediated recruitment of Tsg101 to  HIV-1 budding sites at the plasma membrane is a  prerequisite for the efcient release of virus particles  from infected cells.
  Ubiquitin binding  The Tsg101 UEV domain also binds ubiquitin, although  the 1:1 interaction is quite weak (Kd  500 mM) (Garrus  et al., 2001).
The Ub and PTAP binding sites appear to be  distinct, and indeed can be simultaneously occupied as  evidenced by the fact that direct fusion of Ub to p6  enhances the binding afnity over that of either ligand  alone (i.e. the ligands bind cooperatively; Figure 4).
As  compared with p6, titration with Ub produced chemical  shift changes in a distinct, but slightly overlapping subset  of Tsg101 UEV amides, consistent with the idea that  PTAP and Ub bind to different sites (compare Figures 3A  and 5A).
Signicant amide chemical shift changes (d >  1.8) were observed for only 13 residues, suggesting that  Ub does not contact a large surface area or cause large  conformational changes upon binding (Figure 5A).
  Consistent with the weak afnity of Tsg101 UEV for  (unconjugated) ubiquitin, the complex was in fast  exchange.
As shown in Figure 5A, single resonances  were always observed for the perturbed amides and their  chemical shift changes increased as the Ub protein ratio  increased.
Residues undergoing the greatest chemical shift  changes were located throughout the b-tongue and at the  vestigial active site loop, which ank a large hydrophobic  patch on the protein surface formed by side-chains from  strands 3 and 4 (Figure 5B and C).
  The importance of this region for Ub binding was tested  by introducing a series of alanine point mutations and  quantitating their effects on Ub, p6Ub and p6 binding  (Figure 4 and Table II).
Alanine substitutions of b-tongue  residues (Val43, Asn45, Asp46) and a hydrophobic sheet  residue (Phe88) signicantly reduced Tsg101 UEV binding to both p6Ub and Ub alone (>3-fold) without  affecting p6 binding.
Substitution of Trp75, which is  exposed on the hydrophobic surface, did not signicantly  affect the ubiquitin-binding activity of Tsg101 UEV.
This  was unexpected, as the indole N-H of Trp75 is signi-  cantly shifted during Ub titration.
This difference notwithstanding, our mutagenesis and NMR chemical shift  mapping experiments are generally in good agreement and  dene the location of the Tsg101 UEV Ub-binding site.
  The complementary Tsg101 UEV-interacting surface  on ubiquitin was also mapped by chemical shift perturbation experiments.
As expected, titration of unlabeled  Tsg101 UEV into 15N-labeled Ub shifted a small subset of  Ub amides, and the complex was again in fast exchange  (Figure 5D).
The greatest chemical shift changes (d > 1.0)  mapped to the two shortest strands (3 and 4) of the  Fig. 5.

This region contains a number  of polar and charged residues, which may form ionic and/  or hydrogen bonding interactions with Tsg101 UEV  b-tongue residues.
The shifted Ub residues include  Lys48, which is used for the formation of polyubiquitin  chains that target proteins for proteasomal degradation  (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998).
  Discussion  PTAP binding  The structure presented here demonstrates that the  N-terminal UEV domain of human Tsg101 conforms to  the general E2 fold, but with several distinctive features  that allow it to bind PTAP and ubiquitin.
Tsg101 UEV is  the rst example of an E2/UEV domain with a peptide  binding motif, and our work shows that residues from ve  different secondary structural elements come together to  create a PTAP binding `groove'.
Analogous sites in other  E2/UEV proteins are buried, either by a C-terminal helix  (in canonical E2 enzymes) or by the ordered C-terminal  residues of Mms2 UEV (Figure 3B), explaining why these  domains do not have peptide binding activities.
  The importance of the Tsg101/PTAP interaction in the  release of HIV particles seems clear because mutations in  either the p6 PTAP motif (Gottlinger et al., 1991; Huang  et al., 1995) or in Tsg101 UEV (J.Garrus, personal  communication) that inhibit the interaction also block  virus release.
In principle, the Tsg101 UEV domain  represents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention  against HIV and Ebola as these viruses require Tsg101 for  budding (Garrus et al., 2001; Martin-Serrano et al., 2001)  and because the cellular Tsg101 protein presumably would  not develop drug resistance as rapidly as a viral target.
Our  structure therefore provides the rst glimpse of potential  binding sites for small molecule inhibitors designed to  block viral egress by inhibiting Tsg101 binding.
  The role(s) of PTAP binding in normal cellular Tsg101  functions remains an open question.
A number of candidate cellular Tsg101-binding proteins also carry P(S/T)AP  motifs (Strack et al., 2000; Garrus et al., 2001), including  plasma membrane proteins known to be downregulated via  the vacuolar protein sorting pathway (Berthoud et al.,  2000; Strack et al., 2000).
A PSAP motif is also found  in hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase  substrate (Hrs/Hgs, the ortholog of yeast Vps27)  (Garrus et al., 2001), a protein required for tyrosine  kinase receptor downregulation and MVB formation in  Drosophila (Komada and Kitamura, 2001; Lloyd et al.,  2002).
This suggests the intriguing possibility that viral  late domains may act by mimicking the normal protein  recruiting functions of Hrs during vacuolar protein sorting  and multivesicular body formation.
Consistent with this  idea, human Hrs has very recently been shown to be  ubiquitylated (Polo et al., 2002).
Hrs also contains a PPEY  sequence, which is another motif that can function as a late  domain in other enveloped viruses (Vogt, 2000).
  We have also noticed that Tsg101 contains its own  PTAP motif, which is located in a predicted loop region  connecting the apparent binding sites for the Vps37 and  Vps28 proteins (Figure 1A).
We hypothesize that the  Tsg101 UEV domain could fold back and bind to this  PTAP sequence, perhaps creating an `auto-inhibited'  conformation.
Thus, we speculate that regulated PTAP  binding may be important for normal Tsg101 function, and  viruses like HIV and Ebola are simply mimicking this  natural binding interaction.
  Ubiquitin binding  Previous biochemical and modeling studies have suggested that ubiquitin can bind to E2/UEV domains in  two distinct modes.
Remarkably, our data indicate that  ubiquitin binds in yet another, third way to the Tsg101  UEV domain, although the biological relevance of this  interaction remains to be tested.
As illustrated in Figure 6,  both previously known modes of ubiquitin binding are  utilized by the heterodimeric Ubc13/Mms2 complex.
This  complex can assemble polymeric chains of Ub molecules  by binding and catalyzing the linkage of `acceptor' and  `donor' ubiquitin molecules.
The most general mode of Ub  binding is illustrated by the interaction between the donor  ubiquitin and the catalytically active Ubc13 E2 domain.
  As in other E2 enzymes, the active site cysteine of Ubc13  forms a transient thioester bond with the C-terminus of Ub  in the process of transferring Ub from an E1 enzyme onto  the lysine side chain of a protein substrate (Lys63 of  another Ub molecule in this case).
This covalent chemistry  implies that the C-terminal `tail' of Ub must bind near the  active site cysteine residue, and there is direct evidence  that tail residues form the major contacts when Ub binds to  the Ubc1 and Ubc2b E2 enzymes (Miura et al., 1999;  Hamilton et al., 2001).
  Ubiquitin binds in quite a different mode to the  catalytically inactive Mms2 UEV subunit of the Ubc13/  Fig. 6.
Comparison of the ubiquitin binding site (blue residues) on  Tsg101 UEV (yellow) with models for the two distinct ubiquitin binding sites (purple) on the Ubc13/Mms2 heterodimer (gray) (VanDemark  et al., 2001).
To create the gure, Tsg101 UEV was superimposed on  either the Ubc13 E2 (A) or the Mms2 UEV (B) subunits of the Ubc13/  Mms2 heterodimer.
The gure illustrates the fact that the Ub binding  surface on Tsg101 is distinct from previously characterized Ub binding  sites on either E2 or UEV domains, but does roughly correspond to the  Mms2 binding site on Ubc13.
  Tsg101 UEV domain structure  2403Mms2 complex.
The role of Mms2 is to position the  acceptor Ub Lys63 side-chain to attack the C-terminus of  the donor ubiquitin.
Although two different models for the  Mms2/Ub have been proposed (Moraes et al., 2001;  VanDemark et al., 2001), mutagenesis studies are most  consistent with Ub binding in a channel that straddles the  Mms2/Ubc13 interface (Chan and Hill, 2001; VanDemark  et al., 2001), with the Mms2 binding surface dened by the  C-terminal half of helix 1, the outer edge of strand 1, and  the loop that connects strands 1 and 2.
  In contrast, our chemical shift mapping and mutagenesis  experiments indicate that ubiquitin binds to the concave  `lower' half of the four-stranded sheet of Tsg101 UEV.
  The most prominent feature of this binding site is the  b-tongue projection, and mutations of residues at the tip of  the tongue reduce Ub binding.
Although this site is distinct  from both previously characterized Ub binding surfaces in  E2/UEV proteins, it does roughly match the Mms2 binding  site on the Ubc13 protein (Figure 6A).
Ub binds Tsg101  UEV using a convex surface that encompasses strands 3  and 4, and we therefore propose that shape complementarity may play an important role in recognition.
The Lys48  residue at the N-terminal end of Ub strand 4 is likely to be  sequestered at the Tsg101 UEV/Ub interface, which  probably precludes polyubiquitylation via Lys48 linkages  (the targeting signal for proteasomal degradation).
  In summary, the Ub-binding surface of Tsg101 differs  from that used by other E2/UEV proteins, leading to the  surprising conclusion that although E2/UEV domains  utilize a conserved three-dimensional fold to bind  ubiquitin, they have evolved at least three distinct surfaces  to mediate these interactions.
  Materials and methods  Tsg101 UEV domain  Tsg101 UEV domain constructs were designed based on an alignment of  Tsg101 homologs obtained from the NCBI protein database (Arabidopsis  thaliana, BAB03147; Caenorhabditis elegans, AAC25822; Chelonia  mydas, AAF87776; Drosophila melanogaster, AAG29564; Homo  sapiens, AAC52083; Mus musculus, AAH05424; Saccharomyces  cerevisiae, AAB62820).
Since canonical E2 enzymes are ~150 residues  in length, gaps in the alignment near Tsg101 residue 150 were interpreted  as potential domain boundaries.
Based on the alignments, constructs  spanning residues 1145, 1150, 1157 and 1161 of Tsg101 were cloned  and expressed from a pET11d vector (Novagen, Madison, WI).
The three  shortest constructs expressed soluble proteins at high levels in  BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells, but 1161 (and longer constructs)  expressed poorly and were insoluble.
Although we were unable to make  these longer protein constructs, we conclude that Tsg101 residues  151180 are unlikely to form the two helices seen in canonical E2  enzymes because the protein sequence in this region (151PPYQATGPPNTSYMPGMPGGISPYPSGYPP180) is 50% Pro/Gly (15/30)  and has an extremely low helical propensity.
Moreover, this sequence is  poorly conserved in alignments of Tsg101 proteins from multiple species  (Bishop and Woodman, 2001), and cannot be aligned meaningfully with  the C-terminal helices of E2 enzymes (Koonin and Abagyan, 1997;  Ponting et al., 1997).
  To purify the soluble Tsg101 UEV proteins, cells were lysed using  lysozyme and sonication, and insoluble material was removed from the  lysate by centrifugation.
Tsg101 UEV was precipitated from the soluble  fraction with ammonium sulfate at 2855% saturation.
The precipitate  was redissolved in buffer containing 25 mM MOPS pH 6.5 and  fractionated on a methyl sulfonate (SP)-Sepharose column (Pharmacia,  Uppsala, Sweden).
Tsg101 UEV eluted at an ~300 mM NaCl linear salt  gradient (501000 mM NaCl over 400 ml).
Fractions containing Tsg101  were pooled, adjusted to 1 M ammonium sulfate and refractionated on a  phenyl-Sepharose column (Pharmacia).
Pure Tsg101 UEV eluted near the  beginning of a linear salt gradient (10 M ammonium sulfate over  200 ml), with typical yields of 1520 mg pure protein per liter of E.coli  culture.
N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry  analyses showed that the N-terminal methionine was quantitatively  removed during expression, and the masses of all puried proteins were  within 13 Da of those expected (not shown).
The 1H/15N-HSQC spectra  of Tsg1011145, Tsg1011150 and Tsg1011157 were completely superimposable (except for C-terminal residues), and amide protons beyond  Phe142 displayed limited proton chemical shift dispersion and sharp  peaks with half-height linewidths of 1419 Hz (versus 2124 Hz for  structured residues of the domain), indicating that they are disordered.
In  addition, all three UEV constructs bound with same afnities to p6,  p6Ub and Ub (data not shown).
Tsg101 residues 1145 therefore appear  to encompass the entire ordered UEV domain.
Hence, all reported  structural and biochemical analyses were performed on this dened  domain.
Mutant Tsg101 UEV constructs were cloned using the  megaprimer PCR method (Picard et al., 1994), and puried as described  for the wild type.
  Other protein samples  GSTp6 constructs and the free p6 domain of the HIV-1 Gag protein were  puried as described previously (Jenkins et al., 2001).
The PTAP peptide  (NH-PEPTAPPEE-COOH) was obtained by solid-phase synthesis and  puried using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography.
  Bovine ubiquitin, which is identical in sequence to human ubiquitin,  was purchased from Sigma and puried using size exclusion chromatography.
15N-labeled ubiquitin was purchased from VLI Research, Inc.,  (Malvern, PA).
  NMR spectroscopy  Samples for structure determination were ~1.5 mM Tsg101 UEV in  20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl pH 5.5 in 90% H2O/10% D2O.
  Spectra were recorded at 25C on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer  equipped with a triple-resonance 1H/13C/15N probe and z-axis pulsed eld  gradient capability.
Backbone and side-chain assignments were made  using the following NMR experiments: 15N/1H HSQC (Mori et al., 1995),  HNCACB (Wittekind, 1993), HNCO (Kay et al., 1994), 13C/1H  CTHSQC (Santoro and King, 1992; Vuister, 1992), 3D 15N-edited  TOCSYHSQC (Zhang et al., 1994), H(CCO)NH, (H)C(CO)NH  (Grzesiek et al., 1993) and 4D 13C/13C-edited HMQCNOESYHMQC  (Vuister et al., 1993).
The following NOE data were used to generate  distance restraints: 3D 15N-edited NOESYHSQC (Zhang et al., 1994;  Mori et al., 1995) and 3D 13C-edited NOESYHSQC (Muhandiram et al.,  1993; Pascal et al., 1994).
NOESY mixing times were 80 ms.
Three-bond  coupling constants (3JHN-HA) were obtained from a 3D HNHA experiment  (Kuboniwa et al., 1994).
Hydrogen-bonded amides were identied using  deuterium exchange as described previously (Bai et al., 1997).
All spectra  were processed using FELIX (MSI).
  Structure determination  Backbone and side-chain correlations were assigned and NOE intensities  were integrated using the tools in SPARKY (T.D.Goddard and  D.G.Kneller, University of California, San Francisco).
Structures were  calculated using the torsion angle dynamics approach in DYANA  (Guntert et al., 1997).
Initial structures were calculated from ~1500  NOEs.
Iterative rounds of structure calculation and NOE assignments led  to 10 models that superimposed over secondary structure backbone atoms  with an average r.m.s.d. of ~0.5 A .
Hydrogen bonding restraints (two per  hydrogen bond) and phi and psi dihedral angle restraints were then added.
  These restraints did not alter the structure, but improved convergence.
To  generate the reported structures, 200 structures were calculated using  DYANA and geometries of the 20 lowest penalty structures were  regularized using the crystallography and NMR system (CNS) (Brunger  et al., 1998).
The structures were analyzed using PROCHECK-NMR  (Laskowski et al., 1996), MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996) and INSIGHT  II (Molecular Simulations Inc.; www.accelrys.com/life/) (Table I).
  Structure gures were created with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991),  BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997) and GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991).
  Chemical shift perturbation  Titration experiments were performed at 20C in 20 mM sodium  phosphate, 50 mM NaCl pH 6 in 90% H2O/10% D2O.
To identify the  PTAP and Ub binding sites on the UEV domain, unlabeled p6, PTAP  peptide or Ub were titrated into 0.5 mM 15N-labeled UEV domain.
To  identify the UEV binding site on Ub, unlabeled UEV domain was titrated  into 0.2 mM 15N-labeled Ub.
Normalized chemical shift changes were  calculated using the equation: d = 25[(dHN)2  (dN/5)2]0.5 (Cheever et al.,  O.Pornillos et al.  24042001).
Amides displaying the greatest normalized chemical shift changes  were displayed using cutoffs of d >1.8 (for Tsg101 UEV amides) or >1.0  (for Ub amides).
Amide chemical shift assignments for human Ub were  obtained from the VLI Research, Inc. website (www.vli-research.com).
  Binding experiments  Binding afnities of puried wild-type and mutant Tsg101 UEV domains  for immobilized GSTp6127, GSTp6127-Ub and GSTUb were  quantied using a BIAcore biosensor as described previously (Garrus  et al., 2001).
Measurements were performed at 20C in 20 mM sodium  phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% P20  (pH 7.2).
