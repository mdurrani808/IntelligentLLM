Critical Interactions in Binding Antibody NC41 to Influenza N9 Neuraminidase:  Amino Acid Contacts on the Antibody Heavy Chain  Pamela S. Pruett, and Gillian M. Air*,|  Department of Microbiology, UniVersity of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, and Department of  Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UniVersity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73190  ReceiVed January 27, 1998; ReVised Manuscript ReceiVed April 27, 1998  ABSTRACT: Antibody NC41 binds to the subtype N9 neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus A/tern/Australia/  G70c/75 and inhibits its enzyme activity.
To address the molecular mechanisms by which antibodies  interact with neuraminidase and the requirements for successful escape from antibody inhibition, we made  amino acid substitutions in heavy chain CDRs of NC41.
Antibody proteins expressed as a single-chain  Fv (scFv) fused with maltose-binding protein were assayed for binding to NA by ELISA.
Association  constants (Ka) for wild-type and mutant scFvs are as follows: wild type, 2  107 M-1; Asn31 f Gln, 2   107 M-1; Glu96 f Asp, 1  107 M-1; Asp97 f Lys, 6  106 M-1; and Asn98 f Gln, 8  106 M-1.
  The Ka for intact NC41 antibody was 4  108 M-1 in the same assay, reflecting increased stability compared  to that of the scFv.
Mutations in the scFv antibody had less of an effect on binding than mutations in  their partners on the NA, and modeling studies suggest that interactions involving the mutant antibody  side chains occur, even without taking increased flexibility into account.
Asp97 forms a salt link with  NA critical contact Lys434; of the four mutants, D97K shows the largest reduction in binding to NA.
  Mutant N98Q also shows reduced binding, most likely through the loss of interaction with NA residue  Thr401.
Substitution N31Q had no effect on Ka.
NC41 residue Glu96 interacts with NA critical contact  Ser368, yet E96D showed only a 2-fold reduction in binding to NA, apparently because the H bond can  still form.
Asp97 and Asn98 provide the most important interactions, but some binding is maintained  when they are mutated, in contrast to their partners on the NA.
The results are consistent with maturation  of the immune response, when the protein epitope is fixed while variation in the antibody paratope allows  increasing affinity.
Influenza viruses may exploit this general mechanism since single amino acid changes  in the epitope allow the virus to escape from the antibody.
  Although it has been the subject of intense biomedical and  clinical research, influenza continues to have a major health  impact in the United States, as well as in the rest of the world.
  Especially susceptible are the elderly, infants, immunosuppressed patients, and those with other respiratory ailments.
  Pneumonia and influenza are the sixth leading cause of death  in the United States (1).
  Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae  and contain a segmented, negative sense, single-stranded  RNA genome.
The ability of influenza virus to change its  antigenic structure enables it to escape the hosts immune  system.
These changes occur in the two major surface  glycoproteins: (1) hemagglutinin (HA1  ), which binds to sialic  acid receptors, and (2) neuraminidase (NA), which cleaves  sialic acid and facilitates the release and spread of the virus  (2, 3).
Vaccines have not been effective in controlling the  recurring epidemics of influenza because of variation in these  surface antigens.
  One step in understanding the mechanism by which the  influenza virus escapes from antibodies is determination of  the crystal structure of the glycoprotein antigens complexed  with monoclonal antibodies.
This is the only way in which  epitopes can be unambiguously characterized.
Mapping of  antigenic sites by generation of virus escape mutants grown  in the presence of neutralizing antibodies and the determination of amino acid changes give a very incomplete view  of the epitope.
In the epitope on G70c NA recognized by  antibody NC41, the most important contacts on the antigen  were identified by escape mutant analysis (4), but the  complete epitope involves 16 other amino acids (5).
  Considerable effort has been put forth to understand the  mechanism by which antibodies bind specifically to antigen  with high affinity yet great specificity.

  10660 Biochemistry 1998, 37, 10660-10670  S0006-2960(98)00205-0 CCC: $15.00  1998 American Chemical Society  Published on Web 07/09/1998is manifested in the antigen-combining regions, the six  complementarity-determining regions [CDRs (6)], three on  the heavy chain (H1-3) and three on the light chain (L1-  3).
Despite their sequence diversity, five of the six CDRs  assume a limited number of conformations, the canonical  structures (7).
CDR H3 is formed by the D and J genes  brought together during VDJ rearrangement and has little  or no sequence conservation or common structural motifs  and, therefore, has no canonical structures.
In many crystal  structures of protein-Fab complexes, CDR H3 contributes  significantly to binding interactions, and thus, its variability  and flexibility contribute significantly to antibody diversity  (8).
  The properties of the higher-resolution antibody-protein  complex crystal structures are compared in Table 1.
These  complexes involve two to five polypeptide loops in the  protein interacting with four to six antibody CDRs.
All the  epitopes are highly conformation dependent.
Complex  formation involves 12-19 amino acids on each interacting  protein, with 12-20 hydrogen bonds, 0-3 salt links, 75-  111 van der Waals contacts, and 1400-1800 2 of total  buried surface area.
Most antibody-protein structures to  date show lock and key surface and chemical complementarity, exhibiting little change in the conformation of  either component upon binding.
One exception is CDR3 of  the HC19 Fab heavy chain, which moves 10  upon binding  to HA (9).
At a medium resolution of 3.3 , this complex  is similar in character to those shown in Table 1, on the basis  of its total buried surface area of 1250 2 in the interface  and its use of 10 hydrogen bonds.
NC41 has not been  crystallized by itself so it is not known if there are changes  in the bound versus unbound state of the antibody, but no  dramatic changes are seen in the bound versus unbound state  of the neuraminidase (10).
  Escape mutants of G70c NA were generated by growth  of reassortant influenza virus A/NWS/33HA-tern/Australia/  G70c/75NA (NWS-G70c) in the presence of NC41 (11).
  Monoclonal antibody NC41 binds to an epitope on the rim  of the enzyme active site of G70c NA (Figure 1).
Sequence  analysis of 19 independently selected escape mutants showed  that, except for one double mutant, only a single amino acid  was changed and there were only four sites of change,  defining residues 368, 373, 400, and 434 as being important  to the interaction (11, 12).
The NC41 epitope was definitively mapped by X-ray crystal structure determination of  the Fab-NA complex refined to 2.9  resolution (5).
When  the NC41 epitope was examined by site-directed mutagenesis  of the NA, it was found that, of the 19 amino acids in contact  with NC41, only the side chains of Ser368, Asn400, and  Lys434 were critical to the interaction, in that even very  conservative substitutions abrogated binding (4).
  The interface between NC41 and G70c NA has excellent  surface and chemical complementarity.
The NC41 epitope  on G70c NA is comprised of five polypeptide segments on  four loops surrounding the enzyme active site and is  discontinuous, like all other structurally defined epitopes on  native proteins (13).
The chemical complementarity involves  one buried salt bridge and twelve hydrogen bonds, with  additional van der Waals interactions (5, 14).
These interactions involve 19 residues on five polypeptide segments of  G70c NA in contact with 17 residues in five of the six NC41  CDRs.
A ridge in NC41 CDR H3 made of residues Glu96,  Asp97, and Asn98 fits into a groove on the NA formed by  residues 368-373 and 400-403 with NA residue Lys434  making a salt bridge with AspH97.
  To test if critical contacts on the NA are paired with critical  contacts on the antibody, we made the following mutations  in the heavy chain of NC41: Asn f Gln at position 31  (N31Q, interacts with critical contact Asn400), Glu f Asp  at position 96 (E96D, side chain interacts with critical contact  Ser368), Asp f Lys at position 97 (D97K, forms salt link  with critical contact Lys434), and Asn f Gln at position 98  (N98Q, provides two of the twelve hydrogen bonds between  the antibody and NA).
Together, these residues form nine  of the twelve hydrogen bonds of the Fab-NA complex, as  well as the only salt bridge (Figure 2).
The effect of these  mutations on the ability of the antibody to bind G70c NA  was determined by ELISA.
The analysis of the individual  contributions of antibody amino acid residues in the paratope  to the strength of the binding interaction provides insight  into the mechanisms by which antibodies recognize and bind  antigen.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Viruses.

Within a mixed infection, one or more  of these segments can be exchanged between strains and  incorporated into virions, creating a reassortant virus.

  Monoclonal Antibodies.
Hybridoma cell lines for G70c  NA-specific monoclonal antibodies NC41 and NC10 were  generously provided by R. G. Webster.
Hybridomas were  grown in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) with 10% supplemented calf  serum (Hyclone) and then transferred to serum-free medium  (RPMI 1640 with Nutridoma, Boehringer).
Every 2-3 days,  the supernatant was harvested and centrifuged (3000 rpm  for 15 min in a JA-10 rotor) to remove cellular debris and  the antibody purified (16).
The supernatant was dialyzed  against 70% saturated (NH4)2SO4 for 1-2 days with frequent  mixing.
The precipitate was spun down (15 000 rpm for 30  min in a Type 21 rotor), resuspended in a minimum amount  of 0.9% NaCl (saline), and dialyzed against saline.
The  NC41 antibody was then precipitated with 45% saturated  (NH4)2SO4, again ending with saline dialysis.
Alternatively,  hybridoma supernatants were purified over a column of  Protein A-Sepharose and eluted with 0.1 M sodium citrate  at pH 3.9, and fractions were immediately neutralized.
The  purity of the monoclonal antibodies produced was assessed  by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17).

  Purification of NA Heads.
NA is a tetramer comprised  of identical globular domains (head) sitting atop a long  thin stalk which attaches the protein to the viral membrane.
  Because the sialidase activity resides in the tetrameric heads,  enzymatically active NA can be separated from the virus by  proteolytic cleavage within the stalk region.
The procedure  was scaled down from the method of Laver (18).
The NWSG70c virus was treated with Pronase or proteinase K at a  final concentration of 3 mg/mL overnight at room temperature.
Residual virus cores were removed by centrifugation (30 000 rpm for 1 h with a TLS-55 rotor), and the  supernatant was centrifuged at 55 000 rpm (TLS-55 rotor)  for 20 h to pellet the NA heads.
The NA pellet was dissolved  in saline (0.05 mL), and the NA heads were purified by  sucrose density gradient centrifugation (5 to 20% sucrose in  0.15 M NaCl, with a SW55 rotor, at 55 000 rpm at 4 C for  6 h).
Fractions containing NA were pooled and dialyzed  against saline and then against 70% saturated (NH4)2SO4.
  The precipitated NA heads were spun down, dissolved in a  minimum amount of saline, and dialyzed against saline.
  Purified NA was then pelleted as before (55 000 rpm for 20  h with a TLS-55 rotor) and resuspended in 50-100 L of  saline.
Purified NA heads were used in the neuraminidase  inhibition assays and fluorescence quenching experiments.
  Neuraminidase ActiVity and Inhibition Assays.
The enzyme activity of NA was determined with fetuin as the  substrate and the Warren colorimetric assay (19).
Inhibition  of G70c NA activity was determined by preincubation of  50 ng of purified NA with 50 ng of NC41 Ab or 250 ng of  MBP-scFv proteins before addition of the substrate.
  Extraction and Sequencing of RNA.
The sequence of  monoclonal antibody NC41 was determined directly from  mRNA.
Total RNA was extracted from hybridoma cells by  the guanidinium/cesium chloride method (20).
The Sanger  dideoxy method, modified for an RNA template, was used  for sequencing the RNA (21, 22).
The oligonucleotide  primers used were 17-mers, which were annealed to the  beginning of the constant region of mouse antibody heavy  and light chain mRNAs: gamma 5-GGGGCCAGTGGATAGAC-3 and kappa 5-TGGATGGTGGGAAGATG3.  Cloning of Antibody Genes.
The NC41 antibody genes  were cloned into pBluescriptSK+ (pBS) (Stratagene).
cDNA  was generated from total RNA using Invitrogens First Strand  Kit. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using  sequence-specific primers with 5-EcoRI and 3-SalI sites  allowed directional cloning of individual variable genes into  pBS.
The 3-SalI primer also incorporated a termination  codon at the end of each variable gene.
Thirty cycles of  amplification were carried out as follows: 94 C for 1 min,  40 C for 1 min, and 72 C for 2 min.
A final extension  step at 72 C for 8 min completed the amplification.
  Construction of Antibody Single-Chain FV.
The pBS  construct containing the heavy chain variable gene (VH) was  digested with EcoRI and ScaI for linearization, while the  light chain variable gene (VL) was isolated from pBS by  digestion with SalI and ScaI. The two genes were ligated  into the same vector at the ScaI sites and recircularized using  a 57-nucleotide linker (AbL) encoding a 15-amino acid  peptide (Gly4Ser)3, with 5-SalI and 3-EcoRI restriction site  overhangs joining the previously cloned individual genes in  the order VH-AbL-VL.
This linker was generated by  synthesis (Genosys) of two separate nucleotide strands (51-  mers), which were combined in equimolar amounts, annealed  at 65 C for 1 h to form a double-stranded DNA fragment,  and then used for the ligation of both genes and the  subsequent recircularization of the vector.
This forms a  single-chain Fv, referred to as scFv (23).
Once constructed  in pBS, NC41 scFv was subcloned into the bacterial  expression vector pMALp2 (NEB) using BamHI-XhoI to  BamHI-SalI sites.
The sequence was determined using  Sequenase (U.S. Biochemicals) with the dideoxy method  (22).
  Mutagenesis of NC41 scFV.
Stratagenes Chameleon  Double-Stranded Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was used for  the mutagenesis of CDR residues in the VH region of NC41  scFv.
Mutagenic oligonucleotides (negative sense) are  named with the single-letter amino acid code for the original  amino acid, its position, and the residue to which it is  changed.
The bases responsible for the amino acid change  are underlined.
The oligonucleotides used were as follows:  N31Q, 5-CCAGTTCATTCCATATTGTGTGAAGGTATACCC-3; E96D, 5-GACTACCGAAGTTATCATCGCCTCTTGCACAG-3; D97K, 5-GAGACTACCGAAGTTTTTCTCGCCTCTTGCAC-3; and N98Q, 5-GAGAGACTACCGAATTGATCCTCGCCTCTTGC-3. Colonies were screened  by hybridization with radiolabeled mutagenic oligonucleotides and subjected to high-stringency washes to discrimiFIGURE 2: Hydrogen bonds and salt bridge between antibody NC41  and G70c NA that involve the side chains of antibody residues  N31, E96, D97, and N98.

The NC41  scFv mutant D97K was verified by sequencing doublestranded DNA with Sequenase.
An ABI/Prism DNA Sequencer was used to verify mutants N31Q, E96D, and N98Q  using dye-labeled terminators.
  Expression and Purification of the scFV-MBP Protein.
  NC41 scFv was subcloned into the expression vector pMalp2  (NEB) at a site within the structural gene for the maltosebinding protein (MBP), producing a fusion product between  MBP and the scFv, for inducible expression of the protein  in Escherichia coli.
Insertion of a foreign gene disrupts  laczR, allowing blue-white discrimination of plasmid with  insert.
Expression of the protein is from the ptac promoter;  transcription from the promoter is repressed by the Lac  repressor until induction by IPTG.
Expression as an MBP  fusion protein allows detection in Western blots and ELISAs  by anti-MBP antisera (NEB) (24-28).
The MBP-laczR  fusion protein, which results from expression when no  foreign gene has been inserted, was generated as a control.
  Transformed bacteria were grown at room temperature until  A600 was 0.5 and then induced to express protein by addition  of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.3 mM. To harvest the  protein in the periplasmic space, the osmotic shock protocol  from the bacterial expression kit (NEB) was used; the fusion  protein was also recovered from the pellet after sonication  of intact cells.
Protein expression was analyzed by silver  staining and Western blot analysis of 10% Laemmli gels (17).
  Soluble scFv-MBP protein was purified on an amylose resin  affinity column and eluted with 10 mM maltose.
  Fluorescence Quenching Assay.
Fluorescence quenching  of intrinsic tryptophan residues within the NA was used to  measure the interaction of NA with NC41 antibody and Fab  and provided a preliminary measure of the interaction of scFv  proteins with G70c NA.
The NC41 epitope on G70c NA  includes Trp403, which in unbound NA is exposed to solvent  and accessible to excitation by UV irradiation, resulting in  the emission of a photon.
Addition of antibody or scFv  proteins reduces the signal (fluorescence quenching), presumably because Trp403 is now buried in the interface.
  Experiments were conducted with a Shimadzu R5000U  fluorescence spectrophotometer.
Wavelengths were set at  280 nm for excitation and 340 nm for emission.
A constant  amount of NA in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (pH  7.2) was titrated with scFv protein.
After each addition of  scFv protein, the sample was equilibrated in the cuvette  (room temperature for 2 min) while the mixture was  constantly stirred by a magnetic stir bar, before a reading  was taken.
The percent quenching was calculated after  subtracting fluorescence due to antibody alone.
This gave  the concentration of bound antibody which is the same as  the concentration of bound antigen using monomeric molecular weights for each.
We calculated Ka using the  Scatchard equation (29) for each point and averaged these  over the central part of the curve.
  Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
Specific  binding of NC41 scFv proteins to G70c NA was analyzed  by a sandwich ELISA.
The wells of a 96-well microtiter  plate were coated with NWS-G70c virus containing 143 ng  of NA (1:500 dilution, 50 L per well) and incubated  overnight at 4 C.
Following each incubation and subsequent  layer of the ELISA, the wells were washed three times with  borate-buffered saline.
Nonspecific binding was blocked by  incubation with 1% calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline  for 2 h at room temperature (200 L per well).
The fusion  protein or MBP control protein was added in 2-fold serial  dilutions (50 L per well), and the mixture was incubated  at room temperature for 3 h. Maltose (50 mM) was included  in the diluent to reduce nonspecific binding of MBP, the  nature of which is undetermined.
Wells were then incubated  with rabbit anti-MBP antisera (1:2500 dilution, 50 L per  well) for 3 h at room temperature.
Goat anti-rabbit secondary  antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Southern  Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) was added to the wells  using a dilution of 1:5000 (50 L per well), and the mixture  incubated at room temperature for 3 h. ABTS substrate, 2,2-  azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma), was  used (100 L per well) and the absorbance at 414 nm  monitored.
  Modeling.
The structure of NC41 Fab complexed with  G70c NA [PDB file 1NCA (5)] was used as the framework  for modeling the scFv mutants using the program Look  (Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA).
Homology  modeling was performed using the Encad program within  Look, which refines structures with a combination of steepest  descents and conjugate gradient energy minimization methods.
The output from Encad gives the top 10 most strained  interactions (bond lengths, bond angles, torsion angles,   and  torsion angles, and nonbonded interactions) for the  model before, during, and after refinement.
After refinement,  the effects of each mutation on hydrogen bond potential,  atomic mobility, solvent accessibility, and hydrophobicity  were analyzed and compared to those of the wild-type  structure.
  RESULTS  Expression of NC41 scFV.
The nucleotide sequences of  NC41 V regions were determined by direct dideoxy sequencing from the RNA, and some regions were confirmed  by direct peptide sequencing.
Initial experiments for expressing active NC41 or Fab in bacteria or mammalian cells  failed, as often happens with antibodies, since they are  comprised of two (Fab) or four (Ab) polypeptide chains  linked by disulfide bonds.
Therefore, we used the approach  of Winter to generate a clone that expresses Fv in a single  polypeptide with a (Gly4Ser)3 linker (23).
Figure 3 shows  the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for NC41  scFv, constructed in the order VH-linker-VL and inserted  into the plasmid pMalp2.
  The pMalp2 vector provides a signal for directing MBP  fusion products to the periplasmic space.
In initial experiments, we found that the yield of fusion protein released by  osmotic shock was low, presumably due to a folding  problem.
The yield was somewhat improved by reducing  the growth temperature from 37 C to room temperature,  but much of the protein still remained with the cell fraction  after osmotic shock.
There was also a considerable level of  spontaneous lysis of the outer membrane before osmotic  shock.
Therefore, the bacteria were lysed by sonication.
  Much of the MBP-scFv fusion protein was in the fraction  pelleted at 8000g after sonication, but active scFv could be  Ka ) (fraction of Ab bound)/([total sites] - [bound Ab])  10664 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 30, 1998 Pruett and Airrecovered by soaking the pellet in buffer (10 mM Tris, 200  mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) overnight.
  Figure 4A shows a Western blot of this extract probed  with MBP antiserum.
The wild-type and mutant scFv  proteins are expressed at high levels, but give rise to multiple  bands due to premature termination of translation.
After  adsorption and elution from the amylose column, there is  still a background of proteins when the gel is silver stained  (Figure 4B).
Therefore, for the binding assays, the protein  concentrations of the scFv proteins were determined by  densitometric analysis of the full-length MBP-scFv band  on silver-stained Laemmli gels, with bovine serum albumin  as the standard.
Since the MBP is N-terminal to the scFv  in the fusion protein, the prematurely terminated products  will not contribute to the binding.
This method was also  used to determine the concentration of the NC41 antibody  in the ELISAs.
  Binding Experiments.
We used fluorescence quenching  experiments to determine the Ka of the interaction of G70c  NA with the NC41 antibody or its Fab in solution phase  without any disturbance of the equilibrium of the system  (Figure 5).
Titrations of G70c NA with NC41 Ab yielded  a Ka of 1.2  108 M-1  .
Surprisingly, titration with the Fab  gave the same Ka, 1.2  108 M-1  .
The lack of cooperativity  with the bivalent antibody is explained by the crystal  structure of the NA-Fab complex (5).
Due to the circular  FIGURE 3: Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the scFv of NC41.
The antibody CDRs are marked by dashed lines, as is the  (Gly4Ser)3 peptide linker between VH and VL.
Residues in contact with G70c NA are bold, and mutated residues are bold and underlined.
  Incorporation of the 5-EcoRI site during PCR amplification changed VH residues 1 and 2 from Gln-Ile to Glu-Phe compared to the sequence  of NC41 determined from mRNA isolated from the hybridoma line.
Similarly, VL residues 142 and 143 (scFv numbering) have changed  from Asp-Ile to Glu-Phe.
  Antibody Interactions with Influenza Neuraminidase Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 30, 1998 106654-fold symmetry of the NA tetramer and the angle at which  the NC41 binds to each monomer, one Ab molecule is  physically unable to bind bivalently to a single NA tetramer.
  Therefore, for whole Ab, Fab, or scFv, binding can be treated  as one paratope binding one epitope; binding of the second  arm of the Ab to a separate NA molecule is independent of  the first.
  To determine whether the MBP-scFv proteins interacted  with G70c NA, we first used NA inhibition assays.
It was  immediately apparent that the wild-type MBP-scFv bound  poorly compared to Ab or Fab.
Figure 6 shows the results  when 50 ng (1 pmol) of purified NA was preincubated with  either 50 ng of NC41 Ab (0.7 pmol) or 250 ng of the MBPscFv protein (3.7 pmol) before addition of substrate.
To  determine if the poor binding was due to interference by the  MBP domain, we cleaved the fusion protein with factor Xa  and purified the scFv.
Preliminary binding studies indicated  that the released scFv was no more active than the fusion  protein.
The cleavage was slow and inefficient and the yield  of scFv too low to measure binding of the mutant scFvs, so  we used the MBP-scFv fusion proteins for Ka determinations.
An average molecular weight of 68 000 was used for  the scFv-MBP proteins, each containing 1 mol of binding  sites.
The molecular weight of 1 mol of binding sites on  whole immunoglobulin is 75 000 (H and L chain).
The  molecular weight of NA heads is 50 000 per monomer.
  We previously showed that inhibition of enzyme activity  correlates with binding, but this is not necessarily the case;  therefore, we looked to other methods to quantify the effect  of the single-site mutations.
The results of preliminary  fluorescence quenching experiments titrating G70C NA with  MBP-scFv and its mutants are shown in Figure 7.
The scFv  proteins did indeed recognize and bind G70c NA in solution,  but there was also some quenching by MBP-laczR, perhaps  by interaction with carbohydrates on the NA.
When the  MBP-laczR is subtracted, the quenching becomes too low  for reliable Ka calculation.
  These experiments all indicated that the scFv of NC41  binds NA less well than the parent antibody.
This restricted  the methods available for determining Ka; since the wildtype scFv was less efficient than whole antibody in experiments monitoring quenching of tryptophan fluorescence or  enzyme inhibition, the binding-impaired mutant scFvs were  so low in activity their effects could not be reliably  quantitated.
Therefore, we used ELISAs to measure Ka.
  Purified NA is denatured upon binding plastic, so the plates  were coated with the whole virus.

The assays contained the same amount  of NA.
The molar concentration of MBP-scFv was 5 times that  of NC41 Ab, showing that it binds poorly compared to Ab.
  10666 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 30, 1998 Pruett and Airnative NA available after the virus was bound to the plate  was measured in the well by enzyme activity (19) because  binding virus to a solid-phase plate decreases the NA  available for interaction.
Each well was coated with virus  containing 143 ng of NA and left overnight at 4 C, as in  the ELISA, and the enzyme activity was compared to that  of NA assays in culture tubes.
Approximately 42% (60 ng)  of the total NA coated was available for interaction with the  glycoprotein substrate.
This fraction was used as the amount  of NA available for interaction with antibody or scFv; we  have previously shown this to be the case (4).
As with the  preliminary fluorescence quenching experiments, MBPlaczR interacted with NA in the ELISAs, to a lesser degree  than the MBP-scFv proteins, so these values were subtracted  before Kas were calculated.
  Binding curves are shown in Figure 8, which depicts the  binding of wild-type scFv and each mutant scFv as a  percentage of its maximum A414.
The Ka can be estimated  from these binding curves since it is the reciprocal of the  dissociation constant (Kd), which is the antibody concentration at which 50% of the NA is bound.
For a more reliable  determination, we calculated the Ka for each mutant MBPscFv from the binding equation applied to each point of the  binding curve averaged over three determinations.
The  results are shown in Table 2.
The first column lists the Kas  estimated from the binding curves (Figure 8).
The second  column lists the Kas calculated from the binding equation.
  The Ka for NC41 Ab binding to G70c NA is 4  108 M-1  ;  Kas for the scFv proteins were considerably lower, in the  106  -107 M-1 range, as was seen in fluorescence quenching  and NA inhibition assays.
The Ka determined for NC41  binding to G70c NA in an ELISA is close to that determined  in the fluorescence quenching experiments, so although the  ELISA involves washing and other steps where Ab might  dissociate, it apparently does not.
The possibility that the  loss of antibody during ELISA is offset by an increased Ka  in the solid phase remains, so despite the excellent agreement  between the methods, the Kas determined by the ELISA  should be considered relative rather than absolute.
The order  of binding was as follows: NC41 Ab .
wild-type scFv )  N31Q > E96D > N98Q > D97K.  Structural Interpretation of Binding Results.
To understand the structural basis of the binding results, we used the  program Encad (within the Look package) to homology  model each mutation individually from the wild-type structure coordinates 1NCA (5).
The effect of each mutation on  hydrogen bond potential, atomic mobility, solvent accessibility, and hydrophobicity was evaluated by a combination  of steepest descents and conjugate gradient energy minimization methods.
Before minimization, the mutant side chains  did not fit into the wild-type Fab-NA complex structure as  shown by highly strained interactions.
By the time full  refinement is completed, the mutant residues are no longer  within the 10 most strained interactions, indicating that these  mutations can be accommodated within the antibody-antigen  FIGURE 7: Fluorescence quenching of G70c NA by titration with  MBP-scFv fusion proteins or MBP-laczR with no scFv attached.
  FIGURE 8: (A) Binding curves for purified wild-type and mutant  MBP-scFv fusion proteins.
A fixed amount of G70c NA was  reacted with varying amounts of MBP-scFv in an ELISA.
The  data are expressed as a percentage of the maximum absorbance at  414 nm.
The degree of binding is determined by the concentration  at which 50% of the NA is bound.
Each data point is the average  of three determinations.
The errors are not plotted as error bars or  curve fits but are calculated as described in Table 2.

This is consistent with the ELISA results showing  that all mutants bind to some extent.
Table 3 lists atomic  mobilities, hydrophobicities, and solvent accessibilities of  the wild type and each mutant side chain.
The refined  models show very little difference in these properties between  the wild type and mutants, further indicating that the  mutations can be tolerated in the Ab-Ag complex.
  Table 4 lists the hydrogen bond potentials of the scFv  mutants.
N31Q maintains both hydrogen bonds with critical  contact Asn400.
Of its four hydrogen bonds, E96D retains  those to critical contact Ser368 and Ala370, while losing  the bonds to Ile369 and Asn400.
D97K loses both the salt  bridge with critical contact Lys434 and the hydrogen bond  with Ser371, but forms a new hydrogen bond with Ser373.
  N98Q loses its hydrogen bond to Thr401, maintains its  hydrogen bond with Ser373, and forms a new hydrogen bond  with Trp403.
  The reduction in binding of all the antibody mutants was  far less dramatic than the abrogation of binding seen when  NA contact residues were mutated (4).
To understand the  basis of the difference, the critical contact residue mutants  of the NA were modeled and refined using Look in the same  manner that was used for the scFv mutants.
The resulting  hydrogen bonding patterns are shown in Table 5.
S368T  loses its hydrogen bond with Glu96.
N400Q loses both  hydrogen bonds from its side chain to Asn31 and Glu96,  while maintaining its main chain hydrogen bond to Asn31.
  K434D loses its salt link with Asp97.
Thus, the predicted  structural effects of these NA mutations are larger than those  for the antibody mutations, consistent with the experimental  results.
Our results indicate that the NA epitope is highly  defined but can interact with variant antibodies like those  encountered during antibody maturation in vivo.
  DISCUSSION  The purpose of our study was to determine which residues  on the antibody are the most important in the binding  interaction.
Novotny and co-workers (30, 31) first proposed  the concept of energetic epitopes, based on energy calculations using lysozyme-Fab crystal structures.
They hypothesized that a small number of amino acid residues within  the epitope contribute most of the binding energy.
We  previously provided experimental confirmation of this for  the NA antigen by showing that, of 19 contacting amino acids  on G70c NA, only three, centered within the epitope, are  critical to its interaction with antibody NC41 (4).
The results  could be related to biology, since these three amino acid  residues were the only sites of amino acid changes in escape  mutants except for a bulky Ser f Tyr substitution (11, 12).
  Energy calculations for the G70c NA-Fab complex indicated  a centrally located energetic epitope.

  10668 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 30, 1998 Pruett and Airfor the contributions of individual side chains (32) correlated  well with the experimental data (4) in that NA residues with  a G value of less than -1 kcal/mol were also the residues  at which mutation caused a reduction or loss in binding.
  To determine if there were corresponding critical contacts  on the antibody, we made mutations in the four residues that  (a) are partners with NA critical contacts and (b) involve  side chain rather than just main chain interactions.
The residues chosen for mutagenesis were those that have the greatest  potential for comprising critical contacts within the paratope.
  These are Asn31 in CDR H1 and Glu96, Asp97, and Asn98  in CDR H3.
These four residues are responsible for nine of  the twelve hydrogen bonds and the only salt link between  NC41 and G70c NA.
On the basis of the energy calculations,  these residues should contribute most to the binding energy,  with G values ranging from -2 to -5 kcal/mol (32).
Asn  is more frequently found in CDRs than in framework regions  (33), and Asn residues are seen to contribute more to the  interaction between NC41 and G70c NA than any other  residue.
There are four Asn residues on each protein that  make five of the twelve hydrogen bonds; Asn can act as  both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor.
Asn residues  account for 15 contacts out of 104 for G70c NA with a 159  2 buried surface area contributing to the total 899 2 and  for 35 contacts out of 104 for NC41 accounting for 143 2  out of the total of 916 2 of buried surface area (5).
  The G70c NA residues critical to its interaction with NC41  are Ser368, Asn400, and Lys434 (4), which have multiple  contacts with the antibody (5).
We tested these multiple  interactions by making conservative amino acid substitutions  at antibody H chain residues Asn31, Glu96, Asp97, and  Asn98.
The effect of these changes on binding was  measured with an ELISA.
The wild-type scFv bound 1 order  of magnitude less than whole antibody, presumably due to  its increased flexibility (decreased stability) and perhaps  interference from the linking peptide.
Despite this flexibility  and the reduced affinity of the scFv proteins relative to that  of the antibody, the interactions with G70c NA were strong  enough to detect and quantify the differences in binding due  to a single amino acid change.
Modeling studies indicate  that the structural effects of the scFv mutations on the  NC41-NA interaction are significantly less than those of  equivalent mutations on the NA, consistent with the narrow  range of Kas when antibody mutants are assayed compared  to the dramatically lower Kas when the mutations are in the  NA.
  For the following discussion of the interactions between  NC41 and G70c, refer to Figure 2 and Tables 4 and 5.
  Heavy chain CDR1 residue Asn31 makes two hydrogen  bonds with NA critical contact Asn400: one through its main  chain O atom to side chain N2 and the other from its side  chain O1 atom to the main chain N atom (5).
Substitution  of Gln for Asn (N31Q) has no effect on binding; the Kas for  the wild type and N31Q scFv were identical at 2  107 M-1  .
  The ability of N31Q to retain binding at wild-type levels  demonstrates that the critical contacts are from the N2 of  NA residue 400 to the main chain carbonyl Os of Asn31  and/or Glu96 and that the side chain of Asn31 is less  important; i.e., its hydrogen bond to the main chain N either  is dispensable or can still be formed from the shorter side  chain.
Modeling studies indicate that N31Q can form both  hydrogen bonds.
The reciprocal mutation in NA, substitution  of Gln at residue 400 (N400Q), caused a complete loss of  binding with NC41 (4).
Modeling of this mutation shows a  loss of both hydrogen bonds from its side chain N2 to the  Os of Asn31 and Glu96, consistent with the experimental  result of undetectable binding.
  NC41 residue Glu96 makes a hydrogen bond through its  side chain O1 to the side chain O of Ser368 of G70c NA.
  Glu96 forms three other hydrogen bonds with NA: one from  the side chain O1 to the main chain N of Ala370, one from  the side chain O2 to the main chain N of Ile369, and one  from the main chain O to the side chain N1 of Asn400.
  Substitution of Asp for Glu maintains the charge characteristics of the side chain, but the side chain is shorter and  slightly more rigid.
Alteration of the side chain-side chain  interaction with critical contact residue Ser368 could potentially cause a drastic reduction in binding; however, the Ka  for the interaction of E96D with G70c NA showed only a  2-fold reduction compared to that of wild-type scFv.
  Homology modeling indicates that the hydrogen bonds with  Ser368 and Ala370 are maintained, while those with Ile369  and Asn400 are not.
The ability to maintain the hydrogen  bond through its side chain O1 to the O of critical contact  Ser368 allows mutant E96D to maintain binding to G70c  NA.
NC41 residue Asp97 makes one hydrogen bond with  NA through its side chain O1 to the side chain O of Ser371  and one salt link through O1 to the N of Lys434.
  Substitution of Asp by Lys in this context is a drastic,  nonconservative change that substantially increases the length  of the side chain and also reverses the charge from negative  to positive.
This substitution was expected to abolish binding  with G70c NA due to disruption of the salt bridge, and  because a reciprocal substitution in NA abolished the binding  (4).
The Ka for D97K is the lowest of the values for the  four scFv mutants at 6  106 M-1  , but there is still only a  3-4-fold reduction in binding compared to that of wild-type  scFv.
Modeling of D97K shows that the side chain can fit  within the interface, with N able to form a hydrogen bond  with O of Ser373.
Modeling of the reciprocal mutation in  NA (K434D) shows that the shorter side chain points  downward toward NA and away from the interface, unable  to form any type of binding interaction with NC41, again  consistent with previous experimental results (4).
  NC41 H chain residue Asn98 forms two hydrogen bond  interactions with NA.
The main chain N forms a hydrogen  bond with O of Ser373, and the side chain N2 forms a  hydrogen bond with the main chain O of Thr401.
A  comparison of Fab-complexed and uncomplexed NA shows  a shift of 0.5  in the backbone of Thr401, attributed to the  proximity of the side chain of Asn98, which sits between  Thr401 and Trp403 (5).
The substitution from Asn to Gln  maintains the chemical side chain characteristics.
N98Q  showed a 2.5-fold reduction in binding (8  106 M-1  ),  compared to that of wild-type scFv.
Modeling of N98Q  shows a loss of the hydrogen bond to Thr401, with the  formation of a new hydrogen bond to the N of Trp403.
N98Q  maintains binding due to the hydrogen bonds with Ser373  and Trp403.
  A striking feature of our data is the narrow range of Kas  for the wild type and mutants, as seen with an ELISA.
The  scFv is less stable than the whole antibody, resulting in a  20-fold reduction in Ka.
We initially thought that the inherent  flexibility of the scFv allows mutant D97K to form new interAntibody Interactions with Influenza Neuraminidase Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 30, 1998 10669actions with NA and thus maintain a reduced level of binding; however, our modeling studies show that a new hydrogen bond forms even when the model is based on the Fab  structure with no allowance for increased flexibility.
There  is no new hydrogen bond seen when the corresponding mutation in the NA is modeled.
Our binding assay was necessarily different from the immunoprecipitation assays used  for the NA mutants because the scFv has no Fc for binding  protein A, so we cannot directly compare the results with  those of mutating the NA (4); however, the 3-fold reduction  in binding by our antibody mutant K97D measured with an  ELISA is clearly less than the >90% reduction of binding  by NA mutant K434D measured by immunoprecipitation.
  We conclude that the NC41 antibody paratope better  accommodates change than its epitope on the NA.
This  makes biological sense in that the influenza virus uses single  changes in epitopes to escape from antibody neutralization,  while antibody molecules are designed to evolve, with  selection for sequence changes that increase their affinity.
