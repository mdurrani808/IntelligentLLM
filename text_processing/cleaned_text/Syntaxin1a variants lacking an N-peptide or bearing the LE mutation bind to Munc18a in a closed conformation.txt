Members of the Sec1/Munc18 protein family regulate membrane fusion through interactions with the syntaxin  family of SNARE proteins.
The neuronal protein Munc18a interacts  with a closed conformation of the SNARE protein syntaxin1a  (Syx1a) and with an assembled SNARE complex containing Syx1a  in an open conformation.
The N-peptide of Syx1a (amino acids  124) has been implicated in the transition of Munc18a-bound  Syx1a to Munc18a-bound SNARE complex, but the underlying  mechanism is not understood.
Here we report the X-ray crystal  structures of Munc18a bound to Syx1a with and without its native  N-peptide (Syx1aN), along with small-angle X-ray scattering  (SAXS) data for Munc18a bound to Syx1a, Syx1aN, and Syx1a  L165A/E166A (LE), a mutation thought to render Syx1a in a constitutively open conformation.
We show that all three complexes  adopt the same global structure, in which Munc18a binds a closed  conformation of Syx1a.
We also identify a possible structural connection between the Syx1a N-peptide and SNARE domain that  might be important for the transition of closed-to-open Syx1a in  SNARE complex assembly.
Although the role of the N-peptide in  Munc18a-mediated SNARE complex assembly remains unclear, our  results demonstrate that the N-peptide and LE mutation have no  effect on the global conformation of the Munc18aSyx1a complex.
  membrane trafficking | SM proteins | protein crystallography  Neurons communicate across specialized intercellular junctions called synapses.
Arrival of an action potential in a  presynaptic neuron triggers a calcium (Ca2+) influx, which leads  to the exocytosis of presynaptic vesicles and release of neurotransmitters for uptake via receptors in the postsynaptic neuron.
  Soluble N-ethylmaleimidesensitive factor attachment receptor  (SNARE) proteins drive the fusion of neurotransmitter-containing  vesicles to the presynaptic plasma membrane, a critical step in  Ca2+-triggered exocytosis.
Three neuronal SNARE proteins  syntaxin 1a (Syx1a) and synaptosomal-associated protein of 25  kDa (SNAP25), located on the synaptic membrane, and vesicleassociated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2, also called synaptobrevin) combine to form a four-helix bundle, a process that  drives membrane fusion.
Syx1a contains an N-terminal regulatory region in addition to its C-terminal SNARE domain and  adopts two conformations: a closed conformation, in which  a three-helix bundle (designated Habc) in the N-terminal region  binds intramolecularly to the SNARE domain, and an open  conformation in which the SNARE domain binds SNAP25 and  VAMP2 to form the ternary SNARE complex.
  The neuronal Sec1/Munc18a (SM)-like protein Munc18a is  essential for synaptic vesicle fusion and associates with the neuronal SNARE proteins in at least two distinct modes.
Munc18a  interacts tightly with the closed conformation of Syx1a, inhibiting  SNARE complex assembly, as well as with the assembled SNARE  complex containing Syx1a in the open conformation.
Kinetic data  suggest that Munc18a remains bound to Syx1a during the closedto-open transition (1).
The crystal structure of the Munc18aSyx1a  complex has been solved (2), but structural details of the Munc18a  SNARE complex binding mode remain unknown.
Munc18a domain 3a, which is adjacent to the Syx1a SNARE domain in the  Munc18aSyx1a complex, may be involved in formation of the  ternary SNARE complex (3), but the mechanism by which the binary Munc18aSyx1a complex assembles into the SNARE complex remains unclear.
  The highly conserved Syx1a N-peptide (amino acids 124) is  required for the interaction of Munc18a with the SNARE complex  and for stimulation of SNARE-mediated liposome mixing by  Munc18a (47).
Intriguingly, removal of the Syx1a N-peptide  (Syx1aN) facilitates SNARE complex formation in the presence of Munc18a (1).
Understanding the molecular basis of the  effects of the N-peptide has been confounded in part by the use  of N-terminal affinity tags, the presence of which reduces binding  at the Munc18aSyx1a N-peptide interface (13).
  The Syx1a mutant L165A/E166A (LE) also promotes SNARE  assembly in the presence of Munc18a (1, 8).
The LE mutation is  located in the hinge region of Syx1a that connects the N-terminal  three-helix bundle (Habc) and C-terminal SNARE domain.
Affinity  pull-down and NMR experiments indicated that the LE mutation  abrogates binding of Munc18a and disrupts the closed conformation of Syx1a (9).
However, more recent isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data revealed strong Munc18aSyx1a LE binding (1).
  To investigate the closed-to-open transition of Munc18abound Syx1a, we used X-ray crystallography and small-angle  X-ray scattering (SAXS) to study complexes of Munc18a bound  to the soluble cytoplasmic portion of Syx1a with its native  N terminus (Syx1a WT), Syx1a lacking its N-peptide (Syx1aN),  and Syx1a LE.
We found that Munc18a binds the closed conformation of Syx1a in all three complexes.

  Results  Syx1a N-Peptide Does Not Affect the Global Structure of Munc18a  Syx1a.
Based on the observation that Munc18a bound to Syx1a  lacking its N-terminal peptide fails to inhibit SNARE complex  assembly in solution (1), we hypothesized that the loss of Syx1a  N-peptide binding induces a conformational change in the  Munc18aSyx1a complex.
We solved the crystal structure of  Munc18a bound to Syx1a lacking the N-peptide (amino acids 25  266; N).
Moreover, because the N-terminal His6 affinity-tagged  Syx1a used in the original crystal structure of the complex (amino  acids 1267; designated TAG herein) binds more weakly to  Munc18a compared with Syx1a with a native N terminus (1), we  determined the structure of a Syx1aMunc18a complex containing an untagged Syx1a (designated Syx1a WT) (Fig. 1 and  Table 1).
In this crystal structure, a truncated syntaxin (amino  acids 1243) was used to optimize crystallization, because residues 244266 were disordered in the original Munc18aSyx1a  structure.
We found the same overall structure in all three  Munc18aSyx1a complexes, in which Munc18a clasps the closed  conformation of Syx1a (Fig. 1B).
ITC data showed similar binding  affinities in Munc18aSyx1a TAG and Munc18aSyx1aN (Kd =  10.0  0.5 nM and 8.1  1.0 nM, respectively), slightly weaker than  the binding affinity of Munc18aSyx1a WT (amino acids 1262;  Kd = 1.4  0.3 nM) (1).
The small contribution of the N-peptide to  the free energy of this interaction is consistent with the structural  similarities of these complexes.
  Differences in Syx1a WT and Syx1aN Complexes with Munc18a.
  Comparison of the Munc18aSyx1a structures with and without  the Syx1a N-peptide revealed subtle differences in Munc18a.
In  the presence of the Syx1a N-peptide, an ordered -hairpin loop  (amino acids 269274) in Munc18a domain 3a interacted with  the Syx1a SNARE domain (Fig. 2 A and B).
In contrast, in the  Munc18aSyx1aN complex, the electron density was very weak  around the -hairpin loop when compared at the same resolution  and contour level (Fig. 2C), indicating that the Munc18a domain  3a loop is disordered in the absence of Syx1a N-peptide binding  to Munc18a.
The absence of electron density was confirmed by  comparing real space correlation coefficients (RSCCs), which  measure the similarities in electron density maps generated using  experimental data or data calculated from the atomic model, of  the hairpin loop residues in the Munc18aSyx1aN complex  with those of equivalent residues in the other Munc18aSyx1a  complexes.
For the hairpin residues (amino acids 269274), the  average RSCC was 0.78 in the absence of Syx1a N-peptide and  0.92 in the presence of Syx1a N-peptide (Fig. S1).
These observations suggest coupling between a loss of the N-peptide and disordering of the domain 3a hairpin resulting in exposure of the  Syx1a SNARE domain.
  Another difference between the complexes was seen in the  interface between Munc18a domains 1 and 2.
In the presence of  the Syx1a N-peptide, a network of polar interactions that  includes D108 and R171 connected the Syx1a N-peptide and  SNARE domain binding sites (Fig. S2).
In the absence of the  N-peptide, D108 and R171 formed a salt bridge that severed this  linked network (Fig. S2).
We mutated Munc18a R171 as well as  R39, which lies at the end of the network and binds to the Syx1a  SNARE domain (Fig. S3).
Munc18a R39C bound full-length  Syx1a with a sixfold weaker affinity, consistent with previous  work (10), and partially removed the block to SNARE assembly  (Fig. S4 and Table S1).
In contrast, Munc18a R171A did not affect  Syx1a-binding energetics (Fig. S4 and Table S1).

  Native Syx1a and Syx4 N-Peptide Interactions with Munc18a Are  Similar.
The homologous and highly conserved Syx1a and Syx4  N-peptides bind Munc18a indiscriminately (3).
However, comparison of the crystal structures of Munc18a bound to the N-terminally  His6-tagged Syx1a or Syx4 N-peptide indicated that Syx4 N-peptide  forms twice as many hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions with Munc18a compared with Syx1a N-peptide bearing the  His6 affinity tag (3).
The crystal structure of Munc18a bound to  Syx1a with a native N terminus (reported here) allows for a direct  comparison to evaluate the effect of the Syx1a N-terminal affinity  tag on Munc18a binding.
  The structural differences observed between the native Syx1a  N-peptide and either tagged Syx1a or Syx4 N-peptides bound  to Munc18a were subtle (Fig. 3 B and C).
Superposition of the  N-peptides yielded rmsd values of 0.87  for Syx1a WT vs. Syx1a  TAG and 1.2  for Syx1a WT vs. Syx4.
The hydrogen bonding observed in the interaction of the Syx1a N-peptide with Munc18a was  closer to that of the Syx4 peptide bound to Munc18a than to that of  the N-terminally tagged Syx1a bound to Munc18a.
Syx1a with a native N terminus and Syx4 each formed seven potential intermolecular  hydrogen bonds with Munc18a, whereas the tagged Syx1a N-peptide  formed only three hydrogen bonds with Munc18a (Fig. 3 DF).
  These observations support the conclusion that the affinity tag  partially disrupts the interaction between the Syx1a N-peptide and  Munc18a, and provide a structural basis for the similar binding affinities of Munc18a with Syx1a and Syx4 N-peptides (1, 3).
  Syx1a, Syx1aN, and Syx1a LE Bind Munc18a via the Same Mode.
  Binding of closed Syx1a to Munc18a, with or without the N-peptide,  is the favored conformation observed in crystal structures.
However, this does not preclude the possibility that the Syx1a N-peptide  influences the Munc18aSyx1a conformational equilibrium in solution, free of crystal lattice constraints.
Thus, we measured SAXS  data from Munc18aSyx1a complexes in the presence and absence  of Syx1a N-peptide (amino acids 1267 or 25267) to determine  whether removal of the Syx1a N-peptide changes the Munc18a  Syx1a conformation in solution.
Model-independent parameters,  including the radius of gyration, maximum interatomic distance,  and the pair-distance distribution function, demonstrated that the  complexes were very similar in solution (Fig. 4 and Table 2).
  Scattering profiles calculated from the Munc18aSyx1a crystal  structures reported here agree well with the solution scattering  data for Munc18aSyx1a (2 = 1.6) and Munc18aSyx1aN  (2 = 1.5) (Fig. 4A and Table 3).
The crystal structure data were  measured from crystals grown at low pH (5.26.0), which were  subsequently adapted to pH 7.5 in the case of the TAG crystals  (2), whereas the samples used for SAXS were at pH 8.0, ruling  out any effect of pH on conformation.
We conclude that both  Munc18aSyx1a complexes adopt the same conformation.
  The finding that Syx1a N-peptide binding has no effect on the  global conformation of the Munc18aSyx1a complex contradicts  recently published solution scattering data showing that Syx1a  with an intact N terminus forms a complex with Munc18a that  differs considerably from the crystal structure (11).
In both  studies, the scattering experiments were performed using similar  buffer conditions and protein concentrations.
The most notable  differences are the use and placement of protein-affinity tags.
  The previous study used C-terminally His6-tagged Syx1a and  tag-free Munc18a, whereas we used N-terminally His6-tagged  Munc18a and tag-free Syx1a in our SAXS experiments.
To test  whether the tag on Munc18a affected the results, we repeated the  SAXS experiment with tag-free Munc18aSyx1a, and observed no  significant change in the structural parameters (Table S2).
  Given that Munc18aSyx1aN facilitates SNARE complex  assembly (1), we also used SAXS to investigate the structural  parameters of Syx1a (amino acids 1267) L165A/E166A bound to  Munc18a (Munc18aSyx1a LE), a complex that is also compatible with SNARE assembly (1).
The Syx1a LE mutant was initially  characterized by its inability as a GST fusion protein to capture  Munc18a from whole brain lysates (9).
We repeated the GSTSyx1a pull-down experiment with recombinant purified Munc18a  and observed comparable binding of Munc18a by GST-Syx1a WT  and GST-Syx1a LE (Fig. S5).
Published ITC data indicate a tight  interaction between Munc18a and Syx1a LE (Kd = 7.7  0.6 nM)  (1), which we have reproduced here (Fig. S6 and Table S3).
  The results of several previous studies support the idea that the  Syx1a LE mutant favors an open conformation.
NMR data indicate that the LE mutation disrupts intramolecular interactions  between the Habc and SNARE domains of closed Syx1a (9), and  Fig. 2.

  Colbert et al. PNAS | July 30, 2013 | vol.
110 | no. 31 | 12639  BIOPHYSICS AND  COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGYanother study showed that Syx1a LE is more susceptible to proteolysis (12).
Direct structural data for the Munc18aSyx1a LE  complex have been lacking, however, and our data show that the  LE mutant can adopt a closed conformation that tightly binds  Munc18a.
Indeed, the scattering profile calculated from the  Munc18aSyx1a WT crystal structure closely agreed with the  Munc18aSyx1a LE solution scattering data (2 = 1.6) (Fig. 4A  and Table 3).
Moreover, the largest interatomic distance Dmax  and radius of gyration (Rg) values of all three Munc18aSyx1a  complexes were similar (Fig. 4A and Table 2).
The slightly larger  Rg and Dmax values for Munc18aSyx1a LE (Table 2 and Fig. 4 A  and B) might be related to a heterogeneous sample in which  a small fraction was open Syx1a LE, or to a homogeneous sample  with a distinct mode of binding in which the complex was slightly  larger than the Munc18aSyx1a WT complex.
The similar thermodynamic properties for the interaction of Munc18a with WT  Syx1a (Kd = 1.4  0.3 nM, H = 34.6  0.2 kcal/mol) and Syx1a  LE (Kd = 7.7  0.6 nM, H = 34.8  0.2 kcal/mol) (1) favor the  first possibility, although it is possible that the LE mutation had  a subtle structural effect on the Munc18aSyx1a complex.
Note  that although Rg values increased slightly as a function of sample  concentration, suggesting a small degree of aggregation, this  occurred in all three Syx1a variants (Table S4), ruling out aggregation as a source of the difference between LE and the other  complexes.
Taken together, the SAXS data indicate that the  presumed constitutively open Syx1a LE mutation has little to  no effect on the Munc18aSyx1a binding mode.
  Discussion  The role of the Syx1a N-peptide in Munc18a-mediated SNARE  complex assembly remains unclear.
The N-peptide is required  for Munc18a stimulation of SNARE-mediated liposome mixing  and for the interaction of Munc18a with the assembled SNARE  complex (47).
Syx1a knockdown experiments in cultured neurons  have shown that the N-peptide is essential for synaptic vesicle  fusion (13), although another study found that Munc18a bearing  mutations at the Syx1a N-peptide binding interface, which impair  SNARE complex binding, had no effect on synaptic transmission  (14).
Moreover, ITC data indicate that the Syx1a N-peptide contributes only minimally to the binding energetics of the Munc18a  Syx1a complex, and that the interactions of cognate and noncognate  Munc18 and Syx N-peptide pairs are nonspecific (1, 3).
Here we  show that the N-peptide has no effect on the Munc18aclosed Syx1a  binding mode.
We also confirm previous observations that a Syx1a  N-terminal affinity tag compromises Munc18aSyx1a N-peptide  binding (1, 3), and that the native Syx1a and Syx4 N-peptides bind  Munc18a in a similar manner.
  We hypothesized that disruption of Syx1a N-peptide binding  shifts the Munc18aSyx1a conformational equilibrium to favor  a conformation that allows binding to other SNARE proteins.
  Given that the crystal structures of Munc18aSyx1a in the  presence and absence of the N-peptide adopt the same global  structure, we considered the possibility that crystallization favors  a single conformation.
We examined the structural parameters of  Munc18aSyx1a in solution by SAXS, thereby eliminating possible constraints imposed by packing in a crystal lattice, and  found that Munc18a was associated with a closed conformation  of Syx1a, Syx1aN, and Syx1a LE.
The structural data are consistent with previously reported ITC data, which show only small  differences in the thermodynamics for the interactions of  Munc18a with Syx1a, Syx1aN, and Syx1a LE (1).
These data  indicate that removing the Syx1a N-peptide or introducing the  LE mutation has no effect on the global conformation of the  Munc18aSyx1a complex.

  12640 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1303753110 Colbert et al.It is difficult to reconcile the structural data reported in this  work with the finding that Munc18a bound to Syx1aN or Syx1-  aLE does not inhibit SNARE complex assembly.
However, we did  observe that the -hairpin loop in Munc18a domain 3a became  disordered in the absence of the Syx1a N-peptide, possibly exposing residues on the adjacent Syx1a SNARE domain.
Domain  3a is disordered in the crystal structure of the unbound Munc18a  homolog in squid, indicating that it is a conformationally dynamic  region (15).
These observations support the hypothesis that displacement of the Syx1a N-peptide leads to a conformational  change in Munc18a domain 3a that promotes SNARE complex  assembly.
Also of interest is our finding that the unbound squid  Munc18a showed a slight displacement of domain 1 with respect  to domain 2.
An electrostatic network that includes residues R171  and R39 runs through the domain 1domain 2 interface and  connects the N-peptidebinding and SNARE-binding sites of  Munc18a (Fig. S3).
Munc18a R39 directly contacts Syx1a, and the  R39C mutation increases evoked transmission in neurons (16) and  reduces the binding affinity of Munc18a for Syx1a (10).
  We confirmed weaker binding and found reduced inhibition of  SNARE assembly by Munc18a R39C (Fig. S4).
On the other hand,  we found only minimal effects of the R171A mutation (Table S1),  suggesting that this residue might not contribute significantly to the  energy of the interface, or that multiple pathways couple N-peptide binding to changes in the Syx1a-binding interface.
  Other findings suggest allosteric coupling between the Munc18a  N-peptide binding site and domain 3a in the Syx1a closed-toopen transition.
Syx4 N-peptide binding induces an extended  helix in domain 3a of both Munc18a and Munc18c structures  that may facilitate SNARE complex formation (3), because the  extended helix is incompatible with binding to the closed conformation of Syx1a.
However, the Munc18aSyx1a WT crystal  structure is inconsistent with a recent model suggesting that  a fully engaged (i.e., tag-free) Syx1a N-peptide leads to an extended helix in Munc18a domain 3a (amino acids 326359) (3),  given the lack of conformational difference in this region in the  presence or absence of Syx1a N-peptide.
Nonetheless, the subtle  differences seen in our crystal structures are consistent with the  possibility that Munc18a domain 3a plays a role in the Syx1a  closed-to-open transition.
Structural data for Munc18a bound to  an assembled SNARE complex will be essential to our understanding of the role of the Munc18aSyx1a complex in SNAREmediated membrane fusion.
  The structure of Syx1a WT bound to Munc18a indicates that  the LE mutation disrupts several interactions between the two  proteins, consistent with the notion that this mutant favors an  open conformation (2, 9).
However, SAXS data for the Munc18a  Syx1a LE complex show that Syx1a LE can adopt a closed conformation, which is consistent with the modest fivefold lower  affinity of Munc18a for Syx1a LE relative to Syx1a WT (1).
Although the LE mutation does not have a strong effect on the  Munc18aSyx1a binding mode, it may affect Munc18aSNARE  complex binding.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Syx homolog  Unc-64 bearing the LE mutation rescues neurotransmitter release in the absence of Unc-13 (Munc13 homolog) (8).
Munc13  is essential for synaptic vesicle priming, and its MUN domain  accelerates SNARE complex assembly in the presence of Munc18a  (17).
In Syx1a knockout mice, the isoform Syx1b LE shows reduced localization to the plasma membrane and increased synaptic vesicle fusion (18).
It is possible that the LE mutation  stabilizes the Munc18aSNARE complex interaction in vivo,  thus mimicking a likely key role of Munc13 (17).
Another possibility is that the LE mutation alters the relative proportions of  Syx1a associated with its SNARE partners and with Munc18a in  the cell.
Additional studies are needed to tease apart the binding  and conformational dynamics of Syx1a in vivo.
  Our structural data contradict recently published SAXS and  small-angle neutron scattering data showing differences in the  structural dimensions of Munc18aSyx1a with or without the  Syx1a N-peptide (11).
It is possible the Syx1a C-terminal tag  influences the Munc18aSyx1a conformation in an N-peptide  dependent manner, but the mechanism by which this occurs is  not obvious.
NMR data indicate that Syx1a samples a closed  conformation that is stabilized by Munc18a (19).
In agreement  with the NMR results, our X-ray crystal structures and SAXS  data conclusively show that Munc18a binds a closed conformation of Syx1a in solution in both the presence and absence of the  Syx1a N-peptide.
  It is possible that the interaction of Munc18a with the closed  conformation of Syx1a is the most energetically favorable binding mode in the absence of the Syx1a transmembrane domain  and a membrane environment.
Whereas Munc18a inhibits complex formation of soluble SNARE proteins (1), Munc18a facilitates SNARE assembly with Syx1a immobilized through its C  terminus to affinity resin (3) and stimulates lipid mixing of liposomes containing full-length SNARE proteins (47, 20).
Recent  work has demonstrated that Munc18a also reduces lipid mixing of  SNARE-embedded liposomes, in line with its inhibitory effect on  SNARE assembly in solution (7).
The limited degrees of freedom  and topological orientation afforded by membrane anchors likely  play important roles in Munc18a-mediated SNARE assembly;  thus, anchoring Syx1a and/or the presence of a membrane could  influence the Munc18aSyx1a conformational equilibrium, which  may favor a more SNARE-accessible conformation.
Additional  reconstitution and in vivo experiments are needed to elucidate  the interplay of synaptic proteins in the vesicle fusion cycle.
  Methods  Protein Expression and Purification.
All Munc18aSyx1a complexes, with the  exception of Munc18aSyx1a (amino acids 25266; N) used for crystallization,  were coexpressed from the pET-Duet vector (Novagen) as N- or C-terminally  His6-tagged Munc18a and tag-less Syx1a.
Syx1aN was cloned into the  pTWIN1 vector (New England Biolabs) with an intein-mediated self-cleaving  chitin-binding domain (CBD) C-terminal affinity tag, and Munc18a was cloned  into a pQE9 (Qiagen) vector with an N-terminal His6 tag.
  All recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)  RIL+ grown in LB medium at 37 C to an A600 of 0.60.8, induced with 1 mM  isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and then grown for another 4 h  at 2125 C.
Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer [20 mM Na2HPO4/  NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole) with protease inhibitor  mixture set V (Calbiochem) and DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich).
Cells were lysed  using an EmulsiFlex homogenizer (Avestin) at a maximum pressure of 15,000  psi, after which lysates were centrifuged at 39,000  g for 30 min at 4 C to  remove insoluble material.
Clarified lysates were incubated with TALON  metal affinity resin (Clontech), Ni2+-NTA agarose, or chitin-agarose beads  and then washed with lysis buffer.
Proteins were eluted with 200 mM imidazole.
The Syx1aN CBD affinity tag was cleaved with 40 mM DTT at room  temperature overnight, denatured in 8 M urea, and refolded into 20 mM  Tris (pH 8.5), 500 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA.
  To generate a tag-free complex, Munc18aSyx1a was incubated overnight  at 4 C with tobacco etch virus protease in lysis buffer with 10% glycerol to  cleave the N-terminal His6 tag from Munc18a.
All proteins were dialyzed  against 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT for 2 h  at 4 C; loaded on HiTrapQ or MonoQ columns (GE Healthcare); and eluted  with a linear NaCl gradient.
For crystallization, Syx1aN was added at  a slight molar excess to Munc18a, and the complex was purified on a preparative S200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0),  150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT.
  Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing.
Crystals resembling thick  plates were obtained with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method for  Munc18aSyx1aN and the sitting drop vapor diffusion method for Munc18a  Syx1a WT at 25 C, using Munc18aSyx1a concentrations of 145 M and 116  M, respectively.
Well solutions contained 27% PEG 400, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM  Table 3.

  Diffraction data for each complex (Table 1) were measured from a single  crystal at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Advanced Light  Source beamline 8.2.1 for Munc18aSyx1aN and at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource beamline 11-1 for Munc18aSyx1a WT.
For the  Munc18aSyx1aN complex, a total of 60 of data were collected in four  segments, using 17.5- to 20-s exposure times and 0.71.0 rotations per  frame, with a 300-mm crystal-to-detector distance on an ADSC Q315 detector.
For the Munc18aSyx1a WT complex, a total of 89 of data were  collected in three segments, using a 15-s exposure time and 1.2 oscillations  per frame, with a 450-mm crystal-to-detector distance on a Rayonix 325  detector.
Diffraction data were processed and scaled using Mosflm and Scala  (21, 22).
There was one Munc18aSyx1aN or Munc18aSyx1a WT complex  per asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 47% or 51%, respectively.
  Phasing, Model Building, and Refinement.
Phases for the Munc18aSyx1aN  structure were obtained by molecular replacement with Phaser (23), using  the rerefined Munc18aSyx1a structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code  3C98].
The z-scores for the rotation and translation functions were 27.4 and  73.5, respectively.
Rigid-body refinement in Phenix (24) using data to 3.2   gave R and Rfree values of 36.8% and 36.5%, respectively.
For the Munc18a  Syx1a WT structure, rigid-body refinement in Phenix using data from 3.2   yielded R and Rfree values of 42.8% and 42.5%, respectively.
The models for  each complex were built in Coot (25), and refinement was performed using  Phenix (24) and BUSTER (26).
For test sets, 6% of the reflections for the  Munc18aSyx1aN complex and 8% of the reflections for the Munc18a  Syx1a WT complex were removed before refinement.
Bulk solvent and anisotropic temperature factor corrections were applied throughout the refinement.
Final refinement statistics are presented in Table 1.
Figures were  generated using PyMOL version 1.3r1 (Schrodinger).
  Structure Calculations (Hydrogen Bonds, rmsd and RSCC Values).
Because the  Munc18aSyx1a WT and TAG structures were solved at different resolutions  (3.2  and 2.6 , respectively), the TAG structure was re-refined with a resolution cutoff of 3.2 , and the Munc18aSyx1a N-peptide interface was  compared.
At a 3.2- cutoff for assigning hydrogen bonds, two of the  original three intermolecular hydrogen bonds between tagged Syx1a and  Munc18a were observed, confirming reduced hydrogen bonding in the  presence of the affinity tag.
H-bond geometry was confirmed using the  DIMPLOT program in LIGPLOT (27).
Syx1a and Syx4 N-peptides (amino acids  29) were aligned in PyMOL to calculate rmsd values for all matched atoms.
  Given the limited reliability of temperature factors refined at this resolution,  RSCC values calculated in Phenix (28) (model vs. data tool with high resolution; 3.2 ) were used to quantify differences in electron density.
  SAXS.
SAXS data were measured at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation  Lightsource beamline 4-2 in the range of 0.00680 -1  q  0.534 -1, where  q = 4sin()/, from solutions of Munc18a bound to Syx1a with (amino acids  1267) and without (amino acids 25267) its N-peptide, or to Syx1a LE  (amino acids 1267), at concentrations of 0.56 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris (pH  8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 2% glycerol.
Monodispersity  of the protein samples was confirmed by dynamic light scattering using  a DynaPro molecular sizing instrument and Dynamics V6 software (Protein  Solutions), and concentrations were determined by A280 measurements using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and molar extinction  coefficients calculated in ProtParam (29).
All samples and buffers were  passed through 0.2-m spin filters (Corning) before being loaded into a 1.5-  mm quartz capillary flow cell maintained at 20 C, and 10  1 s exposures  were measured for each concentration.
Raw scattering data were normalized to the incident beam intensity and corrected for buffer scattering.
  Scattering curves corresponding to sample concentrations of 1 mg/mL and  4 mg/mL were scaled and merged.
X-ray scattering profiles from the crystal  structures reported herein were calculated and fit to solution scattering  curves using CRYSOL (30) (Table 2).
The pair distance distribution function,  P(r), was calculated from the scattering curves using the indirect Fourier  transform method in GNOM (31) (Table 3).
